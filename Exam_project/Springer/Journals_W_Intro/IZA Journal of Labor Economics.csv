1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,20 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-1-7,Persistent inter‐industry wage differences: rent sharing and opportunity costs,December 2012,John M Abowd,Francis Kramarz,Sébastien Roux,Male,Male,Male,Male,"One of the most pervasive and difficult to explain phenomena in economics is the persistence of inter‐industry wage differences for measurably similar workers. Some explanations predict that most of the variation is due to the persons employed in the industry, whose opportunity wage rates are similarly high or low. Other explanations predict that most of the variation is due to differential firm or industry compensation policies that do not follow the individual from job to job. Economists’ ability to distinguish among these explanations has been hampered by the lack of appropriate matched, longitudinal employer‐employee data. The arrival of such data has produced a resurgence of interest in some classic problems of labor economics for which both sides of the market–workers and firms–matter (see the survey on matched data sources and some early results in Abowd and Kramarz (1999a) or the international results contained in Haltiwanger et al. (1999)). Modeling techniques derived from those used in statistical genetics have been developed to address the econometric challenges (see Abowd and Kramarz (1999b), Abowd et al. (2002a), and the survey in Abowd et al. (2008)). On the theoretical side, Mortensen (2003) and Postel‐Vinay and Robin (2002) developed their search‐based models to address the possibilities that linked data provide. Shimer (2005) developed an assignment model and Cahuc et al. (2006) developed a search friction model with bargaining that were partly inspired by some of the results contained in this literature in particular Abowd et al. (1999b) (AKM, hereafter). In this paper, we take stock of these developments to reexamine the classic question of inter‐industry wage differentials using longitudinal linked employer‐employee data for the United States and France. Although this topic received a flurry of attention in the 1980s, Krueger and Summers (1987) and Krueger and Summers (1988) established the consistency of these differentials over time and across countries, the fundamental question remained unresolved: are these differentials due to individual or employer components? Individual factors stay with the worker from job to job, whereas employer differences affect any worker who has a job with the firm. Because these two parts are directly interpretable in terms of economic models, it is important to apportion the inter‐industry differentials into these person and employer parts. This can only be done using longitudinal linked employer‐employee data (see AKM). Krueger and Summers stressed factors related to the employer, such as compensation policy, as the primary explanation of the inter‐industry differentials although their analysis showed that such factors were, at best, an incomplete explanation. Murphy and Topel (1987), on the other hand, stressed individual unmeasured differences as the primary cause of the wage differentials, although, once again, their data were incomplete. Dickens and Katz (1987) tried to explain the inter‐industry wage differentials using a variety of measured individual and firm characteristics aggregated to the industry level; hence, their analysis was very much in the spirit we propose but they could not control for the unmeasured differences that we stress below. Gibbons and Katz (1992) attempted to explain the differential based on unobserved individual heterogeneity. Brown and Medoff (1989) focused their attention on the firm‐size wage differential. They attempted to distinguish between explanations based on individual heterogeneity and those based on firm level compensation policy. In related work Groshen (1991) examined the role of firm and establishment compensation policy heterogeneity on wage outcomes, generally. What distinguishes this paper from the earlier work is our ability to simultaneously control for unobservable individual and employer heterogeneity, which none of the papers cited in the previous paragraph could do, under statistical assumptions that are exactly comparable to the ones that underlie those papers. In particular, neither Krueger and Summers nor Murphy and Topel could not apportion the respective contributions of unmeasured individual and employer differences. None of their data sources had sufficiently large micro‐data samples to permit analysis at the level of detail and precision that we report here. In two related articles AKM and Abowd et al. (1999a) (AFK, hereafter) provided a basic statistical framework for decomposing inter‐industry wage differentials and firm‐size wage differentials into the sum of components due to individual heterogeneity (measured and unmeasured) and firm heterogeneity (measured and unmeasured). The first of these articles, AKM analyzes French data and finds that most of the inter‐industry and the firm‐size wage differentials are due to unmeasured individual heterogeneity. Goux and Maurin (1999) also find that most of the French inter‐industry wage differential is due to individual heterogeneity using linked employer‐employee data from the French Labor Force Survey (Enquê te Emploi). The second of these articles, AFK, analyzes data from the State of Washington and finds that inter‐industry wage differentials are due in equal proportions to individual and employer heterogeneity while firm‐size wage differentials are due primarily to firm heterogeneity. Both AKM and AFK used statistical approximations to estimate the decomposition of wage differentials into individual and employer components. Furthermore, these papers did not try to understand the origin of these differentials. In this article we apply exact methods from Abowd et al. (2002a) to the estimation problem and comparable data sources for both countries, some of them part of the recent effort of the U.S. Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer‐Household Dynamics Program’s infrastructure file system (Abowd et al. (2009)). A model of bargaining power also allows us to present economic interpretations of our results. The paper is organized as follows. In section 5 we present a simple economic model that we use to interpret our estimates. Then, in section 5, we briefly discuss our estimation methods as well as the framework necessary to understand the estimated person and firm components of the inter‐industry wage differentials and relate them to the literature. Section 5 presents the American and French data sources and labor market institutions. Section 5 discusses the inter‐industry wage differential results. In particular, and in contrast to the previous literature, we try to directly measure economic variables correlated with these differentials. Section 5 concludes1.",16

Is there any common link among all these different forces? As illustrated in the seminal work byChiappori (1992), the family has considerable influence on the behavior of its members, and in particular on their labor supply choices. The wife’s decision power, which depends on her characteristics and wellbeing outside marriage relative to her spouse’s (relative age, wage, education, non-labor income, divorce laws, etc.), will affect both her own and her husband’s allocation of hours of work. Although many studies have analyzed the role of spouses’ differences along several dimensions, the literature has remained silent on the role of differences in physical attractiveness1. This is somewhat surprising, since relative attractiveness seems to be a relevant determinant of the bargaining power of each spouse, and existing works directly link physical attractiveness measures (e.g., photo ratings, body mass index) to several economic outcomes, such as individual employment status, earnings, and even criminal activity (e.g., Hamermesh and Biddle 1994; Mocan and Tekin 2010; Rooth 2009). In this paper, we explore the relationship of relative physical attractiveness within the household and the hours worked by married men and women, proxied by their relative body mass index (BMI, weight-for-height). By establishing a link between body weight and Pareto weight in the household, our work is consistent with the long tradition in labor supply research that emphasizes the family context in which work decisions are made (e.g., Blau and Kahn 2007; Blundell and MaCurdy 1999; Chiappori et al. 2002). While own weight (BMI) has already been linked to labor supply (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2007; Loh 2009), evidence from psychology explicitly points to fatness being stigmatized by spouses, and that social pressures for slimness affect marital interaction (Sobal 1995). In particular, it is the relative attractiveness within the couple which is thought to affect household behavior. McNulty and Neff (2008) actually claim that how the discrepancy in spouses’ attractiveness affects household outcomes and satisfaction is still an open question. We use a standard collective labor supply model (Chiappori et al. 2002) in which relative physical attractiveness may influence the decision power of each spouse. It is known that spouses’ relative characteristics and opportunities outside marriage shape their respective intrahousehold bargaining power and share of household resources (e.g., Browning et al. 2012). Following Gregory and Ruhm (2011), Mansour and McKinnish (2011), Chiappori et al. (2012), among others, we consider BMI as a proxy for physical attractiveness. Viewing relative physical attractiveness through the lens of a collective labor supply framework allows us to investigate its relationship with hours of work of both married men and women. In such a context, relatively high body weight transforms into low Pareto weight in the household, inducing individuals to compensate for their negative physical trait by working more hours, while their spouses work less. Discrepancies in physical appearance lead to a better position inside the household for the better-looking spouse, in terms of intrahousehold allocation of resources, and thus of hours worked by husbands and wives. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) on married heads and their wives from 1999 to 2007, we show how relative attractiveness proxied by wife’s BMI relative to husband’s BMI matters in explaining their annual hours of work. We find that husbands who are thinner relative to their wives work fewer hours, while wives who are heavier relative to their husbands work more hours. Acknowledging that individuals working more hours may work in sedentary jobs (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2007; Loh 2009) or consume more highly-caloric food to economize on the scarcity of their time (Chou et al. 2004), we present estimates controlling for sedentary job-type and the ratio of expenditures of food at home versus total food. We also account for spousal characteristics and conventional distribution factors, and obtain virtually identical results. To uncover the bargaining power channel from the role of unobserved heterogeneity, one may think of linking changes in relative body weight to changes in hours of work. Unfortunately, (relative) body weight has weak time series variation in a short time span. In addition, this variation is likely to reflect noise (e.g., measurement error due to self-reporting). These two issues make first-differenced and within-OLS estimators unreliable (e.g., Deaton 1995), and even undesirable (e.g., Choi 2012). Although we cannot ultimately conclude that high body weight causes lower Pareto weight, we can offer indirect evidence on this underlying relationship. First, we cannot reject the collective model restriction of proportionality between the labor supply responses to the spouses’ relative BMI and the ratio of means and standard deviations of these BMIs in the population. Second, we compare the spouses’ labor supply responses to own BMI to those of unmarried individuals, to distinguish within-family mechanisms from alternative ones. Although own BMI is positively related to hours of work for both married men and married women, no statistically significant relationship emerges for either unmarried men or unmarried women. Finally, marital sorting along a dimension potentially correlated with future labor supply (we focus on couples who have been married for at least 4 years) does not appear to interfere with our results and their interpretation, since this matching would predict a negative correlation between hours of work and own BMI, while we find positive correlations for both men and women. Our analysis is also related to the literature on the marriage market penalties of low physical attractiveness. Heavier (or obese) men and women are found to be penalized in the marriage market by matching with partners who are weaker along socioeconomic dimensions, i.e., educational attainment and wages (Averett and Korenman 1996; Hamermesh and Biddle 1994; Oreffice and Quintana-Domeque 2010). While negative effects of own BMI on both labor- and marriage-market outcomes have been well-documented (e.g., Averett et al. 2008; Cawley 2004; Garcia and Quintana-Domeque 2007), our evidence indicates that the relative BMI within the couple reinforces these penalties through the household decision process. Relatively heavier married individuals work more hours to compensate their spouses for their defect, regardless of gender. More generally, this study contributes to the understanding of labor supply of married men and women. The estimated sizeable correlations of relative BMI and spouses hours of work, and with opposite signs, are all the more remarkable given the acknowledged rigidities in hours worked. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the empirical results and discusses potential alternative explanations. Section 5 concludes.",18
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,09 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-1-5,What happens after enrollment? An analysis of the time path of racial differences in GPA and major choice,December 2012,Peter Arcidiacono,Esteban M Aucejo,Ken Spenner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Scholars have known since the Coleman Report in 1966 that the black white educational achievement gap is a robust empirical regularity. Since then, a prolific literature in economics has emerged trying to describe the evolution, causes and consequences of the racial test scores gap in primary and secondary schools. The main findings indicate that African American children enter kindergarten lagging behind their white counterparts, and these differences are likely to persist for the foreseeable future (Neal [2006]). Cunha et al. ([2006]) argue that schooling raises measured ability, but does not close gaps between children from different racial and economic strata, and if anything widens them. Fryer and Levitt ([2006]), using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study database, find that by the end of first grade, black children lost the equivalent of almost three months of schooling relative to whites. These trends continue through middle school with both Phillips and Chin ([2004]) and Hanushek and Rivkin ([2006, 2009]) documenting increases in the math achievement gap between blacks and whites through the eighth grade. The divergence in black/white outcomes at early ages is not surprising given disparities in resources between black and white families. It could also be the case that disparities may continue to grow in college due to differences in parental resources, support, and information that also matter for performing well in college. However, the college environment is substantially different in that students are more separated from their families. Hence, it is also possible to expect, by taking students whose academic background is weak due to lack of resources but whose academic potential is strong, that these students perform poorly at first as they acquire the needed skills to succeed and then, with time, catch up. By way of illustration, consider the case of Ph.D. economics programs in the United States. International students, who often have Master's degrees upon entry, typically come in better prepared than their American counterparts, with American students gradually catching up over time. With affirmative action promoting access to those who are otherwise less prepared, it is possible that the beneficiaries of affirmative action may also catch up, at least partially, over the course of their college career. In this paper, we examine the evolution of racial disparities in college, focusing in particular on students at Duke University. While researchers have documented lower grades for black students in college (see, for example, Betts and Morell [1999]), this is to be expected given differences in college preparation. Here, we are interested in the time path of racial differences. Clearly using data from one highly-selective school may lead to questions about how the results carry over to other environments. Weighed against this, however, is the ability to use within-school variation, ensuring that our results our not driven by grading patterns being different across the different types of schools blacks and whites attend. An initial glance at data from consecutive cohorts of students who first enrolled in 2001 and 2002 suggests that black students actually show substantial catch up. Namely, for Duke students who completed collegea, Figure 1 shows that differences in grades between black and white students during their first semester were almost half a grade. However, this disparity was reduced by almost fifty percent by the last semester of college. Evolution of students noncumulative semester GPA open by race at Duke University. Source: CLL. There are, however, at least two reasons to be skeptical of Figure 1: variance and course selection. With regard to variance, instructors use much less of the grade distribution in upper year coursesb. Indeed, the standard deviation of grades for second-semester seniors is 86% percent of the standard deviation of grades for first-semester freshmen. For convergence to occur, it is therefore important to examine differences in class rank over time rather than GPA levels. The second concern is course selection. Grading standards differ wildly across majors at Duke (see Johnson [1997, 2003]), with similar differences seen across many universities (see Sabot and Wakeman-Linn [1991], Grove and Wasserman [2004], Bar and Zussman [2012] and Koedel [2011]).c In particular, natural science, engineering, and economics classes have average grades that are 8% lower than the average grades in humanities and social science classes. Note that these averages do not take into account selection into courses: average SAT scores of natural science, engineering, and economic majors are over 50 points higher than their humanities and social science counterparts. Although blacks and whites initially have similar interests regarding whether to major in the more strictly graded fields, the patterns of switching result in 68% of blacks choosing humanities and social science majors compared to less than 55% of whitesd. We show that accounting for these two issues can explain virtually all the convergence of black white grades. Accounting for shrinking grade variances and course selection also explains the convergence in grades for a group where we would expect catch up to not occur: legacies. Legacies at Duke start out behind their white non-legacy counterparts (though not as far back as blacks) with 65% of the gape removed by the end of the senior year. Similar major-switching patterns occur for legacies as well, with large shifts away from the natural sciences, engineering, and economics towards humanities and social sciences. The different grading standards across courses legacies and blacks take, coupled with the tighter variances on the grade distributions of upper year courses, accounts for their catch up to their white non-legacy counterparts. The convergence of black/white grades is then a symptom of the lack of representation among blacks in the natural sciences, engineering, and economics. Over 54% of black men who express an initial interest in majoring in the natural sciences, engineering, or economics switch to the humanities or social sciences compared to less than 8% of white men. While the similar numbers for females are less dramatic across races, they are nonetheless large: 33% of white women switch out of the natural sciences, engineering, and economics with 51% of black women switching. These cross-race differences in switching patterns can be fully explained by differences in academic background. We show that natural science, engineering, and economics courses are more difficult, associated with higher study times, and are more harshly graded than their humanities and social science counterparts. These trends are particularly true for students with weaker academic backgrounds resulting in those with relatively weaker academic backgrounds being much less likely to persist in natural science, engineering, and economics majors.f",54

1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,09 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-1-3,Personality and marital surplus,December 2012,Shelly Lundberg,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The formation and dissolution of marital and cohabiting relationships have important implications for individual wellbeing and for society. Stable partnerships are associated with higher incomes, improved health and happiness, and positive child outcomes. Economic models of marriage and divorce postulate that decisions to begin and end a domestic partnership are driven by the expected and realized surplus to marriage, compared with single life.1 These positive returns to marriage include the extra resources generated by specialization and exchange in multi-person households and the consumption benefits of household public goods. The declining prevalence and stability of marriage in wealthy industrialized societies have been explained as consequences of reduced returns to marriage as women’s market work increases and production complementarities within the household become less important ([Lundberg and Pollak, 2007]; [Stevenson and Wolfers, 2007]). This suggests that the gains individuals receive from marriage and cohabitation has become increasingly consumption-based, but the evidence for this is largely indirect and based on the observed decrease in specialization within marriage. In this paper, I provide additional evidence that the sources of marital surplus have changed among German couples since the 1970s. Using individual personality traits as indicators of heterogeneous preferences and capabilities that influence marital surplus, I show that production complementarities imply a different sorting of men and women into marriage than do consumption complementarities. The empirical relationships between personality and relationship formation and dissolution for post-war cohorts of a large representative sample of German men and women indicate that the determinants of marital surplus changed substantially between men and women born in the years immediately after World War II and younger cohorts born in the 1960s. These changes were consistent with a shift to consumption-intensive marriages despite very modest changes in women’s market work across these cohorts. Returns to marriage and cohabitation that are due to production complementarities are enhanced by the mating of individuals with different capabilities who can benefit from specialization in different activities and exchange within the household (Becker, [1981]). Consumption complementarities, such as those due to joint public goods consumption, are of greatest benefit if individuals with similar preferences for consumption and leisure are matched ([Lam, 1988]). As noted by [Borghans et al. (2008]), personality traits seem, intuitively, to be related both to preferences (conscientious people place a high value on order, and extraverts prefer social interaction to solitude) and to capabilities (conscientious people are self-disciplined at school; introverts perform poorly in sales jobs). If personality traits are predictive of individual contributions to marital surplus, either through market/domestic productivities or tastes for household public goods, then they should also predict individual selection into and out of marriage. Thus, the empirical relationship between personality traits and demographic outcomes should be informative, both about the relative significance of consumption-based and production-based gains to marriage and about the economic interpretation of personality. We know that economic factors such as educational attainment and market wages are predictive of age at marriage and the probability of divorce, but much of the individual variation in marital histories remains unexplained. Economists have begun explore the role of psychological traits, including personality, motivational factors, and preferences, as determinants of labor market outcomes,2 but the impact of psychological variables on social and demographic behaviors remains largely unstudied in economics. Psychologists and sociologists have examined the relationship between personality and family outcomes such as fertility and marital satisfaction, but most of these analyses are based on relatively small samples. The recent availability of psychological variables in large representative surveys such as the German Socio-economic Panel Study and the British Household Panel Study present new opportunities for economists and other social scientists to study their association with a wide range of lifetime experiences, and to reconsider how we model the formation and stability of families and the living arrangements of children. This paper uses data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (SOEP), which contains an array of psychological and preference indicators (most gathered in recent waves of the survey), and relates these to lifecycle demographic outcomes for cohorts up to age 59 in 2005. Personality traits are treated as indicators of preferences and capabilities that shape the returns to marriage and the ability of partners to solve problems and make long-term commitments. A caveat to the interpretation of the empirical results is that, although personality has been found to be extremely stable over the adult lifespan, we cannot rule out the possibility that measured traits have been influenced by marital histories. For the full sample, I find evidence both of common factors in the sorting of men and women into marriage and divorce (openness to experience and conscientiousness), and of distinct gender differences in the effects of other traits (agreeableness increases the probability of marriage for women and decreases marriage for men, while extroversion and neuroticism are significant only for women). For the older cohorts, the results suggest that contributions to marital surplus were to some extent gender-specialized, with men providing material and women emotional contributions to their joint domestic enterprise. For younger cohorts, openness and conscientiousness are important determinants of transitions into and out of marriage, and their effects on the marriage probabilities of men and women are not significantly different. In general, individual personality traits are important indicators of marital surplus, and the cohort results are consistent with a shift in the sources of marital surplus from specialized domestic production for post-war birth cohorts of men and women to joint consumption for younger cohorts born in the 1960s. Propensities to divorce appear to be related both to low marital surplus and to low emotional stability (which may inhibit marital negotiation) and to the availability of alternatives. Since 1950, patterns of family formation and dissolution have undergone a transformation known as the second demographic transition ([Lesthaege, 2010]) in most wealthy market economies. Marriage and childbearing have been delayed, cohabitation rather than formal marriage is increasingly prevalent, and partnerships are less stable. Since union formation and dissolution are strongly linked to the lifetime wellbeing of men, women, and children, understanding the determinants of an individual’s family status has become more salient for policy as variability in family histories, both across individuals and socioeconomic groups, has increased. Economists consider marriage (and domestic partnership in general) to be the outcome of choices by individuals who expect to enjoy private gains from the establishment of a joint household. Since men and women decide to marry on the basis of a comparison of their expected utility in two states—married and single—the decision depends both on the magnitude of the expected marital surplus and on the partners’ ability to make a credible commitment regarding the division of the surplus.3 The gains from marriage arise from both joint production and joint consumption in the household, and have several distinct sources. Production-based gains come from economies of scale in domestic production and from the returns to specialization and exchange within the household; consumption benefits arise from risk pooling, the joint consumption of household public goods (including children), and the direct utility of time spent together. A focus on production complementarities and specialization within the household leads to the standard prediction that there should be negative assortative mating based on market wages ([Becker, 1981]): the hard-driving careerist marries the happy homemaker. The gains to matching individuals with complementary skills should also apply to other individual capabilities relevant to household production—there will be potential gains to the marriage of an accomplished cook to a keen gardener. However, as women’s labor force participation has increased and the relative significance of household (rather than market) production has declined, complementarities in consumption have become more important sources of the gains to marriage ([Stevenson and Wolfers, 2007]). This implies that positive assortative mating on traits related to preferences for household consumption—a shared interest in children, modern art, or loud parties, for example—should have become increasingly important ([Lam, 1988]). [Isen and Stevenson (2010)] document the changes in American women’s family behavior since 1950 and note that the observed increase in assortative mating by education, which should be correlated with preferences for time use and consumption as well as the price of market time, is consistent with increasingly consumption-based marriage. Analyses of selection into and out of marriage and of assortative mating have focused on individual characteristics that are readily available on large samples, such as education, race and ethnicity, and family background ([Schwartz and Mare, 2005]; [Furtado and Theodoropoulos, 2011]; [Chiswick and Houseworth, 2011]). New data on personality, which is both a relatively stable set of individual traits and is strongly predictive of behavior and of economic and social outcomes, provide new opportunities to examine the determinants of marital surplus. Personality inventories are intended to be descriptive of stable differences in individual dispositions. There are many alternative taxonomies, but the “Big Five” personality inventory is broadly accepted as a consistent and reliable categorization of attributes that people find “important and useful in daily interactions” ([Goldberg, 1981]). The Big Five measures individual differences across five broad traits: openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism (or its converse, emotional stability). In an evolutionary context, the five-factor model may identify individual variations on behavioral dimensions that are significant to human social acceptance and status in groups. [McAdam and Pals (2006]) identify these facets of social interaction and their associated personality traits as social dominance (extraversion), negativity and instability (neuroticism), cooperation (agreeableness), trust and commitment (conscientiousness), and openness to change and learning (openness to experience). At a more micro-level, these modes of interaction are also relevant to mating and successful pair-bonding—a conscientious mate will be more trustworthy and more likely to fulfill a marital commitment. Though a recent literature in economics has examined the cross-sectional relationship between personality indicators and labor market outcomes,4 the effect of personality on demographic outcomes in large samples is almost unexplored. An exception is a set of recent studies of fertility and fertility timing. Jokela et al. ([2009]) review a small set of studies in psychology on personality and childbearing and estimate the relationship between personality and parenthood using a large longitudinal survey (N = 1,839) of young Finns. They find that emotionality (related to neuroticism) and sociability (related to extraversion) are associated with the probability of having children for both men and women. [Tavares (2008)] examines the relationship between Big Five personality traits and age at first birth for women in the British Household Panel Survey and finds that agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism accelerate childbearing, while conscientiousness and openness delay it.5 Measured psychological characteristics, including personality, may reflect individual variation in both preferences and capabilities. [Tavares (2008)] interprets the correlations she finds between personality and fertility timing as reflective of individual women’s underlying preferences and motivations for childbearing. [Borghans et al. (2008)] discuss the relevance of personality to economics and the relevance of economics to personality psychology. They provide some analytic frameworks for linking personality psychology and economics and argue that personality traits, as well as cognitive ability, may impose constraints on individual choices and, in turn, “conventional economic preference parameters can be interpreted as consequences of these constraints” (p. 997). For example, high rates of time preference may be caused by an individual’s inability to delay gratification, or by an inability to imagine the future. It is possible to construct simple models of personality and marital surplus in which “preference” and “constraint” interpretations of personality have distinct predictions for empirical relationships between individual traits and marriage behavior. In the first model presented below, personality affects individual tastes for a household public good and, in the second, personality traits are indicators of productive capabilities. In this context, the two types of economic interaction that create marital surplus—household production and joint consumption—have contrasting implications for how individual traits affect the decision to marry. If a personality trait has the same effect on the probability of marriage for men and women, we can infer that it is related to the consumption benefits of marriage, and therefore to individual preferences. If gender-based specialization is an important source of marital surplus, however, we would expect different capabilities to promote the marriages of men and women. If psychological traits primarily reflect individual capabilities rather than preferences, then trait effects on marriage will differ by gender. Suppose, first of all, that the gains to marriage depend on the joint consumption of a marriage-specific public good that is purchased in the market. Each individual i in a prospective couple has a continuous, quasi-concave utility function that is monotone increasing in consumption of a household public good, Q, and a private good, x
i
. Q is purchased in the market at a price p. Let preferences take the quasi-linear form: which permits utility to be transferable within the household through reallocations of the private good.6 A married couple consisting of person 1 and person 2 is assumed make decisions cooperatively and, with transferable utility, the efficient level of the household public good is independent of the distribution of income that household bargaining determines. The optimal value of Q satisfies the Samuelson condition and the pooled household budget constraint

In a general model with transferable utility in which potential spouses vary only in wealth, [Lam (1988)] shows that there will be positive assortative mating on wealth, since there are positive returns to choosing a spouse with similar demands for the public good. We are concerned here with preferences rather than wealth, and marital surplus is increasing in both β1 and β2, the relative preferences for the marriage-exclusive public good. Suppose that a personality trait z0 influences preferences so that β

, and this probability will be increasing in the value of her personality trait. Therefore, individuals with greater preferences for marital public goods are more likely to marry. With assortative matching, the marginal effect of z0 on the probability of marriage will be even stronger. This model predicts that men and women with high relative preferences for jointly-consumed goods such as children (agreeableness, for example), companionship (extraversion), and conformance with social conventions (conscientiousness) will tend to marry or cohabit with like-minded individuals rather than remain single. If consumption complementarities are the principal source of gains to marriage, we should observe similar patterns of selection into marriage by personality for men and for women. Model 2: Marital Production. Production complementarities in the household, on the other hand, imply differential selection into marriage for men and women. Suppose that, instead of being purchased in the market, the marital public good is produced in the household with inputs of spousal time,

As in the previous model, a cooperative couple chooses the efficient level of the public good, in this case subject to the production function and the time and budget constraints: This is Becker’s model of household production, and since the time of persons 1 and 2 are perfect (quality-adjusted) substitutes in both home and market work, it leads to complete specialization—the husband and wife will not both supply positive hours to the home and market sectors. Suppose that market productivity w is enhanced by a personality trait, z

. Since female z

 are complements in production, assortative matching will increase the marginal effect of each trait on marital surplus, and increase this dependence of marriage probabilities on distinct male and female traits. Models 1 and 2 show that production complementarities and consumption complementarities imply different patterns of selection into marriage for men and women (as long as specialization in household production is gender-based).7 Although we observe strong positive assortative mating on a variety of individual characteristics, including education, wages, religion, and ethnicity, there is some empirical evidence that potential gains to specialization also affect the propensity to marry. For example, Xie et al. ([2003]) show that potential earnings increase the likelihood of marriage for men, but not women. A priori, we expect the differential selection of men and women into marriage by personality traits predicted by the household production model to have decreased over the past few decades for two reasons. One, falling fertility and changes in the relative price of home time and market substitutes have substantially reduced hours devoted to household production ([Aguiar and Hurst, 2007]). As wage rates rise and the price of market inputs falls, efficient household production has become more goods-intensive and this “marketization” of household activities should cause the influence of personality traits that affect sector-specific productivity to fall. Two, decreased gender discrimination in labor markets and weakening social norms that restrict women to the home sphere imply that the determinants of marital surplus will be less gender-specific. We can also expect the marginal impact of individual characteristics on cohabitation, age at marriage and divorce to increase with the erosion of social norms concerning traditional family arrangements and the emergence of greater diversity in family histories. For example, education had no significant association with the marital status of men in the U. S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics in 1970 but by 2001, when the proportion married was much smaller, marriage and education had a strong positive correlation (Lundberg, [2005]). Similarly, increasing levels of discretion in family arrangements should lead to a greater role for personality and preferences in explaining family behavior (Tavares, 2008). The predicted effect of personality traits on individual propensities to divorce also begins with the determinants of marital surplus. The essence of the economic theory of divorce is stated in the classic paper by [Becker, Landes and Michael (1977)]—a couple divorces when they have “less favorable outcomes from their marriage than they expected when marrying” (p. 1142). Members of a newly-married couple will be uncertain about each other’s true nature and the characteristics of their future children, about their future earnings prospects and health conditions. As information about the quality of their match and the value of their alternatives arrives, surprises can lead to a dissipation of the marital surplus and divorce. For example, [Weiss and Willis (1997)] find that negative shocks to men’s earnings (but not women’s earnings) increase divorce probabilities. [Charles and Stephens (2004]) show that the information content of an earnings shock may be more important than the shock itself. They find that the divorce hazard rises after a spouse’s job displacement but not after a disabling health shock, and that job loss only increases divorce if it is due to a layoff, not a plant closing. If legal restrictions or social norms make divorce costly, then marital dissolution will only occur if shocks to the perceived quality of this marriage or the attractiveness of alternative partners renders marital surplus sufficiently negative that it is worthwhile to pay these costs. Individual commitment to marriage can also be thought of as a source of (psychic) divorce costs that make dissolution less likely. If surprises arrive that leave marital surplus positive but that change the value of marital alternatives for one partner, some redistribution may be required to maintain the marriage with positive surplus for both partners. [Peters (1986)] shows that, if the marital surplus cannot be reallocated (due, for example, to asymmetric information) then ‘inefficient’ divorces may occur. In general, then, we would expect divorce to be more likely when marital surplus and divorce costs (or commitment) are low, when the cost of renegotiating the marital contract following shocks is high, and when alternative relationships are more readily available. In terms of individual traits, this suggests that individuals who are more impulsive and desirous of variety (openness), more extraverted, and less conscientious may be more likely to divorce. Environment as well as individual traits may also be important for the arrival of alternative partnership opportunities—[McKinnish (2004)] shows that workplace contact between men and women appears to increase divorce. Finally, neuroticism may inhibit negotiation and make an individual more divorce-prone. There is some support for these hypotheses in psychological studies. In a sample of 431 male physicians, [McCranie and Kahan (1986)] found that socially non-conforming, impulsive, risk-taking, stimulus-seeking men were more likely to have multiple divorces. In terms of the Big 5 traits, this would lead us to expect that low conscientiousness and high openness to experience are associated with a high probability of divorce. Marital instability has also been shown to be associated with neuroticism ([Kiernan, 1986]; [Lowell and Conley, 1987]), low agreeableness in women and extraversion in men ([Kinnunen et al., 2000]). A comprehensive review of this literature by [Roberts et al. (2007)] finds consistent effects of neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness on divorce and concludes that the likely explanation for this association is that “personality helps shape the quality of long-term relationships” (p. 327). This study uses data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (SOEP), a representative longitudinal survey of households and individuals in Germany ([Wagner et al., 2007]). The initial wave of the survey was conducted in 1984, and consisted of 12,000 randomly-selected respondents in West Germany in 1984. In 1990, following re-unification, a sample from East Germany was added, followed by a sample of immigrants in 1994 and several additional samples. This study uses all samples available in 2005 except the high income test sample and sample weights are used in all analyses. The analysis sample is derived from the 2008 95% Scientific Use File of SOEP, and consists of 7,111 household heads, spouses, and partners aged 35 to 59 in 2005 with non-missing data for all variables. Results are presented for the full sample and separately for two birth cohorts—men and women born between 1945 and 1959 (old), and those born between 1960 and 1970 (young). Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for key variables. The SOEP conducts a separate interview with each member of a household over age 17, so that all information is self-reported. The key dependent variables are life-cycle family outcomes that can be observed for these birth cohorts--ever-married by age 35 and whether the first marriage ended in divorce by the end of the sample period. Table 1 also reports the proportion of each cohort married by age 25 and the mean age at first marriage. These variables are constructed from the Marital Biography File, and do not distinguish between legal marriage and cohabitation—both are termed “marriage.” Despite the inclusion of cohabitation in this measure, the older cohorts “married” earlier than the young cohorts. The mean age at first marriage is 23 for the older women and 26 for the older men, compared to 24.6 for the young women and 27 for the young men. Marriage rates are very high for the older cohorts (93 and 87 percent for women and men, respectively) and even for men in the younger cohorts, 77 percent have married/cohabited by age 35. About one-quarter of the ever-married older cohorts experienced a divorce from their first marriage by 2007, compared to 24 percent of the young women and 18 percent of the young men. The younger cohorts of men are less likely to have divorced in part because the elapsed time between their marriage date and the end of the sample period is much shorter—an average of 13 years versus 26 for the older cohorts. Mean years of education are roughly constant across cohorts for men, but increase from 11.8 years to 12.3 years for women. The labor force participation rate for women, defined as the proportion of the sample with positive labor income in 2005, is only slightly higher for the younger cohorts (66 percent versus 61 percent for the older cohorts), as many of them still have young children at home in 2005. Many of the younger women who work do so part-time and their total earnings are lower in 2005, both in absolute terms and relative to male earnings, than the earnings of the older female cohorts. Even though we might expect the better-educated women born after 1960 to have a greater lifetime attachment to the labor force than those born in the post-war years, the low rates of maternal employment in Germany imply that only a very small decrease in gender specialization across cohorts is apparent at this point in the lifecycle.8 Additional control variables include dummies for German ethnicity, for inclusion in the East German sample, and for the report of some religion (vs. “none”). The main independent variables are the personality traits—openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. Each personality trait incorporates a variety of detailed attributes that tend to be correlated, and “the Big 5 are fairly independent dimensions that can be measured with convergent and discriminant validity” ([John and Srivasta, 1999]). There is a long history of testing for internal validity, but external validity assessments are more limited, and tend to be focused on small samples. Recent reviews by [Roberts et al. (2007)] and [Ozer and Benet-Martinez (2006)], however, emphasize the ability of personality traits to predict important life outcomes, including health and happiness, the quality of peer and romantic relationships, and occupational choice. The SOEP 2005 survey includes a short-scale version of the Big Five personality inventory. Each trait is constructed from three items in which the respondent assesses how well a descriptive phrase applies to them (Table 2) using a 7-point Likert scale. The average scores for each trait have been age-normed (with a quadratic in age) and standardized separately by gender. The Big 5 personality traits are defined as follows by [Hogan and Hogan (2007)]: Openness vs. closedness to experience: The degree to which a person needs intellectual stimulation, change and variety. Conscientiousness vs. lack of direction: The degree to which a person is willing to comply with conventional rules and norms. Agreeableness vs. antagonism: The degree to which a person needs pleasant and harmonious relations with others. Extraversion vs. introversion: The degree to which a person needs attention and social interaction. Neuroticism vs. emotional stability: The degree to which a person experiences the world as threatening and beyond his or her control. One issue in treating personality as a causal determinant of labor market success or family behavior concerns the stability of personality traits over the adult lifecycle and possible endogeneity of personality and other traits with respect to an individual’s family history. Since personality is assessed in the 2005 survey and marital histories include events in previous years, any causal interpretation of these results requires that measured personality be unaffected by the experience of marriage or divorce.9 Existing longitudinal research has suggested that personality is not affected by major life events, though we cannot rule out the possibility of some reverse causality.10 The rank-ordering of individuals is quite stable over time and, though there is some instability in early adulthood ([Roberts and DelVecchio, 2000]), temporal correlations in longitudinal studies commonly exceed 0.9 (Costa and McCrae, 1997).11 According to [Caprara and Cervone (2000)], “the relative stability of adults’ self-reports is one of the most robust findings in the personality psychology literature” (p. 146). Recent longitudinal analyses of personality retests in both SOEP and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) surveys find that traits are very stable over a four-year period (Specht, Egloff, and Schmukle, 2011; Cobb-Clark and Schurer, 2011). Cobb-Clark and Schurer find little evidence that adverse life events affect personality and, while Specht et al. find a few significant associations between major life events and specific traits, there is no evident pattern to the results.12 Also included in some models as a test of the stability of the personality effects is a measure of risk aversion included in the 2004 wave of SOEP. [Dohmen et al. (2011)] examine the validity of the SOEP risk aversion and show that it predicts risk-taking behavior in investment, career choice, smoking, and other domains. Though the relationship between personality traits and preference parameters such as risk aversion is a priori unclear, Becker et al. (2012) report weak associations between personality traits and a range of economic preference measures and find that they are complementary factors in explaining outcomes such as wages, reported health, and education.",42

While research in the area has mostly been empirical—concerned with measuring the ceteris paribus impact of an ascriptive characteristic on some economic outcome, often earnings or wages, a small theoretical literature has made additional fundamental contributions (see the summaries by Cain [1986]; Altonji and Blank [1999]). With only one exception (Fryer and Jackson [2008]), however, the theoretical literature appears to have been unconcerned about how agents form their views of the characteristic against which they discriminate—how they organize their impressions of the characteristic that in turn affect their treatment of members of other groups. The lack of concern with this question in the empirical literature seems to have been complete. That the question is generally important seems clear. How do wage differences respond to differences in height in the work force if new cohorts of workers are taller than their predecessors? How would earnings differentials that arise from differences in workers’ beauty be altered if workers generally became better-looking? How does the impact of looks on electoral success change if the distribution of candidates’ looks changes? Persico et al. ([2004]), Case and Paxson ([2008]), Hamermesh and Biddle ([1994]), Möbius and Rosenblat ([2006]), Benjamin and Shapiro ([2009]) and Berggren et al. ([2010]) have studied the market responses of these outcomes to differences in the characteristics. None of these studies, nor any other, has considered the general question of how perceptions of the characteristic affect the outcome. With Americans, and especially northern Europeans, becoming taller, the treatment of height as an earnings-enhancing labor-market characteristic may change. To the extent that the distribution of looks is changeable by an increasingly affluent and beauty-obsessed public, how those possible changes would affect the returns to beauty is also important. In this study I examine these issues on a number of data sets covering several different characteristics and outcomes, with the data coming from the United States and the Netherlands. In several cases I run a “horse race” between models specifying the characteristic as absolute and those specifying it as relative—in percentiles. Where possible I estimate the kernel density of the characteristic and use kernel estimation to obtain a nonparametric representation of its impact on the outcome, thus obviating spurious results that might arise from the imposition of a particular functional form on the relationship. This approach seems a sensible way of introducing the empirical examination of how perceptions of differences in ascriptive characteristics affect what we view as discriminatory outcomes. No doubt there are other methods of doing so. Whether there is a general answer—a consistent way in which agents form the perceptions that affect how a characteristic alters labor- and other market outcomes—is not clear. But by examining several characteristics in a variety of contexts I may be able to shed a bit of light on how perceptions of differences in characteristics (in the empirical examples here, in beauty and in height) affect outcomes that have previously been examined without attention to the nature of the apparent discrimination.",6

Parents may affect the behavior and decisions taken by their children through genetic transmission, preferences, or/and environment – put simply, more educated and richer parents can provide a “better” environment for their children, which creates an inequity which is the focus of sizable policy attention (see for example McLachlan et al. (2013)). The nature of the policy interventions to address this inequity depends critically on the nature of the intergenerational transmission mechanism, and the extent to which the relationship is causal. In particular, it has proven difficult to determine whether the transmission mechanism works through inherited genetic factors or environmental factors and, to the extent that it is the latter, what is the relative importance of parental education and income? Moreover, the link between the schooling of parents and their children could be due to unobserved inherited characteristics rather than a causal effect of parental education or income per se in household production. This issue is explored in detail in the review by Björklund and Salvanes (2011). An example of the importance of maternal education on child’s outcome is provided in Currie and Moretti (2003), who found a positive relationship between maternal education and their child’s birth weight, which is a strong predictor of child health. The existence of such effects provides an important argument for subsidizing education, especially in households with low income and/or low educated parents. Indeed there may be multiplier effects since policy interventions that increase educational attainment for one generation may create spillovers to subsequent generations. The literature is not entirely consistent but it is generally believed that, while raising the education of mothers and fathers has broadly similar effects on household income, the external effects on children associated with parental education are larger for maternal education than for paternal, because mothers tend to be the main provider of care within the household. Understanding the mechanisms by which parental education may affect children’s outcomes is more difficult than establishing that there is an effect. Firstly, parental education may be a direct input into the production function that generates the quality of the endowments that children have in various domains (health, ability etc.). Secondly, it may also affect the choice of other inputs. Thirdly, it may indirectly facilitate a higher quantity and/or quality of other inputs through its effect on household income. The use of policy instruments such as income transfers to attempt to break the cycle of disadvantage presumes this latter route is important. This paper addresses an important issue in the existing literature: the causal effect of parental education on children, allowing for the separate effects of maternal and paternal education; and for the causal effect of household income, controlling for education. To date, no study has simultaneously tried to account for the endogeneity of both parental education and parental income. The distinction between education and income is important since differences in policy approaches hang on their relative effects. Using a series of British cross-sectional datasets, we begin by confirming the usual finding, using least squares, that parental education levels and paternal income are positively associated with good child outcomes: in particular, with later school leaving1. This outcome measure is important because recent UK governments have targeted a reduction in the proportion of pupils leaving at 16, and committed to a phased increase in the minimum age at which youths can leave education and training. We go on to use instrumental variable methods to take account of the endogeneity of both parental income and education. We exploit a variety of ideas for identification that have been used in other research, including changes in the minimum school leaving age for the parents; month of birth of the parents which captures early school tracking that affected the parental cohorts; and parental union status and its interactions with occupation that affect paternal income independently from education.",91

2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,20 September 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-2-5,The recent decline in employment dynamics,December 2013,Henry R Hyatt,James R Spletzer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the course of the last two decades, an increasing number of sources have provided data on the rate at which jobs and workers move across employers. One consistent story these data tell is that employment dynamics in the United States exhibit double-digit declines during the first decade of the twenty-first century.1 This is the case across multiple measures and data sources, and we summarize these declines in Table 1 (we describe the data in the next section).2 While the levels of each measure differ across data sources due to a variety of definitional and scope differences, there is a strong agreement in the trend for each measure. Between 1998 and 2010, hires and separations rates fell between 10 percent and 38 percent, depending upon the data source. Job creation and job destruction rates declined by roughly 22 to 33 percent. Job-to-job flows exhibited the largest decline, falling by 47 to 53 percent. Available evidence suggests that the 1998–2010 decline in employment dynamics is an acceleration of a downward trend in employment dynamics that extends backwards in time before the start of our data series.3 Employment dynamics are important. Increases in job and worker reallocation have been associated with higher economic growth by, among others, Jovanovic and Moffitt (1990) and Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001). This positive association comes through the Schumpeterian creative destruction process of new and expanding businesses replacing the market share of established companies, as well as the ongoing efforts of businesses and workers seeking their most productive matches. There is also strong evidence that job switching is an important component of wage growth, particularly for young persons, see Topel and Ward (1992). If the decline in employment dynamics is indicative of declining innovation or declining labor market flexibility, then this would be worrisome for the U.S. economy. On the other hand, declining dynamics could be indicative of increased job stability or reduced uncertainty. There are numerous potential explanations for the recent decline in employment dynamics. One set of explanations concern the changes in the composition of the employed or of employers. For example, the postwar baby boom generation is aging and the employment-to-population ratio of teenagers has been falling: both of these changes should lead to reduced dynamics as the workforce shifts from subpopulations with high rates of mobility to subpopulations with low rates of mobility. Other possible explanations include declining worker mobility resulting from better initial worker-firm matching, a shift in the distribution of outside wage offers, increased mobility costs or employment adjustment costs, or the globalization of the production process. In this paper, we give the range of explanations our critical consideration. We begin this paper by thoroughly documenting the decline in employment dynamics.4 Our empirical work relies on four leading datasets on employment dynamics in the United States: the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), the Business Employment Dynamics (BED), the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), and the Current Population Survey (CPS). In section III, we examine changes in labor market composition as an explanation for these declines; our analysis shows that changes in the composition of workers and businesses can explain only a small amount of the decline in employment dynamics. In section IV, we analyze the decline in gross worker flows (hires and separations), employing some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), as well as to job-to-job flows. We find that the decline in gross job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains about a third of the decline in gross worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving the declines in gross job flows, there are different forces that are driving the declines in gross worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving the declines in gross worker flows. We end this paper with a discussion of economic explanations for the decline in labor market dynamics, including increases in adjustment costs, changes in the job matching process, the role of uncertainty, changes in the production process, and job- and housing-lock. While we are able to rule out some explanations, we do not conduct any formal tests, and we view our discussion as an aid for future research.",47
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,23 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-2-4,Hiring discrimination based on national origin and religious closeness: results from a field experiment in the Paris area,December 2013,Guillaume Pierné,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For a couple of decades, economists have been using field experiments in order to directly measure hiring discrimination in the labor markets. Strong evidence of origin based hiring discrimination has been detected in various developed countries 1 such as Australia (Riach and Rich, 1991), the USA (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004) and France (Duguet et al., 2010, 2011). However, one of the striking observations that can be made on most of these studies concerns the proxies that are used to signal the applicants’ national origin. If it is evident that first name and surname provide a relevant signal of national origin to the recruiter, it is also possible that they provide a signal of religious closeness. This issue is widely ignored in the literature, yet there are several good reasons to believe that religion matters. Becker’s aversion theory (Becker, 1957) provides an intuitively plausible explanation for the existence of hiring discrimination based on religion. A statistical component (Phelps, 1972, Arrow 1973) might also play a role. This could occur if recruiters link religious closenesses with economic outcomes in a differential manner. Many studies indeed show that religious membership does influence economic outcomes, especially economic growth (Barro and McCleary, 2003), women’s position in the labor market (Algan and Cahuc, 2006), economic attitudes (Guiso et al., 2003) and employment prospects (Pattachini et al., 2012). While this issue has recently been identified by economists, the literature proposing to evaluate hiring discrimination separately based on origin and religion is very limited. To our knowledge, two studies can be cited in this strand of the literature. Banerjee et al. (2009) seek to identify the role of caste and Muslim identity on hiring discrimination in software and call center jobs in India. For this purpose, they sent out a set of fictitious applications, differing only in applicants’ names, which in India may signal Muslim religious identity or membership in a higher or lower caste group. The authors’ conclusion is that there is no proof of hiring discrimination against Muslim applicants. Their results also show that belonging to a higher caste group increases the probability of obtaining a job interview, while this advantage disappears when the job requires a higher skill level. Adida et al. (2010) are the first to note that previous research on hiring discrimination against applicants related to geographical areas associated with Islam, does not identify whether, and to what extent, ethnicity and religious closeness influence hiring discrimination in France. To detect such influence, the authors measure the difference in job access in secretarial and accounting positions between one female applicant with a French sounding name and two female applicants with Senegalese sounding names. The latter two signal closeness to Catholic and Muslim religiosity respectively through their first names and professional or volunteering activities. The results of Adida et al. (2010) indicate that the difference in the response to the French and the Senegalese Catholic applicants is significantly smaller than the difference in the response to the French and the Senegalese Muslim applicants2. Several observations can be made. As the authors themselves note, the use of Senegalese applicants is perhaps not the most appropriate choice to detect hiring discrimination against Muslims. Sufi Islam in Senegal is quite different from the mainstream Sunni Islam practiced throughout the world. Diop (1988) shows that the habits of Muslims from sub Saharan Africa may cause them to be singled out as “not real Muslims” by French people. Moreover, Brinbaum et al. (2010) show that religion is much more frequently cited as a cause of discrimination by North African person than by persons from sub Saharan Africa. For these reasons, religious discrimination could be underestimated in the study of Adida et al. (2010). Furthermore, if the African first names used signal directly the religious closeness of their applicants, they could at the same time indicate different backgrounds3. This might matter, as Christian Senegalese as a group appears to be significantly more educated than Muslim Senegalese. Thus, there is no way to disentangle first name specific success from the effect of religious closeness. Finally, as the applicants are women, the gap observed might be impacted by a priori probability differences of motherhood between Catholic and Muslim applicants. In this study, we follow closely the intuition of Adida et al. (2010), while seeking to improve it in some ways. First, we direct our experiment at the most relevant migrant group in France: those from North Africa. To our knowledge, a study separating out the effects of North African origin from the effects of Muslim religion has never been carried out before. Several reasons can justify our choice. North Africa is the top source of migrants to France4. North Africans are also the most representative population of Muslims in France and the ones who declare that they suffer the most from religious discrimination (cf supra). Studies suggest that they suffer from hiring discrimination even though the discrimination may be less than against Senegalese applicants (Duguet et al., 2011). More broadly, North Africans belong to the demographic group for which it is the most difficult, and at the same time the most appropriate, to separate origin effects from religiosity effects. North African names are correlated almost perfectly to Muslim religious identity and, differently to the Senegalese, it is not possible to differentiate North Africans into Muslims and members of other religions. In the majority of countries of the North Africa, Islam is the state religion and every newborn is considered as Muslim by default. Atheism and the proselytizing of Muslims by other religions are forbidden and suppressed. Secondly, we vary from Adida et al. (2010) by building applications that signal closeness to Catholic and Muslim religious identity respectively for French and for North African applicants. Therefore, our comparison of applicants’ performances allows for a better identification of origin effect deriving from religious closeness. Thirdly, we send all the applicants to the same job offers, regardless of their religious closeness. Thus, we do not need to make any hypothesis about the equality of some potentially determining unobservable job characteristics, as it is the case for the test of Adida et al. (2010). This hypothesis is all the stronger, the smaller the samples are, and the more limited the set of variables5 used to match job offers is. It follows that sample differences may lead to spurious evidences of hiring discrimination, even if job offers are randomly distributed between pairs of applicants. Fourth, to avoid picking up effects linked to gender such as differences in probability of motherhood, we use only male applicants. Finally, we investigate a profession involving far higher degree of public exposure and contact with customers than secretarial and accounting positions: real estate sales. For this reason, our results are probably more conditioned by customer feelings about North African, Muslim and Catholic people than the results of Adida et al. (2010) study. The remainder of this study is made up of two sections. The first section describes the protocol for application construction and data collection. The second section presents the results.",30

In-kind transfers are widespread and extensive: housing, childcare and nutrition are commonly provided in this way. However, despite their widespread use there is very little empirical evidence that addresses the effects of in-kind transfers on labour supply. This is in stark contrast to the wealth of evidence on the labour supply effects of means-tested cash transfer programmes. An important attribute of means-tested programmes is that participation in them is seldom 100% of the eligible population because of the costs associated with claiming and/or receiving the transfers. These costs may be real (transactions costs) or psychic (in the form of stigma), and there may be informational deficiencies that also contribute to this problem. The costs may be fixed (i.e. independent of the level of eligibility) or variable. In any event, programme participation is liable to depend on the level of entitlement and it seems likely that this applies to both cash and in-kind transfers. In practice, cash transfer programmes are often supplemented by in-kind transfers. Yet it is often thought that cash is preferable to in-kind transfers on theoretical grounds. Thus, conventional wisdom has it that cashing out an in-kind programme would raise the welfare of recipients. It follows that cashing out an in-work in-kind transfer programme ought to make work more attractive. However, means-tested transfer programmes impose costs on recipients and the key to understanding why the conventional wisdom is not necessarily true is to realize that the alternative to inefficient in-kind transfers is not cash, but some other programme that gives cash which has some costs associated with it. The objective of this paper is to measure the effect of in-kind transfers on labour supply, relative to cash transfers, allowing for transfer programme non-participation. We do so by exploiting the observed variation in labour supply of single mothers in cross-section survey data that is pooled across a number of years that bridge an important reform to the UK welfare system. The contribution of this paper is that we allow for differential costs associated with different programmes. In particular, unlike the existing literature on U.S. food stamps, we do not impose any restriction on the costs associated with in-kind programmes compared to cash programmes. Our results suggest that, although there is considerable inefficiency with in-kind transfers, participation in cash transfers can impose even greater costs than the in-kind programmes that we consider here. Thus, our findings support the idea that in-kind transfers could have an important place in the portfolio of policy options. We model the effect on labour supply of several transfer programmes relevant to single mothers in the U.K.: Family Credit is an in-work cash transfer; Income Support is out-of-work cash; Housing Benefit for those with high housing costs and low income; Welfare Milk Tokens for low income families with pre-school age children; and Free School Lunches for children of school age in low income families. We exploit a 1988 reform to Family Credit where cash was increased but conditional eligibility to Welfare Milk Tokens and Free School Lunch was lost. Here, we adopt structural assumptions on preferences to allow us to identify the costs, borne by the single mother, associated with each transfer programme and so enable us break down the effects of the 1988 reform into those due to changes in cash programme entitlement levels and those due to changes in the in-kind programme eligibility rules. Our structural model has two advantages over and above a strictly reduced form approach, such as difference-in-differences, which would only enable us to describe the gross effects of the reform. First, we are able to quantify the costs associated with participating in different welfare programmes. Secondly, we can compare the sensitivity of behaviour to variations in earned income across labour market states with responses to variations in each form of welfare programme income. This allows us estimate the relative work incentive effects of cash versus in-kind transfers.",1

The usual theoretical approach to wage discrimination originates in the pathbreaking work by Becker ([1971]). According to Becker, discrimination stems from personal prejudices among employers, co-workers, or consumers that constitute discriminatory preferences among these groups. As a case in point, discriminatory employers may suffer a disutility from employing women. To be compensated for the loss in utility following from employing women, these employers pay lower wages to women than to men, ceteris paribus. In the non-segregating equilibrium, all female workers receive a lower wage than men, no matter whether they work for an employer with or without discriminatory preferences. Yet, as pointed out by Arrow ([1973]), in equilibrium, non-discriminatory employers employ more women at below-productivity wages than their discriminatory counterparts and therefore gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. Put differently, indulging discriminatory preferences comes at a cost in this framework. Indeed, empirical studies have documented that discriminatory employers make lower profits (Hellerstein et al.[2002]; Kawaguchi [2007]) and are more likely to exit the market (Weber and Zulehner [2014]). Employers actually seem to pay for discrimination. For discrimination to prevail, discriminatory employers must possess some market power on their product markets, enabling them to indulge their costly preferences. Otherwise, discrimination would simply be competed away. And thus, the strength of product market competition should put limits on the viability of discrimination, with gender pay gaps being lower in more competitive environments. Following this line of reasoning, we investigate whether strong product market competition reduces gender wage discrimination in West Germany and whether this effect is more pronounced in the so-called codetermination-free sector, i.e., in plants with neither collective agreements nor a works council. In contrast with previous studies, we use linked employer–employee panel data that include a plant-level assessment of the strength of product market competition. Almost exclusively, extant studies have used aggregate or indirect measures of competition such as the intensity of international trade (Black and Brainerd [2004]; Juhn et al.[2014]), the extent of market regulation (Black and Strahan [2001]), market structure (Winter-Ebmer [1995]; Heyman et al.[2013]), or combinations of these (Jirjahn and Stephan [2006]; Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer [2007]; Zweimüller et al.[2008]; Heinze and Wolf [2010]). Such measures, however, suffer from at least two severe shortcomings: First, although these proxies may be informative on the average intensity of product market competition within a product market, they do not provide information on changes in competitive pressure at the level of the individual firm where decision-making takes place. Even worse, using these measures requires the researcher to implicitly define plants’ relevant product and geographical markets, which turns out to be far from trivial. Notably, the inevitable problems in doing so in a convincing and unambiguous way drove the German Monopolies Commission to cease reporting classic concentration measures, like the Herfindahl index or the concentration ratio, altogether (Monopolies Commission [2012], p. 12). Second, through the lens of the structure–conduct–performance paradigm, utilising these measures also claims that the market structure uniquely determines market participants’ behaviour, thereby abstracting from different ways of competition on different product markets that may add further ambiguity to the proxy at hand. As a case in point, Sutton ([1991]) shows that fierce competition on a market with substantial entry costs may lead to high concentration in an industry (the limiting case being two incumbents competing à la Bertrand). To sidestep these problems related to aggregate or indirect proxies of product market competition, we will use a direct plant-level measure of competitive pressure based on a self-assessment by plants’ managers. Therefore, we do not have to define plants’ relevant market ex ante, and basing our measure on the beliefs of plants’ managers about competition guarantees that it is relevant for managements’ decision-making. To the best of our knowledge, Belfield and Heywood ([2006]) and Hirsch et al. ([2012]) are the only scholars in this strand of the literature to base their evidence on direct information on the competition faced by individual firms. While Hirsch et al. ([2012]) find a negative correlation between firms’ self-assessment on product market competition and the unexplained gender pay gap in West Germany, Belfield and Heywood ([2006]) document a negative link for the U.K. that is more pronounced in the non-unionised sector. Both studies, however, rely on cross-sectional data only – with Hirsch et al. ([2012]) utilising the 2008 cross section of the data set used in this study. They thus cannot rule out that differences in pay gaps, reflecting unobserved heterogeneity among firms facing different levels of product market competition and/or self-selection of workers into firms with different competitive pressure rather than a genuine competition effect. Against this background, our study contributes to the literature in three ways: First, our panel data permit us to investigate the impact of plant-level product market competition on the unexplained gender pay gap, controlling for match fixed effects, i.e., time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity for every plant–worker pair. We thus base our investigation on direct information on the competition faced by plants, with identification relying on the differential impact of within-plant variation in competitive pressure on within-plant wage growth of men and women. As a consequence, estimated effects are neither contaminated by unobserved time-invariant plant heterogeneity nor by self-selection of workers. Second, apart from identification, we add to the literature by investigating heterogeneities in the competition effect on gender wage discrimination by plants’ industrial relations regime. German industrial relations are characterised by a dual system of worker representation through (sectoral) trade unions and works councils that can be elected by the workforce in plants with at least five employees (for details, see Keller [2004] or Addison [2009]). As plants’ discretion to alter wages in response to changes in competitive pressure should be more limited if they are bound by a collective agreement or if they have a works council, we analyse whether the competition effect is stronger in the sector with none of these types of worker representation (which in Germany is usually referred to as the codetermination-free sector). Third, we investigate whether the effect is larger in plants with a below-average share of females in their workforces. Since theory suggests that these plants have more pronounced discriminatory preferences, a stronger competition effect in these plants would further substantiate that fierce competition limits taste-based employer discrimination. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes our data set and Section 3 our econometric approach. Section 4 presents and discusses our results, and Section 5 concludes.",7
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,10 December 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-014-0016-y,Common law marriage and couple formation,December 2014,Shoshana Grossbard,Victoria Vernon,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The last few decades have witnessed a movement from marriage towards unmarried cohabitation. For example, 48% of over 12,000 women interviewed in 2006–2010 for the National Survey of Family Growth cohabited with a partner at a first union, compared with 34% of women in 1995.1 About 41% of all children in this country are born to unmarried mothers, including a quarter of all births to mothers who cohabit with their partner (National Vital Statistics Reports [2014]). In our sample, couple formation rates have decreased during this period: in 1995, 43% of men ages 18 to 35 and 50% of women the same age resided in couple; by 2011, these percentages had dropped to 37% and 44%. There are many benefits of living in a couple rather than alone: larger households enjoy economies of scale in expenses; partners can specialize in various tasks which leads to higher productivity of both partners; household tasks require no transaction costs, partners can enjoy joint consumption; and one partner’s income can serve as insurance against the other partner’s income shocks. However the main reason why couples are formed is to provide a protective environment for children. Children born to parents living in a couple are better off than children of single parents, in part because they grow up with more of a father’s presence in their lives (see Mincy and Oliver [2003]). Relative to children raised by a mother and a father, children raised by a single parent often achieve less in terms of school performance (McLanahan and Sandefur [1994], McLanahan and Sigle-Rushton [2004]) and have higher rates of depression and crime participation (Hobcraft [1998], Sigle-Rushton et al. [2005]). In addition, whether individuals form couples or not has an impact on the demand for goods and services such as housing and childcare. The choice between marriage and (non-marital) cohabitation [hence simply called ‘cohabitation’] is a more subtle one. The two institutions differ, e.g., in their tax implications, access to a spouse’s Social Security and other government benefits, and access to employer benefits such as health insurance and pension plans. Consequently, marriage provides more asset protection to the spouse who earned less (possibly because they engaged more in household production) in the event of dissolution due to separation or death. In this paper, we examine whether the likelihood of in-couple residence, marriage, cohabitation, and likelihood of being divorced among those ever-married are associated with variation in the state-level availability of Common Law Marriage (CLM). Several US states offer their heterosexual residents this additional way of organizing their living-together arrangements. CLM does not require a marriage certificate or ceremony, it can be established when couples cohabit and hold themselves out as spouses by calling each other husband and wife in public, using the same last name, filing joint tax returns, or declaring their marriage on applications, leases, birth certificates and other documents. Cohabiting couples who have a child are almost certainly considered “married” in a CLM state. In the event of separation, such couples go through a regular divorce. Once established, CLM is no different from marriage, including its acceptance by all other states and government institutions dealing with tax collection and redistribution of income. In most states with CLM, there are no rules regarding cohabitation time required for common law marriage. A short term cohabiting relationship may also be called “marriage” if both spouses agree. One peculiar feature of CLM that distinguishes it from a regular marriage is that it can be claimed ex-post by one partner after the relationship ends due to separation or death. This fluid definition of marriage in CLM states is one of the reasons why this paper’s focus is on in-couple co-residence—married or not--more than on marriage and cohabitation as two separate states. Most US states recognized CLM in the past but don’t any more. The historical vagaries of why some states have the law and others don’t are described in Bowman ([1996]) and Lind ([2008]). Informal marriage was originally brought to the colonies by British settlers, and it remained in the U.S. long after its repeal in the U.K. in 1753. Among the factors that explain early popularity of these laws in the US are the philosophy of non-interference of the state in its citizens’ private affairs and the practical advantages of establishing marriages in frontier conditions when priests were not available. A first wave of repeals of CLM laws occurred between 1875 and 1917; a second wave in the years 1921 to 1959. These repeals have been explained, e.g., in terms of transportation improvements (it became easier to register marriages), the expanded system of government benefits with spousal entitlements (making it more costly for states to recognize CLM), and growth in the number of contested marriage cases (Bowman [1996]). As of 2014, common-law marriage remains legal in: Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire (only posthumously for purposes of inheritance), Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, as well as in the Navajo Nation and in the District of Columbia. CLM laws are also found in Utah where they were repealed in 1888 and reinstituted in 1987. Most recently, CLM was repealed by Ohio (1991), Idaho (1996), Georgia (1997), and Pennsylvania (2005), thus providing us with a quasi-experiment. The internet contains plenty of information and legal advice for couples about CLM, so we know it is practiced.2 Some indication of CLM’s prevalence can be derived from the fact that about one hundred legal CLM–related judgments have been issued each decade in each state with CLM laws at the federal level, according to legal historian Goran Lind ([2008]). Data availability on CLM is a problem. There is virtually no official data on CLM marriages published by state or local governments, even though some counties encourage residents to register their CLMs.3 We circumvent this data problem by exploiting cross-state variation in CLM and changes over time. Our analysis includes the derivation of predictions regarding the effect of CLM on couple formation based on Gary Becker’s ([1973]) demand and supply model of marriage.4 Becker’s pioneering economic theory of marriage is part of his economic approach to the family, one of his contributions highlighted by the Nobel prize committee. Our model leads us to predict that CLM will be associated with lower couple formation rates and that the extent of CLM’s effect will depend on male and female education, sex ratios, parental status, and age. The model assumes traditional gender roles, with women more involved in home production than men, and helps explain gender differences in the effects of CLM on subgroups of the population. Previous research has linked variation in legal regimes to outcomes related to couple formation, dissolution, and fertility. The focus of much of that U.S.-based research has been on the effect of no-fault or unilateral divorce on divorce rates (e.g. Peters [1986], Friedberg [1998], and Wolfers [2006]), marriage rates (e.g. Alesina A and Guiliano P 2007, Divorce, Fertility and the Value of Marriage, Harvard Institue of Economics Research Discussion Paper No 2136, April, unpublished manuscript, Rasul [2006]), and couples’ investments in marriage-specific capital such as spouse’s education and children (Stevenson [2007]). Halla ([2013]) showed that the introduction of joint custody increased marriage rates, overall fertility (including a shift from non-marital to marital fertility), and divorce rates for older couples. Leturcq ([2011]) has studied how the introduction of PACS (civil unions) in France in 1999 has affected marriage, and Guttierez and Becerra ([2012]) studied its effect on fertility. Variations in laws regulating division of property in the case of dissolution have helped explain the likelihood that women are out-of-couple when they give birth (Ekert-Jaffe and Grossbard [2008]). However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study examining the effect of CLM laws on couple formation. Elsewhere (Grossbard S, Vernon V (forthcoming) Common law marriage, labor supply and time use: a partial explanation for gender convergence in labor supply. Res Labor Econ), we analyzed effects of CLM on labor supply. We include sex ratios in all our models explaining in-couple residence, marriage, cohabitation, and likelihood of being divorced if ever-married. This variable was included in Becker’s ([1973]) Demand and Supply models of marriage and in earlier empirical research on couple formation (e.g. by Heer and Grossbard-Shechtman [1981], Lichter et al. [1992], and Angrist [2002]). Higher sex ratios tend to be associated with higher marriage rates relative to single status and relative to cohabitation (Grossbard-Shechtman [1993]). Our models assume that state laws regarding CLM and changes in those laws are known to state residents. The wealth of information online supports this assumption. We use individual-level data for US-born men and women ages 18-35 based on the Current Population Surveys (CPS) for the period 1995-2011, focusing on US-born individuals to increase the likelihood that respondents in our sample are familiar with this law, possibly based on the experience of older community members. We exclude foreign-born respondents who may have been unaware of CLM laws when they decided to form a couple. In some of our models, we assume that such legal knowledge is transmitted immediately. In other models, we relax that assumption and either exclude three years of data after the repeal of CLM in each of the relevant states or control for years before and after the repeal. We limit our analyses to respondents under age 36, as they are most likely to be entering marriage.5 We also assume that inter-state migration is minimal, and that if people move, they don’t do so based on whether a state has CLM or not. Consistent with our predictions, we find that CLM is associated with lower rates of in-couple residence, especially when sex ratios are low. We also find similar CLM effects on marriage probabilities when sex ratios are low. CLM’s negative effect on in-couple residence is seen for less educated men and women mainly because of its negative effect on cohabitation. Another finding consistent with our model’s prediction is that CLM only has a negative effect on in-couple residence of men with a college education, and not on their female counterparts. This effect is found separately for the likelihood of marriage and that of cohabitation. We also find that CLM has a larger negative effect on in-couple residence of women with no college education than on that of women who are college-educated. Childless men and women are more likely to respond to changes in CLM. Our demand and supply model of marriage helps explain these findings.",1

This, which he considered to be a method of analysis rather than an assumption about human motivations, became an attempt to explain various facets of human behaviour through a set of simplified assumptions regarding human behaviour, a result of individual choices characterised by utility maxixmisation, a forward-looking stance, consistent rationality, and stable and persistent preferences (Becker [1976]). Those choices were constrained by income, time, imperfect memory and calculating capabilities, and the opportunities available (Becker [1993]). Although he often mentioned that non-economic forces also played a role in terms of human behaviour, he believed that rational choice theory provided a unifying approach to the analysis of multiple social issues, and not only market behaviour (see, for instance, his Nobel Lecture in Becker [1993]). Moreover, the scope of non-economic factors became less prominent since in his later work, rationality broadened to cover aspects such as habits, culture, and social interactions in his attempt to provide an economic rationale for those non-economic factors. One of his most significant strands of research was that which developed human capital, occuping a significant part of his career, especially in the early years. His research led to the publication of the book Human Capital (Becker [1964]), which was a major step in establishing Becker’s reputation in economics and beyond. In this paper we will focus on Becker’s early work on human capital up to the publication of his book in 1964, a period that laid the foundations for his career and in which he tested the possibilities of (and the resistance to) this economic approach to human behaviour. We will explore the context in which the book was developed and the interactions with other people that were laying the foundations for human capital research, namely those working at the Chicago and Columbia Departments of Economics. Becker’s work on human capital is not only the most significant work of his first decade of research, but it also contains some of the hallmarks of his subsequent work underlying those developments3. In the next section, I start by laying the context in which Becker became interested in human capital as a topic of research. Then I present Becker’s early work on human capital and the development of the NBER study that supported it. In the fourth section, I present the major themes of the book and the way it organised human capital research developed thus far. In the fifth section, I analyse the reactions to the book, and in the sixth section, its subsequent exploration by the network of early human capital researchers. Finally, in the seventh section, I will conclude, notably by highlighting the significance of Becker’s work on human capital in the context of his subsequent career.",37

Conditional on both spouses working, however, the determinants of a successful marriage are complex1. In this paper, we use a novel approach that considers information revealed through current and past occupation choices in an empirical model of the predictors of a successful (or unsuccessful) marriage, as measured by divorce. We propose that the type of job one chooses, and the relative distance from their spouse’s job in terms of job content, reveals much about gains form specialization and relative preferences for household goods, which, in turn affects marital stability. Our use of occupation data to reveal information about spousal skills and preferences builds on a wide range of research that has shown a correlation between underlying individual traits, both cognitive and non-cognitive, and occupational choice2. Although our paper is related to the previous literature that considers marriages in the context of relative wages and schooling of the spouses [e.g., (Lam, 1988) and (Liu & Lu, 2006)], we eschew rank-order or vertical comparisons of spouses in this paper. We instead posit a “horizontal” comparison of spousal characteristics with no necessary ordinal significance. Our variables of interest measure dissimilarity between spouses’ occupations on a number of dimensions, which take the form of “distance” measures. Therefore, they act like cartographic distances in that they do not convey which endpoint is at higher elevation or latitude. Consequently, these occupation measures can test theories of marital stability that are either based on similarities of preferences for household goods or dissimilarities allowing for gains from specialization. Spousal contrasts can be either good or bad for a marriage, depending upon which dimensions of the occupations the distance measures are based. Our evidence suggests that there are two dimensions of occupation distance that relate to marital stability and dissolution. First, spouses whose occupational information reveals dissimilarity in terms of knowledge are less likely to divorce or separate. The knowledge-based distance measures most likely capture what the spouses will be able to produce within the household given the knowledge that each spouse’s occupation requires. This supports the prediction that households that can divide tasks based on comparative advantage will be more stable. Second, spouses that are dissimilar in terms of vocational activities are more likely to divorce. The activities involved in one’s chosen occupation reveal preferences for activities more generally. To the extent that couples share activities and consume household public goods, one’s preferences for activities can be more or less compatible with a spouse’s preferences. We extend this analysis to single-earner households as well. As with the literature on wage sorting among couples, this research must overcome the obstacle of missing data—namely from spouses that are not earning a wage and have no current occupation from which to measure distance. Our approach overcomes this using longitudinal data observing individuals’ earlier occupations. A “synthetic” distance predicted from characteristics of the spouses is also used as a robustness check. Combining information gleaned from current occupations, earlier occupations, and synthetic distances demonstrates that spouses’ joint choices of occupations explains marital stability, i.e., divorce behavior. Moreover, the effects of distance measures on divorce probability are evident among single and dual earner households, among the sub sample of households in which neither spouse has changed occupations since marriage, and are robust to all of these methods for treating missing data on single earners. The paper does not make causal claims about occupations and divorce, since our model does not simulate random assignment to jobs or spouses, but it is defensible that occupational dissimilarity measures contain information orthogonal to the other factors that might influence the labor force participation-marital stability relationship. Our results should be read as adding explanatory power to empirical divorce models, with the correlations signed as theory predicts. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on marital dissolution, as well as the related literature on spousal matching. Section 3 discusses the construction of occupational distance measures. Section 4 discusses the data and methods used in the present examination of marriage and marital dissolution, and the empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.",1

They argue that the development of new information and communication technologies accelerates skill obsolescence and reduces therefore both the labor demand and the labor supply of older workers. Little attention has been paid to the impact of technical change on retirement intentions, particularly when it is possible to update the worker’s skills. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. We investigate how technological change may affect the intended exit age of older workers, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. We underline the major role of productivity as a determinant of the worker’s retirement intentions. The originality of this work consists in showing that technological progress can actually delay the retirement decision of a worker if the worker’s skills are updated (via on-the-job training) by the firm. Our paper combines two streams of literature. On the one hand, our work is based on papers analyzing the retirement decision of workers. On the other hand, we employ all the literature interested in on-the-job training issues. The most recent literature dealing with retirement decision issues focuses on the demand side, and more precisely, on the impact of technological changes on hirings, firings or the share of seniors in the workforce (see Aubert et al. (2006) for France or Borghans and Weel (2002) for the UK). Ljunqvist and Sargent (2008), Cheron et al. (2013) and Saint-Paul (2009) support the view that it is not in the interest of firms to invest in workers having a short working horizon. Langot and Moreno-Galbis (2013) find that for homogeneous productivity workers, only positions occupied by young workers are updated. In contrast, when considering heterogeneous productivity workers, it might be in the interest of the firm to update positions occupied by high productivity workers in spite of being old. Considering productivity issues allows the authors to account for heterogeneous situations within a given age cohort. In our contribution, productivity differentials among older workers determine their heterogeneous retirement decisions, i.e. we focus on the supply side, rather than on the demand. Productivity differentials arising after the shift in the technological frontier come from heterogeneous training policies: in some jobs workers’ skill are updated after a technological change while in some other jobs they are not. We are not the first to analyze the retirement decision from the supply side. Using US data, Bartel and Sichermann (1993) show that workers in industries with higher average rates of technological change retire later than workers in industries with lower rates of technological progress, since they prefer to smooth the human capital investment they made. On the other hand, an unexpected increase in the rate of technological change induces earlier retirement, since workers do not have the required skills, and due to their short working horizon, they are not motivated to invest in human capital formation. Ahituv and Zeira (2011) suggest another interpretation. They consider that technical progress is made up of an aggregate part, which affects all sectors and a specific part that hits only one sector. They show that the specific part of technical progress has a positive and significant effect on the probability of not working among older workers. This effect may correspond to the standard skill obsolescence effect. In contrast, aggregate technical progress implies an increase in wages, encouraging therefore older workers to delay their retirement age. Using US data, Friedberg (2003) argues that age is not enough to explain why older workers use computers less. Impending retirement, which reduces the time horizon to recoup an investment in new skills, appears to play a major role. The importance of the working horizon on the retirement choices made by workers is also underlined by Hairault et al. (2010). They estimate that the shorter the distance to retirement (whatever the age of the worker), the lower the probability of being employed. This distance effect becomes active from ten years before retirement. Concerning the literature interested in the impact of on-the-job training on the relationship between productivity growth and employment decisions, as remarked by Acemoglu and Pischke (1998), all workers’ types can benefit from changes in the demand for skills induced by technological progress if they receive training. Bresnahan et al. (2002) conclude that the increased use of information and communication technologies (ICT), changes in organization practices and changes in products and services, taken together are the skill-biased technological progress that calls for a higher skilled labor mix and thus for an increased importance of training.1 Jobs are on average more and more complex. Computerization is associated with a decline in the demand for routine manual and cognitive tasks and with an increase in the demand for non-routine abstract tasks requiring a wider human capital.2 The interplay between technological changes and training is analyzed by Chari and Hopenhayn (1991), who study the lag between the appearance of a technology and its peak usage in an OLG model with ongoing technological change and investment in technology-specific human capital. The interactions between learning by doing, technological choices and the timing of adoption of new technologies are also analyzed in Parente (1994) and Jovanovic and Nyarko (1996). Carre and Drouot (2004) consider a Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) model to analyze how the change in the nature of technological progress modifies on-the-job learning and, through general equilibrium effects, unemployment and wage dispersion. Finally, Moreno-Galbis (2012) shows that, by introducing human capital issues, such as heterogeneous skills, human capital accumulation, on-the-job training and capital-skill complementarity, in a vintage framework in the style of Mortensen and Pissarides (1998), the impact of productivity growth on unemployment rates is magnified. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, from a theoretical point of view, we combine an overlapping generations model à la Michel and Pestieau (2000) with a technological diffusion process similar to that proposed in Ahituv and Zeira (2011). However, we introduce the possibility of skill updating (on-the-job training) in some types of jobs and analyze how training modifies retirement decisions in case of technological change. We consider a single generation of individuals that lives two periods. Individuals work during the first period and must choose whether to work or not (early retirement) and the number of years they work during the second period.3 Numerical simulations permit to better understand the retirement choices of people employed in heterogeneous types of jobs in case of change in the state of technology. The second contribution of the paper consists in focusing on the relationship between productivity and senior’s employment from the supply side (instead of the demand side, as most of the literature). We exploit a unique cross-sectional French database drawn from the survey Passage à la retraite (“Transitions from work to retirement”) conducted in 2006 that contains information about the intended retirement age of respondents aged between 50 and 69. To investigate the effect of technical change and on-the-job training on retirement intentions, we use the Changements Organisationnels et Informatisation survey (COI, “Organizational Changes and Computerization” survey) conducted in the same year and construct aggregate variables within a local labor market, made up of a specific industry and occupation. Using such recent databases constitutes a great advantage with respect to the existing literature on the subject, since by 2006 there was no incertitude concerning the diffusion process of new technologies among occupations. The main findings of our paper can be summarized as follows. The theoretical framework and numerical simulations predict that workers whose productivity is improved together with the state of technology (by means of on-the-job training) tend to retire later than workers who do not receive training and bear a relative skill obsolescence in case of technological change. These findings are confirmed by our empirical results. In case of technological change, workers employed in jobs displaying a high average training rate plan to retire later than those occupying jobs with a low average training rate. Our findings suggest that on-the-job training may effectively dampen the age bias associated with technical progress. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the assumptions and the agent’s behavior of our theoretical model. Section 3 analyzes the model’s predictions by means of numerical simulations. Data and descriptive statistics are displayed in section 4. Section 5 describes the econometric methodology and the results. Section 6 concludes.",3
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,15 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-3-7,Affirmative action and university fit: evidence from Proposition 209,December 2014,Peter Arcidiacono,Esteban Aucejo,V Joseph Hotz,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past several years, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken up and decided several cases concerning the constitutionality of race-based preferences (affirmative action) in university admissions1. One of the arguments opponents of affirmative action have advanced is that affirmative action actually hurts the individuals it is supposed to help – the mismatch hypothesis. According to the mismatch hypothesis, affirmative action in admissions actually results in worse outcomes for minority students as students admitted under affirmative action are attending colleges where the curriculum is designed for students with significantly stronger credentials2. In this paper we examine the mismatch hypothesis in the context of college graduation rates. As documented in Turner (2004), Bound and Turner (2007, 2011), and Bound et al. (2010), while the number of students attending college has increased over the past three decades in the U.S., college graduation rates (i.e., the fraction of college enrollees that graduate) and college attainment rates (i.e., the fraction of the population with a college degree) have hardly changed since 1970 and the time it takes college students to complete a baccalaureate (BA) degree has increased (Bound et al. 2012). The disparities between the trends in college attendance and completion or time-to-completion of college degrees is all the more stark given that the earnings premium for a college degree relative to a high school degree nearly doubled over this same period (Goldin and Katz 2008). We examine differences in graduation rates and the academic preparation of minority and non-minority students attending the various UC campuses between the years 1995–2000, using a unique source of student-level data that covers the universe of students who applied to one or more of the UC campuses. We obtained these data from the University of California Office of the President, the administrative offices of the entire UC system and refer to them as the ""UCOP"" data. The UCOP data cover a period where race-based preferences were banned in California. In 1996, the voters of California approved Proposition 209 – Prop 209 hereafter – which stipulates that: ""The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting"". The Proposition took effect in 1998. Using these student-level data, we find evidence that the graduation rates of minorities increased after Prop 209 was implemented. Indeed, the data reveal that under-represented minorities were 4.4 percentage points more likely to graduate in the period after Prop 209 that the period before3. We also find that the distribution of minorities entering the UC system shifted from its more selective campuses (e.g., UC Berkeley and UCLA) towards its less selective ones. Moreover, while there was an overall improvement in the academic preparation of minorities enrolling at UC campuses after Prop 209 went into effect, the greatest improvements occurred at the less-selective campuses. Taken together, this evidence may be consistent with the mismatch hypothesis noted above. As we argue below, the scope for the mismatch of students to campuses with affirmative action and its alleviation with bans on its use hinges on whether some campuses, presumably less-selective ones, are better-suited to produce positive outcomes, e.g., graduation rates, for less-prepared students while other universities, typically more-selective ones, are better-suited for more-prepared students. In contrast, if more-selective universities were able to produce better outcomes, such as graduation rates, for students of all levels of preparation than less-selective ones, then there is no scope for student-university mismatch. Bans on affirmative action would not be expected to improve the graduation rates of minority students, especially those with weaker backgrounds. We formalize these arguments below, characterizing and estimating graduation production functions for each of the UC campuses and examining whether and how they differ across campuses. The student-level UCOP data we examine also reveal that after Prop 209 there was a decline in the number of under-represented minorities enrolled at one of the UC campuses. And, if the minority students who did not attend a UC campus after Prop 209 were the least prepared, then graduation rates would have likely risen, regardless of the campus they would have attended. That is, Prop 209 may have induced a significant selection effect on minority enrollments within the UC system that would provide an alternative explanation to mismatch for why minority graduation rates improved. To separate mismatch and selection explanations for the post-Prop 209 minority graduation rate increases, we exploit the richness of the UCOP data on cohorts of students that entered the UC system before and after Prop 209. These data contain measures of high school GPAs and SAT scores and of parental income and education, which allow us to both control for these factors in evaluating the effects of Prop 209 and assess how they influence minority (and non-minority) graduation probabilities at the various UC campuses. The UCOP data provide information not only on which UC campus a student enrolled (as well as whether they graduated from that campus), but also on the other UC campuses to which they applied and the ones to which they were admitted. We use the information on the UC campuses to which students were admitted, and the quality of those UC campuses, to implement a modified version of the method used in Dale and Krueger (2002) to control for student qualifications beyond those measured by high school GPA and test scores. We decompose the post-Prop 209 change in minority graduation rates into three components: better matching, better students, and a third, residual, category of post-Prop 209 change in graduation rates not accounted for by the matching or selection. We refer to the latter (residual) component as other behavioral responses to the Prop 209 affirmative action ban. While we cannot directly characterize them, these behavioral responses could have been the results of universities investing more in their students and/or changes made by minority students that improved their college academic outcomes. We find that better matching explains around 18% of the improvement in minority graduation rates within the UC system. However, this relatively small overall effect masks two notable phenomena related to the potential role of matching. First, we find that matching is much more important in accounting for the graduation gains of students in the bottom of the academic preparedness distribution. Second, as we discuss in Section 7, Arcidiacono et al. (2013) find that improved matching played a much more prominent role in improved graduation rates of minorities who initially enrolled at UC campuses in STEM (Science, Technology and Engineering) majors, especially in the higher rates that minorities who started in STEM majors actually graduated with a STEM degree. We find that between 18% and 59% of the minority graduation rate increase is due to changes in student characteristics, both observed and unobserved, of those enrolled in the UC system after Prop 209. We note that the changes in the characteristics of minority enrollees post-209 are not all in the same direction. While some measures of preparation were higher in the post Prop 209 period (high school grades and SAT scores) other measures actually fell (parental income and parental education). Hence, the pool of minority enrollees actually became more diverse from a socioeconomic perspective4. Finally, somewhere between 23% and 64% of the minority graduation gains cannot be explained either by selection or matching. There is some evidence that this residual consist of behavioral responses to Prop 209. Below, we present anecdotal evidence that suggests that universities responded to Prop 209 by focusing more resources on the retention of their enrolled students, especially minorities and/or students from disadvantaged background, to increase their retention and graduation rates. And with respect to changes in the academic performance of minority students attending UC campuses, research by Antonovics and Sander (2013) on enrollments conditional on admittance suggests the possibility that minorities may have felt more comfortable at universities where professors and peers know that they were admitted on the basis of academic credentials and not their race or ethnicity. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the UCOP data and present the unadjusted levels and post-Prop 209 changes in minority and white student enrollments, measures of their academic preparation and their graduation rates. In Section 3 we examine how much of the increased graduation rates for the UC system as a whole remain after accounting for changes in observables. After showing that a substantial portion of the graduation gap is unexplained, in Section 4 we characterize the mismatch hypothesis and establish the conditions it requires in terms of the differences across colleges in their capacity to produce graduates with disparate academic preparation. In Section 5 we develop and estimate a model of college graduation that embeds campus-specific graduation production functions that depend on student preparation using only data in the pre-Prop 209 period. The estimates in Section 5 serve as one of the inputs of the decomposition of the changes in graduation rates after Prop 209. Section 6 decomposes the increased graduation rates following Prop 209, focusing in particular on the roles of better matching, changes in the selection of students who enrolled in the UC system, and behavioral responses to Prop 209. Section 7 concludes.",16
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,29 August 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-3-6,Why do wages become more rigid during a recession than during a boom?,December 2014,Izumi Yokoyama,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"When unemployed workers are available, firms do not cut wages until the excess supply is eliminated, which is unexpected in the ideal market scenario depicted by the conventional theory. This phenomenon has puzzled economists, and a number of studies have attempted to understand it. Noteworthy among these studies is the work of Bewley (1999), whose commendable field research provided a clue to the cause of the phenomenon. In his research, Bewley (1999) found that no existing theories on wage rigidity correctly explained his findings in the “real” U.S. labor market, which implied the need for a new theoretical model. Research on wage rigidity during a recession is important for many reasons, one of which is that wages during a recession can help reduce high unemployment rates. Theoretically, firms could hire more people by paying lower wages to existing workers, and if wages are not decreased during a recession it may prevent new workers from being hired. Thus, if there is a particular reason why wages are not decreased during a recession, it would be worthwhile to understand the possible sources of such wage rigidity. In this study, I explore the mechanism by which nominal wages become downwardly rigid during a recession (but not during a boom) by showing that firms have reason to resist cutting nominal pay during a recession. I adopted a model in which firms decide the intensity of performance-based layoffs based on market conditions. Consequently, in my model, layoffs occur only during recessions.1 By adopting this setting, unlike the typical efficiency wage models such as in Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Sparks (1986), wherein an equilibrium with no dismissal is derived, I was able to answer the question: Why do wages not fall during recessions in which firms lay off many workers?2 Recently, performance-based pay has been employed in many countries. For example Lemieux et al. (2009) showed that, in the U.S., the proportion of performance-paid jobs is increasing. Moreover, the “pay-for-performance” system has become widespread in many countries since the 1990s. This is particularly so in Japan, where most employees traditionally receive a substantial portion of their pay in the form of bonuses. The amount paid as a bonus generally fluctuates depending on the firm’s and the worker’s performances. Thus, particularly for countries such as Japan, it is important to assume performance-based pay rather than fixed wages. Given this scenario, the model presented in this study divides a worker’s total compensation into two components: a fixed component (regular pay) and a performance-based pay component (bonus). This division makes it possible to determine how each component contributes to wage rigidity during a recession. According to Bewley (1999), the key reason for a firm’s reluctance to cut wages is the belief that nominal wage cuts damage worker morale. This finding implies that, while modeling nominal downward wage rigidity, it might be better to allow wages to positively affect worker performance. The model presented in this study allows interactions between wages and workers’ efforts both over and within periods. Since a fixed component and a performance-based pay component play different roles in inducing high levels of effort in a multiple-period model setting, throughout this paper, the different ways that the two components contribute to wage rigidity are explained. The main results obtained from the theoretical model are as follows: (a) performance-based layoffs are more likely to occur when the layoff costs and the output price are low; (b) regular pay is likely to be downwardly rigid during periods in which performance-based layoffs occur; and (c) bonuses move proportionally to the output price. The rationale behind result (c) is as follows: During a recession, the lower value of productivity discourages firms from maintaining workers’ current incentives at high levels, which results in lower bonuses during these periods. As a result, wages during recessions also become “rigid” (inflexible) with respect to performance. To test the theoretical implications obtained from the model, an empirical analysis is conducted using Japanese panel data from the Keio Household Panel Survey (KHPS), 2004–2007. The empirical part consists of the following two steps: The first step is a layoff regression, which is employed to confirm whether performance-based layoffs are more likely to occur during a recession when the output price is low and for non-union workers whose performance-based layoff costs are relatively low. The second step is a wage regression. This step shows that regular pay becomes downwardly rigid when performance-based layoffs are likely to occur, and that bonuses move proportionally to the output price. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the framework of the basic model. Section 3 presents an empirical strategy to test the implications of the theoretical model. Section 4 provides a brief description of the data, and Section 5 discusses the results from the empirical analysis. Section 6 presents the conclusion.",1

3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,24 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-8997-3-4,Are nonprofit entrepreneurs also Jacks-of-all-trades?,December 2014,Insoo Cho,Peter F Orazem,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In contrast with for-profit firms, nonprofit entrepreneurs are legally prohibited from taking profit from their operations. Despite this constraint on profit distributions, many individuals devote their entrepreneurial talents to founding and operating nonprofit firms. One explanation advanced for the existence of nonprofit firms contends that in markets where the customer requires unverifiable service quality, customers will attach more credibility to promised quality from providers that are not motivated by profit (Hansmann 1980; Easley and O’Hara 1983; Holtmann 1983; Chillemi and Gui 1991; Mark 1996; Bilodeau and Slivinski 1998; Glaeser and Shleifer 2001)1. A second explanation attributes willingness to provide public goods at less than the opportunity cost of time, as with pro bono or legal aid services, to utility from doing work in the public interest (Weisbrod 1983; Preston 1989; Roomkin and Weisbrod 1999; Ghatak and Mueller 2011). Similarly, willingness to provide these services could be due to non-pecuniary motives such as altruism or philanthropy (Hansmann 1980; Young 1986; James 1987; Gassler 1998). Finally, provision of public goods may be a means to exploit tax advantages (Weisbrod 1983). To date, little attention has been paid to the role of entrepreneurial ability in nonprofit service provision except for the argument that career experiences may lower the cost of nonprofit entrepreneurship (Bilodeau and Slivinski 1996; Lakdawalla and Philipson 2006). Lazear (2004, 2005) advanced the “Jacks-of-All-Trades” theory of entrepreneurship. By exploiting returns to scale from entrepreneurial talent, the earnings from the owner’s share of firm profits can dominate earnings expected from working for someone else. The main implication is that the pattern of human capital investment differs across entrepreneurs and those in paid employment—entrepreneurs acquire more varied skills necessary to run a business while those they employ specialize in more occupation-specific and narrowly focused skills. Several studies have provided empirical evidence that for-profit entrepreneurs are generalists with diverse skills, whereas paid workers are specialists (e.g., Wagner 2003, 2006; Silva 2007; Åstebro and Thompson 2011; Stuetzer et al. 2013; Lechmann and Schnabel 2014)2. Exceptions are the study by Hartog et al. (2010) who find that variety of skill sets does not affect the choice for entrepreneurship but positively affects entrepreneurial income and the study by Hessels et al. (2014) who find contradictory results between several measures of variety of skill sets and business startups among nascent entrepreneurs. Lazear’s Jacks-of-all-trades theory focuses on monetary compensation as the motivation for choosing entrepreneurship. However, studies commonly find that entrepreneurs earn less than what they could earn as salaried employees (Hamilton 2000; Åstebro and Thompson 2011) or on similarly risky common stock (Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen 2002). Hamilton (2000) explained entrepreneurs’ lower lifetime earnings by a presumed hedonic return from business ownership. Åstebro and Thompson (2011) argue that entrepreneurs have a taste for variety for which they are willing to pay with lower earnings. Consistent with these arguments, Benz and Frey (2004, 2007) found that the self-employed had higher job satisfaction than employees because of their greater independence. Benz (2009) argues that when non-pecuniary factors are added as an additional return to entrepreneurship into Lazear’s model, entrepreneurship is best characterized as a nonprofit-seeking activity3. There may be a possible link between varied career experience and entrepreneurship simply because those who are less risk averse are more likely to change their jobs and more likely to become entrepreneurs (Åstebro and Thompson 2011) or because those with lower ability are more likely to change their jobs and thus more likely to enter self-employment (Evans and Leighton 1989). However, Åstebro and Thompson (2011) do not find any significant correlation between lower unobserved ability and earnings or entrepreneurship. Although there are different views about the issue on whether entrepreneurship is a profit- or nonprofit-seeking activity, the diversity of skill sets from the Lazear’s Jacks-of-all-trades theory in itself is important to understand the nature of entrepreneurial human capital. This is because taking non-monetary benefits into account does not change the central prediction that entrepreneurs should be generalists whereas employees should be specialists. Diverse skill sets are essential for running an efficient operation, whether it is to maximize profit from market sales or to minimize costs of producing the desired level of a public good. Even if an employer places a value more on non-pecuniary benefits from entrepreneurship, his business should continue to grow or at least remain in business so that he can get nonmonetary utility from entrepreneurship. To do so, he would have to exploit his entrepreneurial talent. In this view, the diverse skill sets should be considered important for both nonprofit and for-profit settings. Accordingly, we predict that diverse skills should have a positive effect on the choice of both nonprofit and for-profit startups over the alternative of working for someone else. This study investigates whether nonprofit and for-profit entrepreneurs share similar observable and unobservable skills. Observable entrepreneurial skill is presumed to be indicated by more diverse time investments in educational and labor market skills. We further test whether unobservable entrepreneurial skills that are presumed to be important in for-profit ventures are important for nonprofit ventures as well. We test the hypotheses using data drawn from a random sample of 25,000 Iowa State University (ISU) alumni who graduated between 1982 and 2006 with a Bachelor’s degree. We first confirm that for-profit entrepreneurs are generalists with more occupational diversity while paid-employees are specialists, consistent with Lazear (2005). Furthermore, our empirical finding shows that a more diverse skill set increases the choice of nonprofit start-ups, supporting our hypothesis that nonprofit entrepreneurs are also “Jacks-of-All-Trades”. Lastly, we find that unobserved factors that jointly affect for-profit and nonprofit startups are positively correlated, consistent with the presence of a common observed entrepreneurial skill that leads to both for-profit and nonprofit entrepreneurial success. Our study suggests that nonprofit entrepreneurs are drawn from a common pool of entrepreneurial talents that are valuable in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. Although the motivations between for-profit and nonprofit startups may differ, the skill sets are similar. People who are atypically more likely to start a for-profit business given their observable skills are also more likely to start a nonprofit enterprise, and vice versa. Hence, our results suggest that public policies aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship should focus on providing diverse skills and experiences. However, entrepreneurial training need not differ between for-profit and nonprofit entrepreneurs as the two sectors will draw from the same pool of entrepreneurial talent.",1

Thus, the ‘partial’ effects of school quality on academicoutcomes corresponding to production function parameters may differ from empiricalestimates of the ‘total’ effects (which include effects via effortresponse). This is similar to the distinction between production function parametersand average policy effects in Todd and Wolpin (2003) wherefamily inputs are allowed to respond to changes in school quality. From a policy point of view, both the total and partial effects of an increase inschool quality are of interest. The total effect on student achievement is of courseimportant for policy makers: An intervention aimed at improving student academicoutcomes will typically be considered a success if the goal is achieved, and afailure otherwise (irrespective of specific mechanisms, including possible effortresponse). However, the partial effect on achievement (holding effort constant) isalso important, since it provides knowledge of education production functionparameters and the mechanisms through which an intervention works (or why it doesnot work). Furthermore, if students respond to an intervention which increasesschool quality by reducing time and effort devoted to study, benefit-cost analysisthat only have total effects as benefit will underestimate ‘full’benefits. These include, inter alia, more leisure, increased earnings frommarket work and less need for intervention by parents. In the formal model of thispaper we focus on educational outcomes and student leisure, but benefits are muchwider than that. Empirical estimates of class size effects are often rather small and insignificant.Reasons for this may be non-random sorting of students into schools and that schoolsreduce class size when students are more ‘disruptive’ (Lazear 2001). Another explanation may be that students typicallyreduce effort in response to a reduction in class size. A few papers model and estimate the response of parental inputs to changes in schoolquality. Houtenville and Conway (2008) consider a theoreticalmodel in which student achievement depends on parental effort and school resources,and parents maximize utility, which is a function of student achievement, leisureand consumption, subject to time and budget constraints. In this model, an increasein school resources may induce parents to increase or reduce their effort dependingon the form of the utility and production functions. Their empirical analysisindicates that parental effort and per-student spending have positive effects onstudent achievement, and that some measures of parental effort are affectednegatively by per-student spending. However, the estimated effect of per-studentspending on achievement is not affected by whether or not parental effort isincluded in the model. A similar result is found in Datar and Mason (2008): controlling for parental involvement does not change estimatedeffects of class size on test scores for children in kindergarten and first grade.Bonesrønning (2004) finds zero or positive effects onparental effort of reducing class size. Das et al. (2011) consider a dynamic household optimization model where child testscores depend on school and household inputs. Assuming that households makedecisions regarding their own inputs before they know the amount of school inputs,they are only able to respond to anticipated changes in school inputs. Using datafrom Zambia and India the authors find that household school expenditure is reducedwhen anticipated school grants are increased, and that anticipated grants have noeffect on student test scores whereas unanticipated grants have significant positiveeffects. Only very few papers consider models of student response to changes in schoolquality. In the theoretical model of De Fraja et al. (2010) student effort, parental effort and school effort aresimultaneously determined as a Nash equilibrium. In this very general model, achange in an exogenous variable, e.g. an increase in school resources, may increaseor reduce the equilibrium level of effort of students (and parents and schools)depending on the form of the utility and education production functions and thevalues of exogenous variables. In their empirical analysis, the measure of studenteffort is based on (a factor analysis of) general attitude variables such as whetherstudents like school, whether they think homework is boring and whether they want toleave school. The authors do not find any significant effect of class size on theirmeasure of student effort, but they do find that student effort is reduced when‘school effort’ is increased, where school effort is based on (a factoranalysis of mainly) whether streaming and disciplinary methods are used. They findthat student and parental effort are positively correlated (where parental effort isbased on a factor analysis of mainly the teacher’s opinion of parents’interest in their child’s education) and that class size has no effect onparental effort. The attitudinal variables used by De Fraja et al. (2010) may be poor proxies for effort or time spent on homework,and they may not be expected to be much affected by (marginal) changes in schoolresources. Furthermore, the authors ignore the important issue of the endogeneity ofclass size and assume observed class size variation to be exogenous. These problemsmay explain why they do not find any effect of class size on their measure ofstudent effort. Using quasi-experimental variation in class size, a recent study estimates studentand parental response to class size in grades 4-6 (Fredriksson P, Öckert N,Oosterbeek H: Inside the black box of class size effects: Behavioral responses toclass size variation, unpublished). Their measures of student effort are time spenton homework and reading outside school. In their theoretical model (based onAlbornoz F, Berlinski S, Cabrales A: Motivation, resources and the organization ofthe school system, unpublished), the education production function determinesstudent skills as the product of student ability and student effort, so class sizeonly affects student skills through student effort. They assume that student utilitydepends on student effort and ‘rewards to effort’ which are determinedby parents’ and teachers’ utility maximizing behaviour. In their model,class size always has a negative effect on student effort, but a non-negative effecton parental effort. In this paper we consider a theoretical parametric model whichincludes a more general education production function and a more flexible studentutility function, which depends on an educational outcome and effort, in order toanalyse how student response to a change in school quality may depend on the valuesof important parameters of the production and utility functions. We ignore parentalresponse to a change in school quality. This simplification is more appropriate whenconsidering older students (e.g. 15-year-olds). Some papers estimating the effects of course-specific (or subject-specific) schoolquality inputs on student academic outcomes provide indirectly an indication thatstudents’ change of effort in response to changes in school quality may beimportant. Aaronson et al. (2007) estimate the effectof teacher quality and find, e.g., statistically significant effects of mathematicsteachers on mathematics test scores, but also significant effects of Englishteachers on mathematics test scores (and of mathematics teachers on English testscores). Heinesen (2010) estimates significant negativeeffects of subject-specific class size on examination marks in the same subject, butthe results also indicate negative effects on marks in other subjects. Oneinterpretation of the effects of subject-specific school inputs on student outcomesin other subjects is that they are due to spill-over effects between subjectsinduced by student reallocation of effort between subjects. In this paper we consider simple parametric models with endogenous student effort andshow that students’ responses to changes in their school quality could implyquite large differences between total and partial effects on academic outcomes ofchanges in school quality and could lead to empirical estimates of total effectswhich are either larger or smaller than corresponding partial effects. The mainparameters governing the sign of the difference between total and partial effectsare shown to be the extent of substitution in the education production function andhow kinked is the benefit from a higher mark. The absolute value of the differencealso depends on the student’s distaste for effort, the curvature of the‘production’ of the final mark with respect to effort and thestudent’s ability in the course of study. Our main conclusion is that reliableestimates of the partial effect of school quality on academic outcomes requiresinformation on academic effort, including time use. This suggests a new round ofdata collection.",

A popular belief presumes that the majority of people would quit work if they won a lottery. But do windfall gains have an impact on individuals’ working hours? According to the life-cycle model, a relaxation or tightening of the consumer’s intertemporal budget constraint can lead to changes in labour supply. Windfall gains represent an unanticipated increase in non-earned income and, by reducing the marginal utility of wealth, they diminish the agent’s incentive to work. While the literature on the empirical and theoretical inter-temporal substitution effects in labour supply is well established (Heckman and MaCurdy 1980), the research on the impact of capital gains is still somewhat insipient, despite the fact that lottery winnings are a source of exogenous variation in income (Altonji 1986). In the US, Kaplan (1988) shows that the level of education and the type of profession can help explain the share of winners that choose to continue to work. Holtz-Eakin et al. (1993) and Imbens et al. (2001) find that windfall gains reduce working hours or even lead to a withdrawal from the labour force (especially, in the case of older individuals). In contrast, Joulfaian and Wilhelm (1994) suggest, at most, a small (although significant) effect of inheritances on labour supply of married women and men. In Europe, Burke et al. (1997) evaluate the effects of inheritances on the job creation of self-employment enterprises, and show that it plays an important role. Blanchflower and Oswald (1998) use data for the UK and argue that individuals receiving inheritances are more likely to be self-employed than those not receiving an inheritance. This is also expressed in the large fraction of individuals who do not become self-employed because of their inability to raise the necessary financial resources. Also for the UK, Taylor (2001) reports a positive effect of windfall gains (inheritance and lottery wins) on the probability of entering self-employment. The author emphasizes that liquidity constraints can be detrimental for starting a new business, for the growth of entrepreneurships and for the success of small businesses. Henley (2004) analyzes the impact of both windfall financial gains and house price shocks on hours worked, and suggests that there are significant substitution effects, in particular, in response to house price shocks. In this paper, we analyses the linkages between windfall gains and working hours using data from the European Community Household Panel Longitudinal Users’ Database. In accordance with the life-cycle model, we show that an unanticipated rise in wealth reduces working hours, although the effect is, in general, small. The impact of windfall gains is stronger at the external margin, that is, individuals adjust their labour supply primarily by dropping out of the labour force, rather than by reducing their working hours, conditional on working. We also assess whether the size of the windfall gain matters, i.e. we evaluate how working hours respond to small, medium and large windfall gains. We find that the effects become stronger as the size of the windfall increases. In particular, men receiving a windfall of 50,000 EUR or more, on average reduce labour supply by 1.3 hours per week, which is equivalent to a 3.4% reduction in working hours. Finally, analysing the effects of windfall gains along various personal characteristics, we show that: (i) at younger and older ages, the effect of windfall gains on labour supply is the most negative; (ii) for married people and people with young children, the windfall gain leads to a stronger decrease in working hours; and (iii) for single individuals at the age of around 40, the effect can be positive. A potential explanation for the latter finding is the effect of windfall gains on reducing liquidity constraints. By doing so, windfall gains may encourage people to set up their own businesses, become self-employed and increase their working hours. Alternatively, in the light of the fact that richer families are more likely to give inheritances, individuals from richer families may also be more likely to start their own businesses. We contribute to the literature in following ways. First, we analyse the effects of windfall gains on working hours using data for a set of European countries, rather than focusing on one-country data. Second, we include 15 countries in our framework and, therefore, the sample of people for which we observe windfall gains is large, offering a further empirical advantage to our approach. Third, with the panel dataset, we observe a rich set of personal characteristics of individuals. This gives us an opportunity to better understand the ways that participation and working-hours decisions differ between individuals. Finally, given that the panel dataset covers a relatively long sample period, we can account for the time-variation in labour supply, a feature that would not be captured in a cross-sectional study. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 presents the econometric approach. Section 4 discusses the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",9

Addison,McKinley L. Blackburn,Chad D. Cotti,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In a critique of recent contributions to the literature on minimum wages, Neumark et al. (2014) have questioned the usefulness of common approaches to controlling for spatial heterogeneity in employment equations. In this project we attempt to conduct a fair arbitration regarding a contentious current dispute in the minimum wage literature regarding measurement and specification, with a focus on evaluating current empirical issues that may question the sensitivity of results from our earlier work on the topic (Addison et al. [hereafter ABC] (2012)). In the process, we also address an alternative critique having a basis in the notion that minimum wage effects are more easily detected in employment growth than in employment levels, such that conventional controls for spatial heterogeneity may attenuate estimates of how the minimum wage affects the level of employment (Meer and West 2013). The wider backdrop to the present analysis is a recent meta-analysis by Belman and Wolfson (2014) of 23 modern minimum-wage studies, which controlled for study differences and concluded that minimum wages have no economically or statistically meaningful disemployment effects.Footnote 1
 Using a large sample of county-level employment data, ABC estimated the effect of minimum wages on employment in the restaurant-and-bar sector, 1990–2005. In addition to time and county fixed effects, the authors’ model included a county-specific effect allowed to follow a linear trend over time (along with county-level controls) in a framework that permitted the investigators to assess the consistency of the estimates with a competitive-model explanation of employment and earnings determination. In general, ABC concluded that minimum wages did not reduce employment in a sector that contains the highest percentage of workers at or below the relevant minimum wage in the United States and in which a little over 40 percent of workers worked for the minimum wage plus two dollars or less. The authors argued that their estimates could be considered largely consistent with a competitive model in which the elasticity of demand for labor was very small. In the present paper, we seek to evaluate the robustness of the results presented in ABC allowing for more flexible time trends, updating the sample period, and modeling employment changes as well as employment levels. The goal of the exercise is fundamentally to determine what can be learned from the recent debate surrounding the sensitivity of past results in light of new concerns surrounding the importance of alternative empirical approaches, much of which is to be viewed as constructive and productive of research progress. Overall, we view our empirical evidence as still consistent with minimum wage employment effects that are quite small or nonexistent.",20
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,10 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-015-0040-6,Differential effects of graduating during a recession across gender and race,December 2015,Ayako Kondo,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Recent studies have established that entering the labor market during a recession has long-term negative effects on subsequent wages and career paths for white male college graduates (Genda et al. 2010; Kahn 2010; Oreopoulos et al. 2012). It is also known that, in the United Sates, the initial impact of a recession at entry on earnings immediately after graduation is stronger for high school graduates than for college graduates, but this negative effect diminishes quickly (Genda et al. 2010; Speer 2015). However, there is limited evidence regarding the long-term consequences of shocks at entry for women, and similar evidence for any racial minority is even scarcer. Compared to white men, women have a weaker attachment to the labor force, and blacks are more vulnerable to contemporaneous labor market conditions. Therefore, the effects of the early labor market experience may be quite different for women and blacks than for white men. Economic theories predict that the negative effect of a recession at entry to the labor market on subsequent wages is more persistent for demographic groups who have strong labor force attachment and are less likely to be dismissed. This is because the advantage of obtaining a high-wage job at entry is lost when the worker quits due to exogenous reasons or is dismissed. Since women are more likely to quit for family reasons, the negative effect of a recession at entry is expected to be weaker and less persistent for women than for men. In addition, since blacks are more likely to become unemployed in recessions after entry,1 the negative effect of entering the labor market during such periods may be less persistent for them, although the initial impact of a recession is expected to be stronger. Motivated by these theoretical predictions, I examine how the effect of the unemployment rate at entry to the labor market on subsequent wages differs across race and gender. Specifically, I compare the effect for the following four demographic groups: white men, white women, black men, and black women. The main data source is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 (NLSY79). To control for nation-wide cohort effects, I exploit variations in unemployment rates across states, with controls for state-fixed effects. I also address the endogenous determination of time and location of entry by using an instrumental variable based on the predicted timing of entry and the state of residence at age 14.2 I find a weaker effect of a recession at entry for women than for men. However, I do not find strong evidence for the differential effect across race. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the differential effect of labor market conditions at entry across race. However, it is not the first study to examine the effect of labor market conditions experienced at youth for women.3 Hershbein (2012) compares high school-educated men and women in the United States. He finds that the long-term effects of graduating high school in a recession on wages are minimal for women and that young women who face adverse labor market conditions temporarily reduce labor supply and substitute into home production.4 I believe this study complements that of Hershbein (2012) because my approach is different from his. First, while Hershbein (2012) focuses on the effect of the unemployment rate at high school graduation for all individuals including those who proceed to college, I focus on the effect of the unemployment rate in the last year of enrollment. Furthermore, I measure differences across and within racial groups. In addition, methodologically, Hershbein (2012) uses the national unemployment rate as the explanatory variable, whereas I use the state unemployment rate and control for state fixed effects and nationwide year effects. The comparison between whites and blacks is closely related to the literature on the differential effects of a recession at entry across groups with different skill levels and educational backgrounds. In particular, Kahn (2010); Speer (2015) are most relevant in that both studies use the same dataset and an empirical strategy very similar to this study. Kahn (2010) shows a persistent negative effect of the unemployment rate at graduation on wages for white male college graduates. In contrast, Speer (2015) shows that the initial impact of a recession at graduation on employment and wages is substantial for high school graduates, but these effects diminish quickly. A similar pattern is observed by Genda et al. (2010) using the Current Population Survey (CPS). Blacks are on average less educated than whites are, and racial minorities and less-skilled workers share a similar vulnerability to business cycle conditions. Therefore, theoretically, it is possible that the effect of a recession at entry for blacks and whites is similar to that for high school graduates and college graduates, respectively. However, I do not find as clear a difference between blacks and whites as the existing studies found between college and high school graduates. At the same time, despite the statistical insignificance, the pattern of black-white difference depicted by the point estimates resembles the difference between high school and college graduates to some extent. It is important to keep in mind that whether the effect of labor market conditions at entry is weaker for disadvantaged workers depends on the institutional settings. For example, Genda et al. (2010) show that the effect of high unemployment at graduation is more negative and persistent for high school graduates than for college graduates in Japan. Furthermore, Brunner and Kuhn (2014) show a more negative and persistent effect for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers in Austria. On the other hand, Raaum and Røed (2006) find that the effects of the unemployment rate experienced in youth tend to be more persistent for those with advantaged backgrounds in Norway. Moreover, a recession at entry could increase the incidence of non-employment in subsequent years without affecting the wage rate for less-educated men in countries with a rigid labor market structure such as Belgium (Cockx and Ghirelli 2015) and Spain (Fernández-Kranz and Rodríguez-Planas 2015). Therefore, my findings may not be generalizable to minorities in countries with rigid labor market structures. However, these findings provide useful insights for countries with flexible labor market structures similar to those in the United States. Lastly, this study relates to the broader literature of differential effects of labor market conditions across different demographic groups. Although it is controversial whether an economic upturn benefits economically disadvantaged people as much as the more advantaged,5 there is little doubt that the costs of a downturn are borne disproportionately by the disadvantaged (Clark and Summers 1981; Cutler and Katz 1991; Hines et al. 2001; Hoynes et al. 2012). Studies on cyclical upgrading of the labor force (Devereux 2004; Okun 1973) also suggest that less-skilled workers tend to lose their jobs in recessions, while more-skilled workers tend to move upward to higher-paying jobs in booms. Since the contemporaneous labor market conditions affect blacks significantly (Altonji and Blank 1999), the initial impact of a recession at entry is expected to be stronger for them. On the other hand, however, the vulnerability to aggregate shocks after entry to the labor market may reduce the persistence of a negative shock at entry.",27
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,27 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-015-0038-0,Do employers prefer migrant workers? Evidence from a Chinese job board,December 2015,Peter Kuhn,Kailing Shen,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A common claim in popular discussions of migration is that employers prefer to hire workers with limited residency rights—such as temporary or undocumented migrants—over equally qualified natives, because these migrant workers are willing to work harder, for longer hours, or for less pay. Such claims coexist with others arguing that employers discriminate against migrants, either for taste-based reasons or out of a desire to protect native workers.Footnote 1 Yet despite substantial literatures on the labor market outcomes of temporary and undocumented migrants (e.g., Dustmann 2000, Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark 2002, Kahanec and Shields 2013), it appears that no study has examined employers’ hiring choices between workers with different residency rights in any jurisdiction.Footnote 2
 This paper studies employers’ choices between workers with and without permanent residency rights in a context that has been called the largest migration in human history (Chan, 2013). In 2010, the internal rural migrant population in China’s cities was estimated at 206 million persons, or about two thirds of the entire U.S. population (Chan 2012, Table 1). A noteworthy feature of this migration is that unlike the U.S., and unlike many other developing nations, Chinese people do not have the right to permanently reside in any part of the country. Instead, each person is born with a city or province of permanent registration (hukou). While this does not prevent people from migrating to other jurisdictions for temporary work, it places severe limits on their ability to settle permanently in any location other than the one corresponding to their birth hukou. Since a worker’s hukou status is relatively public information, China’s internal migration system provides a unique laboratory in which to study employers’ preferences between workers with different residency rights. To that end, this paper uses internal data from XMRC, an Internet job board in Xiamen, a medium-sized, prosperous Chinese city, to pose the following question: among equally qualified local hukou (LH, or ‘native’) and non-local hukou (NLH, or ‘migrant’) candidates who have applied for the same job, which applicants are more likely to receive an employer contact? Our main finding is that employers on this job board, which caters to private-sector firms seeking relatively skilled workers, prefer workers without a permanent residence permit over equally-matched permanent residents; specifically, there is a difference in callback rates to the same job of about 0.8 percentage points, or 11 percent. This gap is considerably larger in jobs requiring lower levels of education and in jobs offering lower wages. While migrant-native payroll tax differentials might account for some of this gap, we argue that the observed patterns are hard to explain without some role for a migrant productivity advantage over natives, especially in less skilled jobs. Higher levels of migrant productivity could stem from a number of sources, including positive selection of nonlocals into migration, negative selection of local workers into search for the unskilled private sector jobs that disproportionately employ migrants, efficiency wage effects related to unskilled migrants’ limited access to the urban social safety net, and intertemporal labor and effort substitution by temporary migrants that makes them more desirable workers. In addition to these substantive results, our paper makes three methodological contributions. One is to illustrate the potential of large samples of naturally occurring applications on Internet job boards to study the value of employee characteristics and credentials. Compared to resume audit studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004, Oreopoulos 2011, Kroft et al. 2013), job board data let us study large samples of applications and callbacks at a very low marginal cost.Footnote 3 These large samples allow researchers to generate estimates for a more representative set of jobs and to explore match effects between worker and job attributes in a way that is not practical when one is creating and experimentally manipulating resumes. Naturally occurring job board data also avoids the use of fictitious resumes, which can raise issues of credibility in resume audit studies. Job board data also reveal differences in application behavior between groups, allowing us to estimate the effects of how workers direct their search on their callback rates. For example, we show that migrants’ 11 percent callback advantage relative to equally qualified local applicants to the same job (our analog to the quantity estimated by the resume audit approach) substantially understates their advantage when still controlling for qualifications, but when not conditioning on where they apply. This is because migrants, on average, apply to jobs that are ‘easier to get’ and that pay lower wages relative to their qualifications. More generally, whether workers’ application choices accentuate or mitigate the callback gaps they face within ads has implications for the labor market effects of employers’ callback choices, and cannot be studied with standard resume audit methods. A drawback of naturally-occurring job board data, of course, is the fact that the resume characteristics we study are not randomly assigned. Thus, if employers base callback decisions on worker characteristics they observe but we cannot hold constant, job-board-based estimates of the ‘pure’ effects of any given resume characteristic may be biased. That said, if we evaluate our approach with respect to the same criterion as resume audit studies—specifically, if the goal is to measure how employers react to specific features of a resume—the scope for omitted variable bias with naturally occurring resumes is relatively limited. This is because callback decisions on a job board (as opposed to hiring or pay decisions) are typically made only on the basis of information contained in a worker’s resume. Thus, the only information about applicants that is observed by employers but not controlled for in our regressions are the features of the worker’s online resume that we have not fully been able to code into our vector of control variables. While such aspects (such as formatting, grammar, unusual types of experience, etc.) certainly do exist, they are probably less important than between-group differences in employers’ expectations of workers’ interview and job performance, which are not eliminated by randomizing group membership on resumes.Footnote 4
 A second methodological contribution is to illustrate the importance of the sample of jobs that is used in empirical studies of groups’ relative success in the recruitment process. In particular, job sampling plays a critical role whenever employers (or even jobs) specialize in hiring different types of workers; imagine, for example, a situation where one group of workers has preferential access to ‘good’ (e.g., high wage) jobs, while firms offering ‘bad’ jobs prefer to hire the other worker type.Footnote 5 In such a world, there might be no difference between two groups in their mean chances of getting a job offer, but both the size and sign of the offer or callback gap can depend on the type of job being applied to. Thus, if the sample of jobs surveyed is disproportionately ‘good’ (as it tends to be in existing audit studies) the results will overstate the favored group’s advantage in securing an offer at a randomly selected job. On the other hand, if the sample of jobs is disproportionately ‘bad,’ we might see that the group with worse labor market outcomes overall is preferred by employers. This is arguably what we observe in our data, and it does not necessarily indicate reverse discrimination, or even an absence of discrimination in this labor market. In sum, estimated callback differentials are only relevant to the sample of jobs studied. While this caveat applies both to resume audit studies and to job board studies like ours, it is arguably more important in the former case because of the more restricted sample of jobs for which credible, fictitious resumes can practically be designed. Third, while it is common to hear claims that employers prefer to hire (say) migrant (or female) workers “because they are cheaper,” to our knowledge no existing studies of the hiring process consider the possible effects on callbacks of expected wage differences between workers who are hired in response to the same job ad. Clearly, if employers expect to be able to pay migrants (or women, or minorities) less, this could affect employers’ callback and hiring choices between two equally qualified applicants in a way that has been hard to assess in existing work. In this paper we take two approaches to bounding the effects of this form of (expected) wage discrimination. One is to distinguish between job ads with and without posted wages (since wage discrimination between worker types is arguably more difficult in posted-wage jobs). The other takes advantage of information on the current wages reported by job applicants on their resumes, which should place some bounds on the wages employers will have to pay to hire these workers. In our case, neither method suggests that within-job wage discrimination against migrants can account for their callback advantage. More generally, resume-based data on current wages help to bound the effects of expected within-job wage discrimination on callback rates: a factor that has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Section 2 provides some background on China’s hukou system, both nationally and as it applies to our study city. Section 3 describes our data and methods, while Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 discusses possible explanations of employers’ NLH preferences, while Section 6 concludes.",15

More recently, this literature has focused on majors in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The literature from education focuses on factors such as role models (including parents, teachers, and peers), exposure to math and science courses, and math self-efficacy beliefs; Delaney (2007), Crisp et al. (2009) and Wang (2012) provide surveys of the education literature. Economists have also explored this issue. In a life-cycle utility maximization framework a student’s choice of major depends on the student’s preferences, the cost of completing various majors, the student’s ability, that is, the probability of successfully completing the course of study for various majors, and the expected earnings after graduation (Berger 1988). Montmarquette et al. (2002) extend the model to include uncertainty regarding the successful completing of each major. While the cost of college has been shown to affect the probability of attending college, it has also been found to affect the choice of major; see for example, Stater (2011), Denning and Turley (2013), and Stange (2013). See Arcidiacono (2004), Kinsler and Pavan (2013), Griffith (2010), Beffy et al. (2012), Arcidiacono et al. (2012), and Wiswall and Zafar (2011) for other economic studies of the choice of college major. We consider how Georgia’s merit-based financial aid program, i.e., the HOPE Scholarship, affects student decisions to major in STEM fields. State merit aid programs have grown substantially since the early 1990s, with Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship program adopted in 1993 being among the largest and most notable.1 A large research literature has emerged that examines the effects of these merit aid programs on college outcomes such as enrollment, persistence, completion, and post-college retention in the state.2 One outcome receiving limited attention thus far is the effect of merit aid on college major decisions. We identified three studies that examine the effects of state merit aid programs on college majors. Cornwell et al. (2008) investigate the effect of Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship on the college major choices of freshmen enrolled at the University of Georgia. They find that HOPE significantly increased the probability of majoring in education but find no significant effect of HOPE on other majors. The current paper differs from theirs in two major ways. First, our administrative data includes all 35 public colleges and universities in Georgia, not just one university as with Cornwell et al. (2008). Furthermore, we consider not just freshman major but also the major upon graduation. Zhang (2011) examines the effects of merit aid programs in Florida and Georgia on annual statewide STEM degree conferrals computed from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System’s (IPEDS) Completion Survey. He generally finds statistically insignificant effects of merit aid on the percentage of STEM graduates in each state, with the one exception being a 1.6 percentage point increase for Florida private institutions. However, merit aid programs likely affect where students attend college and have been shown to increase the average academic ability of students in the state. STEM fields require greater academic ability, especially in math, so merit-induced increases in average student quality need to be accounted for, but using aggregate data prevents Zhang from doing so. Sjoquist and Winters (forthcoming) use American Community Survey (ACS) microdata to examine the average effects of merit aid programs across 25 states adopting them since 1991. Their analysis focuses on nine states with relatively large and generous merit aid programs and uses a difference-in-differences (DD) approach, comparing states with and without merit aid programs pre- and post-merit aid adoption. They find that the merit programs in these states substantially reduced the likelihood that an individual earned a degree in a STEM field. Their baseline estimate suggests that strong merit programs reduce the likelihood of earning a STEM degree by 1.3 percentage points (which corresponds to a 6.5 percent decrease in the number of STEM graduates), but alternative specifications suggest that the magnitude could be larger. In this paper we use administrative records from the University System of Georgia (USG) to first examine the effect of Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship on students’ college major choices, focusing on STEM majors. We use a pre- and post-policy time difference identification strategy to estimate the model. Our analysis complements that of Sjoquist and Winters (forthcoming), but the current paper differs from Sjoquist and Winters in several ways. Examining USG administrative data allows us to explore the roles played by factors such as student ability, student performance in college, the transition between initial major and major at graduation, and how the effect on major differs by type of college. Using USG administrative data also offers a more precise measure of treatment than with the ACS, which requires defining treatment based on being born in a state with a merit-aid program at the time the student should have graduated from high school. Finally, Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship is one of the largest and most generous merit aid programs in the nation, and it could have stronger effects than the average effect of the nine strong merit aid programs estimated by Sjoquist and Winters (forthcoming). To preview our results, we find consistent evidence that Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship reduced the probability that a young person would complete a bachelor’s degree with a major in a STEM field. Our baseline specification yields an estimate of a 12.6 percent decrease in the number of STEM graduates, with the effects being larger for males than females. This estimate is larger than that found by Sjoquist and Winters (forthcoming) for their baseline specification, possibly because HOPE is an especially large merit program. The USG data include detailed student information that allows us to take a closer look at this effect than was possible with the ACS data used by Sjoquist and Winters. We are able to consider initial (freshman) major and find that HOPE had no statistically significant effect on the probability of being an initial STEM major for our preferred specification. For earned major we find no effect of HOPE on the probability of being a STEM major if we do not control for student quality; the ability to control for SAT score is thus an important feature of our data. We are able to document that the decline in earned STEM majors due to HOPE is primarily a result of initial STEM majors switching to another major and not a reduction in non-STEM majors who switch to being a STEM major. HOPE also had heterogeneous effects on the likelihood of specific non-STEM majors; we are also able to explore the effect of HOPE on the transition from an initial STEM major to a non-STEM major. We explore the effect of HOPE on the joint probability of graduating from college and being a STEM major and find an effect similar to earned STEM major conditional on graduating. The effect of HOPE on the likelihood of being a STEM major differs by type of initial college; we find no effect of HOPE for students starting in two-year colleges and a larger negative effect for students starting in one of the four research universities. We estimate the effect of HOPE by ability and find that the relative effects on the likelihood of earning a STEM major were most pronounced for students with good but unexceptional math skills. There are several possible mechanisms through which HOPE could reduce the probability of earning a STEM degree. Unlike the ACS data, the USG data allow us to present some insights into some of these mechanisms; we discuss these mechanisms more fully in section 5. First, financial aid reduces the cost of tuition but not the other costs. To the extent that other costs differ across majors, financial aid changes the relative prices of majors, which could affect a student’s choice of major.3 Second, financial aid reduces the need for a student to take out loans. The magnitude of a student’s loans might affect the student’s major if the student plans to choose an occupation that would allow him to pay off the debt quickly. Third, the mechanism that is perhaps most intuitive are student actions to maintain eligibility for HOPE, and in particular students might select or switch to a major for which it is easier to maintain a 3.0 GPA required to maintain HOPE.4 Fourth, the high school GPA requirements for merit aid eligibility may create incentives for students to enroll in less challenging courses in high school, which might make them less prepared for more difficult majors in college. Fifth, HOPE has been shown to alter the type of in-state institution students attend and to increase the likelihood that students stay in-state to attend college. This could affect the college major opportunities that are available and alter the relative attractiveness of specific majors. Our data do not allow us to identify the mechanisms driving the effect of HOPE on STEM majors, but we do offer some evidence for or against specific mechanisms.",10

Women tend to work in occupations that require shorter hours and pay lower wages, whereas men tend to work in longer-hour, higher-paying jobs. Pioneered by Bergmann (1974), the overcrowding model shows that women “crowd” into certain occupations, which depresses their wages.1 Extending Bergmann’s model, Johnson and Stafford (1998) provide a simple framework for understanding the factors that affect occupational gender segregation. Their analysis shows that women overcrowd into occupations in which they can find (i) a smaller degree of employer discrimination, (ii) job characteristics preferred by women, (iii) a comparative advantage for their gender, and/or (iv) less social pressure. All these models are based on a perfectly competitive labor market, in which the labor supply curve facing an individual firm is perfectly elastic. However, if there are search frictions and workers have imperfect information regarding alternative job opportunities, a reduction in job value will not result in a loss of all employees to employers. Furthermore, empirical studies find that many workers are not perfectly matched to jobs that have their desired working hours and that those who report dissatisfaction with their hours tend to change employers to work in positions that are more in line with their preferred hours (Altonji and Paxson 1988; Kahn and Lang 1991; 1995; 2001).2
 The purpose of this paper is to present a search model that explains the occupational asymmetries observed between men and women. I present a model based on the heterogeneous-workers, heterogeneous-firms version of the Burdett and Mortensen (1998) and Bontemps et al. (1999) wage-posting games.3 Relative to these papers, my model differs in the following two dimensions. First, the utility that a worker derives from a job does not necessarily coincide with the salary. It also depends on a nonpecuniary characteristic, which I consider to be the number of hours worked. This setup is similar to Hwang et al. (1998) and Lang and Majumdar (2004) in that it includes a job attribute other than salary.4 Therefore, instead of a wage-posting game, my model is a job-posting game in which every firm posts a single “tied-salary/hours offer” that workers may accept or reject depending upon their status. The number of hours worked is also an important determinant for the demand side of the labor market because the flow output per employee (labor productivity) is not constant, as modeled in Burdett and Mortensen (1998), but increases along with the total hours worked. Second, there is heterogeneity of workers across gender, which I model by a preference “shifter” in the disutility of work between males and females. Because women tend to spend more time producing household commodities, I specifically assume that women are more reluctant to work longer market hours.5 This is the main assumption I use to explain the different labor market behaviors of men and women. The equilibrium of this job-posting game is analyzed numerically. I find the following results: There is a positive correlation between the number of hours worked and salary. Employers that are more productive require longer hours and offer higher salaries. This prediction is in accordance with the compensating differentials theory of Rosen (1974). Hours and salary correlate positively because the utility of the latter compensates for the disamenity of the former. For a given salary level, men experience a smaller disamenity to working, and more productive firms can profit from requiring longer hours. Thus, more productive firms hire more men than women because men require smaller salary compensation for the long hours than women. Therefore, in equilibrium, men sort into longer-hour, higher-paying jobs, and women sort into shorter-hour, lower-paying jobs. If employers experience disutility from hiring women, as in the model of taste-based discrimination à la Becker (1971), gender segregation is reinforced. Employers endogenously choose to post job offers with longer working hours to dissuade women (who are averse to long hours of work) from accepting these jobs. This strategy compensates employers for the utility loss from hiring women.6
 If women experience disutility from working in jobs with a higher proportion of men, (a phenomenon called employee discrimination, which is supported by empirical evidence using the job satisfaction data in Usui (2008)),7 the implications for gender segregation are the same as in (2). The difference is the channel: because the women experience lower utility in longer-hour jobs, they prefer to either remain unemployed or to work with other women in shorter-hour jobs. In response, employers tailor their job offerings to men to maintain their employment size. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets up the model. Section 3 presents the simulation results. The paper concludes in Section 4.",

Governments have been responding to the crisis through active labor market programs (ALMPs) like subsidizing employment and providing training and employment services. The job crisis may have increased unemployment persistence, leading to longer unemployment spells, an increase in long-term unemployment and subsequently to skill attrition–thereby, also having detrimental effects on future employment probability1. At the same time, tighter budget constraints highlight the relevance of evidence-based, cost-effective active labor market policy making to support recoveries. This paper aims to bridge the gap between understanding cost-effective ALMPs and boosting post-crisis recoveries. At the same time, as pointed out by Cazes et al. (2009) and as witnessed by take-up rates of ALMPs, for example, in work sharing arrangements2, time lags until policies can be operational need to be taken into account. Thus, this calls for an existing ready-to-implement policy strategy based on existing evidence, which can be adapted to the respective position in the business cycle. This paper provides a new policy perspective in classifying ALMPs in light of their relevance and cost-effectiveness during normal times and recoveries to guide evidence-based policy making. We will discuss in particular the indirect effects, including macroeconomic and general equilibrium effects, as well as longer run effects determining the cost-effectiveness. We will also address the challenges for design and implementation in balancing these and avoiding disincentives. Instead of comprehensively reviewing existing programs and their evaluations across countries, the focus of this paper is rather to provide a systematic overview of the cost-effectiveness of ALMPs. In assessing the cost-effectiveness of ALMPs, we follow Heckman et al. (1999), asking whether ALMPs are effective for targeted workers in line with their respective aims and whether they are cost-efficient from a macroeconomic perspective3. In doing so, we provide a strong focus on indirect and macroeconomic effects. We show that policies retaining employment like work sharing schemes can be applied in severe recessions for limited time periods. ALMPs creating employment perform much better in terms of cost-effectiveness and desirability by strengthening outsiders’ position in the labor market, especially during recoveries, and by raising the outflow out of unemployment, ultimately reducing labor market persistence. In-work benefits and public works are very cost-inefficient in terms of raising employment, but might be cost-efficient in reducing poverty and inequity. Policies readjusting distorted employment incentives, such as activation and sanction measures, have proven to provide cost-effective results, especially during normal times. While short-run evaluations of ALMPs have not conveyed a consistent message on the cost-effectiveness, new longer-term evaluations clearly indicate cost-effectiveness from a longer-term perspective. This contrast is especially highlighted for training programs; evidence shows significantly positive long-run impacts. This is especially clear for on-the-job training and those targeted at disadvantaged outsiders. ALMPs improving labor market matching have an impact only in the short-run but are highly cost-effective. Existing reviews and evaluations do not always take into account the full set of effects, including the longer-run effects which may only materialize many years after the program4. All these are, though, essential to determine the cost-efficiency of ALMPs and to understand why some programs work and others do not5. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we present our new perspective on ALMPs. Section 3 provides an overview of indirect effects of ALMPs. Section 4 discusses the cost-effectiveness of the classified ALMPs based on evaluations of programs, and Section 5 concludes.",34

Conscripts typically have to serve in the army in a period of their life in which decisions on human capital investments are taken. A compulsory military draft might harm investments in human capital and reduce life time earnings. A number of recent studies have investigated the effect of military service on educational attainment or the effect on wages. Remarkably, these studies do not provide a consistent picture of the effects of military service. For instance, military service seems to decrease educational attainment in the UK (Buonanno 2006) and Italy (Cipollone and Rosolia 2007)1 but increase completion of tertiary education in Germany (Bauer et al. 2014), France (Maurin and Xenogiani 2007) and in the US (Card and Lemieux 2001) because of draft avoidance behaviours. In addition, military service seems to reduce wages in the US (Angrist 1990; Angrist and Krueger 1994) and in the Netherlands (Imbens and van der Klaauw 1995), but in Germany (Bauer et al. 2012), there is no effect on wages. In the US, the negative effects seem to fade away over time (Angrist et al. 2011). Moreover, the importance of education as a mediating channel for the long run effects on earnings remains unclear (Bauer et al. 2012). This paper aims to provide new evidence by investigating the long term effects of military conscription on educational attainment and wages in the Netherlands. Investigating the effects of military conscription is difficult because those that have served might differ from those that have not served. Despite the fact that military conscription was compulsory for all men in the Netherlands, only 40 per cent of each birth cohort actually served in the military. Those who were recruited were selected from a larger population and the various decisions made in this selection process are unobserved. This might induce selection bias if we compare the outcomes of those who served in the military with the outcomes of those that did not serve in the military. To address this selection problem, we exploit a policy change that created a major difference in conscription between birth cohorts. In 1979, the age that Dutch young men were called for military service was lowered from 20 to 19. The direct consequence of this policy change was that a whole birth cohort was exempted from military service. We identify the causal effect of military service by comparing the long term outcomes of this exempted birth cohort with the outcomes of those born in the adjacent years. This local comparison enables us to generate two types of estimates. First, reduced form estimates of the difference between the exempted cohort and the adjacent cohorts that received the regular treatment of conscription provide a direct estimate of the societal costs of a system of conscription. The societal costs might consist of a lower educated population with a lower earnings capacity. Second, instrumental variable estimates show the effect of conscription for males that actually served in the army. These estimates for the compliers provide insight into the private costs of conscription. This approach is related to earlier work by Imbens and van der Klaauw (1995). They introduced an instrumental variable approach that exploits all variation in conscription between fourteen birth cohorts for obtaining estimates of the short term wage effects for conscripts. We also apply their approach for testing the robustness of our main results on the long term effects of conscription on three education outcomes and wages using micro-level data from 1997 to 2002. Moreover, data on educational attainment and earnings of women enable us to perform a placebo test about the influence of other time related confounding factors. This paper contributes to the recent literature on the effects of military service. First, by exploiting variation in conscription that is transparent and arguably exogenous in a local approach, we are able to obtain estimates of both the societal and private costs of a system of compulsory military service. Second, we are able to trace the effects of conscription on investment in human capital. In particular, we are able to investigate the effects of military conscription on completion of university education. We find that the system of compulsory military service decreases the proportion of university graduates by 1.5 percentage points from a baseline of 12.3 per cent. In addition, being a conscript reduces the probability of obtaining a university degree by almost four percentage points. Third, we investigate the long term effects of conscription on the average societal wages and the wages of conscripts. We find that the system of military service reduces average societal wages by 1.5 per cent. In addition, conscripts lose approximately four per cent of their wages by serving in the military. This suggests that the negative effects of military service are long-lasting. Finally, we investigate to what extent the wage costs of conscription can be explained by the decrease in investment in human capital. We find that the effect of conscription on educational attainment does not fully explain the wage reduction. This suggests that conscription also reduces individual earnings capacity through channels other than a reduction in human capital. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section will provide background information about military conscription in the Netherlands. Section 3 discusses previous research on the effects of military conscription. Section 4 explains our empirical strategy. The data are described in Section 5. Section 6 shows the main estimation results, and Section 7 shows the results of several sensitivity tests. Section 8 concludes.",13

However, several states across the United States have recently introduced legislation to modify or eliminate teacher tenure. In 2011, the state of Florida passed a bill that any new teacher hired would receive a year-to-year contract, effectively eliminating tenure. In 2009, Ohio extended the probationary period before a teacher is eligible for tenure from three years to seven years. Proponents of tenure argue that once teachers demonstrate competency during a probationary time period, they should be protected from arbitrary dismissal. Opponents of tenure argue that the process of firing poor performing teachers is too time-consuming and expensive. Once a teacher receives tenure, school districts must follow a detailed and costly sequence of steps to fire a poor performing tenured teacher. As a consequence, few tenured teachers are fired for poor performance in the United States. According to The Widget Effect, from 2004–2008, Chicago Public Schools only formally dismissed 9 tenured teachers, or 0.01 percent of its workforce. Prior to receiving tenure, school districts can fire, or fail to renew the contract, of a probationary teacher for almost any reason – with the exception of discriminatory or other illegal reasons. Because tenure status increases a teacher’s job security by reducing the likelihood of being fired, I investigate how teachers anticipate and respond to receiving tenure. In this paper, I look at the change in a teacher’s spending on classroom materials and explore whether teachers change their time allocation in activities outside of the classroom (e.g., club sponsorship, coaching, serving on school committees, etc.). Research has consistently found that teacher quality is one of the most important school-level variables affecting student performance (Rivkin et al. 2005; Aaronson et al. 2007; Chetty et al. 2011). Changes in teacher behavior during the tenure evaluation year may affect student performance. I also investigate how teacher work hours change once a teacher is granted tenure – where the number of work hours is measured as the total time a teacher spends on school-related activities during a given week. Relative to the year that teachers are evaluated for tenure, I examine how these measures change immediately before receiving tenure and in the years following tenure. To answer these questions, I use data from the 2007–2008 restricted use version of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and exploit the cross-state variation in the probationary period length of novice teachers. The majority of states require that teachers serve for three years in a district before tenure is granted. However, several states have shorter probationary periods of only one or two years, while others have longer periods of four or five years. Teacher tenure is a specific application of employment protection legislation (EPL) which consists of the laws and regulations that govern the hiring and firing of workers. Once a teacher is granted tenure, dismissal or firing costs increase considerably. There is a sizable economics literature on the effects of EPL on various outcomes of interest. Autor et al. (2007) found that the adoption of wrongful discharge protection laws in the United States altered firms’ production choices, causing employers to retain unproductive workers. Blanchard and Portugal (2001) found that the strict employment protection in Portugal profoundly affected the labor market relative to the United States and led to an increased duration of unemployment. Heckman and Pages (2000) showed that job security legislation in Latin America reduced employment and increased wage inequality across workers. Several other papers also found that EPL affects worker employment (Lazear 1990; Miles 2000; Kugler and Saint Paul 2004; Martins 2009). There are also papers that investigate the impact of EPL on individual worker behavior. Ichino and Riphahn (2005) used data from a large Italian bank and found that employee absenteeism increased significantly once employees were no longer under a probationary period. Scoppa (2010) used the 1990 EPL reform act in Italy to investigate the effect on worker absenteeism in that country. Using a difference-in-difference approach, the author exploited the fact that the law drastically increased the firing costs for small firms and found that shirking increased once employees were granted firing protection. Despite this extensive literature, there is little research that looks at EPL in the context of K-12 education. Jacob (2010) used the 2004 new collective bargaining agreement in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) that gave principals the flexibility to dismiss probationary teachers for any reason and found that annual teacher absences were reduced by roughly 10 percent. Goldhaber and Hansen (2010) examine the implications of using value-added models as a criterion for granting tenure to teachers. The Widget Effect, published by The New Teacher Project, documents the relationship between tenure and the number of teachers who are fired. While not specifically addressing teacher tenure, Hansen (2010) used North Carolina administrative data and found that teacher absences increased dramatically in the year prior to teacher retirement or departure. While understanding teacher behavior under EPL is itself a worthwhile research question, this research is also an important first step in understanding how teacher tenure might affect student outcomes to the extent that teacher behavior changes under tenure. I find that in the year that teachers are evaluated for tenure, they spend significantly more of their own money on classroom materials. The teachers also participate more in school committees and extracurricular activities during the evaluation year. I also find evidence that these changes in behavior are temporary. After a spike in activity during the tenure evaluation year, behavior appears to return to the baseline established prior to being evaluated for tenure.",6

The CPS is a monthly survey that allows for the estimation of the transition rates between employment, unemployment, and inactivity since 1976. Amongst others, it has been used by Blanchard and Diamond (1990), Shimer (2005), Elsby et al. (2009) or Fujita and Ramey (2009). For several other countries, the comparable labour force survey is only carried at a quarterly frequency. Gomes (2012), Elsby et al. (2011) and Elsby and Smith (2010) have examined quarterly survey data from the United Kingdom, Silva and Vázquez-Grenno (2013) from Spain, and Hairault et al. (2012) from France1. Particularly noticeable are Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008), who compare the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates across countries using administrative data (France and United Kingdom) and data from quarterly surveys (Spain and United Kingdom) and from monthly surveys (United States). The different frequency of surveys poses the question of how comparable the transition flows between employment, unemployment, and inactivity are. Shimer (2005) and, more specifically, Shimer (2012) propose a methodology to correct for time aggregation. This correction is made defining the length of the time unit (say a week), making a partition of the frequency period in the time units (a month is formed by 4 weeks), assuming a constant transition rate between every two states for each time unit, and adding up the product of the transition rates for all the possible paths that link the initial state with the final state. To investigate the comparability of the data flows from datasets at different frequencies, it suffices to estimate the counterparts of the transition rates to the same time unit and verify whether they coincide. Shimer (2012) argues that the time aggregation affects the cyclicality of transition rates and creates a bias when measuring the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates for unemployment fluctuations. He defends the use of a continuous time-aggregation correction that became a standard practice in the literature. Elsby et al. (2009) prefer the use of a discrete, weekly time-aggregation correction. Although they acknowledge Shimer’s point, they find that the effect of the correction on the cyclicality of flows is quantitatively small. Nekarda (2009) further investigates the performance of the time-aggregation correction. Using weekly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, he is able to compute both the weekly and monthly transitions and check their consistency. He find that the monthly data understates the true transitions by 15 to 24 per cent. However, as in Elsby et al. (2009) he concludes that using the monthly data does not create a significant cyclical bias. This result was subsequently used by Smith (2011) to disregard the correction. The objective of this paper, similar to Nekarda (2009), is to investigate how the frequency of a survey matters for measuring labour market flows and evaluate the performance of the time-aggregation correction. I calculate transition rates at monthly and quarterly frequency from the CPS between 1976 and 2011. I apply both the discrete and continuous time-aggregation corrections. As in Nekarda (2009), I find significant differences in the transition rates obtained at different frequencies, across all state pairs, both in terms of levels and volatilities. Using a quarterly survey understates the measured monthly transitions rates by 30 to 50 per cent. I also evaluate whether the frequency of the survey affects the unemployment decomposition. Applying the continuous time-aggregation correction on the monthly survey data does not alter the relative importance of job-finding and job-separation rates, which is 50-50 in my sample. This result confirms the findings of Nekarda (2009) and Elsby et al. (2009). However, the data from the quarterly survey shows a different picture. Without correcting the data, the job-separation rate is measured to be more important (60-40), while the continuous time aggregation correction overstates the importance of the job-finding rate (40-60). To understand these differences, the key insight is that the time-aggregation correction crucially imposes a within-period invariant transition rate as if transiting from one state to another were a memoryless stochastic process. Using the monthly survey, I calculate conditional transition probabilities that differ substantially depending on the previous labour market state. In the last section, I briefly discuss possible causes for history-dependent transition rates that have been identified in the labour literature.",7
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,21 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-015-0020-x,Matching strategies of teachers and schools in general equilibrium,December 2015,Tom Ahn,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While teacher mobility and its impact on education production continues to be debated and actively researched, two important features of the teacher labor market in the United States emerge from the literature and the data: a) the teacher labor market is starkly segmented, with inexperienced teachers isolated in poor, underachieving schools, and b) a relatively stable job-queuing process seems to exist. Simple summary statistics of teacher characteristics in most administrative data sets reveal that highly-qualified and experienced teachers are concentrated in schools that have high academic performance and low proportions of students of traditionally disadvantaged groups. Poor, inner-city schools tend to be staffed by teachers with the least amount of experience. The literature has shown that clear stratification of teachers exists along dimensions of undergraduate institution selectivity, experience, subject matter, and certification status (Darling-Hammond 2001, Boyd et al. (2002), and Table 1 in this study).
				 In addition, there is almost no wage differential across schools (at least within a state). Because schools do not compete on wages, teacher assignments are differentiated by non-monetary characteristics. Transfer rules (both explicit and implicit), which are negotiated between teachers and districts, tend to favor teachers with seniority. No wage differences across jobs should, all else equal, decrease the search rate of teachers. Seniority-based transfer rules should lead to a positive relationship between experience and search (and transfer) rate. More experienced teachers should move to schools with better non-monetary characteristics. The picture that emerges is one of a classic job queueing mechanism, where teachers who initially match with an undesirable school wait until seniority rules allow them to move up the job quality ladder to match with better schools. Placing teachers based largely on seniority will most likely lead to sorting that benefits teachers, and not necessarily students1. Since teachers improve with experience, a queueing mechanism concentrates inexperienced (and as-of-yet less productive) teachers into schools populated with disadvantaged students. As these teachers become more productive, they will then be matched with students at better schools. Not only can this further widen the academic gap between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots,’ the fact that the higher-achieving students reap the benefits (of teacher experience) built on teachers learning from their mistakes while teaching disadvantaged students is troubling. This understanding of the teacher labor market has led policy makers, practitioners, and administrators to advocate to eliminate or at least minimize such teacher transfers through scholarly work, position papers, lawsuits, or policy changes2. In this study, I show that our understanding of the teacher labor market may be incomplete, leading to incorrect policy recommendations designed to curtail the loss of experienced teachers from under-performing schools. I analyze the teacher labor market where a teacher decides to search for a new school, and a school looks for a teacher to fill a vacancy, using the North Carolina public education administrative data set and the Working Conditions Survey (WCS). In the theory model, a teacher decides to search in a particular school market, and a school searches in a particular teacher market. The teacher searches in a school market based on a) her utility at the new school conditional on matching and b) her probability of finding a match in the market. The school searches in a teacher market based on a) its utility of matching with that teacher (type) and b) its probability of finding a teacher in that market. Any seniority-based hiring preferences should be partially reflected in how strongly schools search for highly experienced teachers. I then estimate the structural matching model to find the following3: a) Teachers who are mid-career, with 4 - 10 years of experience, face the lowest cost of entry to engage in search. Although it is apparent from the data that more mid-career teachers successfully transfer to a different school, the WCS reveals that their rate of entry into the transfer market is no higher than teachers with less than 4 years of experience. The structural model is required to separate the likelihood of entering the transfer market, the cost of entering the transfer market, the probability of successfully matching with a new school, and the utility gain from the match. Separating the search process in this way reveals that mid experience teachers face the lowest entry cost into the transfer market. However, this low barrier to entry results in too much competition, somewhat dampening the attractiveness of the search market. In addition, teachers with better pre-service qualifications (such as advanced degrees or certification) are more likely to be looking to transfer. Again, this is not obvious from the data, as teachers who transfer and those that do not move (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) look very similar in terms of pre-service qualifications. b) When teachers decide to search, their search strategies differ depending on the teachers’ status. Teachers from low-achieving schools across all experience levels behave similarly, searching for a good school about 88% of the time. Teachers from high-achieving schools have differing search strategies, depending on their level of experience. While mid and high level experience teachers focus search on high-achieving schools, teachers with low experience spend about 36% of the time searching for a match with a low achieving school. I speculate that this may be due to involuntary separation of these non-tenured teachers from their original school. c) Different types of schools have different strategies to recruit teachers. A low achieving school will search 80% of the time for teachers who have at least 4 years of education, regardless of whether they originate from high or low-achieving schools. On the other hand, high-achieving schools will focus 75% of their search on teachers with at least 4 years of experience from high-achieving schools. These search strategies reveal that new teachers are acceptable substitutes for teachers with only a few years of experience. Low-achieving schools in particular are willing to accept the risks of attempting to match with a more experienced teacher even if it means that they will, very often, fail and be forced to ‘settle’ for a new teacher. d) The observed changes in teacher quality distribution due to transfers understate the true extent of labor market volatility and search friction. Conditional on searching for a new position, even a teacher with the best qualifications (high experience and originating from a good school) succeeds in finding a match with a high-achieving school only 64% of the time. Similarly, a high-achieving school manages to match with a highly experienced teacher from a high-achieving school only 33% of the time. Based on a simplistic, incomplete picture of teacher transfers where the market operates through a rigidly stable queuing process, introducing simple changes to seniority rules could lead to a more efficient (and/or more equitable) allocation of teachers, leading to improvements in poor schools that lose these experienced teachers4. Policy simulations using the parameter estimates from the structural model to investigate the general equilibrium impact of policies to deter the transfer of experienced teachers yields the following: a) Decreasing vacancies in desirable schools by 15% leads to movement of low and high experienced teachers to less desirable schools. However, mid experienced teachers actually move away from these schools. Entry of teachers into the transfer markets is broadly suppressed, but the overall impact on improving teacher quality at poor schools is minimal, as the largest change in the distribution of teachers is a reduction in the number of newly minted teachers and an increase in the number of low experience teacher. As schools are shown below to value low experience and no experience teachers about equally, low achieving schools do not benefit much from the policy. b) Increasing the desirability of low achieving schools to mid-career teachers by 20% leads to positive effects, with more teachers of all experience levels ending up at these schools. Teachers already at these schools refrain from engaging in search, and more teachers at better performing schools enter the transfer market to look for openings in these newly improved schools. However, the overall impacts are fairly modest, with the number of mid experience teachers increasing by about 7%. Given the large costs of implementation to impact a relatively small number of schools, this policy seems unlikely to be implemented. The next subsection describes the teacher transfer market in detail and justifies the need for a structural matching model for this analysis. Section 1 describes the two data sets used in the estimation. Section 1 describes the econometric model in detail, and the estimation strategy is presented in Section 1. Section 1 presents and discusses the results which are used in the policy simulations in Section 1. Conclusions follow in Section 1. Teachers are mobile. As I show in the data section, even teachers with high levels of experience (and long tenures at a school) will move. Since a principal will, on average, lose 10 to 20% of her workforce each year, she must be searching annually for replacements. In other labor markets, wage differentials across jobs would play a prominent role in how employers and employees search for each other, with wages moving up or down in response to changes in labor demand and supply to clear the market. In the education labor market, however, wages are flat across schools (with the exception of small district-specific differences)5 and change only with experience level, certification, and advanced degrees. That is, the price of labor is exogenous. These individual pay increases are usually based on characteristics inherent to the teacher and are portable6. Therefore, a principal cannot recruit on wage but must seek to attract teachers based on the characteristics of her school7. In addition, because teacher salary is not paid by the principal but at the district level, teachers are cost-neutral to the principal. She will recruit a teacher based on her characteristics and not the wage that will have to be paid. In addition, restrictive hiring rules may tie a principal’s hands in searching for teachers to fill vacancies. Seniority-based hiring is thought to impact a school negatively by some principals as well as many education experts, yet many times they are powerless to prevent such transfers (Ballou 1999). Teachers’ contracts are perceived to inhibit the principals’ ability to effectively select their labor force. At the same time, involuntary transfers that are initiated by the principal, usually to jettison ineffective teachers, appear to be only a minor component of the teacher labor market (Nelson 2006). Summary statistics from administrative data sets (See Table 1 in this study, for example) show that when teachers transfer, in general, they move to ‘better’ schools, and that these teachers tend to be at mid-career or later, with at least 4 years of experience. The literature has shown that disadvantaged schools have difficulty recruiting teachers and are less selective in hiring, while advantaged schools tend to have a surplus of applicants, allowing them to be more selective. (Darling-Hammond 2001 and Boyd et al. 2002). Accountability legislation may also influence a principal’s recruiting decision by introducing market pressures in terms of monetary rewards or sanctions8. Some districts in North Carolina have tried to actively prevent the transfer of teachers into ‘desirable’ schools of high academic achievement and restrict transferring principals from ‘poaching’ too many teachers from their origin schools (Helms 2005). In North Carolina, teachers who wish to transfer to a different school submit their names to a central clearing house, but the process by which teachers and schools actually match are different for each individual case. While there may be some matching that occurs according to a mechanical rule-set, at least in the majority of cases, it appears that teachers and principals do actively search for each other. Principals will strategically time posting of open positions or reach out to certain teachers to impact recruiting outcomes. Some administrators cultivate a draconian image or send out negative observable signals to discourage potential bad matches (Ballou 1999). Conversations with education policy practitioners in North Carolina reveal that ambitious principals in North Carolina aggressively search through transfer applicant lists to look for the most desirable candidates. Indeed, the anecdotal evidence points to the existence of a complex and active transfer market. All that can be said with certainty is that some teachers and schools search for each other based on observable characteristics. Other teachers are content to stay at their school (for the time being, at least). Some teachers and schools succeed in matching, and these are observed as transfers in the data. Other teachers and schools fail to match, in which case there is no movement. The process is decentralized, with the state providing only a platform for both sides of the markets to post their availability9. If the surface teacher labor market appears as an orderly job queuing process, while there is an active, turbulent job search market underneath, our understanding of the teacher labor market would be incomplete. If the model of teacher transfer used to make policy recommendations does not adequately capture the churning of the labor market, instituting simple policies to stop or slow the perceived movement of teachers up the job quality ladder may not accomplish the goal of keeping experienced teachers where they are most needed. With the lack of a price mechanism to sort teachers, the complexity of the transfer process, and no detailed survey data to track teacher and school search behavior, a structural matching market framework is the most natural and tractable model for the teacher transfer decision as described above. Some previous studies have looked at the transfer decision in the context of a matching model. Boyd et al. (2013) showed that teachers are particularly sensitive to the distance between the school and their place of birth or high school attended. In another study where the authors had detailed information about all transfer applicants, Boyd et al. (2011) determined that teachers that are most likely to apply for a transfer look different from those who are most likely to find a match. Two common challenges in estimating a matching model are the difficulties in defining a) who is searching and b) the choice-set over which she searches (such that estimation is tractable). Information to identify teachers (and schools) that are searching can be difficult to obtain10. In the absence of this information, the entire sample is usually assumed to be searching. For this study, I am able to extract aggregate statistics on searching teachers at the school-level from a separate survey of teachers, which will be used to augment the individual matching data from the North Carolina administrative dataset. Defining the choice-set to allow empirical estimation usually requires multi-dimensional logit or probits (if the sample size is small enough), simulated maximum likelihood estimation, or alternative frameworks such as the use of maximum score estimators (MSE)11. I define the choice-set as a limited number of markets that teachers and schools may search over12. In the model, neither teachers nor schools are bound by geography in searching for each other. Teachers observe all openings in the state, and schools observe all applicants in North Carolina. Teachers choose to search for a certain type of school (‘good’ or ‘bad’, as defined below in the Data section). Schools choose to search for a certain type of teacher (defined by the teacher’s experience and whether she is currently at a good or bad school). Both teachers and schools evaluate the utility gain if they search in a particular market and succeed in matching. The probability of success depends on the number of teachers of her type searching for her preferred school type and the number of schools of her preferred type searching for teachers of her type. Based on this calculation, teachers decide whether to search for a new position, which in turn, affects the probability of all other teachers and schools in finding a match13.",2

Not surprisingly, there is great public interest in promoting policies that improve the breadth and depth of STEM skills in the American workforce. Undergraduate education is a critical part of the STEM pipeline. Some studies suggest that college students may benefit by attending academic institutions with stronger peers. However, the peer dynamics found in university-level STEM courses are potentially drastically different from those seen in the sorts of academic contexts commonly evaluated in the peer effects literature. In STEM classes, rigid grading curves are prevalent and peer competition is often fierce. This paper is one of the first studies to empirically test how the competitive environment found in university-level STEM courses mediates the influence of peer quality on the college outcomes of intending science majors. The effect of peer quality on STEM achievement is also of great interest for the affirmative action debate (Elliott et al. 1996). African-Americans are especially underrepresented in STEM fields, even though they are even more likely than whites to express interest in a science career as high school seniors (Astin and Astin, 1993). Young whites are nearly three times as likely as blacks to achieve a bachelor's degree in a STEM field and nearly seven times as likely to achieve a doctorate in the sciences (author’s calculation from US Census Bureau 2003). A central argument in favor of affirmative action policies is that such policies potentially benefit minority students by exposing them to stronger peers. However, a variety of studies have suggested that large preferences may have counter-productive effects (Sowell 1972; Loury and Garman 1995). In particular, they may cause science-interested minorities to shift out of undergraduate STEM fields because of the difficulties of competing with students with stronger academic preparation. If STEM training benefits from positive peer externalities, then one would expect affirmative action to promote diversity within the scientific workforce. Conversely, affirmative action policies would potentially have the perverse effect of undermining diversity in the sciences if net peer effects are negative in university-level STEM courses. To the extent that minorities that benefit from affirmative action have skill deficits relative to their university peers (i.e., they are mismatched), such relative deficits may exacerbate any negative peer effects in the sciences or negate any positive average peer effects. Therefore, our paper additionally aims to evaluate any mismatch effects on STEM attrition and to better understand how peer quality influences the major choice and final college outcomes of minorities pursuing STEM majors. In our analysis, we take advantage of a very large dataset covering all freshmen enrollees at the eight undergraduate campuses of the University of California over a nine-year period.1 These campuses have many functional similarities – they are all public, they are similar in size, they have common entrance requirements and a common administration – but they embrace a wide range of student competitiveness. At UC Berkeley, the median student has SAT scores that place her at the 91st percentile of all American students taking the SAT; at the least elite UC campuses, the median student has SAT scores that place her at the 62nd percentile. While all UC students are academically stronger than the average American college student, this range of entering credentials is much broader than that observed in most other studies of peer effects. Because of the extremely rich data we have on application and admission patterns across all eight campuses, we are able to effectively address selection problems by building upon and improving on the strategy used by Dale and Krueger (2002) in their well-known study of the effects of college eliteness on earnings. Specifically, we control for very flexible application-admissions pattern fixed effects to account for student unobserved characteristics, as well as school-specific fixed effects to account for typically unobserved institutional characteristics that are plausibly correlated with peer quality and student outcomes. We find strong support for the role of peer effects, and significant support for the mismatch effect as it is usually defined. We also suggest issues to pursue in future research.",9
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,19 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-014-0017-x,Locus of control and the labor market,December 2015,Deborah A Cobb-Clark,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"One of the most exciting developments in labor economics over the past decade has been the reframing of standard theoretical and empirical models to accommodate the role of non-cognitive skills in driving labor market outcomes. What began as a simple recognition that non-cognitive skills – for example, personality traits, perseverance, locus of control, self-efficacy, self-esteem, social skills, etc. – often have predictive power in wage equations has evolved into a considered analysis of the mechanisms through which non-cognitive skills impact worker and firm decisions in general. The result has been a more profound understanding of the way that labor markets work and a more nuanced view of what it takes to be successful. The objective of this paper is to synthesize the emerging research on one non-cognitive skill: locus of control.1 Locus of control is perhaps best described as “a generalized attitude, belief, or expectancy regarding the nature of the causal relationship between one’s own behavior and its consequences” (Rotter 1966 p.2). Those believing that life’s outcomes are due to their own efforts have an internal locus of control, while those believing that outcomes are due to external factors (e.g., luck) have an external locus of control.2 Perceptions of control have long had a prominent place in psychology, with psychologists arguing that an individual’s belief that his or her actions will lead to the desired outcome is fundamental to both motivation (i.e., effort) (Bandura 1986, 1989; Skinner 1996; Goldsmith et al. 2000) and self-control (Rosenbaum 1980). Economists have been much slower than psychologists to turn to locus of control as a means of understanding human behavior. Nonetheless, locus of control has increasingly come to be regarded as one of the core concepts in many fields of applied economics, including labor economics. Having an internal locus of control has a demonstrable link with labor market success and appears to be central to many of the human capital investment decisions which consume the attention of labor economists. In particular, investments in education, health, self-employment, and job search have all been linked to individuals’ beliefs about the extent to which they control life’s outcomes. Research in organizational sciences demonstrates that the decisions a senior manager makes are driven in part by his or her locus of control, and there is the potential for locus of control to become an important screening device in the hiring process. Finally, as one component of self-control more generally, locus of control is also relevant for understanding the types of incentive contracts that firms offer their workers. This review begins with a discussion of the conceptual origins of locus of control, including its relationship to related concepts such as self-efficacy, motivation, and self-control (see Section 2). In Section 3, the relationship between locus of control and labor market success is summarized. Section 4 pays careful attention to what we know about three potential mechanisms – human capital investments, hiring decisions, and optimal incentive contracts – through which locus of control might operate. The broader implications of these relationships for public policy are discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions and directions for future research are outlined in Section 6.",56
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,29 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-014-0015-z,The unhappily unemployed return to work faster,December 2015,Dimitris Mavridis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"An important question in labor economics is to what extent unemployment hurts those who experience it, and how large is the difference in utility between having a job and not having one. In job search theory, this difference in utility determines the payoff of the costly job search activity, and the prediction is that the larger the utility gap, the higher the effort one is willing to do to find a job. An opposing view to job search theory sees unemployment as involuntary, driven mostly by labor demand and with little or no role of labor supply. This paper proposes to test which of the two competing theories is true using a panel with data on both subjective well-being (henceforth SWB) and job history. The test consists of checking whether individuals who are (subjectively) most hurt by unemployment are more likely to engage in the costly job activity and more likely to find employment faster. The prediction from job search theory is that those who experience a larger fall in utility when losing their job should be more likely to be looking for a job. To shed light on this matter, I use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), a panel that follows individuals yearly over 16 years and constructs their monthly labor history. The results are as follow. First, I show that SWB drops when individuals lose their job. On average, individuals report a loss of 1.1 in well-being on a 0–12 scale (\(\frac {1}{3}\) of a standard-deviation), with the loss being slightly higher for men. Behind the average loss, I find large heterogeneity as a significant minority (17%) reports a rise in utility. Second, I show that this change in SWB predicts both future job search and unemployment duration. The results hold consistently only for men, whereas they disappear under certain specifications for women. For men, the larger the loss of SWB, the more likely they are to look for a job and the less time they spend unemployed, thus confirming that labor supply has a non-negligible role in determining unemployment for them. A further motivation of this paper is to show that SWB variables have a predictive power that can be used to study job search behavior and unemployment duration. Previous empirical research has focused on the effects of unemployment on mental-health but not on whether SWB could help us understand labor supply. Clark (2003) marks an exception, as he also looks into the effect of utility difference on the probability of employment and job search in the next wave. This paper’s contribution is to offer a duration model of unemployment to test the theoretical predictions from search theory and to decompose the effects by gender. Recently Gielen and Van Ours (2014) have inquired into this question using German data. Their findings suggest, like mine, that the happiness difference between labor force states predicts job search, but in contrast with my findings, the increase in job search does not translate into shorter unemployment spells. The robustness section uses their methodology to the BHPS data, and I find that my previous results hold: the SWB fall upon entering unemployment not only predicts job search, but also unemployment duration. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a review of the literature on SWB and labor market status. Section 1 describes the 16 waves of the BHPS as well as the job search and duration data. Section 1 presents the empirical strategy as well as the main results of interest for job search and from the duration model of unemployment. Section 1 concludes.",9

Workers in this sector usually do not pay taxes, have access to fringe benefits (i.e. social security and health care coverage), or fall under any labor market regulation. The existence of this sector and its recent expansion in many emerging economies has important implications for the functioning of labor markets and for economic growth. In particular, a deeper understanding of what workers consider when deciding which sector to join could greatly improve the efficacy of policies aimed to increase formality.
				 
Share of informal workers by country. Note: this figure presents the share of individuals working in the informal labor market by country for the year 2009 (source: Jutting and de Laiglesia (2009)). How do informal workers price forgone fringe benefits? In this paper, we argue that, in Mexico, informal workers are compensated for the value of lost benefits with higher labor income. We identify the price of these benefits through an approach that combines: i) the Mexican labor market structure, which had 58.3% informal workers in the period 2005–2013; ii) information on monthly labor income; iii) information on individuals who switched from formality to informality or the other way around; and iv) an efficient market hypothesis. In particular, if markets are efficient, individuals with identical characteristics should earn the same compensation (inclusive of fringe benefits) regardless of the labor market to which they belong. In other words, if there is perfect mobility between the formal and the informal labor markets, informal workers need to be compensated because there is no law that guarantees them fringe benefits1. The compensation represents how much extra labor income the informal workers get in return for not having fringe benefits. In this paper, we take advantage of the panel structure of the Mexican labor data and exploit the fact that 15% of the individuals switched from formality to informality between 2005 and 2013. After controlling for time-invariant characteristics, we rely on a efficient market hypothesis and a strict exogeneity assumption to interpret the negative effect of formality on labor income as the price of fringe benefits. In countries such as Mexico, in which the informal sector is a large fraction of the labor force, and workers continuously move from formality to informality and the other way around, finding exogenous variation that will induce workers to reallocate from one labor market to the other has proven to be a difficult task. However, one recent example is the introduction of Seguro Popular, a program launched to provide health services to uninsured individuals. The program, at first, was thought to be reducing the cost of informality, and its critics claimed that a large fraction of the population would switch from formal to informal jobs. Surprisingly, studies have found evidence that the program did not significantly increase informality (see Azuara and Marinescu 2013). In addition, despite the fact that formal workers have health coverage, a large fraction of them have joined Seguro Popular. Figure 2 shows that, since its introduction, both formal and informal enrollment rates to the program, although at different levels, have followed similar trends.

, 2005–2013. Note: the graph shows the percent of beneficiaries to Seguro Popular that belong to the formal and informal labor markets. Seguro Popular is the most prominent component of the Mexican System of Social Protection in Health launched in 2003 to provide health services to uninsured people. The data comes from the National Survey of Occupation and Employment (NSOE). Various papers analyze features of markets in which formal and informal labor coexist, but there are few papers pricing fringe benefits2. Juarez: Are Informal Workers Compensated for the Lack of Fringe Benefits? Free Health Care as an Instrument for Formality (unpublished) and Olson (2002) ask related questions but focus on the female labor force. The former estimates the compensation that poor informal female workers receive for the lack of fringe benefits. The latter finds that married female workers accept lower wages in exchange for health benefits. Our data comes from the National Survey of Occupation and Employment (NSOE) collected by the Mexican government. The survey is nationally representative and collects quarterly information on several features of employment conditions for household heads and their respective spouses as well as socio-demographic characteristics for the period 2005–2013; it has a rotating panel structure in which households are dropped after 5 observations. Our estimates are calculated using the after-tax labor income based on the assumption that workers consider after-tax labor income when choosing between the informal and formal jobs. Our results indicate that the price of fringe benefits is large and statistically different from zero. We consider these estimates to be relevant, not only to inform policies aiming to increase labor productivity, but also those aimed to improve the employment quality of informal workers. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 describes our data. Section 1 describes the formal and informal labor markets in Mexico and defines fringe benefits. Section 1 presents our empirical findings, and Section 1 provides the interpretation and implications of our results. Section 1 concludes.",3
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,31 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0050-z,Own-wage labor supply elasticities: variation across time and estimation methods,December 2016,Olivier Bargain,Andreas Peichl,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Assessing the labor supply responsiveness to tax (and benefit) changes is of key importance for policy analysis—for example, to predict the effect of tax-benefit policy reforms ex ante or to calibrate an optimal tax model. Responsiveness is often summarized by a measure of elasticities or what Chetty et al. (2011) refer to as “steady-state elasticities,” i.e., wage or income elasticities of labor market participation or worked hours stemming from a static framework. In principle, these estimates should also provide some information on international differences in labor supply responses. However, the variation in the magnitude of labor supply elasticities found in the literature is huge (see Evers et al. 2008), and there is little agreement among economists on the elasticity size that should be used in economic policy analyses (Bargain et al. 2014; Fuchs et al. 1998) show that only a small share of this variation is driven by genuine differences in work preference across countries.1 In fact, other factors account for the large differences in elasticities that are observed across studies: (i) the period of investigation (which may reflect changes in work preferences, for instance) and (ii) modeling choices (estimation method and model specification). To understand the relative contribution of these two factors, a careful and comprehensive survey of the literature on steady-state elasticities is required, which we undertake in the present paper. Our survey substantially completes previous reviews on static labor supply models by providing a wider and more comprehensive comparison of international evidence. Handbook studies written in the 1980s mainly focus on estimations using the continuous labor supply model of Hausman (1981) and provide evidence essentially for individuals in couples (Hausman 1985b; Pencavel 1986, for married men, Killingsworth and Heckman 1986, for married women). More recent surveys incorporate some evidence from recent methods (see Blundell and MaCurdy 1999; Meghir and Phillips 2008) or focus on dynamic life-cycle models (Keane 2011; Keane and Rogerson 2012; McClelland and Mok 2012). Yet, most of these surveys mainly summarize the available evidence for the USA and the UK. Evers et al. (2008) suggest a meta-analysis based on estimates for different Western countries but focus essentially on those obtained with the traditional Hausman approach. We provide a fresh characterization of static labor supply elasticities, collecting old and recent estimates for both Europe and the USA, covering the studies based on the Hausman method, more recent ones based on discrete-choice structural models, and, when available, estimates drawn from natural experiments. We focus on the two margins usually emphasized in the empirical literature on labor supply (Heckman 1993), namely how individuals respond by varying their hours of work (intensive margin) or by deciding whether or not to enter the labor force (extensive margin).2 We ignore other margins that are captured in the literature on the elasticity of taxable income (see Meghir and Phillips 2008 and Saez et al. 2012, for surveys)3 and leave aside the macroeconomic literature, in which elasticities are often obtained by calibration of general equilibrium models.4 We compare 282 elasticity estimates resulting from 92 studies, including 156 wage elasticities for individuals in couples, 70 wage elasticities for single individuals and lone parents, and 56 income elasticities. Our survey broadly confirms the modest consensus reached in the literature, establishing that own-wage elasticities are largest for married women and smaller for men. Recent studies confirm these findings but not the negative elasticities for men as sometimes found in older studies. Estimates for men are generally positive and small, with some exceptions (for instance, Ireland and some German studies). Some of the studies for the USA and the UK, but not all, point to substantial elasticities for single parents while estimates for childless singles are usually missing. Then, we investigate the relative roles of time changes and estimation techniques in explaining the diversity of estimates found in the literature (which had not been done in previous surveys like Evers et al. 2008). Our meta-analysis, based on both visual displays and meta-regressions, addresses the principal challenge coming from the fact that supposedly overstated estimates due to the Hausman approach coincided with a period characterized by low female participation. Restricting our meta-analysis to years of common support, we find suggestive evidence in favor of the hypothesis of a time decline in elasticities for both the USA and Europe. This confirms and extends the result of Heim (2007) and Blau and Kahn (2007) who show that married women’s wage elasticities have strongly declined over time in the USA. A possible explanation for this finding is that a more stable attachment of women to the labor market is responsible for modest participation responses to financial incentives in the recent period. We do not find compelling evidence that the estimation methods matter for the size of elasticities. Rather, the results are indeed driven by time trends. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the various empirical approaches to estimate static labor supply elasticities. This is particularly important to understand potential biases or differences that may be due to the use of the Hausman approach compared to more recent approaches including discrete-choice model estimations and quasi-experiments.

Ribas,Gustavo R. Sampaio,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The perception that maturity plays an important role in school learning has encouraged parents and teachers to delay children’s first-grade enrollment. As a consequence, there has been a significant increase in the age at school entry in countries such as the USA (Deming and Dynarski 2008). In fact, there is strong evidence that older pupils tend to outperform their younger classmates in early grades (Bedard and Dhuey 2006; Puhani and Weber 2007; McEwan and Shapiro 2008; Justin 2009). However, there is also evidence that this difference declines over time and disappears in the long run, having no positive effect on adult outcomes (Elder and Lubotsky 2009; Mühlenweg and Puhani 2010). Some studies even find that entering school later reduces educational attainment, by increasing high school dropout rates, and decreases lifetime earnings, by reducing experience in the labor market (Angrist and Krueger 1991; 1992; Dobkin and Ferreira 2010; Black et al. 2011).1 Nonetheless, the positive effects in early grades may be persistent in a system where students are tracked early into different schools or classes (Allen and Barnsley, 1993; Fredriksson and Öckert 2014). Given the weak and still disputable evidence of its long-term effects, our study presents and discusses the consequences of a delayed school entry on the admission of college applicants and on their subsequent earnings. We exploit the admission process to one of the major flagship universities in Brazil, which selects candidates strictly based on an entrance exam. In addition to its high quality and reputation, Universidade Federal de Pernanbuco (UFPE) is a public university and does not charge tuition fees. As a result, practically all high school graduates in the state of Pernambuco apply to this institution as their first choice. This circumstance makes our study unique because candidates who are not accepted by this university cannot easily enroll at another equally good institution.2 Moreover, Brazil does not have a tracking system that could explain the persistence of early disadvantages. At the same time, the country also has one of the highest rates of grade retention in the world (Bruns et al. 2012).3 Thus, this system might diminish the disadvantage felt by younger pupils, who are more likely to repeat a grade. We compare college applicants whose age differences at school entry are exogenously determined by whether they were born on December 31 or on January 1, along with the minimum-age rule enforced by primary schools in Brazil. Our analysis, however, should not be interpreted as the long-term effect on the probability of first graders going to college. Instead, we estimate the effect of delaying school entry on high school graduates aiming to join an elite institution. Our regression-discontinuity (RD) design shows that, among boys, delaying school entry by 1 year increases the admission test score by 0.5 standard deviations (sds) and the probability of college admission by 15 percentage points (p.p.). Importantly, due to the higher repetition rates among early entrants, the age difference between students born on December 31 and those born on January 1 practically disappears by the time they graduate from high school. Therefore, the effect on college admission cannot be attributed to differences in age at the test but rather to learning disadvantages that persist over time. For girls, the effect at early ages is weaker and not persistent on average.4
 According to Elder and Lubotsky (2009), two potential mechanisms could explain why later entrants outperform their peers. One is that greater maturity at school entry improves children’s learning ability at primary school and this effect persists over time. The other is that starting school later implies more human capital accumulated from parenting. To the extent that well-educated parents provide more human capital accumulation at home, the relationship between school-entry age and future outcomes should be weaker for the children of less-educated parents. We find, however, that the effect of delaying school entry on test scores is stronger among candidates with less parental education. If parents do not have a college degree, the enrollment delay increases the admission test score of boys by 0.73–0.86 sds and of girls by 0.14–0.57 sds. These findings imply that the difference in college admission scores comes from candidates’ learning ability at primary school, rather than from previously accumulated knowledge. Our findings are consistent with the ideas that learning disadvantages at an early age have a persistent impact on adults (Cunha and Heckman 2007; Cunha et al. 2010) and that grade retention is not an effective way to remedy this distortion (Manacorda 2012). We also conduct a number of tests to shore up our conclusions. First, we confirm the strength of our instrument by showing that children born on January 1 and on December 31 are indeed more likely to be the oldest and the youngest in the first grade, respectively. Second, our results do not seem to be driven by birthday manipulation. If parents planned ahead so that their children were born after New Year’s Eve, then the density of birthdays would be discontinuous around this day. Using the density test proposed by McCrary (2008), however, we show that there is no significant discontinuity between December 31 and January 1. Similarly, parents of children born on New Year’s Day have essentially the same income and education levels as parents of children born on New Year’s Eve. Thus, our results are unlikely to be driven by parental background or birthday manipulation; they certainly derive only from the minimum-age rule. Finally, we verify whether the difference found in college admission rates is carried into the labor market. Unfortunately, we have only data of candidates’ employment in their 20s, which are not enough to estimate lifetime earnings. Nevertheless, among poorer candidates, we find that men born on January 1 earn about 20 % more at the age of 25 than if they were born on December 31. For female candidates, the difference in earnings is not significant, but being born a day later increases by 4–14 % the probability of graduating from college and working by the age of 25. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that delaying school entry increases the lifetime earnings of poorer candidates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the four sources of data used to estimate the effects on college admission, first-grade enrollment, and adult earnings. Section 3 discusses our empirical strategy based on an RD design. Section 4 presents our main findings, as well as several tests that confirm the consistency of these findings. Our conclusions are presented in Section 5.",7
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,12 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0048-6,Informal unemployment and education,December 2016,Ann-Sofie Kolm,Birthe Larsen,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Researchers have been puzzled by the fact that observed tax evasion in high-income countries, despite low audit rates and fairly modest fines, is substantially lower than what is predicted by theory. Andreoni et al. (1998) argue that this discrepancy is most likely explained by non-economic factors, such as morality, guilt, and shame. However, Kleven et al. (2011), who conducted a large field experiment on individual tax filers in Denmark, suggest that this discrepancy is explained by the degree of third-party reporting. As incomes for individuals are not self-reported, rather reported by a third party such as the employer, it is difficult, and thus costly, to evade taxes. These costs, both due to third-party reporting, or even morality, guilt, or shame, tend to reduce the profitability of evading taxes and limit the size of the informal sector, although the expected punishment fees are low relative to taxes. In this paper, we argue that these types of costs may explain why highly educated workers to a lesser extent evade taxes and work informally than low-educated workers. If highly educated workers to a smaller extent work in industries which handle cash payments and to a larger extent are subject to third-party reporting, it will be more difficult, and thus more costly, for these workers to evade taxes. This is consistent with data. Evidence indicates that manual workers, or workers with a lower level of formal education, to a substantially higher degree face informal employment opportunities compared to highly educated workers. Pedersen (2003), using the same questionnaire design for Germany, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, confirms that skilled blue collar workers carry out more informal market activities than others. Figure 1 shows the extent of informal activities in the five countries by industry. Most informal work are carried out in the construction sector, followed by the agricultural sector, hotels, and restaurants. This pattern is also confirmed for Denmark, by Hvidtfeldt et al. (2011), and for Germany, by Haigner et al. (2011), using representative survey data.
 Fraction of informal sector work by industry. Pedersen (2003) Furthermore, performing logistic regressions for the five countries, Pedersen (2003) confirms that the likelihood of informal market activities falls with the length of education. In addition, Boeri and Garibaldi (2005) show for Italy that mainly workers at the lower end of the skill distribution engage in informal activities. The fact that mainly low-educated workers seem to work in the informal sector suggests that the choice of educational attainment is potentially distorted. Informal employment opportunities foregone with education may simply reduce the incentives for workers to acquire education. The aim of this paper is to investigate the equilibrium impact of underground activities on labour market outcomes and educational attainment in high-income countries, as well as to characterize the optimal enforcement policy. Although harsher punishment policies may correct for a too low stock of educated workers, total unemployment may increase with such policy. In fact, we have little guidance from research to what extent formal sector jobs replace jobs in the underground economy as those jobs disappear with stricter informal sector punishment. For this purpose, we develop a four-sector general equilibrium model featuring matching frictions on the labour market. Unemployed workers search for jobs in both a formal and an informal sector, and workers decide whether or not to acquire higher education based on their ability levels. Education is considered to be a once and for all investment in human capital and takes place as soon as the worker enters the labour market.1
 In order to isolate the mechanisms and increase the transparency of the model, we keep the differences between the formal and informal sectors at a minimum.2 The only dissimilarities between the sectors are that taxes are not paid in the latter and that productivity in the formal sector may be higher than productivity in the informal sector. Instead of paying taxes, informal sector firms have to pay a fine in case they are hit by an audit and detected as tax cheaters. In addition, firms in the informal sector are assumed to face concealment costs. In our model, we let concealment costs capture costs associated with concealing taxable income due to third-party reporting or even morality, guilt, or shame. The costs reduce the profitability of evading taxes and limit the size of the informal sector although the expected punishment fees are low relative to taxes. In line with Kleven et al. (2011), we also let these costs be higher the more income that is hidden from the tax authorities. We find that underground activities reduce the incentives to acquire higher education if informal employment opportunities mainly are available to low-educated workers. More zealous enforcement policies will in this case improve educational incentives as these reduce the attractiveness of remaining a low-educated worker. However, if also highly educated workers to a large extent are exposed to informal employment opportunities, the incentives to acquire higher education may fall with stricter enforcement policies as underground work pays off better to workers with high productivity. Moreover, we find that actual unemployment most likely increases, although the official unemployment falls. Finally, characterizing the optimal enforcement policies, we find that relatively more audits should be targeted towards the sector employing low-educated workers; elsewise, the outcome is a too low stock of educated workers. The present paper extends the strand of tax evasion literature which departs from the assumption of imperfectly competitive labour markets by incorporating involuntary unemployment through the inclusion of search frictions.3 See, for example, Fugazza and Jacques (2004), Boeri and Garibaldi (2005), and Kolm and Larsen (2006) who also model underground activities in high-income countries. These studies focus on labour market outcomes and rely on asymmetries between the formal and the informal sector, such as heterogeneity in morality, in order to explain the co-existence of a formal and an informal sector. There are also numerous studies based on search theoretical frameworks investigating issues of informal employment from the point of view of low- and middle-income countries. As one can argue that the nature of the informal sector can be quite different in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries, the modelling strategies usually differ in these set-ups. As pointed out by La Porta and Shleifer (2014), the informal sector in low- and middle-income countries is usually huge and contains small, unproductive, and stagnant firms. Moreover, the informal sector in this literature is usually seen as an unregulated sector. For an example, taking a Latin American perspective, see Albrecht et al. (2009) that accounts for worker heterogeneity and considers the impact of payroll taxes and severance pay on unemployment in the presence of an informal sector. The informal sector can be seen as an unregulated sector which is not affected by payroll taxes and other formal policies.4 The recent study by Meghir et al. (2015) takes a slightly different modelling approach in its focus on underground activities in Brazil as the paper considers on-the-job-search and firm heterogeneity. Workers may search for jobs both in the formal and the informal sector, and search frictions make it profitable for firms to start both types of jobs. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an empirical background and motivation for the paper. In Section 3, the model is set up. Section 4 offers a comparative statics analysis of an increase in the relative punishment of informal activities. Section 5 considers optimal policy, and finally, Section 6 concludes.",9

Kroft and Pope (2014), however, find that the entry into local labor markets of Craigslist, a popular website that hosts job ads, had no effect on unemployment rates in these markets. While the authors speculate (p. 298) that Craigslist’s effect might have been attenuated by the fact that Craigslist provided a service that was already offered by existing competing websites, the authors do not test empirically their hypothesis.Footnote 1

Footnote 2
 In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of the effects of Craigslist’s entry on competing employment websites. We use a panel of websites hosting job boards and resume banks from 2005 to 2007, a period of rapid expansion of Craigslist across the states in the USA. Similar to Kroft and Pope (2014) and Chan and Ghose (2014), we argue that the sudden rise in popularity of Craigslist during this period changed abruptly the market structure faced by competing employment websites. We exploit this abrupt change to evaluate its impact on competing websites’ online traffic and pricing. Our analysis draws on a comparison across employment websites that faced varying degrees of competition from Craigslist. We measure exposure to Craigslist with the number of job-related postings on Craigslist and the number of years since Craigslist’s entry in the market in which competing websites operate. We code employment websites that served a particular US state as competing with Craigslist if Craigslist entered at least one city in that state. For websites serving the entire USA, we consider two treatments. In the first treatment, these websites are coded as competing with Craigslist once Craigslist entered its first city. In the second, these websites are coded as not competing with Craigslist. To control for heterogeneity across employment websites, we control for time-varying website-level attributes (e.g., the number of different types of postings that the websites hosted, services offered by the websites, age) and add website-level fixed effects. We also include controls for attributes of the markets that employment websites served (e.g., unemployment rate, job creation rate, educational attainment, Internet access by residents, population size and density, fraction of workers employed in information sector). We find that Craigslist’s entry into the markets of competing employment websites was associated with a decline in both the number of visitors that an average competing website attracted and the number of pages an average visitor reviewed while on these websites. For example, the average number of visitors to a competing employment website declined by 3740 whereas the number of page views per visitor to a competing website declined by 1 for every additional 100 job-related postings that Craigslist hosted in the competing website’s market. We also find that employment websites reacted to increased competition for online users prompted by Craigslist’s entry by adjusting some of the fees they charged their users. Specifically, we document a decline in the average fees that the websites charged to employers and an increase in the likelihood that job searchers and employers were offered a discount as Craigslist became more entrenched in the markets of competing employment websites. These findings are consistent with the view that the absence of beneficial effects of Craigslist’s entry into local labor markets in the USA documented by Kroft and Pope (2014) can be attributed in part to a business-stealing effect. That is, Craigslist’s entry into local labor markets in the USA resulted in no distinguishable change in the unemployment rate in these markets because it cannibalized online traffic at competing websites. The paper’s findings also suggest that Craigslist’s entry might have had mixed welfare effects. In other words, while increased competition prompted by Craigslist’s entry benefitted online users by resulting in lower prices at competing employment websites, the entry also reduced online traffic at these websites. Because the gains of visiting these websites increase the more these websites get used by other participants (a feature that is inherent to platforms, like employment websites, that operate in multi-sided markets), Craigslist’s entry rendered these websites less useful to their potential users by reducing their online traffic.Footnote 3
 Our findings contribute to three areas of research. First, our focus on interactions between employment websites complements studies that analyze data from a single employment website. These studies examine how employers and job searchers search with the help of these websites (with data from Monster in Brenčič and Norris (2010), Snagajob in Kudlyak et al. (2013), and CareerBuilder in Marinescu and Rathelot (2014)) and the implications of their use for search outcomes (with data from oDesk in Stanton and Thomas (2015), Agrawal et al. (2013), Pallais (2014), and Horton (2016)). Unlike these studies that focus on the users’ experience with a single employment website, our focus is on the market for these websites. Second, our findings contribute to other studies on the effects of Craigslist’s expansion in the USA. In addition to Kroft and Pope (2014), a study by Seamans and Zhu (2014) is closely related to our paper because of its focus on the effect of Craigslist’s entry on pricing (together with circulation and provision of content) in the market for newspapers. Chan and Ghose (2014) focus on the effect of Craigslist’s entry on new HIV cases, while Gurun and Butler (2012) on the use of slant by local newspapers. Unlike these papers that focus on how the diffusion of the Internet—as represented by entry of an online intermediary—affects activities offline (e.g., decision-making by newspaper, sexual behavior), our study examines Craigslist’s effects on activities online (i.e., online traffic at and pricing by competing online intermediaries). Finally, our findings contribute to the literature on the reactions of incumbents to new entrants and, specifically, to studies that focus on reactions by platforms in multi-sided markets to changes in market structure (Jin and Rysman (2015), Chandra and Collard-Wexler (2009), Fan (2013), and Seamans and Zhu (2014)). While in our study a change in market structure is triggered by the entry of a new competitor as in Seamans and Zhu, in other studies, it occurs as a result of mergers (Chandra and Collard-Wexler and Fan) or a change in the definition of a geographical market (Jin and Rysman). The distinguishing features of our analysis are its focus on (a) online platforms in the labor market and (b) joint examination of the effect of a change in market structure prompted by Craigslist’s entry on employment websites’ traffic, prices, use of discounts, and use of bundling of services the websites offer their users.Footnote 4
 We start with a description of the data and our empirical approach in Section 2. In Sections 3 and 4, we review our results. In Section 5, we review evidence from two robustness checks that include an alternative measure of Craigslist’s presence in the markets of competing websites and an alternative sample period. Concluding remarks are delegated to Section 6.",1
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,10 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0046-8,Self-employment in an equilibrium model of the labor market,December 2016,Jake Bradley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The proportion of total employment made up by the self-employed in the UK rose steadily over the period 2000–2004. The number of self-employed increased by 8.9 % compared with an increase of 0.1 % of paid employees. This growth was across gender, region, and industry (Lindsay and Macauley 2004). Over this period, the average self-employment rate was at 11.5 % of total employment and this large proportion is not unique to the UK: across all OECD countries this proportion varied from 8 to 30 % (Blanchflower 2004). Overall employment, wage determination and dynamics across the two sectors are clearly intrinsically linked, especially when one also considers that in the UK one third of all the self-employed hire at least one paid employee (Moralee 1998). Considering the size and importance of self-employment, literature that incorporates it into a model of the labor market is relatively sparse. This paper develops a search-theoretic general equilibrium model of the labor market that incorporates self-employed individuals. The self-employed entrepreneurs are treated in a Schumpeterian way, as a source of innovation (Schumpeter 1934)1. It is distinct from other labor market models of self-employment in that after innovation, the self-employed agent can work on their own, as an own-account worker, or begin hiring workers from a labor market with search frictions. The importance of incorporating the self-employed into an equilibrium model of the labor market is seen by looking at simulations of labor market policy. Conventional wisdom would suggest that a rise in unemployment benefits would have an adverse effect on aggregate unemployment—workers require better job offers or better ideas to exit unemployment for paid or self-employment respectively. Introducing the self-employed as a source of job creation introduces a counterweight to this straightforward mechanism. If only sufficiently good ideas create employment opportunities, making the self-employed more fastidious about which ideas to act on could create employment opportunities for other agents. This paper finds that for small increases in the generosity of unemployment benefits, aggregate employment increases. This is used as an illustrative example to show the importance of considering the self-employed when implementing active labor market policy. In the model, there are two types of agents, large private sector firms who vary in their productivity and ex ante homogeneous workers who are exposed to innovative ideas which arrive at an exogenous Poisson rate that is dependent on their labor market status. When an agent gets an idea, its quality is drawn from a known distribution and the agent decides whether to act on it. If they choose to start a business, then depending on the quality of the draw, they may commence attempting to hire workers as paid employees. Thus, paid employees are either hired by large firms or self-employed recruiters. All workers are finitely lived and when in paid employment are exposed to an exogenous probability that they lose their job; all wage offers and job arrival rates to paid employment are determined endogenously. This rich setting allows for a multitude of avenues in which the two sectors are interlinked. The model is structurally estimated using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). The identification strategy allows primitive productivity distributions and hiring behavior of both types of firm to be uncovered. The distribution of productivity amongst large firms is uncovered, as in Bontemps et al. (2000) by an inversion of the wage offer distribution; the productivity amongst the self-employed is obtained directly from their earnings; and hiring behavior is estimated in order to match the distribution of firm size amongst large privately owned companies and small firms owned by self-employed recruiters. Estimates suggest that the productivities of the two types of firms are very similar; however, self-employed owned firms are responsible for a much smaller share of employment because they face much greater frictions in hiring paid employees. It is necessary to uncover output and hiring through the guise of an equilibrium model as there exist large limitations of data on the self-employed. Data are specifically limited in information regarding the recruiting self-employed. The BHPS is useful as it distinguishes the self-employed between those who hire paid employees and those who do not. However, it does not identify the paid employees who are hired by recruiting self-employed nor does it provide information on output. Therefore, in order to infer rates of hiring and production, the paper leans heavily on a model that provides a great deal of structure to the data. There are models that embed self-employment into a labor market equilibrium. However, there are none, to the author’s knowledge, that allow for the two distinct types of self-employment discussed. Kumar and Schuetze (2007) develop a model of the labor market that incorporates self-employment and assess the effect of changes to unemployment insurance and the minimum wage on labor market equilibrium. Self-employed hire paid employees as in this paper, but unlike this model, there is no wage dispersion within sector nor are there any movements across sectors. Thus, they restrict a direct interaction between the two sectors. Narita (2014) and Margolis et al. (2014) allow for wage dispersion within sector and structurally estimate the parameters of their models using data from Brazil and Malaysia, respectively. However, unlike Kumar and Schuetze (2007) and this paper, the self-employed are restricted to being own-account workers (they are restricted from hiring). Also, although they allow for more mobility than Kumar and Schuetze (2007), they still omit any direct transitions between paid and self-employment. Although not all concern themselves with self-employment, perhaps the most similar papers methodologically are Meghir et al. (2015), Bradley et al. (2015), and Millán (2012). All introduce another sector into an equilibrium labor market setting allowing for a great deal of mobility between and across sectors, be it an informal, public, or self-employed sector. Decisions made by workers depend not only on the wage they are offered but also future prospects associated with the sector. Millán (2012) suggests that self-employment is used as a route out of unemployment. This paper does not consider this hypothesis, but workers may be encouraged to become self-employed as they face the opportunity of starting a business which can grow. Only Kumar and Schuetze (2007) and this paper entertain the idea of the self-employed as employers, and only this paper distinguishes between the self-employed as own-account workers and recruiters. The consensus in the empirical literature is that there exists a substantial paid employment premium over being self-employed. Hamilton (2000) finds that taking into account within sector earnings growth and without distinguishing between own-account self-employed and recruiters, there is a 35 % differential between median earnings of a self-employed individual and a paid employee with 10 years of experience in the USA. To rationalize workers’ career choices, “results suggest that the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment are substantial”. Critiquing the shortcomings of the existing literature Hamilton (2000) goes on to say “results presented here are of a reduced form [...] structural estimates of the compensating wage differential, for example, would require [...] the probability of observing particular employment and earnings sequences”. To my knowledge, this is the first paper that attempts to structurally estimate the nonpecuniary benefits of self-employment while taking into account different employment options, including starting and growing one’s own business. A priori, it is not clear which sector has the preferable employment and earnings profile. On the one hand, those in paid employment are better exposed to other jobs in paid employment and can climb the job ladder thusly. However, the self-employed are far more likely to become recruiters. If their firm successfully grows, so will their earnings. Consistent with the empirical literature, this paper too finds a large positive amenity associated with self-employment. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents and solves the equilibrium model. Section 3 presents the data, which corrects the earnings of the self-employed, attempts to validate assumptions made in the model, and explains the moments used for identification. Section 4 outlines the estimation protocol, the results, and the fit of the model. Section 5 runs counterfactual policy simulations to asses the effects of increasing unemployment benefit on aggregate employment, and finally, Section 6 concludes.",3
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,29 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0045-9,Local labor markets and taste-based discrimination,December 2016,Clémence Berson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Competition and discrimination on the labor market are closely related both in theory and in empirical work. The main finding, which comes from the Becker (1971)’s model, is that competition has a negative impact on discriminatory outcomes. The concept of discrimination was introduced into economics by Becker as the differential treatment of two individuals with identical observable productive characteristics, due to an observable non-productive characteristic. Becker suggests that discrimination reflects the taste of employers, coworkers, or customers. In this framework, members of the group which is discriminated against receive lower wages in order to be hired and accepted as employees, coworkers,or salespersons. This analysis was criticized by Arrow (1971), who argued that the model is unstable and that discrimination will disappear via competition. Perfect competition produces a zero-profit market, so that prejudiced firms, which are less competitive due to their higher wages, exit the market. Their continued presence requires them to make extra profit or be more productive than other firms in order to stay in the market. By way of reaction, Phelps (1972) and Arrow (1971) improved the explanation of discrimination by considering it as a result of beliefs. When workers do not belong to their own group, employers use an expectation, real or assumed, of the productivity levels of groups of workers as a whole to set the offered wage. In general, firms believe that workers in other groups are less productive on average than those who are in the majority. Minority group workers thus earn less than their majority counterparts. This statistical discrimination will disappear over time as employers learn the true productivity of their workers, except if firms can use their market power against the discriminated workers. Altonji and Pierret (2001) highlight this phenomenon using job characteristics and workers’ results to AFQT tests in the USA. Empirical work provides support for Becker’s theory by showing that greater competition reduces wage differentials, although discrimination persists. These results depend on two key inputs: the measures of competition and labor market discrimination. First, exogenous competitive shocks to a particular sector show that competition reduces the wage gap by gender and by race, enabling workers in the discriminated group to attain higher job positions.1 Second, the comparison of different sectors with different degrees of competition within a country shows that the wage gap is lower in less concentrated markets.2 Third, the international trade liberalization reduces the gender wage gap.3 The main conclusion from these papers is that imperfect competition justifies the persistence of discrimination on the labor market. This implies that prejudiced companies receive rents or are more productive than other firms and can thus satisfy their taste for discrimination while remaining competitive and staying in the market. The above analysis focuses on the relationship between product market competition and discrimination. However, discrimination is not only inconsistent with competition on the product market but it also provides a challenge to the existence of labor market competition. In the latter, workers are paid according to their marginal productivity, and two workers with identical ability should receive equal pay. Nevertheless, with discrimination, employers do not pay workers at marginal productivity and take non-productive worker characteristics into account. In order to be wage setters, employers need some market power in order to fix the wage. Consequently, imperfection on the labor market is one argument for the persistence of discrimination in a competitive product market and, as this paper shows, will lead every firm to discriminate, whatever their tastes or beliefs. Theoretical search models of discrimination use to explain discrimination persistence using labor market frictions.4 In particular, Black (1995) explains the lower wage of minority workers by their lower reservation wage due to a smaller number of job offers. The model developed below confirms previous findings of matching models as the persistence of discrimination, induced by imperfection of the labor market. However, it releases some assumptions and uses new channels to explain the wage gap. The results highlight the importance of firms’ location in the wage gap. Moreover, as discrimination is persistent, the paper studies several public policies aiming at fighting discrimination. In this paper, discrimination is introduced in a taste-based model where workers are not paid at marginal productivity. Workers’ utility functions include the non-wage characteristics of the job. Heterogeneity in worker preferences allows firms to exercise market power in the labor market, which is thus oligopsonistic. According to the theoretical arguments in Manning (2003a) and as shown by an increasing literature, considering the labor market as oligopsonistic reflects reality. Boal and Ransom (1997) and more recently Manning (2011) summarize studies highlighting monopsony and point out issues at stake. Empirically, Staiger et al. (2010) and Ransom and Sims (2010) show monopsony with respect to nurses and teachers in the USA, respectively. Booth and Katic (2011) estimate labor supply elasticity around 0.7 in Australia, confirming monopsony power existence. Falch (2011) points out monopsony in Norway concerning teachers. Barth and Dale-Olsen (2009) indicate that 70–90 % of the gender wage gap among low-skilled workers is explained by monopsonistic discrimination. Ransom and Oaxaca (2010) estimate labor elasticities between 1.5 and 2.7 in US grocery stores depending on sex. This model of oligopsony with heterogeneous worker preferences is based on Salop (1979), who enriches the Hotelling (1929)’s model with a circle city. This model of oligopsony with heterogeneous worker preferences is based on a combination of both concepts. In the presence of taste-based discrimination, it yields an enduring wage gap between the majority and the minority without worker segregation. Consequently, this model does not exactly reproduce geographical breakdown by ethnicity and fits better gender than race discrimination. The main contributions of this paper are, first, that discrimination does not come from a productivity gap, real or assumed, between minority and majority group workers. Second, a single prejudiced firm is sufficient to induce a significant wage gap in the market. Further, non-prejudiced firms discriminate against the minority without having any taste for discrimination or beliefs regarding them. Furthermore, firms make more profits when they are located in an area close to similar firms. If higher competition decreases the wage gap, it totally vanishes if and only if commuting costs disappear or if the number of firms tends to infinity. Moreover, unprejudiced firms have no incentive to compete with prejudiced firms to drive the latter out, as they profit from the existence of discrimination. Consequently, discrimination can persist even in the long term. As discrimination will not disappear via competition, governments consequently have to introduce public policies. In this paper, these consist of equal wage laws, employment subsidies, introduction of a minimum wage, affirmative action, and transport improvements and subsidies. To my knowledge, this is the first time that this model has been applied to the issue of labor market discrimination. Thisse and Zenou (1995), Wauthy and Zenou (1999), and Hamilton et al. (2000) have used this model to analyze employment and training policies. Bhaskar and To (2003) have also employed it to consider wage dispersion and survey the possible uses of the model in Bhaskar et al. (2002). This paper is organized as follows. The model is described in Section 2 for the case of four firms, with an analysis of the effects of competition on wages. Section 3 then sets out the policy implications. Finally, Section 4 concludes.",7

Hirsch,Muhammad M. Husain,John V. Winters,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Roughly 5 % of US workers hold multiple jobs. The common perception among journalists and the public is that multiple job holding is countercyclical, used by workers to help offset household income losses during a recession. Numerous news stories highlight anecdotal evidence of individuals taking multiple jobs when economic conditions are poor.Footnote 1 Neither theory nor prior evidence, however, provides an unambiguous answer to the question of whether multiple job holding is procyclical or countercyclical. Based on labor supply theory, workers’ willingness to hold multiple jobs may be countercyclical if household income effects are strong. Desire for a second job can arise from losses in work hours or other earnings on one’s primary job or from an earnings loss by another household member. Even if labor supply for multiple jobs is countercyclical, product and labor demand falls in a recession, resulting in fewer opportunities to hold multiple jobs absent extreme wage flexibility. The limited evidence that exists on multiple job holding and the business cycle is suggestive, but not fully conclusive. In this paper, we use a large micro data set for 1998–2013 in order to examine how multiple job holding varies across and within US labor markets (MSAs) with respect to local unemployment and employment growth rates. In addition to examining how overall multiple job holding varies with respect to local labor market conditions, we address several related questions. Among these are how multiple job holding over the cycle has varied over time and among demographic groups, how it varies for workers whose primary jobs are salaried versus hourly, and whether responses to business conditions are symmetric with respect to increases versus decreases in unemployment. We briefly address the question of how closely second jobs match primary jobs and whether differences between the two, measured by occupational indices of skill-related job tasks and working conditions, vary over the business cycle.",17
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,26 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0043-y,Composite indicators of labour market regulations in a comparative perspective,December 2016,Mariya Aleksynska,Sandrine Cazes,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The past decades witnessed a significant burgeoning of empirical studies examining the effect of labour market institutions on various measures of economic and labour market performance.Footnote 1 This burgeoning was naturally propelled by the global economic crisis and the need to seek empirically grounded policy responses to persisting unemployment and widening inequalities. It was also facilitated by the development of cross-country time-series composite indicators of labour market institutions. Some of this development was facilitated by technological progress and the widespread use of the internet that brought about new possibilities of creating, storing, exchanging, replicating, and using various kinds of data for economic research. However, the question of the robustness of empirical studies based on such indicators has become increasingly critical. This paper examines some of the dangers embedded into what can be called data repackaging—i.e. utilization of data produced by some organisms by other organisms through the combination and aggregation of initial data into various other data products, such as composite indicators. This process is sometimes accompanied by data misclassification and misinterpretation, as well as by poor acknowledgement of the nuances in the initial data. It can also be viewed as part of “mashuping” of indicators—a term coined by Ravallion (2012)Footnote 2 and defined as a process of creating composite indicators in which the data producer is only constrained by the availability of data in choosing what variables to include and by their weights, but not by theory or empirical practice. To demonstrate our point, we chose to focus on three composite indicators developed for measuring labour market regulations, competitiveness, and efficiency, by three internationally renowned think-tanks. These are the Labour Market Efficiency Index developed by the World Economic Forum (WEF LME), the Government Efficiency Index and its labour regulation components developed by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), and the Fraser Institute Labor Market Regulations (Fraser LMR) index. These three indicators are chosen for several reasons. First, they are widely used in policy-oriented research on the role of labour market institutions. A very partial list of the most recent works based on either of these indicators includes Freeman et al. 2008; Feldman 2007, 2009; Javorcik and Spatareanu 2005; Bernal-Verdugo et al. 2013, 2015 (criticized by Aleksynska 2015a, 2015b); or Prados de la Escosura 2016 (who also discusses some of these indicators’ drawbacks). These indicators are also widely cited in the media and are seriously taken by businesses and by governments for formulating policy advice, especially in countries with rich reform agenda, such as Ukraine, or countries of the Arab Spring world.Footnote 3 Second, all three indicators share the same characteristic: they aim at capturing labour market institutions in general and at describing them with one number. In this respect, they are different from, for example, the widely used and acclaimed OECD Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicator or a recently launched ILO EPLex indicator, which are aimed at describing in depth one specific labour market institution—employment protection legislation. It is for this reason that such other indicators measuring just one type of institution are not considered in the systematic analysis of this paper, though we occasionally refer to them. Lastly, all three indicators under review are partly or fully based on data produced by other institutions. This is a common feature of the three indicators, which is not shared by some other famous indicators in the field, such as the Deakin et al. (2007) indicators. One consistently used data source for the three indicators under review is the Employing Workers Indicator (EWI), a subindicator of the Ease of Doing Business indicators developed by the World Bank. The Fraser LMR indicator also contains data produced by the WEF and IMD. In what follows, we provide a critical overview and a comparison of these indicators of labour market regulations. Our main findings are three. First, we highlight that while each of these indicators claims to be original and having a somewhat different objective from others, each of them systematically uses the whole, or parts of, the World Bank EWI—a series of indicators developed by the World Bank and measuring some specific aspects of labour regulations. Originally, EWI was part of the aggregate Ease of Doing Business indicator used to rank countries. However, its use in the aggregate Ease of Doing Business indicator has been discontinued by the World Bank, though the Bank still collects the data. In systematically using the World Bank EWI data, the WEF, IMD, and Fraser take liberty in renaming and rescaling various components of the original World Bank Employing Workers Indicator. But mainly, they fail to properly acknowledge the appropriateness of using this source to construct their own composite indicators. They also fail to properly track and acknowledge the methodological changes in the original data series. In fact, the World Bank EWI has been extensively reviewed and assessed as not being suitable for inclusion into the overall aggregate Doing Business indicator or for ranking countries. Following initial important criticism from academia, civil society, and other international organizations (see notably Berg and Cazes 2008; Lee et al. 2008), it underwent an independent evaluation (World Bank 2008), an examination by a consultative group (World Bank 2011), and a review by an independent panel (World Bank 2013). These evaluations resulted in several significant methodological changes introduced to the EWI. Most importantly, it was determined that, although the World Bank may continue gathering raw data underlying EWI, the World Bank would suspend using the EWI to calculate the aggregate Ease of Doing Business indicator or rank countries based on it, as well as would stop referring to the EWI when formulating policy advice. According to the Final Report of the Independent Panel (ibid), “The Bank’s decision to suspend the EWI acknowledged the problems inherent in measuring only the costs of labour-market regulation and not the benefits. The Panel agrees with the Bank’s reasoning [World Bank, 2009] that ‘a comprehensive approach in advice on labour market policies is needed’”. However, not only do the methodological notes accompanying the three indicators under the review of this paper not acknowledge these important debates but also they use the EWI data to construct their own composite indicators and to rank countries, thus disregarding significant recommendations and the decisions taken by the World Bank itself. Thus, another objective of this paper is to raise awareness among the WEF, IMD, and Fraser data users about the debates surrounding the data used to construct these composite indicators. Second, we uncover additional caveats in the three respective composite indicators. These include trivial aggregation of de jure and de facto measures, the use of opinion surveys that may not represent all types of firms, and frequent methodological changes, which render data incomparable over time. These methodological changes include adding or removing individual components from aggregate indicators from one data year to another and changing the methodology and definitions of these components. Some of the composite indicators contain sample-dependent data, which should neither be aggregated with data from other sources nor used in comparative purposes over time if the sample changes—and this is not always the case. Third, we show how, despite the use of the same common source, resulting composite indicators produced by the three intuitions differ from each other. As a result, each of the indicators provides a different outlook of labour market regulations, potentially creating confusion for policymakers. The uncovered limitations and shortcomings in the three composite indicators do not help advancing the controversial debate on the role of labour market institutions. While previous research has already highlighted several problematic areas with the composite indicators that we consider (for example, Ochel and Röhn 2006 review the overall IMD, WEF, and Fraser indices prior to 2005, not just their labour regulations subcomponents), the wide recent use of subcomponents measuring labour market regulations for ranking countries and providing policy advice calls for a more in-depth overview of such specific components based on the post-2005 data. Our paper also rejoins a growing literature that is critical of composite indicators more generally, such as Ravallion (2012) and Stiglitz et al. (2009) who provide a general perspective on advantages and disadvantages of composite indicators in various fields, without focusing on labour market regulations specifically. The three reviewed indicators, and the databases to which they are associated, are somewhat different from the “internet” data in the strict sense that has recently emerged in social sciences (Askitsas and Zimmemann 2015), as they are not generated by simple internet users, for example, through their search activities. However, they are similar to the “internet data” in the sense that the fast development of technologies permitting instantaneous, open, unlimited, and mostly free access to data generated by some organisms to other organisms facilitates the development of secondary online databases and composite indicators based on them. It helps to save on costs of original data collection and also of data use, as original sources provide data in a ready-to-use standardized format. The digital revolution also permitted virtually unlimited storage of newly created data products and allowed saving costs associated with their publicizing on the net. Thus, we can expect to see a growing number of similar databases and indicators in the future, an expectation also flagged by Ravallion (2012).Footnote 4
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a comparative overview of the selected indicators. It shows how the World Bank Employing Workers Indicator is systematically found among the Fraser, WEF, and IMD composite indices’ ingredients. It also examines the appropriateness of the underlying subcomponents, data sources, and aggregation techniques adopted by the three indicators. Section 3 explores how the selected indicators correlate with each other and with key labour market outcomes. Finally, Section 4 concludes.",4

The case of obesity,December 2016,Jennifer Bennett Shinall,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"When Congress first passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on July 26, 1990, its goals were lofty: it aimed “to invoke the sweep of congressional authority…in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities” (42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(4)). Congress expressly intended “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities” throughout their lives, including in employment, and thus to improve the outcomes of the disabled in the labor market and beyond (42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)). Specifically, Title I of the ADA sought to further Congress’s goals in the labor market by prohibiting discrimination against the disabled with regard to the “terms, conditions, and privileges of employment” and by requiring employers to provide “reasonable accommodation” to disabled employees who are capable of “perform[ing] the essential functions of the employment position” (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112(a)). Yet empirical studies suggest that, over the past two decades, Title I of the ADA has fallen far short of Congress’s intentions. Two well-known papers by DeLeire (2000) and Acemoglu and Angrist (2001) demonstrate that, instead of improving the position of the disabled in the labor market, employment has actually declined for the disabled since Title I went into effect on July 26, 1992. Subsequent papers such as Hotchkiss (2004) and Bound and Waidmann (2002) have questioned the methodology of earlier estimates, but even after re-estimating the wage and employment outcomes of the disabled after the ADA, these papers admit that labor market outcomes for the disabled, at best, remained the same after the effective date of Title I. Although multiple issues may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of Title I, certainly one of the greatest obstacles encountered by ADA plaintiffs was the fact that Congress’s definition of disability in the Act was anything but clear. Congress defined an ADA disability as “(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.” (ADA 1990 §3(2)). But Congress failed to define what the terms “impairment,” “substantially limits,” “major life activities,” and “regarded as” precisely meant. Nor did Congress provide any rules of construction for the undefined terms in the ADA. As a result, years of litigation ensued over the meaning of these terms and, more broadly, over who was disabled for the purposes of the ADA. Coverage under the ADA’s definition may have been relatively certain for individuals confined to a wheelchair, but coverage was much less certain for individuals affected by a host of other debilitating conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Among the conditions for which coverage was uncertain under the 1990 ADA was obesity.Footnote 1 The negative effects of obesity on wage and employment outcomes are well documented (Cawley 2004; Pagan and Davila 1997; Averett and Korenman 1996). Similar to the labor market penalty experienced by individuals with most other types of disabilities, the obesity penalty may consist of both a penalty related to reduced productivity, suggested by the long list of comorbidities associated with obesity, including musculoskeletal conditions (Hergenroeder et al. 2011; Alley & Chang 2007), and a penalty related to taste-based discrimination, suggested by the persistence of the negative wage and employment effects for women, but not for men, after controlling for individual characteristics (Shinall 2016; Cawley 2004).Footnote 2 Still, the question with which most courts wrestled regarding obesity was whether it was a covered “impairment” under the 1990 ADA (as opposed to an uncovered physical condition). With the exception of a single federal appellate court, federal courts generally answered this question in the negative. Fortunately for the obese (and many other individuals seeking disability status under the ADA), the legal environment improved in 2008. In response to decisions by the US Supreme Court and federal appellate courts that had severely limited coverage under the ADA, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA). The ADAAA clarified many of the definitional ambiguities of the 1990 Act, including definitions of the crucial terms “substantially limits,” “major life activities,” and “regarded as” within its provisions. Moreover, Congress provided rules of construction in the amended Act that admonished federal courts to construe the term “disability…in favor of broad coverage of individuals…to the maximum extent permitted” (42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A)). In expanding the coverage of the ADA in 2008, Congress did not specifically identify obesity or any other medical condition as a covered disability.Footnote 3 Nonetheless, Congress’s broad command has led the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to revise its official ADA guidance substantially. With respect to obesity, the prior guidance stated that obesity would only be a covered disability under the ADA in “rare circumstances,” but the current guidance now states that “severe obesity, which has been defined as body weight more than 100 % over the norm…is clearly an impairment” (EEOC 2009). The EEOC’s definition of severe obesity roughly equates to the medical definition of morbid obesity, which is a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more (the BMI of a normal-weight person ranges from 18.5 to less than 25). Congress’s broad command also appears to have convinced federal courts to view the claims of morbidly obese individuals seeking the ADA’s protections more favorably. As a result of the ADAAA, obese individuals—and particularly morbidly obese individuals—are positioned to see improvements in labor market outcomes now more than ever before. Because the legal treatment of obesity has shifted since the 2008 Amendments, the possibility of seeing a large and substantial improvement in nationwide employment outcomes of the heaviest individuals in the labor market seems quite plausible. Consequently, the principal focus of this paper will be to examine how morbidly obese individuals have fared in terms of employment and in terms of presence in the labor market since the passage of the ADAAA. Using 2004 through 2013 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), I estimate the 2008 Amendments’ labor market effects. In spite of the potential for the amended ADA to improve the labor market outcomes of obese individuals, I find little evidence that it has actually improved their outcomes. These estimates suggest that, so far, the ADAAA in action has not been much more effective in the labor market than its predecessor. My investigation of how expanding the definition of disability under the ADA has impacted the heaviest individuals in the labor market will proceed as follows. Section 2 discusses the legal treatment of obese individuals under the 1990 version of the ADA, and Section 3 examines how this legal treatment has changed since the 2008 Amendments. Section 4 elaborates on my data and empirical methodology, and Section 5 presents my results. Section 6 discusses the implications of these results both for the obese and for the disabled generally, considering why the ADA in action may diverge from the ADA in print.",2

As a result, the number of Internet users has skyrocketed. A recent report by the International Telecommunications Union shows that at the end of 2014, almost three billion people had access to the Internet (ITU 2014). Globally, close to 44 % of households have Internet access at home. The economic and societal changes that result from these developments are considerable and have attracted the attention from academics and policymakers. Along with the advancement of the Internet, researchers have increasingly shown interest in the worldwide web, not only as a research subject but also as a potential data source. This interest has not been limited to a single field but stretches out across many different domains. In the discipline of economics, labour economics has been identified as a field for which web-based data are particularly promising. In their seminal papers, Kuhn and Skuterud (2004) and Askitas and Zimmermann (2009, 2015) argue that web data could be very valuable to do research on the labour market. The Internet has transformed the labour market in many ways. Autor (2001) identifies three dimensions through which the web has affected the labour market: how firms and workers search for each other (e.g. employers look for “passive” candidates, on-the-job search), how labour services are delivered (e.g. skills required online) and how local labour demand is shaped (e.g. impact of e-commerce). Technological change indeed has greatly affected job search, application, selection and matching (Carnevale et al. 2014; Kuhn 2014; Kuhn and Mansour 2014). A recent survey suggests that 80 % of the HR teams use social media when hiring new employees (Konetic 2014). In this article, we aim to provide an overview of novel web-based data sources and their potential as sources for labour market research. In this way, we aspire to contribute to the literature on the link between the Internet and the labour market. There already is a large and quickly growing body of literature on the use of data from job portals for labour market analysis. Indeed, in this very issue of IZA JOLE, there is a paper by Kureková et al. (2015) on the methodological issues involved in using vacancies from job portals (and also, to a lesser degree, the WageIndicator survey). For this reason, we decided to survey other sources of data. While these sources have not been ignored by researchers, their utilisation has been lower, and there is also a lack of survey literature bringing together all strands. We therefore describe alternative data sources covering the supply, demand or both sides of the labour market and explain why we are convinced of the potential of these data as excellent platforms and sources for labour market research. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, a brief overview of web-based research is presented. The section first discusses how the Internet became more prominent as a research platform and data source. To this end, the section includes an analysis of early web-based work. As a second step, a series of relatively new web-based data sources is described. These sources comprise data extracted from online job boards and intermediaries, Google Trends, social networks and surveys. Sections 3, 4 and 5 present more details on the new data sources. In each of these sections, first, the data source is described and then empirical applications that make use of the source are surveyed. We consider not only articles published in scientific journals but also prospective work and other contributions. We examine how the data source is, or could be, used for labour market analysis. Section 3 introduces Google Trends. In Section 4, we focus on three social networks: LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Section 5 deals with web-based surveys and Glassdoor in particular. Section 6 of the article summarises our findings and outlines some paths for future research.",12

Hull,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Across disciplines, there is a long literature on the relationship between family background and educational outcomes. Despite the widely held value of equality of opportunity, past research has documented that the family into which a child is born has a large impact on the course of his life. However, the family environment should also be understood as a dynamic environment: Changes in family life can also have a substantial influence on educational outcomes. While many analyses focus on permanent family characteristics, there is also a literature that examines the impact of various transitory ones. In this paper, I formulate a new method to quantify the time-varying role of the family using a within-sibling-year measure, and then, I use this method to estimate its importance for student time use and achievement. Studies of permanent family characteristics have examined both the share of the variation in an outcome that can be attributed to the family as well as the impact of specific family characteristics on outcomes. In the literature on sibling correlations, researchers often estimate a linear model with a family effect and then analyze estimates of the variance components. Results indicate that at least half of the variation in educational attainment and adult IQ is due to factors shared by siblings (Björklund and Salvanes 2011; Björklund and Jäntti 2012). Although this fraction is sizable, these shared factors include the family environment in addition to shared genes, neighborhoods, and schools. Importantly for this study, sibling correlations for adult outcomes fail to isolate the role of time-dependent family factors. Other strands of the literature on permanent family characteristics have focused on the effect of specific characteristics, like parent’s educational attainment or race, and find that many of these play a substantial role in children’s outcomes.1
 What role is there for the time-varying family environment? While many family-level traits are fixed at birth, others change as a child ages. A number of studies have used fixed effects strategies or exogenous variation to analyze the causal impact of specific factors. For example, Stevens and Schaller (2011) employ child fixed effects to determine that parental job loss increases the probability of grade retention. Ananat et al. (2011) use plant closings as an exogenous source of job loss, and Lyle (2006) uses military deployments and job assignments during the Gulf War to study the impact of parental absences and household relocations. Milligan and Stabile (2011) and Dahl and Lochner (2012) exploit changes to government benefits to estimate that a $1000 increase in income increases test scores by about 0.06 standard deviations for children from low-income families. Another related paper is Carneiro and Ginja (2016), which studies how permanent and transitory income shocks affect parental investments in children. Many more transitory family factors could affect student learning, but we may not observe them or even be able to measure them. For example, a negative health shock to a sibling or grandparent could affect student learning and time use, but these are often not observed.2 An increase in parental oversight could impact student time use and achievement, but the various dimensions of parental oversight are difficult, if not impossible, to measure. Studies about job loss or income shocks help us understand the relationship between specific family-level changes and student achievement, but they do not provide a higher-level understanding of the time-varying role of the family. This paper takes a step toward the bigger picture by treating these transitory traits as a bundle and quantifying their importance. In this paper, I begin with a model of student outcomes that is commonly found in the test score literature, though I apply the model to both test scores and time use outcomes. I then decompose the error from the model into a family-year-specific component and the rest of the error. I call this family-year fixed effect the “family innovation,” but this is merely shorthand for a whole bundle of time-varying family factors, which could include planned inputs or shocks that are not captured by the other controls in the regression. A unique data set from North Carolina that merges administrative school data with birth records makes this analysis possible.3 I identify the family innovations from sibling pairs observed in the same year. To quantify the time-varying role of the family, I calculate the standard deviation of these family innovation parameters for two test scores and four measures of student time use.4 I also analyze the correlations between family innovations to different student outcomes, both for the whole sample and by socioeconomic status. These correlations tell us whether time-varying family circumstances that affect one outcome also tend to affect others. I find that the time-varying family environment plays an important role in student time use and test scores. A one standard deviation move in the distribution of family innovation parameters is associated with a 0.17 standard deviation change in math score and a 0.19 standard deviation change in reading score. These results indicate that the time-dependent family environment is more important than teacher assignment for student achievement. For example, recent estimates from Chetty et al. (2014) show that a one standard deviation change in teacher quality moves math scores by 0.14 standard deviations and English scores by 0.1 standard deviations.5 The time use results imply that a one standard deviation increase in the distribution of family innovations increases homework time by 18 h, free reading time by 28 h, and TV watching by 102 h over the course of the school year. These changes are 20–22% of the average time use for each activity. The results vary by the characteristics of the sibling pair, and they are robust to models that allow different students to be on different learning trajectories. When I analyze the correlations between family innovations for different outcomes, I find that family innovations to achievement are most strongly (and positively) related to family innovations to educational uses of time (i.e., homework and free reading). However, these correlations vary by the socioeconomic status of the family. The results suggest that programs targeted to increase education-related time inputs at home could produce gains to student achievement, especially among low-SES students. The analysis in this paper is descriptive in nature: I do not attempt to ascribe a causal interpretation to the family innovation parameter.6 My goal is simply to apply a fixed effects strategy to evaluate the relative importance of time-dependent family circumstances for student outcomes. The family innovation parameter captures a bundle of factors that make a set of sibling outcomes deviate from their expected growth. In this sense, it only captures aspects of the bundle that lead sibling outcomes to move together. Correlated shocks across siblings could result from parental behavior, from social interaction effects, from local neighborhood shocks, or just from unobserved characteristics that are shared by siblings and affect changes in test scores and other outcomes. Conceiving of the family innovation as a bundle of factors is consistent with the literature on sibling correlations.7 Whereas past studies have focused on specific inputs and events affecting the family, the results presented here suggest a larger role for the time-varying family environment than perhaps previously thought. In the next section, I detail my method for estimating the family innovation parameters. I describe the matched education and birth data sets in Section 3. Section 4 contains the main results, and Section 5 discusses heterogeneity in the results by child and family characteristics. Section 6 concludes.",1

This caused the literature to converge towards a debate on the size of such—mostly small—employment effects, as well as potential alternative channels of adjustment within affected firms (see among others, Addison 2017 or Bossler and Gerner 2016). Bárány (2016) argues that an increase in training might be one of these adjustment channels and may serve as an explanation for only small disemployment effects. According to the economic theory, minimum wages could negatively impact the incentives for employees to realize human capital accumulation due to lower expected returns from training. Secondly, they could reduce employers’ willingness to finance further training as part of cost-saving strategies. In case of non-competitive labor markets, a counteractive increase in training investments could be used to restore productivity-dependent rents. Following these arguments, it seems sensible to complement empirical studies of employment effects (e.g., Bossler and Gerner 2016) with evidence on minimum wage-induced impacts on training at the workplace level. Of the 28 member states of the European Union, 22 have a statutory minimum wage, while sectoral-specific minimum wages and collective bargaining regimes are used in the remaining six countries (Schulten 2016). In Germany, the statutory minimum wage came into force on 1 January 2015 after it was approved in parliament on 11 July 2014. It is the first compulsory minimum wage that it is valid to all employees with only minor exemptions.1 The minimum wage was introduced in response to a period of two decades of a substantial decrease in collective bargaining coverage and an increase in wage inequality. The new minimum wage is largely binding, and employer expectations surveyed prior to the minimum wage introduction make adjustments in firm-financed training likely (Bossler 2017). Based on a biennial suggestion of the newly introduced minimum wage commission, the minimum wage can be adjusted by a legislative decree of the German Federal Government. The Minimum Wage Law §9(2) determines that the commission shall suggest a minimum wage that contributes to an appropriate minimum protection of workers and to fair and performing conditions of competition and does not jeopardize employment. While there is no clear connection between the height of the minimum wage and the cost of living, the law states that the development of the minimum wage should align the development of collectively bargained wages in Germany. This article studies the minimum wage effects on training in course of an introduction of a statutory minimum wage in continental Europe. Applying difference-in-differences estimation techniques to data of the IAB Establishment Panel 2011–2015, the analysis contributes to the literature on training and minimum wages in three aspects. First, we present training effects of the new statutory minimum wage in Germany, which was introduced on 1 January 2015. Second, we can distinguish between three types of training (external training courses, internal training courses, and training on the job) and three skill groups (unskilled workers, workers with vocational qualifications, workers with university degrees). Third, we distinguish between training that is solely firm-financed and training which includes employee expenditures. The empirical analysis of minimum wage effects on training with establishment data is a useful supplement to investigations of individual data. However, employer-employee data that include the time period of the German minimum wage introduction are not yet available. The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical aspects presented in previous literature based on which we formulate empirical hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data and microeconometric methods of our analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical results including a sample description, the baseline difference-in-differences results, robustness checks, and effect heterogeneities with respect to sectors, types of training, the employees’ financial participation at training costs, and training by qualification levels. Section 5 concludes.",4

Better air quality reduces infant mortality (Bobak and Leon 1992; Chay and Greenstone 2003a, b; Currie and Neidell 2005; Loomis et al. 1999) and respiratory problems in both infants and adults (Chauhan and Johnston 2003; Emmanuel 2000; Romieu et al. 2002) and can even improve mental health and cognition (Peterson et al. 2015). From an economic perspective, pollution has social costs that go beyond the direct costs associated with these negative health consequences. Having health problems, even transitory ones, not only imposes a direct cost on those affected but also can lead to further social losses stemming from reduced productivity or reduced labor activity of those affected. There is ample evidence in the literature that shows negative consequences of pollution on labor supply (Aragon et al. 2016; Carson et al. 2010; Hanna and Oliva 2015; Hausman et al. 1984) and on worker productivity (Chang et al. 2014; Crocker and Horst 1981; Graff-Zivin and Neidell 2012). There is also evidence that pollution affects school absenteeism, which can further affect work hours for workers taking care of these sick children (Currie et al. 2009; Gilliland et al. 2001; Park et al. 2002). Most of the existent evidence focuses, however, only on the short-term impact of pollution. Research on its medium- and long-term effects is limited. Studying the effects of pollution over longer time horizons is important as some of its negative effects could be persistent over time and harder for exposed individuals to recover from. Among the few recent studies that try to address the issue in the long term, Kim et al. (2016) show negative effects of pollution on a range of health measures that persist even 10 years post exposure, while Isen et al. (2016) show negative effects on labor supply and earnings in the USA for those who were exposed to pollution during their early childhood. Our paper is among the first to study the medium- and long-term effects of pollution on labor supply in a developing country and adds to the very limited evidence by studying the issue at the aggregate population level and by using a fully exogenous pollution shock, rather than achieving identification through some policy change that might be suffering from other confounders. The closest paper to our study that we are aware of is Hanna and Oliva (2015). They however differ from us in that they study the reverse phenomenon of pollution reduction. Isen et al. (2016) is another paper with a similar research question. However, they only focus on the early childhood exposure and use a policy change in the 1970s to identify the effect of pollution exposure, which is overall less persuasive than the direct evidence of pollution exposure our study uses. At the same time, an important difference between these studies and ours is that we are dealing with a relatively short but intense pollution shock, while they study a sustained decrease in pollution over time. Since the impact of pollution might not be linear, the resulting estimates need to be put in context and interpreted accordingly. We propose to study the medium- and long-term2 effects of air pollution on labor supply, using data from Indonesia and taking advantage of a natural experiment that offers the unique opportunity of having a truly randomly assigned pollution shock. In the fall of 1997, large parts of Indonesia were engulfed in forest fires that originated with slash-and-burn practices commonly used by farmers as a cheap way of clearing land but were aggravated by the especially dry and windy season caused by El Niño. The fires burned out of control between August and November 1997, destroying over 12 million acres of land and covering much of Indonesia in smoke3. This episode has been widely used in the literature to study a variety of issues surrounding air pollution. Frankenberg et al. (2004) find older individuals exposed to the smoke are less able to perform daily activities. Jayachandran (2009) finds reduced fertility in the areas most exposed to pollution. Kunii et al. (2002) find elevated levels of respiratory illnesses during the fires, which might have indirect effects on hours worked. The pollution was so severe that even neighboring countries suffered from it. Emmanuel (2000) and Heil (2000), for instance, find an increase in respiratory illnesses and other acute health issues in Singapore, while Sastry (2002) finds increased mortality among the elderly in Malaysia. All these documented health issues could have direct effects on labor markets, and these effects could persist over time. Our paper tries to fill-in this gap of the literature and study these longer-term effects of pollution on labor supply. We find that higher pollution reduces the hours worked in both the medium- and the long term. We capture medium-term effects 3 years past exposure and long-term effects 10 years past exposure. The medium-term effects are larger in magnitude, which is consistent with a hypothesis of recovery over time, but some effects still persist 10 years after exposure. We also underline two distinct channels that lead to reduced labor supply as a result of pollution exposure: own health and dependent caregiving.",26

Existing studies estimate that around a third of American workers are “overeducated”—i.e., have more schooling than is necessary for their job.1 These would include, for example, a college graduate working as a cashier in a store. Estimated wage returns to this surplus schooling average 4.3%, or about half of the returns to required schooling. Thus, schooling mismatch appears to be an important source of the ex post heterogeneity in returns to schooling documented in the literature (see, e.g., Carneiro et al., 2003). At the aggregate level, overeducation could reflect skill mismatch and an inefficient allocation of workers to jobs. What cross-sectional data miss is the possibility that overeducated workers may only be temporarily underemployed before switching to a job that requires their level of schooling. Further, low unobserved ability, compensating non-pecuniary job characteristics and career mobility considerations could rationalize apparent overeducation without the implication of a suboptimal schooling choice.2 In order to understand how much of a problem overeducation really is, it is crucial to go beyond the cross-sectional stylized facts and investigate longitudinal patterns. This paper provides the first analysis of the career dynamics of overeducated US workers. Specifically, we use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), combined with the pooled 1989–1991 waves of the Current Population Survey (CPS), to examine how overeducated employment spells persist, exhibit duration dependence, and are associated with future wages. Most of our analysis will focus on the causes and consequences of overeducated employment among 2- and 4-year college graduates, who make up the bulk of overeducated workers.3
 While the literature has paid comparatively little attention to the longitudinal dimension, analyzing transitions into and out of overeducated employment, together with their effects on wages, is key to disentangling the role played by labor market frictions versus other theories of overeducation.4 For example, if overeducation was due only to search frictions, one would expect this type of mismatch to be transitory and concentrated early in the career. Conversely, selection on ability, compensating wage differentials or career mobility motives would generate persistence in the overeducation patterns.5 The individual persistence and duration dependence of overeducated employment, together with the wage penalties associated with it, are also important for the design of unemployment insurance and training programs. For instance, encouraging early exit from unemployment may push more workers into overeducated work with potentially negative long-term effects on earnings. The question of overeducation was first brought to the attention of economists and policymakers by Freeman (1976), who argued that excess supply of college graduates was causing the decline in the college wage premium observed in the USA during the 1970s. While the cross-sectional properties of overeducation are well-studied (see, e.g., Alba-Ramirez 1993; Hartog 2000; Kiker et al. 1997; Verdugo and Verdugo 1989), still little is known about the evolution of overeducation over the life cycle, although, as argued above, dynamics are of clear interest in this context. US evidence is particularly scarce.6
 A notable exception is Rubb (2003) who provides evidence from the CPS that overeducation displays a substantial degree of persistence, with around 30% of the individuals overeducated in year t switching to a job which matches their level of education in year t+1. While duration dependence and dynamic selection effects imply that these transition rates are likely to decrease over the length of the spell, the CPS panels are too short to address this question adequately. It is worth pointing out that while we borrow the wording “required level of education” from the existing literature, defining and measuring that concept is not a trivial task. In this paper, we use a statistical measure, in a similar spirit as, e.g., Verdugo and Verdugo (1989) and Kiker et al. (1997). Namely, we compute the mode of the distribution of schooling in the 1989–1991 CPS for each occupation in the 1980 3-digit Census Occupation classification. We also restrict the CPS sample used to compute the mode to individuals in the same birth cohorts as the NLSY79 respondents. The required levels of education are then defined as those within 15 percentage points of the schooling mode.7 The typical overeducated worker in our sample has 2 or 4 years of college education, but is working as a secretary or a cashier, say, among a majority of high school graduates. Relative to alternative approaches in the literature, and in particular those measuring the required levels of education with the General Educational Development (GED) scale provided by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (see, e.g., Hartog 1980; Rumberger 1987), this approach is arguably more transparent and has the benefit of directly generating requirements in terms of years of education. We document longitudinal patterns of overeducation for the NLSY79 cohort up to 12 years after labor market entry. Overeducation incidence within the cohort decreases as workers progress through their careers but remains sizeable 12 years after the first job. This suggests that, while frictions are likely to play a role, we need to appeal to other economic mechanisms to explain this long-term persistence. Overeducation is also a fairly persistent phenomenon at the individual level, with around 66% of overeducated workers remaining in overeducated employment after 1 year. We find that blacks and low cognitive ability workers (as measured by their AFQT scores) are not only more likely to be overeducated but also less likely to switch into matched jobs. That is, the longitudinal dimension magnifies the cross-sectional black-white and cognitive ability gaps. The hazard rate out of overeducated work is also strongly decreasing in overeducation duration and drops by about 60% after 5 years. We estimate a mixed proportional hazard model (Elbers and Ridder 1982) of overeducated employment duration to investigate whether this decreasing hazard rate reflects selection on unobservables or true duration dependence. While composition effects based on observable characteristics explain away some of the duration dependence, further controlling for unobserved heterogeneity largely wipes it out. In other words, the duration of the overeducated employment spell does not have a significant impact on the probability to exit overeducation. Instead, we identify large unobservable differences in the hazard rate: while overeducation is found to be very persistent for 30% of the sample, the rest is much more likely to exit quickly, in keeping with a frictional view of overeducation. The latter pattern provides clear evidence that there is generally more to overeducation than selection on unobserved ability and preferences. We then revisit the classical augmented wage regression used in the overeducation literature and document a robust and statistically—as well as economically—significant negative association between past overeducated employment and wages.8 This pattern holds after controlling for observed measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. We further show that past overeducation remains associated with lower wages after adding controls for unobserved ability that are constructed from the heterogeneity types identified in the duration analysis. The results from our preferred specification show that, for a non-overeducated worker, past overeducation is associated with a sizeable wage penalty of between 2.6 and 4.2%, which persists over 4 years. This provides a likely candidate mechanism behind the negative wage effects of graduating during a recession (Kahn 2010; Oreopoulos et al. 2012; Altonji et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016), since, consistent with the cyclical upgrading literature (Bils and McLaughlin 2001), overeducation is likely to be more frequent during recessions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the sample used in the analysis, the construction of the required schooling measure and compares the cross-sectional properties of our measure of overeducation to the literature. Section 3 documents the longitudinal patterns in the incidence of overeducated employment along the career. Section 4 estimates a mixed proportional hazard model of overeducated employment duration allowing us to separate true duration dependence from dynamic selection on observed and unobserved worker attributes. Section 5 presents results pertaining to the effect of past overeducation on wages, and Section 6 concludes.",13

Conceptually and empirically, field-of-study mismatch is distinct from qualifications mismatch in that a worker may be matched to the job in terms of the quantity of schooling received (qualification match) but not by the type of schooling received (Sloane 2003; Robst 2008; Quintini 2011a). Seen this way, field-of-study mismatch is a form of horizontal mismatch while qualification mismatch is a form of vertical mismatch (Verhaest et al. 2013). In studying field-of-study mismatch, the literature has generally ignored how skill supply and skill demand dynamics influence mismatch and the relationship between horizontal and vertical mismatch in the wage penalty associated with field-of-study mismatch. Using the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), an internationally comparable survey of adult skills, this paper addresses both gaps and updates cross-national estimates of field-of-study and qualification mismatch.",27
6.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,13 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-016-0051-y,A new measure of skill mismatch: theory and evidence from PIAAC,December 2017,Michele Pellizzari,Anne Fichen,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"A large number of studies investigate the nature and consequences of mismatch, generally defined as some sort of discrepancy between the characteristics of employed workers and the requirements of the jobs that they occupy (Quintini 2011a). For example, several papers compare the formal education qualifications held by employed workers with the requirements of their jobs, commonly finding large numbers of workers being more qualified than necessary (Chevalier 2003; Dolton and Vignoles 2000; Groot and Maassen van den Brink 2000; Quintini 2011b; Rubb 2003; Sicherman 1991; Sloane et al. 1999). This finding can be rationalized by arguing, for example, that over-qualified workers may not have benefited from formal education as much as they could have and that their actual competencies are less advanced than those one would normally expect them to possess based on their formal educational qualifications. At the same time, workers who are found to be under-qualified for their jobs may have acquired the necessary skills to perform satisfactorily outside formal schooling, through experience, on-the-job learning and adult education (Green and McIntosh 2007; Chevalier and Lindley 2009). Hence, it is interesting to contrast qualification mismatch with skill mismatch, namely the discrepancy between the skills possessed by a workers and those required to perform his/her job (Allen and van der Velden 2001; Desjardins and Rubenson 2011). Over-skilled workers are those who are more skilled than required by their jobs, the opposite for under-skilled workers. Unfortunately, measuring skill mismatch is particularly challenging, mostly due to the lack of direct information about workers’ skills and job requirements. A large literature has now emerged proposing various methodologies to measure mismatch in skills (Allen and van der Velden 2001; Green and McIntosh 2007; Quintini 2011a; Flisi et al. 2014; Desjardins and Rubenson 2011; CEDEFOP 2010; van der Velden and Bijlsma 2016) and the comparison and assessment of these many methodologies is the subject of a sometimes heated debate, centred around the definition of the skill requirements of jobs or the appropriateness of direct comparisons between skill endowments and skill use (Levels et al. 2013). Our view of this debate is that it suffers from a serious lack of theory. The typical paper in this area addresses the measurement problem without really providing a formal definition of the underlying theoretical notion that is meant to be measured, thus making it very difficult to compare the many proposed indicators. In most cases, they simply measure different underlying concepts. In this paper, we develop a simple theory that guides our use of the data from OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) to construct a new indicator of mismatch. Our model is closely anchored to the specific data that we use and cannot be seen as a general theory of mismatch. Nevertheless, the approach to measurement of skill mismatch that we derive can be easily generalized to any other dataset sharing the same key features. The OECD Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) includes a rich battery of questions on skill use at work and direct indicators of workers’ skill proficiency derived from a purposely designed assessment exercise. The survey covers a large number of countries and guarantees a high degree of comparability across borders thanks to the harmonized sampling procedures and the common questionnaire (OECD 2013a).1
 In summary, the proposed methodology uses the simple theoretical framework to overcome the fundamental problem of defining the skill requirements of jobs from a survey of workers. Specifically, for each available skill domain and each occupation, minimum and maximum requirements are defined as the minimum and the maximum proficiency of self-reported well-matched workers.2 Within this framework, workers are classified as well-matched in a skill domain if their proficiency score in that domain is between the minimum and maximum requirements of her occupation. Workers are over-skilled or under-skilled in a domain if their score is above the maximum or below the minimum requirement. Three additional features of the approach described in this paper are worth mentioning. First, alternative measures of the minimum and maximum skill requirements can be produced by comparing the extremes of the distributions of assessed competencies for the under- and over-skilled and the well-matched. Such comparison allows assessing the relevance of misreporting in the estimated requirements. Second, exploiting the rich background questionnaire of the PIAAC survey, it is possible to compare the utilization of skills in the workplace by similarly proficient workers who are well-matched or mismatched in their jobs, thus constructing indicators of the degree of under- and over-utilization of skills associated with mismatch. Finally, our approach allows designing simple reassignment algorithms that, far from solving the problem of optimally allocating workers to jobs, can be used to compare the distribution of skill mismatch across alternative allocations and thus measure their relative efficiency. In addition, we also develop a general procedure to construct standard errors for estimates of skill-mismatch derived from surveys like PIAAC, where the sampling frames can differ substantially across countries and where the test scores are derived from imputation models. Such a procedure can be computationally intense, but it is very general and it can be easily applied to any non-linear estimator constructed with the PIAAC data. The procedure is described in the Appendix. The results of our analysis show that on average, across the entire survey, approximately 75% of dependent employees are well-matched in the literacy domain, about 9% are under-skilled and 16% are over-skilled. The overlap between literacy and numeracy mismatch is substantial: 90% of the workers who are well-matched in literacy are also well-matched in numeracy. Men are more likely to be over-skilled than women, whereas gender differences in under-skilling are minor. Tertiary graduates are less likely to be under-skilled than less educated workers, and they are also more likely to be over-skilled. Foreign workers are more than twice more likely to be under-skilled than natives and substantially less likely to be over-skilled. Differences emerge also when looking across age groups. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarises the relevant literature. Section 3 lays out the proposed methodology to measure skill mismatch, starting from its theoretical underpinnings and including a discussion of the empirical implementation and of the impact of misreporting. Section 4 briefly describes the PIAAC data and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 5 reports comparable estimates of skill mismatch and skill under- and over-utilization across the countries covered in PIAAC, for the entire population and for various subgroups. Section 6 presents an extension of the approach to construct measures of the over- and under-utilization of workers’ skills. Section 7 compares the distribution of skill mismatch observed in the data with those resulting from a variety of reassignment procedures. Finally, Section 8 concludes by highlighting the importance of this analysis for both academic research and policy making.",28
7.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,12 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-018-0071-x,Headscarf and job recruitment—lifting the veil of labour market discrimination,December 2018,Attakrit Leckcivilize,Alexander Straub,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The topic of discrimination based on, for example, ethnic origin and gender in the labour market came under scrutiny of the economics discipline after the influential doctoral dissertation entitled The Economics of Discrimination by the Nobel laureate Gary Becker in 1957. Becker proposed the concept of taste discrimination in which prejudiced persons receive disutility from their interaction with certain groups of people. Hence, they monetise their prejudice by applying a mark-up to the transaction. Even if two demographic groups were to have identical productive characteristics, such a mark-up leads to differences in compensation. In the labour market, taste discrimination can be classified by the source of the prejudice into employer, employee, and customer discrimination. To consistently estimate the impacts of discrimination, researchers would ideally like to observe labour market performances of two groups which are the same in every aspect except for the characteristic of interest such as gender or ethnic origin (see Baert (2018); Bertrand and Duflo (2016); Lane (2016); Zschirnt and Ruedin (2016) for extensive review). Many studies (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Carlsson and Rooth 2007) focused on racial discrimination at the very first stage of entry into the labour market and adopted the technique called “correspondence testing”, which is to create fake CVs, allocate fake ethnicity at random to each CV, then send these CVs to job adverts. They found that ethnic minorities received significantly fewer callbacks for job interviews. However, in some studies (Kaas and Manger 2012), such a difference disappears when favourable information about the applicants’ personality is included in the applications. They interpreted this finding as evidence for statistical discriminationFootnote 1. In terms of appearance, Hamermesh and Biddle (1994) found significant effects of beauty on earnings in the USA. Yet there is evidence of sorting by looks and beauty premium from some occupations, such as salespersons and lawyers, where the workers have to appear in public or confront the buyers directly (Biddle and Hamermesh 1998). Hence, a fraction of the beauty premium could result from productive characteristics of beauty. A few studies used the correspondence testing technique in this domain as well. Rooth (2009) showed that an obese applicant received 20% fewer callbacks for an interview. Based on the correlation between job performance and being obese, he concluded that customer discrimination and/or statistical discrimination could be the explanation. On the other hand, Kraft (2012) found that unattractive candidates are 14% less likely to get an invitation and have to wait a couple of days longer for a callback. However, he did not find differential effects between high and low customer contact positions. Recently, there are studies using correspondence testing to uncover discrimination against certain religious practices. In France, Valfort (2017) distinguished effects of applicants’ religion from their country of origin by comparing the callback rates among fictitious candidates whose religion is Catholic, Judaism, or Islam. All of them came from Lebanon, completed their high school, then received a certificate in Paris and became naturalised French citizens. She found that practising Catholic raises a callback rate by 30 and 100% respectively higher than being a Jew or being a Muslim. However, these disadvantages could be alleviated if the applicants signalled through extra-curricular activities in their CVs that they were secular rather than serious practitioners of these religions. With regard to religious practice signalled by attire, Weichselbaumer (2016) sent out the same CV of a female candidate with different combination of names and photos to job openings for secretaries, accountants, and chief accountants in Germany. Particularly, she took photos of the same woman with and without headscarf and assigned either German or Turkish sounding names to the CV. Her results showed that a photo with German name was significantly more likely to get a callback than the same photo with Turkish name. In addition, a woman with a Turkish name and headscarf suffered additional discrimination compared to the same Turkish woman without headscarf. Incorporating more variation in characteristics of both applicants and recruiters than previous studies, this paper demonstrates that interaction between religious practice and positive characteristics of applicants can mitigate impacts of discrimination, while it provides some evidence of additional heterogeneous effects based on recruiters’ characteristics. Particularly, our study design combines a randomised CV approach with a laboratory experiment, which allows us to assess the effects of beauty, ethnicity, and religious practice in the same empirical model. We recruited students from universities in Hannover, Germany, to participate in an experiment where they were asked to select applicants for an interview for fictitious positions from a pool of candidates whose CVs were randomised in every other aspect except for appearance. An additional advantage of conducting such a lab experiment is to be able to control for personal characteristics of the participants (acting as HR recruiters) involved in the selection processFootnote 2. We also tracked the time each participant used to evaluate each part of the presented CVs. This extra information allows us to (partially) control for the dual-process framework in judgement and decision making that could lead to bias in the hiring process (Derous et al. 2016). The dual-process theories involve type 1 and type 2 processes where the former is spontaneous, intuitive, effortless, and fast, while the latter is deliberate, rule-governed, effortful, and slow (Kahneman and Frederick 2002). Specifically, we can control for the relative time each participant spends on each component of a particular CV, especially the photo page, with respect to his or her own average. Hence, any influences of heuristics involving type 1 process could be partialled out from our results. Exploiting a sizeable proportion of Turkish descendants in Germany, we randomly insert photos of the same Turkish-looking women with and without headscarf into CVs in the experimentFootnote 3. Apart from providing consistent estimates of the differences in the probability of being selected for an interview owing to beauty, ethnicity, and headscarf, we attempt to identify the source of such discrimination based on job positions, characteristics of the CVs, and the participants. Specifically, we classify our job openings into high- and low-skilled occupations as well as jobs with and without (or minimal) customer contact. We hypothesise recruiting for occupations with more interaction with customers would prefer better-looking persons and avoid minorities or females with headscarf due to anticipated customer discrimination, hence leading to potentially higher productivity such as higher sales. Conversely, any discrimination observed in low customer contact jobs such as back-office operations could mainly arise from either within firm (employer/employee) discrimination or statistical discrimination. Our results suggest that the beauty premium prevails in all types of occupations and is quite large in high-skilled occupations. So, the beauty premium could be driven by both taste discrimination and potential productive attributes of beauty. Nevertheless, a slightly larger premium in high-skilled jobs supports the argument for employee discrimination because this is a sector where our participants could relate to the candidates as their future co-workers. Interestingly, better-looking candidates with the same gender as the recruiter are less likely to be chosen for the interview. Although a simple difference in the probability of being chosen between Turkish and German applicants shows a significant discrimination against Turks, such an effect disappears after controlling for beauty and interactions between some applicants’ characteristics and headscarf. This finding provides an alternative explanation to the previous studies that racial discrimination in Germany might be partly explained by the fact that Turkish applicants (at least in our sample) are perceived as less beautiful than German-looking counterparts. Similar to Weichselbaumer (2016), Baert et al. (2017), and Valfort (2017), we find that positive characteristics mitigate negative impacts of religious practice and ethnicity in job recruitment. Such results provide circumstantial evidence for the importance of statistical discrimination (Haan et al. 2017) and biased beliefs (Reuben et al. 2014) as potential causes of discrimination against headscarf. In other words, supplying more productivity-relevant information could reduce average differences in perceived unobservable characteristics between candidates with and without headscarf. Yet unlike, for example, Baert and De Pauw (2014) who gather information on key attitudes underlying different mechanisms, our method is only an indirect way (yet popular among researchers) to try to isolate taste-based discrimination from statistical discrimination (Bertrand and Duflo 2016). Specifically, the main goal of our study is to investigate when people discriminate against the headscarf, rather than why. Despite the non-dynamic setting of our experiment, a reversal in discrimination effects against headscarf from over-penalised candidates with low characteristics to over-rewarded those with high characteristics is in line with a theory of dynamics of discrimination proposed by (Bohren JA, Imas A, Rosenberg, M: The dynamics of discrimination: theory and evidence, unpublished). Using data from an online platform, they showed that women with no prior evaluation score on the platform were discriminated against but women with a history of positive evaluations were favoured over their men counterparts. Similar to our case, the recruiters may hold a certain kind of biased beliefs in abilities of female with a headscarf. Thus, extra information on positive characteristics helps to reverse negative effects of discrimination into advantages for this group of applicants. Furthermore, the extent of discrimination against headscarf (conditioning on being Turkish) is more prominent in the case of high-skilled occupations and jobs with customer contact. Interestingly, we find evidence that such discrimination seems to be driven by male recruiters Footnote 4. Older participants are those who discriminate against headscarf but at the same time they value good characteristics of these applicants. Our results imply that the characteristics and behaviours of the “recruiter” could be the main driver of observed discrimination, particularly against headscarf, during the hiring process. Yet such practices might not reflect the best interest of their employers in terms of firms’ productivity or profit. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 explains the experimental design. Section 3 presents our methodology. Sections 4 and 5 show the results and robustness checks respectively. Section 6 discusses and concludes; figures and tables are included in the Appendix.",9

Less known is that the incidence of previous part-time work and employment interruptions has also grown among full-time workers. However, employment interruptions and part-time experience may be associated with lower future wages due to lower human capital accumulation, negative signalling effects, or lower labor force attachment (Arulampalam 2001; Blundell et al. 2016; Heckman 1981, Paul 2016). The literature on the rise in wage inequality among full-time workers has so far not taken this into account. This is the first study to examine the impact of changes in recent labor market histories on the rise in wage inequality. Re-examining the development of the wage distribution in Germany, we use administrative panel data to investigate the role of composition changes, in particular changes in recent labor market experience, for the rise in wage inequalityFootnote 1. As the key novel aspects, our study accounts explicitly for previous part-time work and employment interruptions among full-time employees, and we extend the analysis to total employment. Motivating our analysis, Fig. 1 shows for the years 1985 and 2010 the number of days in part-time employment and nonemployment, respectively, during the previous 5 years by decile of the wage distribution. For full-timers, both the incidence of previous part-time and nonemployment experience increased considerably between 1985 and 2010. Put differently, full-timers have over time become more likely to have experienced part-time work or employment interruptions in the past. The prevalence of previous part-time experience and nonemployment increases in the lower part of the full-time wage distribution, implying that among workers with particular low wages the share of workers, who have recently worked part-time or who have experienced nonemployment in the recent past, has grown over time. Figure 1 shows that nonemployment experience is more important than part-time experience, with male (female) full-timers in 2010 in the lowest decile having experienced an average of more than 600 (500) days of nonemployment and more than 40 (110) days of part-time employment during the time period 2005 to 2009. The evidence for part-time employment is consistent with studies showing that part-time work has increased strongly and that transitions between part-time and full-time work and employment interruptions have become more frequent (Tisch and Tophoven 2012; Potrafke 2012; Tamm et al. 2017). Below, we will also show evidence that the dispersion of nonemployment and part-time experience among full-timers has grown over time. There was a secular increase of unemployment in Germany from the 1980s until the mid 2000s. Afterwards, unemployment fell almost continuously until 2010 (SVR 2014). Our analysis will focus on long-term changes abstracting form cyclical variation in nonemployment and part-time experience among full-timersFootnote 2.
 Part-time employment and nonemployment during the previous 5 years in different parts of the full-time wage distribution. Average number of days in part-time employment/nonemployment during the years 1980–1984 and 2005–2009, respectively, by decile of the full-time wage distribution in the years 1985 and 2010 There is ample evidence suggesting that episodes of part-time work or nonemployment have negative long-term impacts on the career path and therefore on future wagesFootnote 3. First, human capital accumulation slows down or there is even depreciation when workers interrupt their career or temporarily downgrade to part-time employment. Second, employment interruptions or part-time experience may lead to scarring effects leading to lower wage offers and poorer career possibilities upon re-employment. A third point is that lagged employment outcomes are indicators of permanent characteristics which drive employment and wages. Accordingly, periods of nonemployment or part-time employment in the past may indicate a lower labor force attachment—in addition to being a negative productivity signal. Lagged employment outcomes are unobserved in the cross-sectional data sets, typically used in the literature on wage inequality for most countries (see, e.g., Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and the literature discussion in Section 2). For the aforementioned reasons, our paper investigates the role of employment interruptions and part-time employment in a statistical decomposition of the rise in wage inequality among full-time working employees. In light of the evidence in Fig. 1, the growing importance of part-time employment and nonemployment is likely to play an important role for the increase of lower tail wage inequality. The literature review in Section 2 reveals that the studies on the rise of wage inequality have so far not taken into account the rise in previous nonemployment and part-time employment among full-timers. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to gender differences in the rise in wage inequality. For instance, negative long-term career effects of transition from full-time to part-time work for women after childbirth have been studied by Connolly and Gregory (2009) and Paul (2016). Fitzenberger et al. (2016) document that women in Germany, who had been working full-time before birth, take fairly long spells of maternity leave after child birth and often then return to part-time work. Our paper makes the following contributions. First, in our decomposition of the rise in wage inequality among full-timers, we add the previous labor market history involving part-time and nonemployment experience. This plays an important role in explaining the rise in wage inequality both among males and females. At the same time, adding previous labor market history accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in employment decisions. As such, our analysis is of interest for all countries experiencing similar labor market trends, because ours is the first study investigating the role of the rise in nonemployment and part-time employment in explaining the rise in wage inequality among full-time employees. As a related second contribution, we estimate the effect of further observable characteristics to the increase in male and female wage inequality in Germany over the recent decades. Such a parallel analysis for Germany does not exist. Compositional changes in observable characteristics explain over 50 percent of the increase in male wage inequality and up to 80 percent of the increase in female wage inequality. To the best of our knowledge, the extremely strong role of composition effects for the rise of female wage inequality has not been recognized so far. Third, we estimate composition effects with regard to the counterfactual distribution of full-time wages for all employees, which confirms the robustness of our main findings. Furthermore, this shows that part-timers (especially female part-timers) represent a negative selection with respect to observable characteristics. Including part-timers into the analysis also speaks to the role of increasingly heterogeneous labor market histories for the rise in German wage inequality. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the rise of wage inequality. Section 3 discusses the data used and presents first descriptive evidence. Section 4 discusses our findings. Section 5 concludes. The Appendix provides more details and supplementary empirical results.

Uneven teachers’ attention to boys and girls in the classroom,December 2018,Marina Bassi,Mercedes Mateo Díaz,Ana Reynoso,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Teaching quality is critical to fostering student learning. An effective teacher can significantly reduce the learning gap between low- and high-performing students (Kane and Staiger 2012; Araujo et al. 2016). A high-quality teacher can produce a gain in achievement equivalent to one additional school year (Rivkin et al. 2005). Good teachers are also associated with lower school dropout rates and can have long-term impacts on outcomes such as university enrollment and income (Chetty et al. 2011). Teachers’ effectiveness cannot be predicted by observable characteristics such as the level of education, experience (at least after the first few years), age, or the type of contract (Araujo et al. 2016). Effective teaching is associated with the quality of the interactions between teachers and their students, with what happens inside the classroom and how the teacher uses the time in class. Students learn more when teachers spend more class time on academic activities, keep students engaged for longer periods of time, and minimize the time spent on classroom management activities (taking attendance, explaining the schedule for the day, distributing papers, and so forth) (Bruns and Luque 2015; Stallings and Knight 2003). But what happens when teachers engage more or differently with some students than with others? This paper addresses whether differences between boys and girls in learning outcomes are associated with differences in the quantity and quality of teacher–student interactions. Research on teachers’ effectiveness concludes that classroom dynamics and interaction matters, but little work has been done to understand whether teachers’ interactions vary depending on the gender, race, or income level of the student and how these differences affect learning outcomes. The evidence in this paper contributes to the broader discussion of whether traditional measures of teacher–student interactions that focus, in an aggregate manner, more on quality than on quantity capture all that matters for learning. Using videotapes, we analyze teaching practices in Chile, a country with one of the largest gender gaps in academic achievement. The results show a pattern of differentiated attention favoring boys. Our measures of gender biases (or differentiated attention) in the classroom correlate with the overall quality of teacher–student interactions measured with the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). Teachers who perform worse on CLASS also tend to demonstrate greater attention bias by student gender. We also estimate the correlation between attention bias in the classroom by gender and students’ scores on Chile’s national test, the Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación (SIMCE). Girls whose teachers demonstrate greater attention bias favoring boys tend to have lower math scores. The measures of gender bias for student-initiated actions (calling out when not called on) have a statistically significant positive correlation with boys’ scores in math and a statistically significant negative correlation for girls. These correlations do not indicate causation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the literature. Section 3 presents the conceptual model, the sample characteristics, and the setting. Section 4 describes the coding strategy and variables. Section 5 presents the findings and analyzes the correlation between teacher gender bias and student academic performance, as well as between teacher gender bias and measures of the quality of teacher–student interactions. Section 6 summarizes the paper’s conclusions and identifies policy implications.",7

The gendered correlates of air pollution on hours worked,December 2018,Guillermo Montt,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The environment and the world of work are tightly linked. Environmental degradation can, in the long term, hurt jobs through two channels. On the one hand, environmental degradation deteriorates infrastructure and the ecosystem’s ability to provide services (i.e. ecosystem services), both of which sustain jobs. On the other hand, environmental degradation has a direct impact on individuals’ health (ILO 2018). Excessive heat, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and water and soil pollution, among others, are forms of environmental degradation that affect workers’ ability to work through their own illness or, when the care of dependents relies on working individuals, through the illness of their dependents (e.g. children or the frail elderly). This paper focuses on the effects of urban outdoor air pollution. It takes advantage of 20 years of daily outdoor air pollution and quarterly employment data from Santiago, Chile. Results show that pollution is not associated to aggregate changes in hours worked. The null aggregate result, however, hides a gendered dynamic: when air pollution rises, women—and women with children, in particular—are more likely to work fewer hours. It is hypothesised that men and women can combine care and work when healthy children go to school. When sick and unable to attend school, these children must be cared for by someone. In a country like Chile where care for dependents is primarily the responsibility of women within the family, it is the women who reduce their working hours as a result of children falling ill due to air pollution. The following sections develop further the link between air pollution, hours worked and care for dependents; describe the data sources and methods; and discuss the results. Several contaminants produce urban outdoor air pollution.Footnote 1 The most commonly measured are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Suspended particulate matter is also considered a pollutant. They are small solid particles in the air (i.e. “floating dust”). Commonly, two groups of suspended particulate matter are measured, according to their size: those with an aerodynamic size smaller than 10 μm (PM10) and those smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Each contaminant is associated to different health hazards including, but not exclusive to, respiratory problems which may be transient or bring about long-term health deterioration (Muñoz 1991). Air in polluted urban areas can also contain heavy metals like lead, which are especially dangerous to children’s cognitive and physical development.Footnote 2 Air pollution is the fourth leading fatal health risk worldwide. The World Bank (2016) estimates that the 5.5 million premature deaths associated to air pollution in 2013 led to 225 billion USD in income losses. These costs only consider lost income due to premature deaths, but air pollution also reduces hours worked and productivity as a result of lost working days, which the OECD (2016a) estimates at 1.2 billion USD. Air pollution increases health expenses. Illness-related costs that do not result in mortality—morbidity costs—amount to around 10% of mortality costs in the case of air pollution (OECD 2014a), resulting in over 100 billion USD in Europe (WHO and OECD 2015). In California, hospital-related expenses that result from air pollution resulted in 193 million USD over the 2005–2007 period (Romley et al. 2010). Aside from the effects of premature deaths and health care expenses, air pollution affects hours worked through two channels: workers’ own health deterioration and dependent caregiving (Aragon et al. 2017).Footnote 3 When pollution levels reach critical levels, workers may be ill and call in sick. In New Delhi, the city with the worst outdoor air pollution level (WHO 2016), for example, 5–10% of staff report called in sick due to respiratory or breathing problems following the critical pollution episodes in 2016 (ASSOCHAM 2016). The direct effects of critical pollution episodes on labour supply are not limited to the immediate health risks: they persist in the medium term as well (Kim et al. 2017). A second channel by which air pollution impacts is indirect and operates through dependents (Aragon et al. 2017). Children and the elderly are particularly sensitive to the health effects of pollution, which can manifest themselves through bronchitis, cough and decreased lung function (AAP 2004). When pollution is high, but not critical, workers may still be healthy enough to work, but children and the elderly may fall sick. If care for sick children and dependents relies on working adults, they will likely have to skip work to take care of their dependent children or elderly. This is the case, for example, when children cannot go to school as a result of illness. The distribution of care work is gendered-biased, with the bulk of care work falling on women in unpaid arrangements, with some variation across countries (OECD 2014b). If the distribution of care for sick dependents relies on one group of workers, e.g. women, the effects of non-critical yet high air pollution levels on hours worked will fall disproportionately on this group. Importantly, this indirect effect of air pollution on hours worked only affects individuals who combine paid work and care. Informal family caregivers who care for children or the elderly on a full-time basis are not in paid work, so air pollution will not affect their position in the labour market though it may further limit their possibility to enter the labour market. These indirect effects will only apply in cases in which the carer combines paid work and care, that is, when the standard care arrangement cannot be met when the child or elderly is sick. In countries where childcare, schooling and elderly care is shared between the family and institutions (e.g. nurseries, day care centres), the impact on hours worked will be the strongest (Heymann et al. 2006). The 2002 Community Care and Health Act in Scotland offered free formal personal care to the elderly, increasing the working hours of their family caregivers by an average of 0.4 hours per week, as a result of a reduction in informal care provided (Hollingsworth et al. 2017). Chile provides an interesting case study for this hypothesis. From age 3 to 5, 75.3% of children spend their days in pre-primary school. From age 5 onwards, the majority go to school (OECD 2016b). If children fall sick, they have to stay home. If the child’s parents work, one of them will have to stay home. It is usually the mother, even in countries with greater levels of gender equality (Eriksson and Nermo 2010). If the household hires a full-time housemaid, working parents need not stay home and the housemaid will care for the child. In contrast to healthy children attending school, few, if any, options exist in Chile to support the care of the frail elderly. Almost 90% of them stay in their home under the care of a non-working family member (Palacios 2017).Footnote 4 Given the unavailability of institutional care options for the healthy frail elderly, their falling sick may not be related to hours worked since the majority of elderly family caregivers are out of the labour force already. Santiago, Chile’s capital, endures high levels of air pollution during the fall and winter months. Even though summer months have relatively low pollution levels, Santiago still ranks among the most polluted cities in the world (WHO 2016).Footnote 5 Annual average pollution levels systematically exceed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) annual PM10 guidelines on all the city’s monitoring stations. Roughly 7 million people live in Santiago, in an area of 15,400 km2. During the 1990s, Santiago was among the most polluted cities in the world (O’Ryan and Larraguibel 2000). Pollution levels are not equally distributed throughout the year, with high levels of pollution more common in the fall and winter months. Pollution levels are not equally distributed throughout the city, with higher concentrations of particulate matter and other pollutants (with the exception of ozone) observed in the southern parts of the city. This paper takes advantage of a continuous quarterly measurement of employment and daily measurement of pollutants in Santiago for 20 years. It draws on the temporal and geographical variation to explore the gendered and care-related relationship between air pollution and hours worked.",10
7.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,12 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-018-0066-7,Deserving poor and the desirability of a minimum wage,December 2018,Tomer Blumkin,Leif Danziger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A minimum wage is used in many countries as a redistributive tool for the benefit of unskilled workers.Footnote 1 However, its normative justification is highly controversial due to its adverse effect on employment and the possibility of redistribution through the tax-and-transfer system. Beginning with the seminal contribution of Mirrlees (1971), the major concern of the optimal income-tax literature has been with the government’s role in pursuing distributional goals in the presence of asymmetric information about workers’ characteristics. The canonical framework stipulates a competitive labor-market setting, which would lead to a Pareto-efficient allocation in the absence of government intervention. However, due to redistributive concerns and informational constraints, the government faces a non-trivial tradeoff between equity and efficiency. Hence, the government will generally choose an allocation that is not Pareto optimal, and the optimal income-tax literature primarily focuses on how expanding the set of policy tools available to the government beyond the tax-and-transfer system may improve this tradeoff. One strand of this literature investigates whether a minimum wage could be such additional policy tool in a competitive labor-market environment. The focus is mainly on the intensive-margin setting where the choice is confined to working hours, and the key insight is that a minimum wage is in general not a desirable supplement to the tax-and-transfer system (Allen 1987; Guesnerie and Roberts 1987). A notable exception is Boadway and Cuff (2001) who demonstrate that if unemployment benefits are denied from workers who turn down wage offers exceeding the minimum wage, then a minimum wage can serve as a warranted supplement to an optimal tax-and-transfer system. The reason is that a minimum wage can then serve to distinguish between voluntarily (skilled) and involuntarily (unskilled) unemployed workers and thereby effectively target unemployment benefits to the latter. More recently, Danziger and Danziger (2015, 2018) show that a graduated (rather than a constant) minimum wage combined with an optimal tax-and-transfer system can be instrumental in achieving a Pareto improvement and study its welfare properties.Footnote 2 Lee and Saez (2012) instead focus on the extensive margin and examine the desirability of a minimum wage in an occupational-choice model with fixed working hours. They show that if rationing is efficient, namely, the involuntary unemployment triggered by a minimum wage will primarily hit the workers with the highest disutility of work, a minimum wage can be desirable. The normative justification for a minimum wage in the occupational-choice extensive-margin model of Lee and Saez (2012) hinges on a restrictive assumption about the tax system. In particular, Lee and Saez consider an occupation tax which imposes a fixed levy on each occupation (high-skilled and low-skilled) independently of the earned income. If the production function exhibits perfect substitutability between skilled and unskilled labor inputs (i.e., a linear production function as in Saez 2002), this assumption would not be restrictive as the income level in each occupation would be given exogenously. An occupation tax would then be equivalent to an income tax. However, with complementarity between the various skill inputs, this assumption becomes restrictive as it rules out the tax being conditional on the endogenously determined income earned in each occupation. In particular, a more general income tax would allow, for each occupation, to set the tax liability for any income other than that realized in equilibrium. With an extensive-margin adjustment of labor, if the tax could be conditioned on income, a minimum wage could be fully replicated by a confiscatory 100% income tax on any income level below a minimal threshold coinciding with the realized income level in the low-skill sector in equilibrium. A minimum wage would then be redundant, as the allocation attained under the augmented income tax system would be equivalent to the one attained under the restrictive income tax system supplemented by a minimum wage. The above literature assumes that the skill distribution is given. However, the tax-and-transfer system and the minimum wage may of course affect the human-capital formation and thereby the skill distribution. In a recent paper, Gerritsen and Jacobs (2016) consider an occupational choice model with competitive labor markets and endogenous human capital formation and address the question of whether income redistribution is more efficiently achieved through an increase in the minimum wage or through changes in the income tax. The threat of involuntary unemployment associated with an increase in the minimum wage may induce some low-skilled individuals to upgrade their skills to avoid unemployment. Provided that taxes rise with income, this results in revenue gains from increased high-skill employment offsetting the revenue losses from increased low-skill unemployment. Gerritsen and Jacobs show that for a minimum wage increase to dominate a distributional-equivalent tax change, revenue gains from higher skill formation should outweigh revenue losses from inefficient low-skilled labor rationing.Footnote 3 In this paper, we offer an alternative normative justification for the use of a minimum wage to supplement an optimal tax-and-transfer system. We consider the intensive-margin setting that captures the difference between wage and income and therefore provides a natural framework for examining the social desirability of a minimum wage as a supplement to the tax-and-transfer system.Footnote 4 Central to our argument is the distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor, where deservedness refers to the society’s willingness to provide public support as reflected in the relative weights in the social welfare function. We capture this distinction by assuming that unskilled workers differ in their disutility from work, where those incurring a low disutility from work are referred to as deserving, while those incurring a high disutility from work are referred to as undeserving. The association between incurring a high disutility from work and being perceived as undeserving can be interpreted in several manners. A high disutility from work may reflect laziness, so that society has some bias in favor of the poor workers who are more willing to work hard (long hours) relative to those poor workers who are less willing to do so. Incurring a high disutility from work may alternatively reflect family circumstances, such as being a teenager or a secondary earner of a household. In both cases, the worker is likely to have a higher reservation wage and typically opts for a part-time job. For instance, teenage workers are less constrained by long-term financial obligations (e.g., mortgages), have more attractive outside opportunities (e.g., schooling), and may receive their parents’ support; likewise, secondary earners may rely on their spouses’ income and therefore already enjoy a high level of consumption. Of course, incurring a high disutility from work could well be associated with social circumstances such as disability and single parenthood that warrant public support. Individuals in these categories may to some extent be identified and targeted by specialized welfare programs that address their particular needs (e.g., Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and Social Security Disability Insurance). However, in many cases, distinguishing between more and less deserving within the pool of low-skilled workers exhibiting a high disutility from work may be a daunting challenge for the government. For instance, according to the US Census Bureau Data (see Weisbach 2009 and the references therein), among the top ten disabilities, back/spinal problems (excluding spinal cord injuries and paralysis) are by far the most prevalent. Another common source of claimed disability is mental problems (excluding retardation). However, both back pains and mental problems are difficult to verify compared with disabilities such as blindness, heart/artery problems, and diabetes which are readily verifiable. Due to the problem of verification faced by the government, incurring a high-disutility from work is imperfectly correlated with welfare deservedness. That being said, our model assumes that the correlation is sufficiently large to warrant assigning a lower welfare weight to low-skilled workers with a high disutility from work. In our model, the government maximizes a social welfare function that favors the deserving poor. However, as the disutility from work is unobservable, the government cannot directly identify the deserving poor and is faced with a screening problem. We demonstrate that a minimum wage can help the government overcome this challenge. When working hours are rationed in a manner which is sufficiently close to being constrained efficient (precisely defined below in the formal model) in the sense that most of the involuntary underemployment triggered by the imposition of a minimum wage falls on the undeserving poor, extra transfers offered by the government to unskilled workers can be targeted toward the deserving poor rather than being accorded to all poor across the board.Footnote 5 We demonstrate that by relying on the screening of workers through the rationing of working hours, the government may overcome its inability to identify the deserving poor directly. Consequently, a minimum wage may become a desirable supplement to an optimal tax-and-transfer system.Footnote 6 The notion of welfare deservedness has attracted much attention in recent years and has become a key issue in the public discourse about the role of the welfare system. Abundant evidence shows that society is generally sympathetic toward supporting the poor but that generosity is often conditioned on the recipients either working hard or being disabled. For instance, Gilens (1999) reports that people are more concerned about the conditions determining which recipients should benefit from social security programs than about the cost of the programs, the main question for taxpayers being not so much “who gets what?” but rather “who deserves what?”. In other words, it is not the government support for the truly needy that sparks considerable public resentment, but rather the perception that many individuals receiving welfare are undeserving.Footnote 7 These trends are reflected in the 1996 welfare reform in the USA and the shift from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program with its emphasis on the work requirement, as well as the significant expansion in recent years of the Earned Income Tax Credit program that conditions welfare on labor market participation. Several previous studies have distinguished between the deserving and undeserving poor in order to provide a normative foundation for commonly used policy tools such as the Earned Income Tax Credit program and Workfare to target benefits to the deserving poor. For instance, Besley and Coate (1992, 1995) assume that the government objective is to alleviate poverty rather than to maximize social welfare. Effectively, this eliminates disutility from work from the government objective and may be interpreted to reflect the view that high disutility from work indicates a socially unacceptable trait. They show that workfare can then be an effective screening tool that supplements means testing. Relatedly, Kanbur et al. (1994) establish the case for levying a negative marginal tax rate on the working poor when the government aims to minimize an income-based poverty index. Cuff (2000) employs a framework where individuals differ along the skill dimension and in their disutility from work. She demonstrates that work requirements can be desirable if the government objective is to maximize the well-being of the unskilled workers incurring a low disutility from work (the deserving poor). Saez (2002) discusses the possibility of assigning a relatively low marginal social weight to unemployed unskilled workers and shows that this would reinforce the case for an Earned Income Tax Credit. Finally, Blumkin et al. (2015) demonstrate that statistical stigma can be an effective welfare ordeal mechanism to sort out those claimants considered undeserving.",5

This knowledge alone is not useful for guiding policy prescriptions without differentiating between the permanent and transitory components of unemployment and output. Structural or institutional change is necessary to influence the permanent trend whereas short-run policy initiatives are likely to affect only the transitory cycle. The response of cyclical unemployment to cyclical output shocks is of particular interest to policymakers. In this research, a trend and cycle decomposition is performed on the unemployment rate and the log of real GDP, and the cyclical components are interpreted as measures of the unemployment gap and output gap respectively. The estimated gaps are used to generate estimates of the Okun coefficient for workers grouped by age and gender. The behaviour of the labour force participation rateFootnote 1 during the business cycle also needs to be considered because, without it, the unemployment rate is an incomplete indicator of the level of unutilised labour. Discouraged workers who transition from unemployment to non-participation during a recession may mask the true number of people who want more work. Participation was identified as a key driver of economic growth, improvement in living standards and community prosperity in the Intergenerational Report (Commonwealth of Australia 2015). Usually, the long-run trends affecting participation are of most interest to policymakers, such as the changing age structure of the population, migration effects and the participation of females and the elderly in the workforce, but cyclical effects also need to be understood. Policy initiatives which are intended to increase participation in a given context need to be designed either to influence the trend or the cyclical component. In this research, the focus is the business cycle behaviour of participation. We define a participation coefficient by analogy to the Okun coefficient which measures the cyclical response of the participation rate to output. In the literature, the decomposition of macroeconomic time series is often performed using a Hodrick-Prescott filter (hereafter HP). Shortcomings of the approach are well known, arising from the requirement to choose a value for the smoothness parameter which controls the relative variance of trend and cycle components. The apparent behaviour of the HP cycle may be to some degree an artefact of the filtering process rather than a reflection of characteristics of the true data-generating process (Harvey and Jaeger 1993). For a recent criticism of the HP filter, see Hamilton (2017). As an alternative, we use the structural time series model developed by Harvey (1985) to make maximum likelihood estimates of unobserved trend and cycle components. The key advantage of the unobserved components (UC) model is that the components are estimated using a statistical model rather than being imposed by the structure and parameters of the HP filter. A multivariate model of output, unemployment, participation and total hours worked which incorporates a common business cycle is jointly estimated to extract the trends and cycles. Estimates are made separately by age and gender for Australian data. The first contribution of this paper is a new set of estimated Okun coefficients derived from the relative magnitude of the unemployment and output cycles. The second contribution is a set of participation coefficients which reveal the estimated magnitude of the cyclical response of labour force participation by age and gender to shocks to cyclical output. In Section 2 literature is reviewed which provides theoretical grounds for and empirical description of the business cycle behaviour of unemployment and participation. Section 3 describes the labour market data used for the empirical analysis and illustrates some of the salient features of particular age and gender groups. A detailed specification of the empirical model is provided in Section 4. Empirical results are given in Section 5 and the estimated trend and cycle components are illustrated graphically. Estimates of the Okun and participation coefficients are given by age and gender and a comparison is made with estimates of the former made in the literature. Section 6 concludes the paper.",6

Evidence for such an effect has been found in studies of agricultural productivity shocks (Beegle et al. 2006; Colmer 2013; Guarcello et al. 2008) and employment shocks (Duryea et al. 2007; Guarcello et al. 2010).Footnote 1 Fallon and Tzannatos (1998) and Udry (2006) argue that child labour is a consequence of chronic poverty, and there is some evidence for such a link from cross-country studies (Edmonds and Pavcnik 2005), country-specific studies (Jensen and Nielsen 1997; Edmonds 2005), and cash-transfer experiments (Edmonds 2006; Edmonds and Schady 2009; Bourguignon et al. 2003). This paper focuses on the effects on children’s time allocation of shocks to parental health. Parental health shocks could have an especially large effect on children’s time, because a child is required not only to provide a substitute for adult labour but also to care for the parent. The child’s education could be adversely affected because the household can no longer afford to pay for it, or because the child has no time to study (Haile and Haile 2012; Rosati and Rossi 2001; Rosenzweig and Evenson 1977; Udry 2006), or because the child is fatigued by strenuous or hazardous employment (Duryea et al. 2007; Heady 2003). There is already a small literature on the links between parental illness, child labour and education, but only two papers (Dillon 2012; Alam 2015) which estimate the impact of adult health shocks on the allocation of children’s time across a range of activities, rather than just on time spent in school. Our analysis embodies a number of distinctive features. Firstly, we distinguish between different types of child work using two alternative types of disaggregation. We distinguish between different kinds of activity (education, play, domestic chores inside the home and work outside the home), and we also distinguish between (i) time spent on innocuous household chores or light work outside the home and (ii) child labour as defined by organisations such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Depending on their age and the type of task they perform, children might benefit from light work: they might acquire skills useful in future life or earn income that can help to finance their own education and health (Cigno and Rosati 2002; Moehling 2005). We believe that this distinction enhances the relevance of our results to policymakers, who may be concerned primarily with child labour as defined by the ILO and UNICEF—i.e. work that is harmful to the child’s wellbeing and personal development. Secondly, we estimate the effects of parental illness using a panel dataset that allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneity at the household level. Such heterogeneity could arise if, for example, there are some parents who put relatively little value on human capital and so invest in neither their own health nor their children’s education. Thirdly, while we do control for shocks to the health of adults in the household other than the mother and father, our main focus is on parental health shocks, and on asymmetries in (i) the effect of maternal health shocks on girls and boys and (ii) the effect of paternal health shocks on girls and boys. Our study uses data for two cohorts of children in the Ethiopian Young Lives survey. One of the key original contributions of this paper is that we estimate the impact of parental health shocks on the allocation on children’s time in a way that allows for a distinction between child work and child labour. This distinction is based on the definition of child labour developed by UNICEF (United Nations 1989), which is consistent with the guidelines in the ILO’s Minimum Age Convention (ILO 1973) and the resolutions of the 18th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ILO 2008). This definition takes into account work intensity and the child’s age. We also distinguish between the effects of paternal and maternal illness, and between the effects on sons and the effects on daughters. Our results are based on fixed-effects estimates that allow for unobserved heterogeneity. We find that parental illness has a large and statistically significant effect on the allocation of children’s time, but that there are asymmetries between maternal and paternal illness. Paternal illness reduces time spent in school while increasing time spent in income-generating work, but maternal illness reduces time spent in play and income-generating work while increasing time spent in domestic work. Moreover, maternal illness has a larger impact on daughters while paternal illness has a larger impact on sons. In this way, the effects of parental illness appear to reflect traditional gender roles within the household. There is also some heterogeneity in the effects of parental illness on the prevalence of child labour. Overall, serious maternal illness is associated with a ten percentage point increase in prevalence while serious paternal illness has a smaller effect. However, maternal illness has a relatively large effect on prevalence among girls and paternal illness a relatively large effect on prevalence among boys.",11

Especially for older workers, finding new employment after displacement appears to be a challenge. The labour market position of older displaced workers is of specific interest due to the ageing population and the ensuing policy targets to keep older workers in the work force. This paper investigates to what extent the impact of firm closures associated with bankruptcy differs between older and prime-age workers and studies how long tenure in the previous job, finding work in a different industry than the one from which they lost their previous job and the local labour market conditions in the industry from which workers are displaced correlated with these differences. There are several reasons for a stronger displacement effect among older workers. On the demand side, older workers may be less attractive to new employers due to a relatively high-wage costs-to-productivity ratio for older workers. This higher ratio may be the result of deferred compensation schemes (Lazear 1981; Daniel and Heywood 2007; Heywood et al. 2010) and of a strong bargaining position of well-protected older workers that are well-represented by labour unions who negotiate costly special provisions for older workers in collective bargaining schemes (De Hek and Van Vuuren 2011). On the supply side, older workers generally have higher reservation wages due to longer benefit entitlements (Van Ours and Vodopivec 2006) or better options to retire from the labour market (Ichino et al. 2013), sometimes with generous early retirement schemes. In addition, many older workers embody substantial firm-specific human capital, which is forgone when they are displaced (Poletaev and Robinson 2008); sector-specific capital which is lost upon displacement if the worker cannot find new employment in the same sector (Carrington 1993; Neal 1995); or task-specific human capital (Gibbons and Waldman 2004) that is lost if a worker needs to change occupation. Many older workers end up in shrinking occupations (Autor and Dorn 2009; Bosch and ter Weel 2013), which increases the probability that they will need to find a new job in another occupation. Earlier research has established a substantial and persistent effect of displacement on labour market success. Especially in the USA, researchers have been interested in this phenomenon for decadesFootnote 1. They have shown a severe and permanent drop in earnings after displacement. The European literature on displacement is more recent and focuses more on the incidence of (un)employment instead of just on earnings or wagesFootnote 2. In general, the US literature has found that losses are primarily caused by lower wages in post-displacement jobs, whereas evidence from many European countries finds almost no wage losses for those who re-enter employment, but find significantly lower employment probabilities instead (Hijzen et al. 2010). Differences between age groups are found both in the USA and in EuropeFootnote 3. Some studies explore the relation between labour market success after displacement and long tenure in the previous job (Hijzen et al. (2010), Kuhn (2002)) or changing industry (Burda and Mertens (2001), Huttunen et al. (2011)), but they do not analyse how these correlations differ between age groups. For the Dutch case, Fouarge et al. (2010) followed individuals who were displaced in 2005 for 12 months after their dismissal and found that displacement due to plant closures led to 7% lower wages, whereas individual dismissal led to 13% lower wages. Surprisingly, they found no additional wage effect of changing industry after dismissal. For their study, Fouarge et al. (2010) used the same administrative data as we use in this paper. In an earlier comparative study for the USA and the Netherlands, Gautier et al. (2002) found little evidence for adverse wage effects based on survey information. Using the same survey data, Mooi-Reci and Ganzeboom (2015) found a significant scarring effect of unemployment in general in the period 1985–2000, with a notable disparity in the unemployment scarring by gender. All three Dutch studies have asked for further analysis on the effects of displacement in the Netherlands to get a better grasp of its actual effects. Our study adds a new perspective to the literature by analysing three factors that vary within and between age groups: job tenure, working in weak labour markets and switching industries. Using the difference-in-differences techniques that have been the standard in the literature since the seminal work of Jacobsen et al. (1993), we determine the effect of firm bankruptcies on employment participation and wages of the workers involved. We improve on this method by estimating heterogeneous treatment effects within this difference-in-differences approach, which allows us to determine to what extent there are differences within age groups and analyse how these differences vary between age groups. Our strategy is to apply a difference-in-differences approach combined with non-parametric matchings. We use extensive administrative linked employer-employee data for the Netherlands that include all workers, in combination with data on firm bankruptcies that are drawn from an administrative source as well. We take a sample of workers who were displaced due to firm bankruptcies in the period 2000–2009 and follow them up to 2011. The size of our dataset allows us to construct a control group of non-displaced workers using non-parametric matching techniques, following Ichino et al. (2013). In doing so, we reduce the potential bias that might result from the selection of the controls (Hijzen et al. 2010; Huttunen et al. 2011), since the treated and controls have the exact same observable characteristics. In total, we have nearly 19,000 treated and 50,000 controls in the age-group 35–54 years old. We test for heterogeneous treatment effects by expanding the standard difference-in-differences specification. Our results indicate that the labour market outcomes after displacement are highly contingent on age, especially in terms of employment probabilities. Within the older-age group, the outcomes are related to job tenure in the former job, the local labour market situation in the sector from which people are displaced and whether people find work in another sector. For prime-age workers, tenure in the job before displacement makes less of a difference for their outcomes after displacement than it does for older workers. Likewise, older displaced workers are more sensitive to the situation in the local labour market in the industry from which they are displaced and experience stronger negative effects of changing industries after displacement on their post-displacement wages, probably due to industry-specific human capital that is lost upon displacement. These results suggest that job- and sector-specific factors are important for understanding the more vulnerable position of older workers after job loss. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows how we constructed the data from various administrative data sources, displays descriptive graphs and presents our empirical strategy. Section 3 discusses the results of our analyses, and Section 4 presents sensitivity analyses. Section 5 concludes.",9

7.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Economics,23 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40172-017-0061-4,Does education raise productivity and wages equally? The moderating role of age and gender,December 2018,Stephan Kampelmann,François Rycx,Ilan Tojerow,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Human capital theory (Becker 1964) posits that (i) education develops skills that make workers more productive and (ii) wage differentials reflect differences in productivity. Accordingly, more highly educated workers would earn higher wages ceteris paribus simply because they are more productive than their less-educated counterparts. This explanation of pay inequality has been challenged by empirical and theoretical work on labour markets. Indeed, a range of labour market theories hypothesise sources of inequality other than labour productivity, such as collective action, labour market institutions or the use of power and authority to obtain economic advantages (Berg 1981; Kalleberg and Sørensen 1979; Weeden 2002). Although each of these theories on inequality focuses on distinct social processes, they appear to have in common that they associate labour market inequality at least implicitly to an element of ‘unearned’ or ‘unjust’ allocation of resources to dominant groups. On the other hand, economists have also developed explanations of differences between productivity and wages without abandoning the assumptions of individual rationality and profit-maximising firms. In this literature, productivity-wage gaps are thought to be rational strategies of firms to address a range of market distortions (Lazear and Shaw 2007). The abundance of theories on education-driven productivity-wage gaps is not matched by a corresponding body of empirical literature. Indeed, very few studies have actually examined how the educational composition of the labour force affects firm productivity (Galindo-Rueda and Haskel 2005; Haegeland and Klette 1999; Haltiwanger et al. 1999; Moretti 2004).Footnote 1 Moreover, the evidence on whether education raises productivity and wages equally is very thin,Footnote 2 inconclusive and subject to various possible econometric biases (Hellerstein and Neumark 2004; Ilmakunnas and Maliranta 2005; Van Biesebroeck 2011). The endogeneity of education and the presence of firm-level time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity are for instance seldom controlled for. Most estimates regarding the education-productivity nexus and the existence of possible education-driven productivity-wage gaps are thus potentially inconsistent. What is more, to our knowledge, no study has tried to assess whether the education-productivity-wage nexus varies with the composition of the firm’s workforce in terms of age and gender. Yet, numerous arguments (notably related to information asymmetries, social norms or labour market regulations) suggest that this is probably the case. As an example, it could be noted that labour market regulations (such as minimum wages or unemployment benefits) essentially affect the lower end of the earnings distribution. As a result, these regulations are more likely to lead to a ‘wage-compression effect’ (i.e. a distribution of wage costs by educational groups that is more compressed than the education-productivity profile) among workers earning lower wages, e.g. younger workers (Cardoso 2010). As regards workers’ gender, given that upper management jobs are mainly occupied by men, tournament theory (Lazear and Rosen 1981) for instance suggests that high-educated men have a greater likelihood to be paid above their marginal productivity. These examples, among others, suggest that workers’ age and gender may have a substantial effect on the (mis)alignment of wages and productivity across educational groups.Footnote 3 The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we put the relationship between the educational composition of the workforce and firm productivity to an updated test, using Belgian linked employer-employee panel data for the years 1999–2010. These data offer several advantages. The panel covers a large part of the private sector, provides accurate information on average productivity (i.e. the average value added per hour worked) and allows us to control for a wide range of worker and firm characteristics. It also enables us to address important methodological issues, such as firm-level time-invariant heterogeneity, measurement errors, reverse causality, feedback effects and state dependence of firm productivity. Indeed, early studies using the Hellerstein and Neumark approach ‘have been criticized mainly due to the potential endogeneity’ in the explanatory variables that have been studied (Bartolucci 2013), which can be a result of these issues. To do so, we rely on the generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator.Footnote 4 A second objective is to examine whether education increases productivity and wage costs equally (i.e. to extend the analysis to productivity-wage gaps). Finally, our study provides first evidence on whether the alignment between productivity and wage costs across educational levels depends on the characteristics of workers, i.e. their age and gender. Research questions addressed in this paper are very important for economic policy. The labour market situation of low-educated workers is particularly critical in most industrialised countries. This is also the case in Belgium (Eurostat 2016a). The unemployment rate in Belgium among the low-educated (i.e. people with less than upper secondary education) is three times larger than that among tertiary educated workers (16.4 vs. 4.7% in 2014). As regards the employment rate, it is found to be more than 40 percentage points lower among the former group of workers (37.3 versus 81.9% in 2014).Footnote 5 Various theories, including skilled-biased technological change and competition from low-wage countries, have been put forward to explain this phenomenon (Cahuc and Zylberberg 2014). A key argument here is that low-educated workers are too costly relative to their added value. As a result, firms are willing to substitute low-educated workers by capital, to outsource part of their activities to cheap-labour countries and (especially in the case of excess labour supply) to hire more educated workers as their productivity to wage cost ratio is more favourable.Footnote 6 Despite the fact that alternative theories (based on tournaments, internal decision-making processes of organisations, monopsony or monitoring issues) suggest that low-educated workers might actually not be too costly relative to their marginal products (Lazear and Rosen 1981; Bebchuk and Fried 2003; Osterman et al. 2009), most policies aiming to increase the employability of low-educated people in the OECD area either try to foster the latters’ productivity (e.g. through specific training programmes) and/or to decrease their wage cost (e.g. through reduced payroll taxes). Belgium is no exception in this respect. Indeed, it is among the highest spenders for active labour market policies in Europe (Eurostat 2016b) and reductions in employers’ and personnel social security contributions (notably targeted on the low-skilled) represent around 1.8% of GDP (Belgian federal government 2015). While these policies are quite standard to improve the labour market prospects of low-educated people, their effectiveness is still highly controversial (Heckman et al. 1999; Cahuc and Carcillo 2012; Kluve 2010; Card et al. 2010). This is notably due to the fact that it remains unclear whether education-induced productivity gains are well aligned with corresponding wage cost differentials. In particular, more evidence is needed on whether the productivity to wage cost ratio of low-educated people is really critical for their employability. The objective of this paper is to improve our understanding of these issues with a specific focus on workers’ age and gender. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The following two sections, respectively, describe our methodology, estimation techniques and data set. We then analyse the impact of the composition of the workforce in term of education on productivity, wages, and productivity-wage gaps and end with a discussion of the results and a conclusion.",26
