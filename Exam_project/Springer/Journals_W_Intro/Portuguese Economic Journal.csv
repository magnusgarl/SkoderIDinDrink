Banks operating in the payments market exert negative risk externalities on each other. A role for the central bank to play in this market could be as a balancing of two concerns that these externalities raise: On one hand, a central bank never gets illiquid and therefore exerts less negative externalities than what other banks in the market do; this calls for a large role of the central bank in the payment system. On the other hand, negative externalities imply that the equilibrium quantity supplied in the market is too high relative to social optimum. But the presence of a central bank, with its benign externalities, will cause the other banks to increase their activities. As my analysis below will show, this strategic response by the other banks to the presence of the central bank may call for a reduction in the central bank’s activities—despite it being more efficient than the others—and perhaps even a total abstention. In order to model this trade-off, I propose a stylized model of the market for payments as an oligopoly facing a downward-sloping demand; thus, the number of payments carried out in the economy will depend on the price charged for the payment service. Although there, in general, is undersupply in the equilibrium of an oligopoly, compared to the social optimum, this outcome may not hold true when the oligopolists’ activities exert negative externalities.Footnote 2
 In Section 2 of this paper, I briefly present the payments system and the externalities involved. In the payments industry, a payment may involve one bank (the payee’s bank) extending intra-day credit to another bank (the payer’s bank) until the payment is settled. One bank’s provision of services thus exerts negative risk externalities on other banks. There are two kinds of risk externalities involved. First, when one bank extends credit to another bank, the first bank does not take into account, in its assessment of this business, how extending this credit affects the other bank’s ability to honor its debt to third-parties; this is a  credit-risk externality. Secondly, and importantly, the first bank does not take into account the effect a failure by the other bank in honoring the debt may affect its own ability to honor its debt to third-parties; this is a systemic-risk externality. The Section ends with a brief overview of related literature. In Section 3, I present my model of banks participating in this payments system and, in so doing, interacting strategically and exerting negative risk externalities upon each other. In the model, the demand for payment services is price sensitive, as discussed above. Moreover, the central bank is modelled as differing from the other banks on two counts. First, it is publicly owned and is therefore maximizing welfare. Secondly, since the central bank itself cannot become illiquid, it does not exert any systemic-risk externality. In Section 4, I present three different scenarios: one in which all banks are private and profit-maximizing; one in which one of the banks is a publicly owned bank with the aim of maximizing welfare; and one in which the publicly owned bank in addition also is the central bank. Since the central bank cannot possibly become illiquid, the risk externalities associated with its activities are different from those of the other banks. In Section 5, I find the socially optimum outcome in this market, account taken, by a social planner, of all externalities. In Section 6, I analyze and compare the equilibrium outcomes in the various scenarios outlined in Section 4. In particular, the central bank may have to trade off the more moderate risk externalities it exerts itself with a too high credit level from the private part of the market. Thus, even if the first best calls for the central bank to be the largest, it may well end up the smallest bank in equilibrium. In this Section, I also compare the equilibrium outcomes and the social optima in the various scenarios. Interestingly, introducing the central bank, thus reducing overall risk externalities in this market, may actually increase the scope for an oversupply of credit in equilibrium, because the private banks get much more aggressive in their extension of intra-day credit when their public counterpart is a benign central bank than when it is just an ordinary bank, albeit a welfare-maximizing one. Section 7 contains concluding remarks, while the Appendix contains more detailed results than what is in the main text, as well as proofs.",

Costa,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In 2014 the PEJ reached the age of adolescence with the publication of its thirteenth volume. Almost one hundred and fifty articles had been published, including some iconic papers such as Stephen Bond’s “Dynamic Panel Data Models: A guide to micro data methods and practice,” and Olivier Blanchard’s “Adjustment within the Euro. The difficult case of Portugal”. Only one in five papers had made it through the refereeing process and nearly two thirds of the authorship belonged to researchers affiliated to non-Portuguese institutions. It was also the year of the very successful 8th meeting of PEJ held at the University of Minho (Braga), which proves that this sibling initiative is sustainable and has space to grow. Table 1 provides some editorial statistics for PEJ in the 2007–2014 period. New submissions were roughly 5–6 times the number of original articles published per year and they showed a modest increase during the period. Considering that nearly half of the new submissions were immediately rejected, the average number of referees per article refereed was 1.8. The rejection rate of new submissions in this period was very stable: three out of four.
 The impact of PEJ in the profession can be partially and very imprecisely assessed using Table 2.Footnote 1 Citations per article in Google Scholar reached 30.6 in this period (11.0 for 2005–2014), with 2.8 % (3.7 % for 2005–2014) of the papers concentrating two thirds of the citations. This type of profile is what should be expected from a young generalist journal in a competitive and rapidly-changing environment.
 By May 2014, childhood was over, so Paulo Brito felt it was time for him to cease being the editor-in-chief. This journal is deeply indebted to him not just for all his effort and competence, but also for believing that it was possible to create and nurture an economics international scientific journal based in Portugal. Ana Rute Cardoso, who had joined the executive board in 2013, and Isabel Correia, that had replaced Francesco Franco in the same year, also left.

The economics literature has addressed a consistent part of the analysis to the scope of bargaining: concerning wages only, or both employment and wage rates. The former refers to the right-to-manage model (RTM, Nickell and Andrews 1983): the wage rate is set during the negotiations but firms retain the right to decide employment levels; the equilibrium solution is on the firms’ labor demand. The latter refers to the efficient bargaining model (EB, McDonald and Solow 1981): firms and unions negotiate at the same time over wages and employment; the Pareto-efficient equilibrium lies on the contract curve’s locus. A few scholars have studied the strategic choice of the bargaining agenda in unionized oligopolies. Authors such as Yang (1995), Vannini and Bughin (2000), and Petrakis and Vlassis (2000) focus on the question whether firms and unions prefer to negotiate under the EB or RTM model. Furthermore, Bughin (1999) and Buccella (2011) argue that the bargaining parties may strategically choose their agenda to deter market entry. Those models assume unions and firms negotiate over fixed wages. However, fixed wages are not the unique pay scheme available. In fact, workers may get compensations according to performance related pay schemes, notably profit-sharing. For instance, according to OECD data (1995), 15 % of the US companies with more than 100 workers and 15 % of the Canadian companies with more than 20 workers have a profit-sharing scheme. As regards the European Union, the incidence of companies with more than 10 employees with a profit sharing scheme ranges from 3 % of Italy to 35 % of France (Eurofound 2010), whereas the percentage of companies with more than 250 employees adopting profit sharing schemes ranges from 2,9 % of Greece to 23,6 % of Finland (Eurofound 2012). While the subject of the strategic bargaining agenda selection to deter market entry is present in the economic literature, up to the present, the idea that pay schemes can be utilized as entry deterrence mechanism for a given bargaining framework has not been explored. Under fairly standard hypotheses (labor unique factor of production with constant return to scales technology, risk neutral union, linear market demand), this work sets out to investigate if, in a unionized industry characterized by RTM negotiations, the introduction of a profit sharing scheme may be used as a strategic tool to deter entry. Some research has studied the introduction of profit sharing schemes in union-firm bargaining. Pioneering contributions are those of Hoel and Moene (1988), Anderson and Devereux (1989) and Pemberton (1991) which explore the effects of introducing profit sharing in the context of a unionized monopoly. Notably, Anderson and Devereux (1989) have shown that in a unionized monopoly the bargaining outcomes of profit sharing equal those of the EB model. As regards unionized oligopolies, only a limited number of works have considered the use of profit-sharing as a strategic tool. Fung (1989) analyzes a unionized oligopoly. This author assumes that, in a firm adopting the profit-sharing scheme, the firm unilaterally fixes the profit-sharing parameter and the union unilaterally sets the wage rate. Sørensen (1992) analyzes decentralized negotiations under the RTM model between two union-firm units with asymmetric bargaining power. Firms may either choose a fixed wage or a profit-sharing scheme. In the case of profit sharing, the firm and the union bargain over the base wage and the share parameter. The paper investigates 1) which pay scheme arises endogenously as Nash equilibrium and 2) the welfare increasing effects for society of introducing profit-sharing. Göddeke (2010) studies the incentives for firms and unions to introduce profit-sharing schemes as a strategic means to improve single bargaining units position in a Cournot oligopoly. The work analyzes both decentralized and centralized wage bargaining, focusing on the stability of these institutional arrangements.Footnote 1 However, none of the above mentioned works discusses market entry issues. On the other hand, Bughin (1999), Buccella (2011), and Buccella and Fanti (2015) deal with the subject of market entry deterrence in a unionized sector. Bughin (1999) investigates the optimal strategic choice of the bargaining agenda for different market structures (duopoly vs. monopoly with threat of potential entry) and constraints (committed vs. flexible bargaining) in a Cournot oligopoly with decentralized negotiations. Extending Bughin’s (1999) framework to a conjectural variation model, Buccella (2011) shows that EB emerges as the industry equilibrium without conflict of interests between the bargaining parties only for entry deterrence reasons. In all other cases, conflicts of interest arise due to the difference in the parties’ dominant strategies, whatever is the degree of competitiveness within the industry. Buccella and Fanti (2015) show that, under an alternative timing of the game with respect to Bughin (1999) and Buccella (2011), a rich set of equilibrium outcomes arises, including multiple and even (as regards the union’s preferences on the bargaining agenda) asymmetric equilibria. Moreover, the set of cases in which the equilibrium implies the choice of EB is substantially larger than in Buccella (2011). The present work builds on Sørensen (1992), Bughin (1999), Buccella (2011) and Buccella and Fanti (2015). In a unionized duopoly with homogeneous goods and decentralized bargaining, the equilibrium pay scheme is sensitive to the market structure, the constraints on the bargaining scope choice and the parties’ relative power. The sub-game perfect Nash equilibria pay schemes are determined through a sequential game between the incumbent and the entrant. The paper analyzes the optimal strategic choice of the pay scheme for different market structures and constraints for a given RTM bargaining framework. Two institutional frameworks are considered: 1) the flexible bargaining, where the entrant can choose its pay scheme; and 2) the committed bargaining, where the incumbent chooses its payment scheme; then, the entrant is obliged to “join the pack” and adopt the industry common practice. The key results are as follows. First, it is shown that the bargaining units may have common interest toward profit-sharing, both when oligopoly is the given market structure and under the threat of entry. In fact, whatever is the entry mode in the industry, for a given bargaining framework (in this context, the RTM model), there are situation such that the flexibility of choosing the pay scheme eliminates the internal conflict of interests among the bargaining parties. This result contrasts with the findings of Buccella (2011) where, for a given payment scheme (the fixed wage), the flexibility of choosing strategically the scope of the bargaining agenda among EB or RTM never eradicates the internal parties’ conflict of interests. Second, this paper highlights the possibility of using the payment schemes as strategic tools to deter market entry: the incumbent firm and its union can reach an agreement toward the profit sharing scheme to deter the potential entry of a competitor in the product market. These findings are significant because, if the labor market institutions of a country do not contemplate that employment enters the bargaining protocol and, as a consequence, the union-firm pairs cannot strategically choose the bargaining agenda, the pay schemes can become an effective entry deterrence mechanism. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and derives the sub-game perfect bargaining regime arising in equilibrium. Finally, Section 3 draws some conclusions.",4

Costa,Paulo Guimarães,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The fifteenth volume of the Portuguese Economic Journal (PEJ) represented a return to normality, following the bumpy executive-board transition during 2015. The first special issue since 2009 was published: Energy Economics: Demand, Prices, and Welfare. We thank Isabel Soares and Óscar Afonso for organising it. The number of new submissions reached a new record in 2015 with 95 papers, almost 50 per cent above the 2008-15 average. The average turnaround time also decreased to 67.8 days, a 50 per cent reduction, while the rejection rate hardly changed. By early November 2016 the previous record for the number of submissions was beaten and a further reduction in the turnaround time was observed. In September 2016, Odd Rune Straume was replaced in the executive board by Steffen Hoernig. PEJ is extremely grateful to Odd Rune for the eight-year period during which he served as an editor. Nonetheless, he will continue as an associate editor. We also wish Steffen the best of luck. The 10th annual meeting of PEJ was held at the University of Coimbra and was organised by José Murteira, Ana Margarida Monteiro, Óscar Lourenço, and Pedro Godinho. Ricardo Reis lead the scientific committee and Pedro Carneiro delivered the keynote speach. We are grateful to all of them for their superb work. The 2017 conference will take place at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD) from 7 to 9 July. The local organising committee is composed by João Rebelo (chair), Ana Marta, José Vaz Caldas, Leonida Correia, Lina Gomes, Patrícia António, Patrícia Martins, and Sofia Gouveia. Vasco Carvalho will be the chair of the scientific committee and Sofia Villas-Boas will be the keynote speaker. As promised, we launched the new website of PEJ website of PEJ. The site includes the following sections: (i) the journal; (ii) annual meeting, upcoming and past; (iii) the Portuguese Economic Network (PEN); (iv) the Portuguese Economy Research Report, a blog curated by Rui AlbuquerqueFootnote 1; and (v) media links, including a YouTube channel. We have also started a monthly newsletter that is disseminated amongst PEN members, conference participants, and authors.",

Rodrigues,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We are happy to report that the number of new submissions to the Portuguese Economic Journal (PEJ) reached 207 in 2018, an all-time record that represents a 37 per cent increase over the previous high mark in 2017. The average turnaround time to first decision was slashed by 45 per cent to less than 25 days. The rejection rate of new submissions has increased slightly to about 90 per cent. The (two-year) impact factor more than doubled to 0.4 and reached its second-best level ever. The backlog of accepted papers now covers more than half of next year’s volume. In January 2018, Margarida Duarte was replaced in the executive board by Daniel Dias. PEJ is extremely grateful to Margarida for this crucial three-year period during which she served as an editor. However, she accepted continuing her contribution as an associate editor. We also wish Daniel the best of luck. The 12th Annual Meeting of PEJ was held in July at ISEG - Lisbon School of Economics & Management (ISEG) of Universidade de Lisboa and was organised by António Afonso (chair), Cândida Ferreira, Joana Pais, and Luca Opromolla. Margarida Duarte was the chair of the scientific committee, and Roel Beetsma and Gianmarco Ottaviano were the keynote speakers. The record for the number of participants was also beaten. The executive board (ExB) of PEJ is extremely grateful to all of them for a job well done. In 2019, the Annual Meeting will be hosted by Universidade de Évora from 5 to 7 July. This is the first time the conference goes back to a city, as the 2nd meeting was also held in Évora. The local organising committee is composed of Carlos Vieira (chair), Luís Coelho, Andreia Dionísio, Soumodip Sarkar, and Isabel Vieira. Nuno Limão will lead the scientific committee, and Paul de Grauwe and Michael Kremer will be the keynote speakers. The deadline for submissions is 15 March and we are extremely grateful to Consultaccount for sponsoring the first award for the best paper presented by a Ph.D. student. The relationship with Springer was reinforced via a new cooperation framework. The ExB of PEJ is very grateful to Manuel Mira Godinho and Clara Raposo of ISEG, and Martina Bihn (our indefatigable Editorial Director) and Heinz Weinheimer of Springer for believing in this project. We are also grateful to João Paulo Calado, who was crucial to this process. Furthermore, we would like to thank Charmaine Hilferty, our Springer Journal Editorial Office Assistant, and Annalyn Marabillo, our Springer Production Coordinator, for their professional support. Last but not least, we are extremely grateful to Manuel Costa Reis for the three-and-a-half years as our Marketing & Communication Director, whose work was decisive to improve the visibility of PEJ. We wish Manuel all the best for his new professional challenge.",

Costa,Steffen Hoernig,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As we write this note in early December, the Portuguese Economic Journal (PEJ) is probably heading for a new all-time record in the number of submissions. There was a 3% increase to 210 new submissions in the period from December 2018 to November 2019 compared with the previous 12 months. The average turnaround time to first decision has stabilised at 27 days and the rejection rate of new submissions has remained slightly below 90%. The (two-year) impact factor improved for the third consecutive year and reached 0.5 in 2018 (released in June 2019). The number of articles available online first in November 2019 is larger than the number of articles published in that year. Paulo Guimarães is leaving the executive board (ExB) in January 2020 and will be replaced by Miguel Portela. However, he will resume his position as associate editor. We are deeply grateful to Paulo for his dedication during this five-year period and also for holding the title of the first person to publish an article in PEJ. We also wish all the best to Miguel in his new position as co-editor, after a short spell as an associate editor. Furthermore, Martina Bihn also ceased to be our publishing editor in April 2019 and was replaced by Samuel Beattie. Martina is a very important person in the history of PEJ and she played the role of a true founding mother. Her involvement with the journal goes back at least to 2000, when she helped designing the project with Paulo Brito and João Santos Silva at the World Congress of the Econometric Society in Seattle. She was also extremely important during the annus horribilis of 2015 and helped preventing the death of the journal at the time. The entire editorial board of PEJ and the larger community associated with the project are greatly indebted to Martina for her professional support, but also for believing enthusiastically in the project from the start. Furthermore, we wish her all the best for her position as an Editorial Director for Business, Economics, Social Sciences, and Statistics for Springer and Palgrave journals. We welcome Sam as our new journal development editor. The Annual Meeting of PEJ returned to Évora in July 2019 for the 13th edition. Évora is a mythical place for us, as the idea of the journal was conceived there in June 1999 at the 4th SPiE conference. The local organising committee was composed by Carlos Vieira (chair), Luís Coelho, Andreia Dionísio, Soumodip Sarkar, and Isabel Vieira. Nuno Limão was the chair of the scientific committee, and Paul de Grauwe and Michael Kremer were the keynote speakers. ConsultAccount sponsored the first award for the best paper presented by a PhD student at the conference, which was conferred to Ana Oliveira (U. Porto). The ExB of PEJ is extremely grateful to all the above-mentioned people for a job well done. A special thanks to Pedro Brinca for making the award a reality. The 14th Annual Meeting will go back to Porto, but this time it will be hosted by the Católica-Porto Business School from 3 to 5 July 2020. The local organising committee is composed of Ricardo Gonçalves (chair), Mariana Cunha, Francisca Guedes de Oliveira, and Alexandra Leitão. Joana Silva will lead the scientific committee, and the keynote speakers will be Ana Rute Cardoso and Beata Javorcik. The submission deadline is 15 March and we are grateful once more to ConsultAccount for sponsoring the award for the best paper presented by a PhD student. Finally, we would like to welcome Olaf Ghanizadeh to the position of Marketing & Communication Director, which he duly started in April 2019. You can see some of Olaf’s work in our YouTube channel.",

Dias,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The year 2020 was a real outlier in (almost) everybody’s life. And what a year we have all had! The number of submissions in the 12 months ending in 30 November 2020 was down by 21 per cent when compared with the preceding 12 months. This means that the number of original submissions went back to 2017. The turnaround time for a first submission stayed roughly stable at 34 days and the rejection rate of new submissions marginally decreased to 86 per cent . Nonetheless, there are also some good news. There is a new all-time record for the (two-year) impact factor of the Portuguese Economic Journal (PEJ): 0.684 for the year 2019. This is the fourth consecutive year of improvement in this indicator. In addition, back in November 2020 there were 12 articles available online first, excluding the ones in this issue, which means that this entire volume is now ready and also there is enough material for one issue of the 2022 volume. Due to the current, hopefully fading, Covid-19 pandemic we had to postpone the 14th Annual Meeting of PEJ to July 2021. We are deeply grateful to Ricardo Gonçalves (chair), Francisca Guedes de Oliveira, Mariana Cunha, and Alexandra Leitão for their work organising the 2020 conference and then moving it to 2021. We are also indebted to the Scientific Committee led by Joana Silva that also accepted assessing the submissions in 2021. Finally, we are grateful to all the authors that submitted papers to the conference. Let us hope that we can meet at Católica Porto Business School in person next July In May, we finally launched the https://data.pej.pt/, a blog dedicated to all data on the Portuguese Economy. This new blog is curated by Miguel Portela and the objective is to disseminate the data available for the Portuguese economy, both produced by institutions and groups of researchers. Your contribution is most welcome! The https://research.pej.pt/, our blog dedicated to all research on the Portuguese economy curated by Rui Albuquerque with the help of Domingos Seward continued its dissemination work and reached 10,000 visitors also in April. Next year, PEJ will be 20 years old. We are planning some commemorative surprises and some changes to prepare the journal for its third decade.",

Among the causes of this instability are the slowing of economic growth, and the ageing of the population. With lower economic growth, on a macroeconomic level, the economies will generate fewer resources, and governments will have a smaller base from which they are able to collect revenues. On a microeconomic level, fewer jobs will be created, implying that some agents will not find placement in the job market, and, therefore, will, not only, be unable to contribute to public budgets, but will also increase dependency on public resources, through unemployment benefits. The ageing of the population poses a problem for two reasons. On the one hand, a reduction of the working population, and on the other hand, an increase in ageing related costs, namely, on pension systems and healthcare. If we look at society as being composed by three major age groups according to the life cycle (childhood/youth, middle-aged/active, and elderly/retirement), both the elderly and youth groups would be net beneficiaries (benefits received are higher than taxes paid) of public budgets, while the middle-aged groups would, not only, be net contributors of public budgets, but also have to contribute enough to off-set the spending with the other 2 groups of net beneficiaries. Based on these arguments, it follows that the structure of the population decisively affects the balance of public budgets. The goal of this paper is to access the sustainability of the Portuguese fiscal system in the long run, to measure the net tax burdens for current/living and future generations (those that have not been born yet), and to propose corrective policies in case of unsustainability or imbalances between the net tax payments of current and future generations. Traditional fiscal measures, namely deficit and debt accounting, focus only on the current and short term effects of fiscal policies, and may not accurately reflect government accounts, due to its arbitrary nature. Thus, we alternatively resort to Generational Accounting, a methodology that was initially developed by Auerbach et al. (1992, 1994 and 1999b), which is based on the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, stating that present and future government spending must either be covered by current or future taxes and social security contributions, or by government net wealth. Depending on how they are financed, public policies have to be paid either by current or future generations, affecting their net wealth, and, as a consequence, they entail intergenerational distribution. Generational accounting is able to incorporate these long term implications of fiscal policy on intragenerational (within generations) and intergenerational (across generations) distribution and fiscal sustainability, while including future changes in the demographic structure of the population. To produce generational accounts, we require: projections of the population, taxes, transfers, and government expenditures; an initial value of government wealth; a growth rate and a discount rate. The analysis is forward-looking, and, therefore, it calculates only the future fiscal burdens that each generation faces. The year 2010 is set as the base year, with generations born before or in 2010 considered as the current generation, and generations born after 2010 considered as the future generations. Taxes and transfers are allocated to the population according to a micro-profile, based on their age, in order to reflect changes in these variables due to changes in the population’s demographic structure. The rest of the variables are assumed to evolve at the same rate as the overall economy. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, the results obtained in this paper are analyzed and compared to the results in “Generational Accounting around the World” by Auerbach et al. (1999b). In other words, we provide an update of the calculations using the same methodology, so that we can draw conclusions from the recent policies followed by Portugal in terms of the sustainability of fiscal policy, and if further changes are required. We also provide a comparison with an alternative methodology for the calculations of the underlying accounts, by the European National Transfer Accounts, and compare the potential advantages and disadvantages between them. Then, we follow this initial analysis with calculations resorting to additional indicators and different scenarios, which will allow us to overcome some of the shortcomings of the initial indicators, provide additional insight on the change of the results due to changes in different variables (including different allocation of certain expenditures, changes in the discount rate or the productivity growth rate), as well as the underlying causes for these changes. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 highlights some of the changes in the Portuguese economy and demography that will affect the sustainability of the fiscal system. Section 3 explains the relevance of the generational accounting method in comparison to the traditional methods. Section 4 describes the theoretical framework and the methodology of generational accounting, as well as some limitations of these indicators. Section 5 defines the process of estimation of the variables and parameters of the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. This includes population projections and developments; age specific micro-profiles in order to assign taxes, social security and other contributions, transfers and benefits; fiscal data and government accounts; and the choice for the growth and discount rates. Section 6 presents the applied data of generational accounting and the respective results, and compares them with the results obtained in the accounts of 1999. We also provide additional indicators, in order to overcome some of the shortcomings of the main indicator. Section 7 provides a sensitivity analysis of the obtained results, as well as some empirical limitations. Section 8 provides the conclusions of this paper.",1

Evidence shows that deals in which state-owned firms are acquirers differ from those between private firms (Del Bo et al. 2017). Recently, many governments in developed countries have regulated cross-border acquisitions by firms from developing countries, especially when the target of the acquisition is a leading technology firm, with the concern of national security.Footnote 2 However, considering the mixed cases recently in real world, which shows acquisitions by private and publicly-owned firms, we seek to study the economic reasons underlying cross-border acquisitions from developing countries. We believe that the analysis conducted to date of the welfare consequences of such cross-border acquisitions is insufficient. Motivated by this belief, we study acquisitions by firms from developing countries that can be vetoed by governments in both developing and developed countries. Literature on FDI has studied cross-border merger and acquisitions in which foreign market access involves private firms. In this literature, Nocke and Yeaple (2007) highlight firms’ heterogeneity in their mobile or immobile capacities when deciding the mode of foreign market access. Norbäck and Persson (2008) find that foreign firms are more likely to enter the domestic market through the acquisition of domestic assets than greenfield investment when the complementarity between domestic and foreign assets is high. Head and Ries (2008) consider that investors from different countries compete for control rights on overseas assets, and which country obtains those assets depends on its monitoring costs relative to rivals’ in other countries. Finally, Fumagalli and Vasconcelos (2009) analyze how trade cost affects cross-border mergers in a sequential merger formation game. Literature on FDI has also considered merger policy and welfare aspects of cross-border mergers. Head and Ries (1997) show that national welfare-maximizing regulators are more likely to approve cost-saving international horizontal mergers that reduce world welfare. Horn and Persson (2001) find that private and social incentives for mergers and acquisitions tend to differ for low levels of cost savings and weak merger synergies. Neary (2007) predicts that international differences in technology can result in bilateral mergers such that low-cost firms acquire higher-cost foreign firms, which are likely to increase the aggregate welfare. Haufler and Nielsen (2008) show, in a three-country model, that international cost-reducing mergers that benefit the firms involved will be permitted by either a national or a regional regulator, and that this is globally efficient. Moreover, Baziki et al. (2017) consider cross-border acquisitions by private equity firms and how they interact with those by multinational enterprises. They suggest that policies for improving the market for corporate control and financial markets in developing countries may be more socially desirable than those for restricting cross-border acquisitions by private equity firms. The papers cited above do not consider cross-border acquisitions conducted by state-owned firms; that is precisely the main objective of this paper. In this regard, the literature on mixed oligopoly analyzes competition between state-owned firms and private firms. Focusing on the domestic market, that literature has studied mergers between private firms in the presence of a public firm and between public and private firms (see Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón 2003, 2020a; Nakamura and Inoue 2007; Méndez-Naya 2008; Artz et al. 2009; Kamijo and Nakamura 2009; Gelves and Heywood 2013; Ye and Wu 2015).Footnote 3 The study of mergers that focus on the world market is limited. In this regard, Heywood and McGinty (2011) examine cross-border mergers between domestic private firms and/or foreign private firms in the presence of a welfare maximizing public firm. Dong and Guo (2013) consider a developing country with one state-owned firm and n private firms. There is a developed country with two firms, and those firms own better technology. The state-owned firm is the acquirer in cross-border acquisition whereas the domestic private firm exports products. They analyze which of the foreign firms is acquired by the state-owned firm. To analyze cross-border merger and acquisitions by firms from developing countries, we consider a world composed by three countries with segregated markets.Footnote 4 In this model a developing country is served by two domestic firms, one privately-owned and the other publicly-owned, whereas a developed country is served by two domestic private firms. The firms in the two countries export products to a third country. Firms from the developing country are less efficient in production than those from the developed country. To overcome the disadvantage in efficiency, a firm from the developing country may acquire a firm from the developed country, incurring a fixed cost, thereby obtaining the technical know-how owned by the acquired firm.Footnote 5 We assume that at most there is one acquisition, and that it needs to be permitted by both the government of the developing country and that of the developed country. Firms face decreasing returns to scale. We assume in the paper that if a firm from a country that is less efficient in production wants to acquire a firm with better technology from a foreign country it needs permission from its government and, subsequently, from the foreign government. There is evidence supporting this assumption. In both North America and Europe the authorities have blocked acquisitions by Chinese firms, mainly in the technology sector, arguing national security reasons.Footnote 6 Limitations on purchases of foreign companies can also come from the country of origin. Chinese firms need to have the full backing of the Chinese government in order to close foreign deals. They need approval to get enough foreign exchange, which is monitored closely by the government, to pay for the acquisitions. Also, many of the firms chasing after foreign deals are actually state-owned firms.Footnote 7 We find that the firms from the developing country want to acquire a foreign firm with better technology if the fixed cost of acquisition is low. For intermediate costs only one of them wants to engage in cross-border acquisition. In that case, if the acquisition assures small (significant) gains in efficiency, only the private firm (the state-owned firm) from the developing country wants to engage in cross-border acquisition. There is evidence of state-owned firms engaging in cross-border acquisition to access advanced technology. In 2012, Liu Gong Machinery Corp, one of the largest wheel loader manufacturers in the world, and a leading exporter of machines from China, acquired Huta Stalowa Wola and its distribution subsidiary. In the transaction, Liu Gong obtained core technologies that will help it advance its product designs and promote sales to Liu Gong’s European customers.Footnote 8 There is also evidence of private firms engaging in cross-border acquisition. For example, the Chinese automobile maker Geely acquired Volvo in 2010. In 2012, Sany Heavy Industry, a private Chinese construction equipment group acquired Putzmeister, a German company that makes high-tech concrete pumps.Footnote 9 The acquisition has to be permitted by both governments. The government of the developing country grants permission for the acquisition to just one domestic firm: That which generates a greater increase in domestic welfare. If the inefficiency of the acquirer is very high, the developed-country government vetoes cross-border acquisitions by firms from developing countries. In general, if the inefficiency of the acquirer is low the developing country only permits its private firm to acquire a firm from the developed country and the government of the latter country does not block it. Social welfare in both countries increases with the acquisition. If the level of inefficiency is intermediate, the developing country only grants its state-owned firm permission to acquire. The government of the developed country does not block the acquisition although it prefers the private firm as the acquirer. Finally, if the level of inefficiency is high the government of the developed country only permits the foreign private firm to be the acquirer, so the government of the developing country has to grant permission to that firm although it prefers the state-owned firm as the acquirer. The results obtained in this paper permit to explain partially the reasons why firms from developing countries want to acquire firms from developed countries, and why governments may veto such acquisitions. For example, the acquisition of Hula Stalowa Wola by Lin Gong Machinery Corp., a Chinese publicly owned firm, had the objective of obtaining the best technology from the former firm. A similar example is the acquisition of Volvo by the private Chinese firm Geely. As these acquisitions increased the social welfare of both countries, their governments permitted them. However, there are also examples of acquisition attempts that were vetoed by the government of the developed-country since it reduced its social welfare. One recent veto was imposed by the German government to avoid the microchip maker Aixtron being purchased by Fujian Great Chip Investment Fund.Footnote 10 In this last example, the different technological level between the two firms was the reason what prevented the acquisition. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 2.1 presents product market competition in the different cases analyzed. Section 2.2 examines cross-border acquisition by firms from the developing country. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 study whether the two governments permit cross-border acquisitions. Section 3 discusses the robustness of the results, and Section 4 concludes.",1

Second, Daniel Dias is leaving the executive board (ExB) and joining the group of Associate Editors. We thank Daniel for his fantastic work as a co-editor during these four years. Third, Ana Fernandes has joined the ExB and we wish her all the best in her new position. Finally, Samuel Beattie will be replaced by a new publishing editor. The 14th Annual Meeting of PEJ was the first to be postponed and the first to be held in a hybrid format: both in-person and online. We are deeply grateful to Ricardo Gonçalves (chair), Mariana Alves Cunha, and Francisca Oliveira for organising such an excellent conference at Católica-Porto Business School. We are also indebted to Joana Silva and the scientific committee's remaining members, who assessed manuscript submissions both in 2020 and in 2021. Ana Rute Cardoso and Beata Javorcik were the keynote speakers, and we also thank them for their patience. The 2nd ConsultAccount award for the best paper presented by a PhD student was won by Elizaveta Sizova. We are grateful to ConsultAccount and Pedro Brinca for this initiative. The 15th Annual Meeting of PEJ will go back to Angra do Heroísmo and will take place at its Cultural Centre. The conference will be hosted by the Faculty for Agricultural and Environmental Sciences of the University of Azores and will be organised by ACDA, from 8 to 10 July 2022. The local organising committee is composed of Tomás Dentinho (chair) and Elisabete Martins. Mónica Costa Dias will lead the scientific committee and Isabel Horta Correia will be one of the keynote speakers. As usual, the submission deadline is 15 March and the 3rd ConsultAccount award will be up for grabs amongst PhD students.",

This view on the benefits of competition, common in many, if not most, markets outside the health sector, requires some careful analysis when applied to health care markets. These are markets with several imperfections and often extensive regulation is present. Thus, policy makers need to be more cautious about the effects of policies that aim at increasing competition in the healthcare marketplace. Competition should be seen as a tool, as a policy instrument, and not as an end in itself.Footnote 1 We address here a patient choice initiative in the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS) that has two particular features. It involves shared decision making between patients and GPs, in the choice of hospital for referral, which should be based on publicly available information on “quality”. This patient choice initiative (described below), unlike what occurred in other countries, did not involve payment changes to NHS hospitals, which are funded by global budgets and not paid directly by episode of treatment. Thus, endogenous “quality” choices by hospitals can be considerably different from the cases in which more demand is associated with more net revenues (while in the patient choice initiative addresses here, more demand results in more costs but not more revenues). And the way different providers react is related to initial asymmetries in “quality” across hospitals, requiring an adequate empirical strategy. The empirical findings corroborate the importance to distinguish different reactions to the policy choice initiative by providers, according to their initial asymmetries in quality choices. There is a growing health economics literature on the introduction of competition in health care markets. The work of Siciliani and Straume (2019), building on the model introduced by Brekke et al. (2011), provides a useful framework to discuss quality choices under regulated prices (although the existence of regulation is not explained). It sets out that ambiguous effects emerge, with particular outcomes being dependent on technical aspects of benefit functions, among other aspects. This leaves for empirical findings to sort out the actual effect of patient choice reforms. The main literature on the role of competition for hospital quality decisions is summarised in Brekke et al. (2021). Previous literature has found, in a majority of cases, positive effects associated with competition (free choice by patients), although some negative impacts have also been documented. Such previous literature has not considered, up to our knowledge, a NHS context with hospital funding not responding to patient flows (by design) and explicit consideration of asymmetric responses by providers to the policy reform. The work of Brekke et al. (2021) considers a patient choice reform in Norway, as hospitals in a NHS were exposed to non-price competition similar to the one explored here. Some crucial differences exist between the two reforms, in Portugal and in Norway, while similarities can also be found. The reform in Norway is the closest to the one that took place in the Portuguese NHS, with a crucial difference being the absence of direct revenue effects in the Portuguese case. Revenue streams are guided by patient flows in the Norwegian case. Bjorvatn and Ma (2011), looking at the 2001 choice reform in Norway, show that differences in waiting times across hospitals determined mobility flows (mainly in younger patients). Brekke et al. (2021) document a (larger) decline in waiting times in hospitals facing stronger competition. They take their testable hypothesis from a model assuming a symmetric equilibrium, and as such all hospitals are expected to behave in the same way in response to the policy reform introducing free choice of hospital by patients. However, there is no reason to use such assumption, at least in the Portuguese context, as it will be detailed below. Differences in qualities (waiting times, in the empirical discussion) across hospitals before the policy reform arise due to systematic hospital differences and are not the outcome of random elements. Thus, the source of the initial asymmetric qualities of hospitals is also a likely source for asymmetric reactions to the introduction of a free choice policy of hospital by patient (and GPs). Moscelli et al. (2019) find that relaxing patient constraints on hospital choice in England resulted in lower quality in some procedures (hip and knee replacement) and no effect on others (coronnary bypass). The authors mention the role of (lack of) profitability in those procedures is behind their findings. The view that increasing competition amongst hospitals leads to higher quality is common, but does not seem to hold in several empirical settings. Gaynor (2006) provides a simple argument for this to be the case when hospitals face regulated prices and the price received by treating an extra patient is above the corresponding cost. Other models question this rationale by introducing other features from health systems (Katz 2013; Brekke et al. 2014). The model laid down by Moscelli et al. (2019) illustrates how the effect of competition depends on the properties of the cost function and the degree of altruism (by providers). We differ from their model in one important respect: we consider heterogeneous providers, giving origin to different starting points and to different responses to the policy change. We share with Moscelli et al. (2019) the explicit inclusion of the role of altruism, as it may lead to treatment of patients and choice of quality levels that bring a loss to the provider. In a different direction, Santos et al. (2015) document the impact of a patient choice initiative in England upon choices in primary care use. Their starting point is that “a necessary condition for greater patient choice to improve quality is that a provider will face higher demand if they improve their quality” (Santos et al. 2015, p. 445). Implicit is the assumption that higher demand will bring more revenues. Their main finding is that patients do indeed react to differences in quality across providers.Footnote 2 Thus, patient choice reforms across different health systems and contexts yield context-dependent results. We explore below a patient choice initiative in the Portuguese NHS. The first element of analysis, before proceeding to the data, is to establish in a clear way the expected effects of the policy, given the institutional features of Portuguese National Health Service. We show that explaining initial asymmetries in qualities (waiting times) with systematic differences in hospital characteristics (cost advantages, managerial talent) leads to potential asymmetric responses to the introduction of patient choice in the NHS. This implies that the empirical analysis has to accommodate such asymmetries. Explicitly allowing for it reveals that reactions are indeed different, with top quality hospitals reducing their qualities (increasing waiting times) after the patient choice initiative is introduced. The paper is organised as follow. Section 2 briefly details the patient choice initiative. Next, Sect. 3 presents a simple model illustrating the main economic forces at play. Section 4 reports on the data and data sources for the empirical analysis. Then, Sect. 5 presents the main empirical results. Section 6 reports on robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 7 has concluding remarks.",

Santos Silva,Silvana Tenreyro,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Fifteen years after its publication, this is perhaps a good time to reflect on the influence of our paper “The Log of Gravity” (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006).Footnote 1 In that paper we challenged the long-established practice of estimating constant-elasticity models in their log-linearized form, and proposed as an alternative the use of an estimator that conveniently coincides with the Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator of Gourieroux et al. (1984). Building on early contributions of Goldberger (1968), Papke and Wooldridge (1996), and Manning and Mullahy (2001), in Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) we presented a clear explanation of why the estimation of log-linearized models could lead to misleading results, provided an unequivocal recommendation for the use of the PPML estimator, and clearly illustrated the advantages of this estimator. In our view, the simple message of the paper and the clarity and relevance of the examples we provided, were the key factors for its popularity.Footnote 2 In this paper, we consider the reasons for the impact of “The Log of Gravity” and summarize some of the developments that contributed to its enduring relevance. In doing this, we provide a brief review of the state-of-the-art in the estimation of the gravity equation for trade, which may be useful to the less experienced researchers. Many of the methods and developments we discuss are also relevant for the estimation of constant-elasticity (multiplicative) models for other kinds of data, and we also refer to some of these applications. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the problem with the traditional least squares estimator of gravity equations and Section 3 discusses several aspects of the PPML estimator. Section 4 discusses specification tests for gravity models and Section 5 reviews the simulations and the results of the empirical application we presented in Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). In Section 6 we provide examples of the use of the PPML estimator in different fields and, finally, Section 7 contains some brief concluding remarks.",9
