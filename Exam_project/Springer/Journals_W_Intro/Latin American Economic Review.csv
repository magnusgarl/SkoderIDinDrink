On the one hand, flows of goods have continued to increase along with, if not faster than, the general trend towards greater vertical specialization in the world economy. China’s entry into the world economy considerably dampened the hopes that NAFTA had raised for Mexican export performance, but by now there are clear signs that US–Mexican integration continues apace. Financial integration has clearly accompanied the integration of trade and production (Lahrech and Sylwester 2013). Of course barriers to the movement of people have not fallen at the same pace, and remain politically fraught. Rivers of ink have been devoted to the causes, consequences and regulation of migration over the border, but the very shortest of trans-border trips, in which someone comes and goes within the same day—perhaps within a few hours—have gone relatively unattended. On one level this is quite understandable since such short trips are necessarily confined to the border region, unlike immigration which has effects throughout both nations. Yet changes in the regulations governing very short trips are of tremendous local consequence. They also have wider national consequence to the extent that the communities that constitute the border loom increasingly large within their national economies and populations. Border regions can either be vibrant areas of commercial interchange that contribute to the dynamism of their larger economies, or at the other extreme, they can be relatively isolated, peripheral areas where stagnation reduces national progress. In a much cited conceptual paper on cross-border contact, based primarily on the US–Mexican border, Martinez (1994) categorizes borderlands into four categories: alienated, where due to hostility cross-border interaction is severely restricted; co-existent, with limited binational integration; interdependent, where a mutually beneficial economic system is created through the flow of resources and people across the border; and integrated, where barriers to trade and human movements have been eliminated, and the border economies are functionally merged. In the spirit of Martinez’s view of an integrated border, Cooper and Rumford (2013) argue that borders must be regarded as mechanisms of connectivity and encounter rather than markers of division. An example of such a border is discussed in Prokkola’s (2010) study of the transition of the internal border regions of the European Union. Focusing on tourism in the frontier between Finland and Sweden, Prokkola finds that border permeability has contributed to dissolution of mental boundaries in the region. In this paper, we examine two periods that experienced dramatic changes in the rules and regulations governing movement between the US and Mexico. The rules concern the documentation that US residents need to produce in order to reenter the US from Mexico. We seek to establish whether these changes in regulations are important in explaining the reduction, over the past two decades, in day trips from the US into Mexico (and back). This reduction in day trips stands in marked contrast to the increasing volumes of goods and services trade, as well as tourism that is not associated with the border. We begin (in Sect. 2) with a very short discussion of the importance of the border region to the Mexican economy, and the role that short visits may play in the border region’s economic and social development. We then provide (in Sect. 3) a provisional outline of the two changes to the border crossing regulatory regime that have been of considerable consequence for recorded cross-border day trips. We also briefly discuss a critical confounding factor, namely the dramatic increase in the homicide rate within the Mexican border states. Sections 4 and 5 present estimates of the impact of the two regulatory regime changes on day trips. The conclusion summarizes the implications of our analysis for the growth and transformation of the border economy and the tourism sector.",3
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,11 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0028-4,Climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean: policy options and research priorities,December 2015,Brian Feld,Sebastian Galiani,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Global warming is a particularly thorny externality because it is global and its effects extend for many decades into the future. To complicate matters even more, it has heterogeneous effects around the world. It requires a level of effort and commitment from the international community that is unparalleled in history, its consequences are potentially disastrous, and it is plagued with uncertainties. While the physical mechanism that links greenhouse gases to global warming is clear and records show that the concentration of greenhouse gases has been increasing in the atmosphere for the last two centuries, a long list of scientific uncertainties makes it difficult to assess precisely how much warming will result from a given increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, when such warming will occur, or how it will affect different regions and ecosystems. To address these concerns, the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization established an international body—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—to assess the scientific knowledge on climate change. Projecting future climate trends is a complex endeavor. To cope with these complexities, the IPCC produced a set of emissions scenarios. Each scenario provides an alternative and internally consistent picture of how world development might shape future emission trends. Taking into account these scenarios, along with uncertainty about emissions and climate-system response, projected twenty-first century warming ranges from 1.1 to 6.4 °C (IPCC 2007). Thus, while the magnitude of global warming that might occur in the future is indeed highly uncertain, all these scenarios agree on its upward direction. Just as the effects of global warming on the climate system are uncertain, the physical and socioeconomic implications of climate change are not fully understood. Thus, uncertain physical risks are compounded by uncertain natural and socioeconomic consequences. Uncertainty about the effects of climate change and how to cope with them is also compounded by uncertainty about its cost. Costs are unknown due to possible changes in the available technology, the existence of irreversibilities in some policies that cope with the problem, and the presence of nonmarket goods and services that are vulnerable to climate change. In short, uncertainty is the single most important attribute of climate change as a policy problem. A central concept in analyzing the effects of climate change is whether a system can be managed. The nonagricultural sectors of high-income countries are highly managed and this feature will allow them to better adapt to climate change. However, human and natural systems that are unmanaged or unmanageable are highly vulnerable. These systems include rain-fed agriculture, seasonal snow packs, coastal communities, river runoffs, and natural ecosystems. Thus, the potential damage of climate change is likely to be most heavily concentrated in low-income and tropical regions such as tropical Africa, Latin America, coastal states, and the Indian subcontinent. The economics of climate change is simple. When we burn fossil fuels we emit CO2 into the atmosphere, and this leads over time to potential harmful effects. Such a process is an externality that occurs because those who produce the emissions do not pay for that privilege, and those who are harmed are not compensated. One major lesson from economics is that unregulated markets cannot efficiently deal with harmful externalities. Any solution needs substantial reductions in the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. An obvious instrument to achieve that goal is to raise the market price of those emissions. Raising the price on carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to consumers to reduce the consumption of goods and services that are carbon-intensive. Second, it will provide signals to producers to substitute away from inputs that are carbon-intensive. Third, it will provide market incentives to innovate and adopt new low-carbon products and process. Fourth, a carbon price will economize on the information that is required to undertake all these tasks (Nordhaus 2008). Rapid technological change in the energy sector is central to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Current low-carbon technologies cannot substitute for fossil fuels without a substantial economic penalty on carbon emissions. Developing economical low-carbon technologies will lower the cost of achieving climate goals. Therefore, governments and the private sector must intensively pursue low-carbon or even noncarbon technologies. There are, of course, other actions that can be taken to manage the problem of global warming. Some of these actions are best performed by governments, while others are best undertaken by private agents acting on their own, such as adapting production practices to a changed climate. A general typology classifies these actions into mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation focuses directly on reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere (thus assuming that human activity is partly responsible for the issue), while adaptation deals with increasing resilience to the consequences of climate change. Developed countries, which are better prepared to cope with climate change, have stressed the importance of mitigation in order to limit temperatures to a range between 2 and 3 °C above preindustrial levels depending upon costs, participation rates, and discounting. Achieving such an objective will require a mitigation effort that is global in scope. International agreements should provide incentives to encourage participation, but the cost of those incentives should also be taken into account. To date there are no such agreements. This paper argues that in the absence of binding international agreements that limit the levels of carbon emissions, Latin America should mainly focus on adaptation to cope with climate change consequences. The paper also argues that the region should implement traditional development policies that increase resilience to climate change but that are also welfare-improving in the absence of climate change (also known as “nonregret” policies). Only in the presence of a global binding agreement like that mentioned in the previous paragraph would the region engage seriously in mitigation. In that case, Latin America could exploit its comparative advantage in the conservation and management of forests, which are a large carbon sink. Finally, deciding which policies to implement depends on the results of thorough cost–benefit analysis of competing projects. Such cost–benefit analyses have yet to be carried out. The next section of the paper describes the projected trends in climate change and what has been suggested to overcome them. Section 3 then presents a list of available policies that have been proposed to address climate change, divided into three broad categories: adaptation, mitigation, and development policies that increase countries’ adaptive capacity. Section 4 presents a theoretical framework, and Sect. 5 provides a framework for evaluating different policies by their cost-effectiveness so that policymakers can efficiently choose the ones that should be implemented. Section 6 looks at the agricultural sector, an unmanaged system that has long been assumed to be able to adapt autonomously, while Sect. 7 will concentrate on forestry, a sector on which the region should focus in the event that appropriate incentives for emissions reduction are put in place. The final section summarizes and draws conclusions in order to propose the direction for future research.",7
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,11 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0027-5,Urban infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean: public policy priorities,December 2015,Laura Jaitman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Most of the world’s population today lives in cities. However, this has been true only since 2007, when the urban population surpassed the rural population due both to natural growth of the urban population as well as accelerated rural migration to cities (United Nations 2009; Henderson 2002). The global urbanization process was mainly driven by the developing world, where the urban population grew at 3.35 % annually during the period 1975–2010, while the rural population grew at around 1 % (United Nations 2009). By 2011, 53 % of the world’s population lived in cities, including 80 % of the population in the developed world and 46 % of the population in developing countries. However, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is an outlier among lower- and middle-income regions, with a strikingly high urbanization rate of 79 %—higher even than the urbanization rate of many member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Rural to urban migration is driven by the expectation of better opportunities and living standards. In cities, residents and firms enjoy the benefits of agglomeration and economies of scale as well as network effects, all of which increase labor productivity and reduce the per capita cost of providing urban services (Rauch 1993). Yet, the expected benefits of living in cities do not materialize for all. The rapid and unplanned expansion of cities has resulted in the growth of informal settlements, which develop because governments are unable to provide urban services for the growing population and because the formal housing market and transport networks cannot meet the new demands. A large proportion of the urban poor in developing countries live in urban or peri-urban areas under conditions of overcrowding, insecure property rights, deficient urban and social services, poverty, and exposure to crime and violence, among other socioeconomic problems. Consequently, migration to urban areas moved the location of global poverty to the cities, triggering the process known as the “urbanization of poverty” (UN-Habitat 2003). In LAC, approximately 60 % of the poor and half of the extreme poor live in urban areas. The urbanization of poverty is projected to continue in the region, particularly in certain areas such as Central America (Fay 2005). Slums represent a major challenge to development given the deficient provision of urban services to them, the lack of public safety, and environmental hazards. In addition, the geographical and social segregation of slum dwellers accentuates bad peer effects and sometimes inflicts a stigma on slum dwellers that prevents them from joining the formal labor market. Thus, programs to avoid new informal settlements and to stop the growth of existing ones should be of first-order importance on the LAC research and policy agenda. Also, governments need to urgently find solutions to integrate the actual slum dwellers into the formal city and solve the urban divide. This paper identifies the main problems in housing and urban infrastructure in LAC and reviews the causal effect of past interventions within urban infrastructure programs in the region. The ultimate goal is to understand what has worked in terms of housing and transport and to detect gaps in knowledge to promote avenues for future research for a more sustainable urbanization process. The paper looks to explore what drives the decisions of households in terms of consumption of household services and location within a city—decisions that, in turn, shape urban patterns. Many urban poor cannot afford formal housing or are confined to live in substandard conditions close to the city center because transport systems that would enable them to live elsewhere are deficient or inaccessible. This leads to the first two policy priorities that will be investigated further in this paper: access to the formal housing market and improvement of the public transit network. The rationale for these first two priorities is based on the fact that the rapid and unplanned urbanization of LAC distorted the equilibrium of housing supply and demand, and to date that equilibrium has not been restored. There are market failures in the formal housing market for the poor that prevent or delay this adjustment. At the same time, in the developing world mass public transport is deficient, which affects the living standards of the urban poor. It is therefore clear that the integration of formal housing supply and mass public transit policies are the key elements to shape more sustainable cities in the future and accommodate the still growing urban population. Slums could be viewed as a first step in the move to the city. Inner slums are located close to the city center and might be a strategic starting point for newly arrived poor migrants to look for a job and explore opportunities. However, as can be seen in LAC, slums tend to be a permanent rather than a transitory phenomenon. Therefore, the third policy priority explored in this paper is slum upgrading to improve the living standards of slum dwellers and mitigate urban poverty. Although the urban poverty problem is multi-causal and requires a cross-sectoral approach, including citizen security and health for example, the scope of this paper is limited to the main barriers to the integration of the urban poor in terms of housing and transport. Other important socioeconomic and environmental problems related to the urban poor are excluded from the analysis. When studying the causal effects of interventions, identification issues are of the first order of relevance. We include mainly papers that exploit experimental or quasi-experimental settings.Footnote 1 Those methods have proven to be the most accurate for causal inference. Nevertheless, we also include important observational studies or qualitative evaluations when more rigorous evaluations are not yet available. Most of the programs reviewed take place in the developing world, with priority given to LAC, unless there is no information available for developing regions, in which case relevant papers from other regions are included. In terms of the first priority area, there is scant knowledge on the best way to expand the supply of housing for the poor and promote the rental market in LAC for low-income households. There is, however, a body of literature with sound identification strategies on formalizing urban poor by giving them land titles. The second policy priority is to improve transport networks for the poor. The most urgent area for future research is to find ways to make mass public transit accessible and affordable for the poor and to investigate how this can shape the spatial patterns of the city. Policies that integrate transport reforms with supply of housing for low-income households seem the most promising Finally, for informal settlements, there are many papers investigating the effect of slum upgrading programs. Proposals that involve a single intervention to improve the living standards of the urban poor have improved the level of satisfaction of households, but have not substantially improved the main socioeconomic outcomes of slum dwellers. It seems that integral slum upgrading programs are necessary to produce more profound and long-lasting changes. Rigorous evaluation of integral programs will be very useful to determine which mix of programs produces the best outcomes. The rest of the document is structured as follows: Section 2 sets the region in the context of the world in terms of a wide range of housing and transport indicators. Section 3 develops a simple spatial equilibrium approach that serves as a theoretical framework to understand housing choices. Section 4 studies a set of programs within the main selected policy areas: (1) access to housing, (2) transport interventions, and (3) upgrading housing. Finally, Sect. 5 presents conclusions that point out avenues for future research.",26
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,11 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0026-6,Progress and challenges in achieving an evidence-based education policy in Latin America and the Caribbean,December 2015,Miguel Urquiola,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recent years have seen increasing calls for evidence-based education policies. In fact, academic researchers have been on a quest for such policies for decades—at least since the publication of the Coleman Report on the equality of educational opportunity (Coleman et al. 1966).Footnote 1 This paper reviews some of the significant contributions economists have made in the area of evidence-based education policies. It also argues that this quest is incomplete, and identifies substantial knowledge gaps, some of which are unlikely to be filled based on the current trends. Two notes on the focus of the paper are relevant. First, in keeping with this volume, the discussion emphasizes Latin America, although the evidence comes from, and the conclusions are meant to apply to, countries in other regions and with diverse income levels. Second, the focus is on assessing the skills that individuals gain in educational systems before they enter the labor market; less attention is placed on the performance of systems in terms of increasing enrollment. This focus—which Sect. 2 justifies in more detail—is based on the fact that in Latin America, as in other developing regions, much greater strides have been made in increasing enrollment. In addition, the region performs at or above what its income levels might suggest in terms of enrollment, but lags in terms of measures of skills such as test scores.Footnote 2
 The paper begins by setting out a conceptual framework that serves to organize past work and identify remaining gaps. It then considers the evidence, with five main conclusions: Over the past two decades, much effort has gone into identifying the causal effects of school inputs. As Banerjee (2007) suggests, this trend reflects a substantial effort by economists to “get into the machine”—that is, to study schools in detail and understand the educational production function. The growth in this type of research is a salutary trend, as in many countries the implementation of many if not most educational interventions still goes unevaluated. It follows that this type of research should be expanded, even if it means that some education economists must go further into the machine. For example, work on the effectiveness of different types of curricula—a topic far afield from most economists’ training—could not only be quite productive but also seem to be a logical extension of current work. That said, work that is primarily focused on identifying the causal effects of different inputs and interventions—particularly when it originates in small-scale experiments—is unlikely to produce a full road map for an evidence-based education policy. Specifically, the sometimes explicit promise of this work has been to generate a ranking of inputs and interventions in terms of cost-effectiveness, with the rationale that such rankings will one day guide policy throughout the developing world (Dhaliwal et al. 2011). For reasons discussed below, however, such rankings are unlikely to be stable across or even within countries—they may vary with the setting and/or scale of implementation, for instance. This also suggests some caution in implementation. There has been less work on the effects of educational inputs during the preschool stage. The relative scarcity of such work may be a greater constraint to sound policy recommendations than at first appears. For example, if educational investments made early in life affect the productivity of investments made later (Cunha and Heckman 2007)—and this remains to be fully shown—then an evidence-based educational policy will look more complicated. In other words, it will have to take into account that part of the return to preschool educational investments that may come in the form of increasing the returns to educational investments during a later period (e.g., high school). In short, further work on the impact of preschool inputs is desirable and may also help to improve policy beyond the preschool sphere. There has been progress on understanding the effects of incentives within education. For example, there has been significant work on the effects of introducing competition in school systems. In general, the effects of voucher and similar initiatives have not been nearly as robust or positive as most economists expected. That said, recent research suggests progress toward understanding how the design of policies introducing competition (e.g., school vouchers) might be improved. In short, while caution in implementation is desirable, further experimentation also seems warranted. There is relatively less work surrounding the effects of inputs provided by parents and students, both in terms of resources and effort. The key issue here is to what extent parental and student effort matter, and how their level responds to incentives. Parents are even harder for policymakers to control than school administrators or teachers, so understanding incentives is critical. For example, the return to skill in the labor market, or in admission to universities, may be crucial in terms of determining parents’ and students’ attitudes toward skill accumulation. The corollary is that the organization of the educational market, and its relation with the labor market, may involve a broad set of institutions that set up an educational system for either success or failure. If this is the case, then understanding these incentives may be essential not only to school system design but also to correctly exploiting all the knowledge gained from experimentation. In short, while education economists might want to invest energy “getting into the machine”, they should not lose sight of the fact that broad institutions/incentives may matter (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The next section lays out a basic conceptual framework. Sections 3–6, then review research and derive the implications discussed above, and Sect. 7 puts forth conclusions.",3

Evidence from Mexico’s Seguro popular,December 2015,Tobias Pfutze,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the start of its roll-out in 2004, Mexico’s health insurance system Seguro Popular has received considerable attention in the academic, as well as, policy literatures. These can be subdivided into three broad topics: (i) the incidence of a non-contributory health insurance on labor market decision, in particular informality; (ii) whether or not the program was successful in its stated aim of increasing access to quality health services and reducing out of pocket expenses on health care, and, lastly; (iii) the effect of the insurance on health outcomes. Regarding this last point, thus far, most of the studies have failed to find any significant effect (Barros 2008; Martínez and Aguilera 2010; King et al. 2009; Knox 2008). However, as most health outcomes, especially in adults, are slowly moving targets, it is doubtful whether one would expect to find any significant effect of a recently established program (Scott and Aguilera 2010). Focusing on shorter-term health outcomes, some authors have recently found evidence that program affiliation results in lower levels of cholesterol (Ruvalcaba and Parker 2010), lower blood pressure (Ruvalcaba and Parker 2010; Bleich et al. 2007), and lower infant mortality (Pfutze 2014). The present paper contributes to this last line of research. Similar to infant mortality, any effect of improved health care access on the likelihood of a miscarriage can be expected to manifest itself in the short-run. While there are some data-related problems (a relatively rare outcome, combined with a noisy measurement of program exposure) that affect statistical power, it is found that the program significantly reduced the risk of a miscarriage by around 0.04 % points for each percentage point increase in coverage of the target population. It is also shown that this effect is not changed much by potential selection on the outcome variable. The upshot is that during the first four and a half years of roll-out alone, Seguro Popular has prevented an estimated 47,986 miscarriages. These are economically important positive welfare effects that need to be included into every coherent assessment of the policy. Regarding the literature in the other lines of research, following Santiago Levy’s early critique that the program will undermine efforts to bring Mexico’s labor force into the formal sector (Levy 2008), several studies have set out to determine whether or not it changed the incentives to pursue formal vs. informal sector employment (Aterido et al. 2011; Azuara and Marinescu 2013; Barros 2008; Bosch and Campos-Vázquez 2014; Camacho et al. 2014; Campos-Vázquez and Knox 2013; Duval-Hernández and Smith-Ramírez 2011). In most cases, they either find no effect or a statistically significant, but fairly small shift toward informality. Other studies focus on changes in the access and use of health services in response to the program (Knox 2008; Sosa-Rubi et al. 2009), or the avoidance of catastrophic health expenditures (Grogger et al. 2010; Gakidou et al. 2006; Knaul et al. 2006; King et al. 2009). The principal findings are that the program has largely succeeded on both counts. The Seguro Popular health insurance program started its roll-out in January 2004, after a pilot program in 2002/03. The roll-out occurred at the level of locality, with localities that had a large proportion of its population uncovered being enrolled first. The insurance is de-facto non-contributory for all beneficiaries as it is free of charge for households in the bottom two wealth quintiles as determined by a uniform questionnaire, and for the immediate family of every child born after December 1, 2006. According to the Mexican health ministry, less than 1 % of the affiliated households pay for coverage. Its declared aim is to provide health insurance to the more than 50 % of Mexico’s population, mostly self-employed and/or in the informal sector of the economy, that did not get coverage through any of the employment linked programs or through the private market.Footnote 1 It does not replace any of the existing public health services, but adds a lowest tier of coverage to the existing system. Its distinguishing feature is that it is run as an insurance, not a direct provider of health services. It certifies health care providers and buys services from a list of close to 300 covered interventions (plus a separate list of interventions that would result in catastrophic health expenditures) at fixed prices. A large number of these interventions are related to pre-natal care.Footnote 2 While in theory any provider can be certified, the lion’s share is made up of clinics and hospitals run by the federal and state level ministries of health (Lakin 2010).",5
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,24 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0021-y,Does access to free health insurance crowd-out private transfers? Evidence from Mexico’s Seguro Popular,December 2015,Pedro P. Orraca-Romano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A number of developing countries have implemented social assistance programs with the purpose of benefiting the population located in the lower tail of the income distribution. Understanding the impact of these programs and how they compare to other public policies is central to the development process. This issue is especially salient in Mexico, a country with a per capita income approximately one-third of the U.S. and a high degree of income inequality, characterised by being at the forefront in putting into effect large public assistance programs whose objective is to increase its population’s human development levels. Given that such policies are often overlaid on top of pre-existing private support networks, various studies have analysed whether public assistance programs displace or crowd-out private transfers (e.g. Cox and Jimenez 1992; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1994; Attanasio and Ríos-Rull 2000; Jensen 2003). The present study contributes to this literature by examining whether the introduction of Seguro Popular, a free-of-charge publicly provided health insurance program for informal sector workers, crowded-out private transfers in Mexico.Footnote 1
 Seguro Popular covers the costs of 284 unique health care interventions and more than 300 medicines comprising 95.0 % of Mexico’s total disease burden (King et al. 2009). For more than 52 million people, Seguro Popular offers a generous means of support since it functions as a source of protection against catastrophic health expenditures, and provides a safety net to many of the country’s most vulnerable households. The program has been studied at length by researchers, who have mostly focused on its impact on health expenditures, health outcomes and sector of employment (e.g. King et al. 2009; Barros 2009; Galárraga et al. 2010; Barofsky 2011; Sosa-Rubí et al. 2009; Azuara and Marinescu 2013). The reduction in health expenditures derived from being affiliated in Seguro Popular may be large enough to influence the receipt of private transfers.Footnote 2
 If households receive private transfers to alleviate budget constraints, it might be expected that those enrolled in Seguro Popular receive fewer private transfers or stop receiving them altogether, since being affiliated to the program is likely to reduce health expenditures and help alleviate budget constraints by increasing disposable income. Alternatively, if private transfers are not a result of budget constraints or are used for other purposes unrelated to health expenditures, then private transfers might not be affected by enrolment in Seguro Popular. As a result, it is an empirical question whether and to what extent expenses not incurred in resulting from being affiliated to Seguro Popular affect the receipt of private transfers. If the program crowds-out private support, then the study is relevant for policy makers who must take into account this unintended effect of Seguro Popular, since some of the program’s goals might have been partially hampered. The choice to remit is typically preceded by the decision to migrate. Individuals migrate due to a variety of reasons related to income maximisation, minimising risks to family income, or overcoming capital constraints, among others. Prior to the implementation of Seguro Popular, vulnerable households commonly encountered out-of-pocket and catastrophic health expenditures attributed to outpatient care and medication, constraining them to reduce expenses in food, shelter, or education (Galárraga et al. 2010). Migrating and subsequently remitting represented a plausible alternative to overcome these difficulties. Although declining in recent years, international private transfers represent a significant source of income for Mexican households, accounting for 1.8 % of Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.Footnote 3 According to information from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) 143, Mexican migrants residing in the U.S. commonly claim that one of their main motives for remitting is to cover health expenditures in Mexico. Specifically, when asked to report up to five reasons why they send private transfers to family members left behind, 39.2 % of respondents state as one of their reasons that they send money to Mexico to cover health expenses. This category is only surpassed by food and maintenance, which is claimed to be one of the motives for remitting for 41.8 % of the U.S.-based remitters included in the MMP. On the contrary, education expenses are only reported as one of the reasons for remitting 12.1 % of the time. Consequently, various studies have analysed the relationship between private transfers and health expenditures, generally finding a positive correlation among the two variables (e.g. Airola 2007; Valero-Gil 2008; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2011).Footnote 4
 Given the significant segment of the population that Seguro Popular aimed to cover, the program was expanded gradually throughout Mexico. The variation in Seguro Popular’s availability and intensity over time and space allows to identify its causal effects, where differences between regions permit circumventing issues of selection into treatment among the uninsured population. While the expansion of Seguro Popular was not completely random, several studies have relied on the timing and rate of the program’s implementation to identify its impact on different outcomes (Bosch et al. 2012). To date, evidence on the impact of Seguro Popular on private transfers is non-existent, as the literature on Mexico has focused on whether social assistance programs such as Prospera, previously called Progresa and Oportunidades, or 70 y Más, both of which include a cash transfer component, crowd-out private support (e.g. Attanasio and Ríos-Rull 2000; Albarran and Attanasio 2003; Amuedo-Dorantes and Juarez 2015). The related international literature is limited to the study by Klohn and Strupat (2013), who investigate whether informal transfers in Ghana were affected by the introduction of a nationwide health insurance scheme. The scholars observe that the policy affected the likelihood of making or receiving informal transfers and their monetary equivalents. The results show that among households eligible for the program, a 1.0 % increase in the Seguro Popular coverage rate reduced the probability of receiving private transfers by 0.0555 % points. This finding appears to be driven by domestic private transfers, since the program’s effect is statistically significant for private transfers originating within Mexico, but is not significant for private transfers sent by foreign-based migrants. Moreover, the results show that Seguro Popular had a weak and non-significant negative effect on the amount of private transfers received. The study suggests that an unintended consequence of Seguro Popular is that the program partially crowds-out private transfers by reducing the likelihood of receiving them. The study proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the motives for remitting and how Seguro Popular may affect private transfers. Section 3 provides background information on the social security system in Mexico and Seguro Popular. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the methodology. Section 6 discusses the main results. Section 7 tests the sensitivity of the results. Section 8 concludes.",3

Innovation becomes essential to spur economic growth and to raise living standards. At the firm level, either competition or collusion could reward innovation by providing strong incentives for firms to be more efficient than their rivals. This paper aims to study the extent to which innovation incentives in a duopoly change according to the extent of product substitutability and the “technological distance” of firms. We draw particular attention to firms’ (full/partial) collusive behavior and attempt to address the following questions: What type of collusion (partial, full, none) should firms choose, and which one is more conducive to technological advancement and a firm’s growth? How do firms choose different types of collusion, and how do these affect market outcomes? Can the collusive strategy improve the consumer surplus and the social welfare, and which one serves best? Innovation through R&D investment leads to more efficient use of resources, creating sustainable competitive advantages. The most important aspect of R&D investment is the externality (spillovers) which has been studied through the divergence between the social and private returns of production process. The public goods feature of knowledge generates spillovers which allow others to use the owner’s innovation free of charge. Due to the spillover effect, the rate of return from an innovation is lesser and as a result, the incentives for carrying out R&D are reduced. The individual firm fears that competitors use its internal research results and thus probably increase their profits without having to bear the expenses. Therefore, the researching firm will only have limited incentive to invest in R&D. However, from the collective viewpoint, spillovers strengthen the dissemination of new knowledge available for the whole society, and improve the social welfare (Amir 2000). Within a game where firms are first engaged in costly research efforts to adopt a lower-cost technology and then compete in a Cournot fashion with homogeneous products, (D’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1988) (henceforth “AJ”) show that firms invest more under R&D cooperation than under R&D competition for sufficiently high spillover effects (full competition versus full cooperation). Kamien et al. (1992) (henceforth “KMZ”) extend the AJ model to a more general framework with product differentiation and allow firms to participate in a research joint venture (RJV). They show that firms should be encouraged to form a RJV only if they coordinate their R&D decisions while maintaining competition for sales. Concerning the welfare effects of cooperative R&D with spillovers, cooperation raises social welfare when the spillover is high (Suzumura 1992). Compared to aforementioned works, this paper emphasizes the “close relationship” between product differentiation and R&D spillovers. The key feature is to consider that the extent of product differentiation determines the ability of a firm to appropriate its rival’s R&D effort. In addition, this ability is influenced by the sensibility of spillovers relative to product differentiation, in other words, technological distance. Several explanations can be provided to justify this “close relationship”. First, when products are close substitutes, R&D efforts are less firm specific and a firm can more easily benefit from the discovery of a more efficient production technique resulting from rival’s R&D effort. Second, the exchange of technological information between engineers of competing firms is recognized as an important source of R&D spillovers (Severinov 2001). Spillovers are believed to be higher between technological neighbors. According to this view, the ability to make productive use of another firm’s knowledge depends on the degree of technological distance between firms. Every technology has a somewhat unique set of applications and language. Researchers in similar technological fields will interact in professional organizations, publish in commonly read journals, and, increasingly, browse a common set of web pages. It is natural to consider that the dissemination of technological knowledge across competing firms is strong when firms’ technologies are similar. Furthermore, the above-mentioned “close relationship” is divided into two categories: concave relationship (technological proximity) where firms adopt similar technologies (i.e., the similar smart phones produced by Apple, Blackberry, Nokia ...), convex relationship (technological alienation) where firms adopt different technologies (i.e., electricity can be produced by different technologies). To be more concrete, we take the electricity production, for example, electric power companies are differentiated by voltages, a commercial consumer may need a voltage level of 11 kV or 440 V while a residential consumer needs power at level of 240 V, this difference of voltages refers to product differentiation. The electricity can be produced by different technologies (i.e., solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear energy), this refers to the extent of technological distance. The R&D flow between companies employing the same output (voltage) and the same technique is obviously greater. In location models, the distance between firms determines the degree of product differentiation. By considering that R&D spillover depends negatively on firms’ product location, it is shown that R&D effort is positively associated with the differentiation of productsFootnote 1 (Piga and Poyago-Theotoky 2005). However, they do not address the important issue of cooperative behavior between firms in their models. In this paper, we consider a two-stage game where firms with heterogeneous products competing in a Cournot fashion engage in upstream R&D and downstream production. At each stage, the competing firms can either coordinate their decisions or adopt non-cooperative strategy. This assumption allows us to compare the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium (henceforth “SPNE”) emerging in the four separate scenarios : full competition, semi-collusion in ProductionFootnote 2, Semi-collusion in R&DFootnote 3 and Full CollusionFootnote 4. Compared to Kamien et al. (1992) which claim that the R&D investment by firms engaged in Semi-collusion in R&D is unambiguously greater than that in the Full Competition regime irrespective of spillovers, we demonstrate in fact which regime generates more R&D effort in equilibrium depends upon both the degree of product differentiation and the extent of technological distance. If we restrict our attention to the concave relationship, Full Collusion participants spend most on R&D, and Semi-collusion participants spend more than firms in the Full Competition regime. This ranking of R&D efforts is unalterable and independent of the product differentiation, and the competition at the upstream stage depresses R&D investment. Firms colluding in R&D regardless of their production strategy always yield more profit and generate higher social welfare than firms colluding in output independently of R&D strategy. When products are close substitutes, the synergy effects prevail over the anti-competitive effects due to the high spillovers, Full Collusion becomes a welfare-enhancing regime. Focusing on the convex relationship, R&D cooperation may reduce firms’ interest to invest in R&D, and it is possible that firms in the Full Collusion regime produce most and generate the highest level of social welfare. Furthermore, horizontal mergers might be interpreted as a Full Collusion where the participants coordinate their decisions with respect to all of strategic variables. Thus, we launch the discussion about antitrust policy, and shed light on the leniency of the total welfare standard and the restrictiveness of the consumer welfare standard. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and solves the SPNE in the four alternative regimes. We compare R&D effort, profit, consumer surplus and social welfare according to firms’ behavior (competitive or collusive) in Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes this paper.",8
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,11 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0017-7,Inflation targeting and term premia estimates for Latin America,December 2015,Andrew P. Blake,Garreth R. Rule,Ole J. Rummel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Recently it has become feasible to estimate affine models of the term structure in a routine manner. Such models produce term premia estimates and, therefore, allow us to back out expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As such they are extremely useful for the evaluation of the efficacy of monetary policy and the anchoring of interest rate expectations. Several newly available technologies have been proposed to estimate these models, but a particularly attractive one is that of Adrian et al. (2013) (henceforth ACM). Their approach uses OLS to estimate models that previously required maximum likelihood. The ‘cost’ associated with this is first the necessary use of observable dynamic factors to drive the term structure, and second the use of synthetic bond-price contracts derived from parameterized yield curves. ACM claim extremely good performance compared to more traditional alternatives. It is also computationally very inexpensive. Indeed, the New York Federal Reserve Bank has recently begun publishing daily term premia estimates using this method (see Adrian et al. 2014), complementing the daily publication of the yield curve estimates documented in Gürkaynak et al. (2007). There is considerable interest in fitting such models. The affine model enables us to calculate implied term premia along the curve and even interest rate expectations, although this requires us to assume that the term premia is the only source of risk compensation. In the last ten years, we have seen considerable turbulence in financial markets and commensurate actions by the US Federal Reserve have necessarily impacted upon Latin America. At the same time the Latin American countries we investigate have been pursuing monetary policy based on inflation targeting, with apparent success. We compare the results across countries where we have used no common information in the estimation. Interestingly, we find that long-run interest rate expectations remain stable in each country while movements in the term premia account for most of the observed variation in yields. The variation in term premia is remarkably similar across countries, indicating that a common factor seems to be at work. In several cases term premia correlates with the US, with comovement at particular events. Regional correlations are strong, and although the US affects Latin American countries in predicable ways the dominant effect seems to be from domestic monetary policy. Our analysis cannot prove by itself that inflation targeting has been the main driver of improved economic conditions. There have been a number of complementary recent studies analyzing Latin American term structures such as De Pooter et al. (2014), Ceballos et al. (2014), and Guarn et al. (2014) which are consistent with our findings and the hypothesis that improved monetary policy has at least partly been the cause. De Pooter et al. (2014) in particular show that Latin American inflation expectations are strongly anchored. As Ellingsen and Söderström (2001) discuss, long-run nominal rates reflect expected policy rates, term premia and inflation expectations. Decomposing the yield curve into policy rate expectations and term premia allows us to further investigate the evolution of policy credibility in Latin America. But as Gürkaynak (2014) lucidly makes clear, the precise cause of the fall in, say, inflation expectations remains unexplained. Our paper is another piece of evidence that inflation targeting has been a significant driver.Footnote 1
 In what follows, we apply the ACM method to four inflation targeting Latin American economies, using monthly zero-coupon yield data from Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru from 2005 to 2014, encompassing the global financial crisis and aftermath. We also report selected results for the US and Brazil. We obtain observable factors as the principal components of the term structure itself, and estimate Nelson–Siegel yield curves for each to provide the necessary synthetic contracts. The resulting curves allow us to fit affine models in a few seconds and the complete procedure is extremely easy to automate. To further anticipate our results we find that long-term policy rate expectations are solidly anchored for each of the four selected countries. This accords with a story of credible monetary policies linked to well-understood inflation targets. Almost all variations in yields are attributed to variation in term premia. The present paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the collection of methods used, both for yield curve estimation and for the ACM estimates. Sections 3 and 4 contain our empirical analysis, using Colombian data as an illustration for the methods before discussing the term premia estimates and their behavior. A final Sect. 5 concludes.",1
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,22 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-015-0016-8,Implicit redistribution within Argentina’s social security system: a micro-simulation exercise,December 2015,Pedro E. Moncarz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the reasons for the existence of compulsory contributory pension schemes is to ensure that income earners save out part of their incomes to cover for their expenditure needs when they retire from labor markets. The implicit assumption behind the need for a compulsory regime is that otherwise people would not save enough if the decision is left only on a voluntary basis. However, social security (SS) programs are also used as tools to redistribute income from the better-off to the worst-off. In the light of this second objective, it is usually the case that pension formulas include, to a less or more extent, some redistributive components (e.g. minimum pensions). Moreover, even retirement regimes based on the principle of actuarial fairness, like individual accounts defined contribution (IA-DC) programs, may also incorporate non-actuarial redistributive ingredients. Also, SS programs redistribute income through more subtle mechanisms. High mortality rates affect mostly to low-income workers when unified mortality tables are used (Garrett 1995; Duggan et al. 1995; Beach and Davis 1998). Government transfers to finance SS tend to favor the population covered by the programs which, as Rofman et al. (2008) point out, in developing countries tend to be the better-off. Low densities of contribution mean that some workers are left ineligible for benefits which, as shown in Forteza et al. (2009) and Berstein et al. (2006), are mostly low-income earners. The aim of achieving a more progressive redistribution of income through the design of pension regimes might collide with the objective of having systems that are self-funded. This trade-off has been present along the history of almost all pension programs around the world, Latin-America has not been the exception. Examples of this have been the regimes changes in Argentina (2004–2008), Chile (2008), Brazil (1988, 2003), Uruguay (2008) and Bolivia (2008), among others. As explained by Bertranou et al. (2011), the reform in Chile has its origin in the evidence that the system of individual accounts as designed in 1981 would meant that most pensioners would obtain very low benefits when compared with their incomes before retirement, with the most affected groups being low-income earners, seasonal workers, self-employed, and mostly women. To avoid this scenario, the reform of 2008 introduced a solidarity pension financed by the government, it also implemented different measures to increase the system coverage, especially among the most vulnerable groups mentioned above, and thirdly it looked at to improve the rate of return of the individual accounts through more competition among the fund administrators and the reduction of administrative fees. In the case of Brazil, the reform of 1988 introduced the concept of universal coverage, the no-discrimination against the rural population, and the protection of the real value of benefits. With these aims, a non-contributory pension was introduced for people with disabilities or older than 65-year-old that were in a situation of extreme poverty. While the reform of 2003 looked at the harmonization of the many pension regimes in order to minimize the inequalities between the general regime and the special ones. In Uruguay, in 2008, the government introduced a series of changes to the pension system looking at allowing that older people with insufficient contributions could access to a retirement benefit. In this regards, there was a reduction, from 35 to 30, in the minimum years of contributions, while keeping the retirement age at 60 years, while for unemployed workers with 28 years of contribution and 58-year-old it was implemented an unemployment subsidy for a maximum period of 2 years. Also, a non-contributory old-age pension was implemented for those in a more vulnerable social situation.Footnote 1 Finally, in the case of Bolivia, in 2008 it was implemented a universal non-contributory pension for all citizens 60 years or older which is financed with revenues that are not related to contributions made by workers and/or employers.Footnote 2 However, a challenge that needs to deal with is the huge unbalance between the contributory and non-contributory pillars of the system. Moving to the case of Argentina, which is the objective of this study, during the first half of the 2000s there was a series of changes aimed at increasing the proportion of the population with a pension benefit through the implementation of several moratoriums allowing people which had not fulfilled with the required years of contribution to have access to a pension benefit. However, in 2008, at the peak of the world economic crisis, there took place an structural change, with the abolishment of the mixed-system that was in place since 1994, and replaced by a publicly administered pay-as-go defined-benefit (PAYG-DB) scheme.Footnote 3 The official reason put by the government behind this change was the intention of protecting the value of the funds saved in the individual accounts, which had lost a great deal because of the world economic crisis.Footnote 4 However, another reason, maybe even more important than the previous one, was the need by Federal Government, which was unable to have access to world capital markets, of getting control over an accumulated fund of around 29 billion USD, and not least important an annual flow of nearly 4 billion USD in contributions previously diverted into the system of individual accounts. As can be appreciated from the examples just mentioned, in most cases the objectives behind the reforms were to increase the share of the population covered by the system and also to increase the replacement ratio of benefits. In what follows, we focus on the Argentine case, more particularly in the redistribution stemming from the fact that low-income workers tend to have systematically shorter contribution histories.Footnote 5 With this aim, we assess the implicit redistribution of the Argentine pension program on a lifetime basis. Using household surveys we simulate lifetime declared labor income and flows of contributions and benefits, and compute the expected present values of income and net flows. Standard distribution indexes are used to assess the distribution and redistribution implicit in the system. The main finding is that the current PAYG-DB system in Argentina appears to be slightly regressive, especially in the case of women working in the private sector, these results are robust to the use of alternative discount rates and definitions of pre- and post-social security wealth (SSW). If income from informal jobs is also accounted for, the system becomes slightly progressive. A similar result emerges under a weak enforcement of the system rules. Our main finding that a solidarity system as the PAYG-DB that is in place in Argentina is regressive appears to be at odds with the preconception that from a distributional point of view this type of arrangements are more progressive than a system with individual accounts, which almost by definition are actuarially fair. A possible explanation for our result that the PAYG-DB system does not improve income distribution is that if soft eligibility conditions were required, the system would be unbalanced from a financial point of view since contributions from current workers would not be sufficient to honor benefit payments, so the system requires strict eligibility conditions, especially in terms of the number of years of contributions, as well as low replacement ratios. This characteristic in an environment where informal job is widely present, at least for some population groups, means that many are left behind when reaching the age of retirement. This question, which is not present in a framework of individual accounts, mostly affects low-income earners, who are less likely to show compliance with the requirements for access to a retirement. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual framework. A brief description of the old-age pension program is presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the data, while Sect. 5 presents the methodology. The main results are discussed in Sect. 6, while Sect. 7 summarizes the main findings.",
24,1,Latin American Economic Review,20 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-014-0015-1,Intergenerational transmission of education: the relative importance of transmission channels,December 2015,Florian Wendelspiess Chávez Juárez,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Education is a main ingredient for a successful life in modern societies. However, in many countries the opportunities to get well educated strongly depend on the family background, particularly in Latin America. As a result, we observe very low intergenerational mobility. Understanding the mechanisms generating this intergenerational persistence in education is essential to target policy measures adequately. In this paper, I try to shed some light on this mechanism by applying a simultaneous equations model to data from Mexico. The main goal of the study was to estimate the relative importance of different transmission channels and their interactions. The three main mechanisms put forward in recent theoretical and empirical contributions can be broadly described as being the biological, the economic and the direct education-to-education channel. The biological channel refers to the genetic transmission of ability, often measured by the IQ, which explains a part of the relationship (Anger and Heineck 2010; van Leeuwen et al. 2008; Björklund et al. 2010; Black et al. 2009). Poor families facing credit constraints are an example for the economic channel, because they cannot borrow against the expected future earnings of their offspring, which generates a link between the socioeconomic situation of the parents and the schooling of their children (see for instance Black and Devereux 2010; Attanasio and Kaufmann 2009; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2007; Carneiro and Heckman 2002; Alfonso 2009). Finally, a higher return to education for children with highly educated parents is an argument for the direct education-to-education channel (Black and Devereux 2010). It might also include preferences for education, non-cognitive skills, aspirations and many other factors. The empirical literature focuses on estimating the causal effect of parental education on children’s education. Holmlund et al. (2011) revise this literature and propose a comparison of different methods applied to the same dataset from Sweden. They conclude that the estimates differ substantially across identification strategies and that no method is perfect. They find relatively modest causal effects of parental education and point to the importance of analyzing in more detail other mechanisms explaining the intergenerational transmission of education. They hypothesize about the possibility of an indirect effect of education through better socioeconomic environment that can be offered to children. This conclusion on the need of better understanding the mechanisms is shared by recent literature surveys such as Black and Devereux (2010), Björklund and Jäntti (2009) and Piketty (2000) who coherently argue that more empirical research must be undertaken to understand the mechanisms behind educational mobility and social mobility in general. Black and Devereux (2010, p. 69) conclude that “[...] there is still much work to do to pin down which family background factors are most important” and Björklund and Jäntti (2009, p. 516) argue that “a major challenge for future research is to find out what in the family other than income is important for the future of children”. This study tries to contribute in the proposed direction by moving from the estimation of one single causal effect to the estimation of a larger system of effects, incorporating simultaneously the three channels previously outlined. This focus on different mechanisms at the same time aims at getting a better understanding of the larger picture—the whole process of intergenerational transmission of education. In this respect, this approach should be seen as a complement to the single causal effect estimation and not as an alternative. The choice of Mexican data is primarily motivated by the importance of high intergenerational correlations in education in Latin America. Hertz et al. (2007) compare educational mobility of 42 countries including 7 Latin American ones. These seven countries take the first seven places ranked according to their intergenerational education correlation. The country with the highest correlation is Peru (0.66), followed by Ecuador, Panama and Chile. Within Latin American Countries, Mexico displays relatively high intergenerational persistence in education. Dahan and Gaviria (2001) compare 16 Latin American countries using data from the late 1990s and find that Mexico has the second lowest intergenerational mobility level behind El Salvador. de Hoyos et al. (2010) use recent data on social mobility in Mexico. They report correlations between the education in years of parents and children, finding the highest correlation of about 0.6 for the children cohorts born between 1942 and 1951, followed by a reduction of the correlation to about 0.5 for the cohort 1962–1971 and finally a new increase of the correlation to 0.55 for the youngest cohort, composed of children born between 1972 and 1981. According to the same authors, this recent increase is even higher when using different data sources. The same pattern of increasing educational mobility prior to the economic crisis in the 1980s and a subsequent decrease was found by Binder and Woodruff (2002), who use different cohorts to estimate the intergenerational link. Hence, the Mexican case is not only interesting on its own but might be representative for other Latin American Countries. Moreover, another advantage of Mexico is the high-quality data available. The suitability of the survey for this study is underlined by the availability of cognitive ability scores. Nevertheless, the analysis faces a series of empirical challenges in the form of trade-offs. This study tries to find a balance between a more complete model with very high data requirements and a simpler model in which less data are lost due to unavailable information. The main result is that even when controlling for parental education and ability, the economic situation of the family has the largest direct effect on the schooling outcome of children. This important source of inequality of opportunity could be reduced by policy interventions targeting the link between economic requirements and schooling. Moreover, the estimation shows that there are important interactions between the channels, suggesting that the exclusion of some channels might seriously bias estimates. In Sect. 2 I will review the literature on the mechanisms of educational mobility motivating my empirical models I present in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 I describe the data used and especially the needed transformations in detail and present some descriptive evidence. In Sect. 5 I present the main results, which are complemented by some figures in “Appendix B”. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",8

Martínez-Cruz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Air pollution remains a pressing issue in megacities located in developing countries. Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) is an infamous case. Pollution levels in MCMA regularly surpass limits suggested by the World Health Organization (CAI 2013). Also, MCMA has been ranked as the second most congested city in the world during 2014.Footnote 1 Effects of air pollution on the respiratory system have long been documented in MCMA (e.g. Escamilla-Nuñez et al. 2008; Romieu et al. 2008). Recent epidemiological studies report neuro-inflammation in otherwise healthy children residing in MCMA (Calderón-Garcidueñas et al. 2008). In general, air pollution produces larger health impacts in Mexico city than in similar cities located in a developed country (Arceo-Gomez et al. 2012). Public policies aiming to reduce air pollution have proved unsuccessful in MCMA. Launched in 1989, Hoy No Circula (HNC) program represents the most important governmental effort aiming to reduce pollution levels in MCMA.Footnote 2 HNC limits the number of weekdays a car is driven in Mexico City. HNC tackles the use of cars because it is the largest contributor to air pollution in MCMA—45% of volatile organic compounds and 81% of total nitrogen oxides (Molina and Molina 2002). Empirical studies have reported no impact from HNC on air pollution levels and an undesirable positive impact on numbers of cars driven (Gallego et al. 2013a, b; Davis 2008). Authorities frequently implement a pre-contingency plan that imposes temporary driving restrictions.Footnote 3 The most recent attempt to improve air quality, consisting in extending HNC to Saturdays, has been launched in July 2014. A question arises in this context—what is the WTP of a resident of MCMA for improved air quality? This paper elicits WTP for improved air quality by means of a single-bounded, referendum format contingent valuation question. Respondents state their willingness to monetarily contribute to improve air levels from observed regular quality to good quality. This paper pays particular attention to differences in WTP explained by individuals´ attitudes and concerns in three realms—environmental, social, and family. The economic literature has already established the relevance of individuals´ attitudes and concerns as factors behind variability in WTP (e.g. Bartczak 2015; Martínez-Espiñeira and Lyssenko 2011; Spash 2006; Spash et al. 2009). This paper illustrates this relevance in the Mexican context. To measure attitudes, respondents are asked to state their opinion on how important is the air pollution problem and the poverty/economic development problem. To measure concerns, respondents are asked to report (1) whether a family member (including himself) suffers an allergy or a respiratory illness; (2) whether there is a car at the household; and (3) family size. Average WTP in this paper—US $262 (2008 US dollars)—falls close to comparable estimates reported in previous studies. For instance, Hanna and Oliva (2015) report US $247 when using a gain-in-productivity approach. Results illustrate heterogeneity in WTP associated with environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. For instance, while respondents posing a very high priority to the air pollution problem have higher than average WTP (US $302), respondents in a household with more adults than the sample median (i.e. 2) have a lower than average WTP (US $214). While respondents posing a very high priority to the poverty/economic development problem have smaller than average WTP (US $222), respondents with a family member suffering allergies or respiratory illness have higher than average WTP (US $295). Indeed, this contingent valuation exercise provides elements to carry out cost–benefit analysis of policies aiming to improve air quality in MCMA—e.g. expansion of metro system, maintenance or replacement of sources of liquid petroleum gas leaks, taxi renovation, and use of hybrid buses (see García-Robles 2010; McKinley et al. 2005). Instances of cost–benefit analysis based on these estimates are presented in the discussion section.",15

Campos-Vazquez,Luis A. Mejia,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The less developed countries of the world have a greater prevalence of corruption (Bai et al. 2013). Numerous studies have explored how extractive institutions are related to corruption and hinder economic development (Acemoglu et al. 2005; Mauro 1995). The World Bank has affirmed that corruption is “among the greatest obstacles to economic and social development. It undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends” (World Bank 2015). Lack of trust in a society represents a form of diminished social capital and retards economic development (Algan and Cahuc 2013). In this paper, we examine the relationship between corruption and social capital, testing in particular the effectiveness of different institutions in promoting trust and cooperation under alternative corruption regimes. Recent work has attempted to understand the determinants of corruption at the microeconomic level using laboratory experiments (Abbink et al. 2002). In the corruption game, an individual offers a bribe to a public official and the official decides whether to accept the bribe in exchange for preferential treatment. This literature has focused mainly on interventions to decrease corruption (Abbink 2006). Other experimental studies in economics have focused on how to foster cooperation among groups. Studies of the public goods game, for example, have shown that the contribution of individuals to a common project decreases as the game progresses (Ledyard 1995). However, when individuals are allowed to punish other members of the group, most individuals use punishment targeted at free-riders as a device to increase contributions (Fehr and Gächter 2000). This literature has emphasized the powerful effect of punishment as a means of increasing contribution rates in a public goods game. In this paper, we bring together the concerns of these corruption and cooperation studies, analyzing whether frames of corruption affect how individuals cooperate in a public goods game. In order to examine the interaction of different punishment institutions with corruption regimes, we set up a two-stage between-subjects laboratory experiment with university students in Mexico. First, individuals are exogenously assigned to one of three groups: a corruption game with the probability of getting caught of 25 % (which we denote as the high-monitoring group), a corruption game with the probability of getting caught of 5 % (the low-monitoring group), and a control group not exposed to the corruption game. The corruption game consists of a firm offering a bribe to an official to get a special permit. After the corruption game, individuals play a public goods game in one of three different groups: the standard game, a game with centralized punishment executed by an exogenously assigned leader, or a game similar to the second one but with the added possibility of counter-punishment. Our key contribution is to demonstrate how mechanisms to improve cooperation are affected under different corruption scenarios. We find four main results. First, in the corruption experiment, individuals in the high-monitoring group commit fewer corrupt acts than those in the low-monitoring groups. This is true both for individuals acting as firms and for those acting as public officials. Second, individuals more exposed to corruption (low-monitoring) cooperate less in the public goods game than those who are less exposed (high-monitoring) and those who do not participate in the game. Third, introducing the option of punishment increases cooperation. However, this increase is greater in the high-monitoring group (low corruption) than in the low-monitoring group (high corruption). Fourth, counter-punishment of the leader decreases cooperation relative to the scenario in which punishment is exercised solely by the leader. Cooperation in the group with counter-punishment is higher for the low-corruption group than for the high-corruption group. These results demonstrate that the same public policy applied in different contexts (low and high corruption) has differentiated results. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature on corruption and cooperation; at the end of the section we discuss the contribution of this paper in light of those studies. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the experiment and its implementation. In Sect. 5, we discuss the four main results of the paper, and in Sect. 6 we offer some conclusions.",2

In fact, progressive financial innovation and deregulation have induced foreign exchange trading to exceed, by almost 20-fold, the volume of goods and services worldwide.Footnote 1 According to Jongen et al. (2008), “It therefore seems that the foreign exchange market is a market ‘on its own’ and that this market, because of its large volume, is highly liquid and efficient.”Footnote 2 As such, there has been a longstanding debate in the international finance literature on the main factors driving these capital flows. Nonetheless, most of the works agree that expectations play a central role in the determination of the exchange rate and for some authors, little else matters (see Woodford and Walsh (2005)). Exchange rate expectations are generally assumed to be unbiased, homogeneous, and stabilizing. In many occasions, expectations are also assumed to be risk neutral, which overlooks potential effects brought forth by a time-varying risk premium. Namely, models that incorporate no-arbitrage conditions (such as the uncovered interest rate parity) assume that different currency-denominated assets are perfect substitutes.Footnote 3 Consequently, the validity of results largely depends on the accuracy of these assumptions. Paradoxically, the empirical literature has shown again and again that these assumptions do not hold. In fact, there is a long history of evidence pioneered by Frankel (1979), Dominguez (1986), and Frankel and Froot (1987) and by more recent works of De Grauwe and Grimaldi (2006) and De Grauwe and Markiewicz (2013) that show a systematic bias in exchange rate expectations. In addition, Ito (1990) and Allen and Taylor (1990) find empirical evidence of strong heterogeneity in expectations among market participants.Footnote 4
 There are also numerous studies such as Lewis (1995), Bekaert (1996), Mark and Wu (1998), Carlson (1998), and Meredith and Ma (2002) that find statistical evidence of a currency risk premium. Authors such as Nurkse (1944), Takagi (1991), and Frankel and Rose (1994) consider expectations to be highly volatile and unstable, and state that the influence of psychological factors may at times be overwhelming. They claim that the destabilizing pattern of expectations (commonly known as “bandwagon expectations”) produce extremely volatile exchange rates which negatively affect investment and international trade, increase protectionist pressures, and hinder the development of the financial sector. Notwithstanding, central banks still maintain a high degree of credibility on exchange rate surveys and often use them as input for their own internal forecasts.Footnote 5 They generally argue that the use of ex-post exchange rates as a proxy for expectations has the disadvantage of assuming rational expectations instead of testing them, that is, studies that employ observed ex-post exchange rates cannot fully determine whether the evidence of a risk premium is in fact attributed to a time-varying risk or to the failure of rational expectations. In this paper, we use a novel (and proprietary) survey conducted monthly by the Central Bank of Colombia during October 2003–August 2012 to test for the rational expectations hypothesis, the presence of a time-varying risk premium, and the accuracy of exchange rate forecasts. Our dataset (monthly frequency) is by far the largest official exchange rate survey in the country, containing a comprehensive outlook of the financial sector, with responses from nearly all pension funds, stockbrokers, and commercial banks, and while assumptions on exchange rate dynamics have been widely researched in the literature, to our knowledge there is no study applied to the Colombian case. Consequently, we shed light on the validity of several economic assumptions that relate to the nature of exchange rate behavior, using detailed and real-time data on traders, analysts, and market makers. Our main findings indicate that episodes of exchange rate appreciation preceded expectations of further appreciation in the short run, but were marked by depreciations in the long run. In the related literature, this pattern has been referred to as an expectational twist and partially explains the stabilizing nature of expectations. For example, as explained in Jongen et al. (2008), market participants might be reacting to momentum models in the short run (i.e., chartists), while making use of equilibrium models supported by macroeconomic fundamentals in the long run (i.e., fundamentalists). Additionally, we find that the forward discount differed from future exchange rate changes due to a significant time-varying risk premium, and that both the unbiasedness and orthogonality conditions are rejected for all horizons considered. In line with most of the existing literature, these results constitute ample evidence against the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Finally, we set forth five competing strategies to assess how well actual expectations performed, relative to a random walk process. We find that 1-month expectations outperform a random walk process as well as models of extrapolative, adaptive, and regressive expectations. But results are almost the opposite for 1-year forecasts, where expectations do not outperform a random walk. In this last case, traders and analysts answering the survey could have improved their forecasts by incorporating information from the forward discount, past exchange rate changes, policy meetings, or the policy rate. This paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 describes the data and investigates the incidence and potential attrition bias due to the number of non-responses within our unbalanced panel. Section 3 reviews the accuracy of forecasts and the relative importance of rational expectations within the purview of the forward premium puzzle. Section 4 presents different models of how expectations are formed and determines their stabilizing or destabilizing nature. This section also compares agents’ forecasting accuracy with that of a random walk. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",3
25,1,Latin American Economic Review,21 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-016-0032-3,Production risk and adoption of irrigation technology: evidence from small-scale farmers in Chile,December 2016,César Salazar,John Rand,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the green revolution, agriculture in developing countries has experienced a technological transformation process principally driven by an increasing demand for agricultural products. It has triggered a massive increase in the adoption of new technologies, such as the use of chemical inputs, pesticides, traditional irrigation, and high-yielding seed varieties, with significant benefits in terms of productivity and poverty reduction (Evenson and Gollin 2003). However, concerns have lately been raised on the grounds of sustainability, as the intensive use has consequences for environment and human health (Ruttan 2002). The adoption of traditional irrigation methods has shown to be beneficial to reduce farmers’ vulnerability to weather conditions, making production and incomes more stable. However, traditional irrigation has also increased the pressure on water reservoirs and created pollution problems.Footnote 1
 The aim of this paper is to study the effect of production risk on irrigation technology choices and discuss adoption of modern irrigation in settings where most rural households depend exclusively on rainfall for water supply. This is a particular feature in developing countries and zones characterized by abundance of precipitation.Footnote 2 We argue that the latter may give rise to potential sample selection problems in irrigation choices, which needs to be considered when analyzing the association between production risk and farm technology adoption. For modeling these irrigation choices, we as an example use agricultural census data of potato family farmers in Chile. Chile has the challenge to transform the Chilean agricultural sector into a world-wide agricultural production and food powerhouse (MINAGRI 2006). However, such a transformation process requires incorporating small holder family farmers into productive agricultural units not only serving themselves (home-production) but as integrated highly productive active agents contributing to the achievement of this objective. The Agricultural Development Institute (ADI) has continually provided technical support to the family agriculture in areas such as investment in human and productive capital, credit provision, access to markets, recuperation of eroded soil and irrigation. In spite of this effort and progress observed in the last decade, the technological gap between large and small-scale farmers persists. For example, 89 % of total land under modern irrigation systems is held by larger farmers (FAO 2009). This fact is what motivates this study to analyze the factors explaining the slow adoption process among small-scale farmers, where the main focus is on the importance of differences in production risk faced by small versus large farmers. The association between production risk and adoption of modern irrigation is quite straight forward. Risk-averse farmers may not adopt modern irrigation if it raises production risk by increasing yield variability too much. In contrast, if the new technology has the potential to attenuate variability in economic outcomes, then it would be more rapidly adopted among risk-averse small scale farmers. Even though literature on adoption of modern irrigation technology is well-documented, there is little evidence concerning production risk and irrigation choices. Two exceptions are Koundouri et al. (2006) and Torkamani and Shajari (2008). Both studies find support of a positive and significant effect of production risk on adoption decisions, arguing that new irrigation technology is a risk-decreasing input. However, both studies were carried out in settings where the knowledge of irrigation benefits is well-known and the new technology seems to show some degree of consolidation, which only allow to model changes from traditional to modern irrigation systems. In Chile the pre-conditions are different. Due to abundance of precipitation mainly in the southern territories in Chile, around 83 % of potato farmers do not use irrigation, which amounts to 66 % of registered farming land. Exploiting these differences in natural pre-conditions, we follow Foudi and Erdlenbruch (2012) applying a sample selection approach to study the risk-decreasing properties of irrigation under joint estimation of production and production risk. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have extended this approach to the decision of shifting from conventional farming to modern irrigation technologies. Moreover, in light of the high drought risk observed in Chile understanding the underlying mechanisms of irrigation adoption is of fundamental value. Historically droughts are frequent and affect 25 % of the continental territory. Furthermore, climate change studies estimate an intensification of aridity in the north zone, advances of the desert toward the south, and less precipitation in the central zone at the end of the 21st century (FAO 2010). Thus, the augment in temperature and decline in precipitation along with an increasing demand for water resources foresee a higher drought risk for the next decades. Therefore, improvements in water efficiency by the adoption of modern technology are likely to become essential to reduce the vulnerability of agriculture in the future. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the main arguments enhanced by literature as determinants of technology adoption. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and data used to carry out this study. Section 4 presents the main results, and Sect. 5 concludes the article.",26
25,1,Latin American Economic Review,02 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-016-0031-4,The economic integration of Spain: a change in the inflation pattern,December 2016,Alejandro C. García-Cintado,Diego Romero-Ávila,Carlos Usabiaga,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This article assesses the time evolution of a fundamental economic variable, the inflation rate, for the case of the Spanish economy. More specifically, it focuses on consumption prices from a geographically disaggregated (provincial) perspective over two well-differentiated periods of time (1955.1–1978.6, 1978.7–2014.4). It is worth noting that overall Spain is a country characterized by a mild inflation differential relative to the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) core—Caraballo and Usabiaga (2009c).Footnote 1 The analysis of the time series properties of province-level inflation rates in Spain and their convergence patterns is conducted with PANIC (panel analysis of non-stationarity in idiosyncratic and common components) as well as with the pairwise approach of Pesaran (2007a). From an econometric point of view, these provincial data allow us to build panels with higher N (50 provinces instead of 17 regions) and higher T, which is important for the application of the PANIC methodology.Footnote 2 The understanding of the behavior of provincially disaggregated inflation rate series enables us to better understand the evolution of aggregate inflation as well as to disentangle the importance of national forces from province-specific factors in explaining inflation rate variability and in identifying the sources of inflation heterogeneity. By focusing on a panel of province-level inflation rates within the same country, the identification of the province-specific idiosyncratic component and the nationally driven common component is also very important from a policy standpoint. Imagine, for instance, that the analysis gives evidence that a province like Santa Cruz de Tenerife has a strong and persistent idiosyncratic component and a weak common component. If that is the case, this would imply that policy measures implemented at regional level are required, rather than general policy measures implemented nationally or supra-nationally affecting all regions similarly.Footnote 3
 In the current scenario of EMU, it is natural to expect provincial inflation rates to be affected not only by external common shocks and national policies (e.g., fiscal policies and labor and goods market reforms), but also by such supranational policies as the common monetary policy. In that scenario, persistent inflation differentials across provinces can be conducive to different provincial interest rates, with clear implications on investment and aggregate demand. It is also appealing to focus on Spanish province-level inflation since in a currency union inflation differentials lead to realignments of the real exchange rate among provinces, which have strong implications for the relative competitiveness of the different provinces within the same country. The further disaggregation of province-level inflation rate series into the inflation rates of the 12 COICOP groups of goods and services also enables us to investigate the importance of the Balassa–Samuelson effect—and its different predictions on the behavior of the prices of goods in the tradable and non-tradable sectors—across the 50 provinces forming our sample.Footnote 4 According to this hypothesis, convergence among pairs of provincial inflation rates should be more prevalent in those groups involving tradable goods, since trade across provinces would help eliminate the arbitrage opportunities. In contrast, there would be less evidence of convergence among pairs of provincial inflation rates for those groups mainly composed of non-tradable goods and services. Whether regions with initially low price levels converge to higher price levels via tradables or non-tradables is also relevant for the degree of persistence of inflation differentials. If convergence operates through tradables, its implications are probably transitory, whereas if convergence works through non-tradables and the associated gradual process of productivity convergence, the implications are likely to be long-lived (Rogers 2007). Aside from the finding supporting a lower extent of pairwise convergence for the Communications group (involving mainly non-tradables), which would accord with the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis, the bulk of the evidence does not allow us to support the Balassa–Samuelson effect predicting important inflation differentials in non-tradables. The lessons that can be drawn from the results obtained for the Spanish provinces are also relevant for other open economies, such as several in Latin America, to the extent that they share with the Spanish economy some key features as the degree of openness, central bank behavior, fiscal policy stance, etc. The finding of widespread convergence among pairs of provincial inflation rates for both tradables and non-tradables implies that there may not be substantial regional heterogeneities in the relative productivity growth of the tradable versus the non-tradable sector. This is very relevant for many Latin American countries for which real exchange rate fluctuations affect economic activity due to their specialization in commodity exports and their high dependence on imported capital goods. To the extent that there is convergence in productivity levels, the price of non-tradable goods also converges, and fluctuations in the real exchange rate across sub-national units thus fall. This would also make it easier for countries to access world financial markets in order to finance their trade imbalances, which helps smoothing consumption. Taking now a national perspective for those Latin American countries that peg their currencies to the dollar, their high volatility in productivity growth due to their high dependence on production and exports of primary goods requires high variability in domestic Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation for the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis to hold.Footnote 5 Hence, situations of slow growth caused by recurrent adverse supply shocks impose equilibrium domestic inflation rates below the US inflation rate. This can be achieved through a revaluation of the exchange rate or through contractionary fiscal and monetary policies, which would further harm growth and employment. These undesirable results could be prevented by adopting a flexible exchange rate regime, at the expense of the negative effects of having higher variability in the nominal exchange rate. The use of PANIC conveys several advantages over standard methodologies employed to analyze convergence in inflation. First, it enables us to decompose the observed inflation rate series into a common and an idiosyncratic component as well as to determine the source of non-stationarity in the observed series, that is, whether it stems from the common factor(s) and/or the idiosyncratic components. Second, by allowing for common factors in the series, this technique controls for strong forms of cross-sectional dependence in the data such as cross-cointegration, which is essential to prevent severe size distortions in the tests—see O’Connell (1998), Maddala and Wu (1999) and Banerjee et al. (2005). Third, this approach is sufficiently flexible as to allow for a different order of integration in both components. Fourth, by encompassing both unit root and stationarity statistics that shift their respective null hypotheses, this framework enables us to gather confirmatory evidence on the stochastic properties of inflation. Fifth and most important, PANIC can be used as a cointegration framework without requiring the choice of a reference province in the computation of the inflation gaps, i.e., the series measuring the inflation differentials between two individual series. The system of the N series forming each panel can be decomposed into a non-stationary part explained by the common stochastic trends (\( \hat{r}_{1} \)) plus \( N - \hat{r}_{1} \) cointegrating vectors involving stationary linear combinations of the individual series forming the panel. This provides information about the extent of convergence among the inflation rate series. If the evidence favors a common stochastic trend together with the existence of jointly stationary idiosyncratic series, there would be pairwise cointegration (and convergence) among individual provincial inflation rates, which would be driven by a non-stationary common factor linking all inflation rates over time. For robustness purposes, we use an alternative test of pairwise convergence developed by Pesaran (2007a), which allows us to test whether all cross-provincial inflation differentials (pairs) are stationary with several unit root and stationarity tests. Like PANIC, this method does not require selecting a reference province in the computation of the inflation differentials between two individual series, and as such, it is not sensitive to this choice. As already laid out, in our work we intend to shed some light upon whether there has been a change in the pattern of behavior of Spanish inflation over the last decades. In our analysis, a structural break is considered. In order to determine it endogenously, we use the procedure proposed by Lee and Strazicich (2003, LS). For the crash model the mean shift is located at July 1978. Instead of dealing with the Spanish overall inflation rate directly, we address a major geographic disaggregation. Consequently, we make use of the 50 Spanish provinces’ inflation rates (excluding the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla due to the lack of consistent data), which will compel us to employ panel data techniques (PANIC methods, in our case), thereby allowing us to capture the econometric nature of the series under study through their decomposition. Likewise, in the second part of our article our focus will be more directed towards the topic of the spatial convergence of the variable involved and its potential underlying factors—taking some relevant economic and labor variables into account, in a first step, and CPI weightings, in a second one. By and large, our analysis will show, from different viewpoints, that there has indeed existed a pattern change in that a more intense spatial convergence in inflation rates has taken place in recent decades. It bears recalling that using disaggregated data at a provincial level is not commonplace in this type of work and it is indeed less usual than concentrating on regional data, thereby rendering our results more original in this regard. Overall, the PANIC analysis demonstrates not only the notable persistence of Spanish inflation, but also the higher importance of the common component of the series in the second period analyzed—which links provincial inflation rate series together—thereby leading to strong convergence. The evidence from the pairwise test of Pesaran (2007a) appears to largely back up these findings. Besides inflation, we focus on a battery of economic and labor variables, mostly by scrutinizing regional data, and conclude that they converge as well, mainly throughout our second period of analysis—with the exception of the real gross value added (GVA) per capita, which converges faster in the first period. The result of high inflation persistence in Spain should not be viewed as striking, since the three most usual indicators of inflation persistence (which could be denoted as explicit persistence, the inflation expectation component and inflation inertia—or implicit persistence—) seem to be quite deep-seated in the Spanish economy. Thus, in this regard, the Spanish economy has long been plagued with a myriad of different types of wage and price rigidities—which give rise to a low sensitivity to the business cycle—, widespread indexation and a significant importance of backward-looking expectations, among other factors.Footnote 6 Moreover, Spain is regarded as being a highly service-oriented economy, which means that labor costs account for an important fraction of total costs—the tertiary sector is known to be a labor-intensive one. This fact manifests itself as a greater persistence in final prices, with respect to other sectors whose inputs prices are proven to be more flexible. Another Spanish economy’s predicament, to some extent shared with other Southern European countries, lies in the barriers to competition in certain sectors and product markets. Notwithstanding several reforms and statements such as those associated with the strengthening of the Single Market, there is still considerable room for improvement in this area in Spain, as there is limited flexibility in some prices. Take for instance the issue of the Spanish energy prices. In essence, this dimension of our outcome (inflation persistence), which is brought into light by our PANIC analysis reinforces the previous results in this area. A final exercise consists of a multivariate regression analysis aimed at determining the factors responsible for Spanish inflation. In our view, given the characteristics of the Spanish economy, all the signs from the multivariate analysis are plausible, in terms of the Phillips curve, the non-wage price pressure, the disinflationary competition and sectoral specialization patterns—given the problems and rigidities of the goods and labor markets in Spain. Finally, the negative sign of the coefficient on real GVA per capita growth does not support the validity of the Balassa–Samuelson effect. The remainder of our article is structured as follows. Section 2 conducts a review to further contextualize our work in the related literature. Section 3 presents the PANIC approach. Section 4 makes a description of the inflation data employed and analyzes the choice of the break considered. Section 5 comments on the results obtained from the PANIC analysis and provides an alternative test of pairwise convergence. Section 6 carries out an analysis utilizing some additional variables other than inflation, also paying attention to CPI weightings and testing the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",3
26,1,Latin American Economic Review,17 November 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0053-6,Determinants of social spending in Latin America during and after the Washington consensus: a dynamic panel error-correction model analysis,December 2017,Fernando Martín-Mayoral,Juan Fernández Sastre,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The reduction of poverty and inequality as well as the promotion of human performance and capabilities has become of increasing interest in the economic development debate (Sen 1982). At the same time, improving education, health, sanitation and other social services has become a priority for the governments (Suescún 2007). In this context, two separate questions have attracted the interest of policymakers and researchers. The first is related to the effectiveness of social policies in terms of providing access to education among low-income groups, the creation of employment opportunities or the social protection of certain excluded population sectors (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 2012). The second deals with the analysis of the determinants of social expenditure levels and their growth, as they have a direct influence on human development. This paper belongs to the second group of studies, as it examines the factors that influence convergence in social spending across 17 Latin American countries for the period 1990–2012.Footnote 1
 A large number of studies have attributed the restructuring of the welfare state to the growth of globalisation. On one hand, there is the pessimistic view that welfare provision would converge to a new low-level social expenditure equilibrium, because of globalisation and increasing economic vulnerability, and capital outflows, irrespective of ideology (Strange 1996; Friedman 2000; Swank 2001). On the optimistic side, Boix (1998) stresses that globalisation allows leftist parties to expand their activities in human capital formation, expanding the welfare state more than right-wing parties do. Consequently, divergence in welfare effort is more likely to continue (Kitter and Obinger 2003). Pierson (2001) supports a third view, called “the politics of blame avoidance”, since efforts to scale down the welfare state involve high risks of electoral punishment. Therefore, he argues that partisan differences will disappear, and governments will attempt to renegotiate and restructure the welfare state under pressure from international competition. In the long run, however, welfare states may become more like each other, since all the nations are anxious to make their welfare systems more competitive, although the ways in which these adjustments are accomplished differ from country to country (Kitter and Obinger 2003, 22), depending on their institutional legacies. Kitter and Obinger (2003), following Flora (1986), describe a natural process of saturation and therefore convergence to the long-term equilibrium of an upper-limit welfare state. They accept the catch-up hypothesis across OECD countries, where the social effort path is dependent upon past spending levels. Behind this idea lies the assumption of an absolute beta convergence to a common upper level of social expenditure, thereby confirming the saturation effect.Footnote 2
 Püss et al. (2005) find the presence of statistically significant beta convergence for total and per capita social expenditure at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a share of GDP for EU countries over the period 1993–2000. Starke et al. (2008) find beta convergence in 21 OECD countries from 1980 to 2003, which reveals an upward trend over time. Even so, they observe a quite modest reduction of disparities between countries, i.e. a lack of sigma convergence. For Latin American countries, Lora (2009) gives an interpretation of the convergence coefficient stating that social expenditure has a certain inertia. We agree in part with the catch-up or beta convergence hypothesis to an upper-limit social expenditure equilibrium. However, the discrete reduction in dispersion across countries (see Table 5 in Appendix) indicates that perhaps Latin American countries are not converging to a common upper-bounded steady state in social effort. Instead, these results might be interpreted as evidence of conditional beta convergence, where each country is converging to its own steady state in social effort, which is consistent with the persistence of disparities across countries. In social expenditure growth, these are determined by economic, demographic and political differences across Latin American countries. In this regard, it is important to note that social spending as a state policy in Latin America during 1990–2012 can be divided into two clearly differentiated periods that could have affected the influence of its economic, demographic and political determinants. During the first period, covering the years 1990–2000, with the implementation of the Washington consensus, most Latin American governments carried out deep structural and institutional reforms that were mainly focused on budgetary discipline. These reforms encompassed policies in areas such as macroeconomic stabilization, economic opportunities with respect to both trade and investment, and the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy. During these years, the role of the state was weakened in Latin American countries and social spending was highly conditioned to fiscal discipline and debt repayment. Leaving aside the macroeconomic consequences of the Washington consensus, its logic was progressively abandoned after 2000 (Lora 2001) and the social agenda occupied a much more prominent place during these years. In general terms, the Washington post-consensus favoured the defence of the complementary (and not exclusive) relationship between the market and the state, the strengthening of institutional capacities, the implementation of reforms focused on social issues and the recovery of public activities as a development factor. Consequently, the role of the States in the provision of social services was strengthened, incorporating in their social policies concepts such as the protection of rights, full citizenship and social inclusion (Tomber 2016). Efforts to extend population coverage in social protection, with a better quality and a wider variety of social services were central to almost all countries in the region (Cecchini et al. 2014). To achieve these targets, fiscal revenue had to be increased to strengthen the social services that contributed to the expansion of opportunities for the poor (Kuczynski and Williamson 2003). In addition, the majority of Latin American and Caribbean states began to undertake counter-cyclical measures to stabilize employment, economic activity and social vulnerability. The 2008 financial crisis deepened this change of direction (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 2011). Roughly, we can state that during this period, governments paid less attention to structural fiscal factors and the evolution of social expenditure was more linked to conjunctural factors. Given that the role of the state was clearly different between these periods, it is likely that the economic, demographic and political factors that influence social spending growth also differed. The aim of this study is precisely to evaluate which determinants explained differences in social spending growth during the years of the Washington Consensus (1990–2000) and the period that followed (2001–2012). Additionally, we will analyse whether social spending in Latin America converged towards a common upper-bounded steady state or to specific steady states conditioned by their country-specific characteristics. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature on the determinants of social spending in developing and transition countries. Section 3 addresses the main methodological issues highlighted in the literature and presents the methodology used in this paper. Section 4 displays and discusses the results on the determinants of social spending and its categories. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 4.",8

The fragmentation process, referred as “trade in tasks” by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), has led to an increase in global integration, generating a web of economic interactions commonly denoted as international production networks. In the beginning, this change involved mostly trade among rich nations, but the real “revolution started when supply chain trade gained importance among high-tech and low-wage nations between 1985 and 1995” (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2015). Production fragmentation opened new possibilities of economic growth to developing countries, allowing their engagement in the production process of manufactured goods that they were not able to produce. The expansion of production networks changed the rules of the economic development game, facilitating developing countries’ access to networks, global markets, capital, knowledge, and technology (OECD 2013). Previously, a country had to climb every single step in the industrial development ladder, mastering all production processes, to manufacture a given good. However, the advent of production networks offered the possibility of skipping steps in the catch-up procedure through the acquisition of knowledge and technology from third countries and the specialization in one or few steps of the production process. Understanding these changes and their consequent implications is crucial to draw policies that integrate a country in this new production structure and allow it to explore the best possibilities for guaranteeing sustainable economic growth and development. The empirical literature about production fragmentation is very rich, with many studies focusing on the regions where production fragmentation is more developed: East Asia, the European Union, and North America.Footnote 1 Although the demand is growing for the analysis of the current situation and the effects that this new trend can have on Latin America, the literature is still incipient. A few papers provide some information about the status of production fragmentation in Latin America based on descriptive analysis. Aminian et al. (2009) compared the economic integration process in East Asia and Latin America, analyzing the characteristics and intensity of intra-bloc and inter-bloc trade. They used a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index to identify the share of traded manufacture parts and components with comparative advantage in the intra-bloc trade. Curran and Zignago (2013) studied the regionalization of trade in South America from 1994 to 2007, differentiating the trade flows by the end use of the products and the level of embodied technology. They concluded that the trade agreements have not extensively affected the regional trade level and that trade of intermediate products was still very low, indicating that regional production networks were still under-developed. Calfat et al. (2011) investigated the participation of Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in fragmented world production. They concluded that Brazil was the only country with a consolidated participation in fragmented production. Fung et al. (2015a) used manufacturing trade data, classified according to the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), to compare production sharing in Latin America, North America, and East Asia from 1985 to 2006. They identified the existence of a relatively thick production network involving the trade of parts of motor vehicles, telecommunication equipment, and electronic components. However, it was concentrated on Mexico’s trade with US and Canada, while Brazil also played a smaller role. Fung et al. (2015b) used the same data and methodology to compare Brazil, China, and Mexico’s participation in production networks. They analyzed the international trade patterns for the period 1990–2010, identifying that China’s global presence in the trade of parts and components increased. Although Mexico concentrated its trade of parts and components with the US, the data showed that China has become a major source of parts and components to Mexico and Brazil. The authors highlight the increasing importance of a Pan-Pacific link and a possible creation of a China–Brazil–Mexico production network. Florensa et al. (2015) produced the first paper that used a quantitative framework to analyze economic integration and production fragmentation in Latin America. Using trade data classified according to the Broad Economic Categories (BEC), the authors analyzed the impact that changes in import of intermediate goods from different world regions had in the development of Latin America’s regional trade. They found evidence of increasing regional production networks and the importance of other regions as suppliers of intermediate products, with special attention on China. Given the importance of this topic to the development literature and that production networks in Latin America are still understudied, this work contributes to the literature shedding light on the evolution of Latin American machinery industry. The first reason to focus on this industry is that machinery final products have a high level of complexity and use of a large number of parts and components, being the most developed manufacturing industry in terms of production fragmentation. Consequently, when the industry is more fragmented, a country will have more opportunities to engage in the production network. The second reason is that the high level of fragmentation and the availability of disaggregated trade data allow us to classify this industry into four different sectors. This division permits the development of a finer correspondence between parts and components and final products for a specific sector, reducing the bias that more aggregated data can generate. Finally, the share of machinery in Latin American exports and imports of manufactured products in 1996 was approximately 49.5 and 55.8%, respectively, while in 2011, the shares increased to 55.5 and 56.7%, respectively. Therefore, machinery is the most important industry in the region’s manufacturing trade.Footnote 2
 The contribution of this article is threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to analyze the quality effects that the changes in the structural composition of suppliers of parts and components have had in the development of regional machinery production networks in Latin America. Second, different from the previous papers on Latin American production networks that use aggregated intermediate manufacture data, we focus our analysis on a specific industry and use disaggregated data. Third, in this paper we adopt a model similar to Florensa et al. (2015), but estimate it using the PPML method instead of the ordinary least squares (OLS) to control the zero trade values and the data heteroscedasticity. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a descriptive analysis of Latin America’s participation in the machinery trade. In Sect. 3, we present the data and in Sect. 4 we describe the empirical methodology employed. Section 5 shows the results of the quantity analysis, while Sect. 6 contains the results for the quality analysis. The final considerations of the paper are available in Sect. 7.",2

Lichtenberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cancer mortality has declined in Mexico during the last 2 decades. As shown in Fig. 1, the age-standardized cancer mortality rateFootnote 1 of males declined by 13%, and that of females declined by 11%, between 1995 and 2014.Footnote 2 The mortality rate, or (unconditional) probability of death from cancer, depends to an important extent on two variables: the probability of getting (being diagnosed with) cancer, and the probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been diagnosed with cancer: prob(death) ≈ prob(diagnosis) * prob(death|diagnosis).Footnote 3 Therefore, the decline in the mortality rate could be due to either a decline in cancer incidenceFootnote 4, a decline in the probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been diagnosed with cancer (e.g., due to improved treatment), or both. (Source: WHO Cancer Mortality database, http://www-dep.iarc.fr/WHOdb/WHOdb.htm) Age-standardized cancer mortality rates, by sex, Mexico, 1995–2014 The Mexican cancer incidence rate declined by 13% (from 147.3 to 128.4) between 2002 and 2008, although it increased 2% (from 128.4 to 131.5) between 2008 and 2012.Footnote 5 Since the cancer incidence rate declined at least as rapidly as the cancer mortality rate in recent years, the decline in cancer mortality could be entirely due to declining cancer incidence. However, the measurement of cancer incidence is subject to significant potential errors. For example, a decline in cancer surveillance or screening could lead to a decline in measured cancer incidence, even when true incidence is not declining. The previous studies (Lichtenberg 2014a, 2015, 2016a, b) have shown that pharmaceutical innovation—the introduction and use of new cancer drugs—has significantly reduced cancer mortality in countries at a “very high” level of human development (as defined by the United Nations Development ProgrammeFootnote 6). In this study, I will assess the impact that pharmaceutical innovation and cancer incidence had on cancer mortality in Mexico, a country at a lower (but still “high”) level of human development. As in the previous studies, a difference-in-difference research design will be used: I will investigate whether the decline in mortality was greater for cancer sites (breast, lung, colon, etc.) subject to more pharmaceutical innovation and greater declines in incidence. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of decline in the mortality rate varied considerably across cancer sites. The mortality rate declined by at least 34% for 3 cancer sites (cervix, stomach, and lung), but increased for 3 other cancer sites (colon, ovary, and breast). (Source: OECD Health Statistics 2016 database) % change in age-adjusted mortality rate, by cancer site, 2000–2013 In Sect. 2, I will formulate an econometric model of cancer mortality. The data sources used to estimate these models are described in Sect. 3. Empirical results are presented in Sect. 4. Rough estimates of the number of life-years gained in 2013 from the reduction in cancer mortality attributable to pharmaceutical innovation, and of the average cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained) of new cancer drugs, are developed in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 provides a summary and conclusions.",3

26,1,Latin American Economic Review,22 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0043-8,A theory of sequential group reciprocity,December 2017,Alejandro T. Moreno-Okuno,Alejandro Mosiño,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Usually, individuals want to pay kind acts with kindness and bad acts with unkindness. This is known as fairness or reciprocity. Most models in economics tend to ignore fairness or any other emotion despite its profound impact on economic activity. For example, Rabin (1993) showed that consumers may not consume a product (even if it is in their interest to do it) if they think its price is unfair.Footnote 1 Akerlof (1982) argues that workers repay high wages by giving a high effort in their jobs. In the negative side, Krueger and Mas (2004) argue that after the management of Firestone demanded concessions from the workers and hired replacement workers during a strike, the workers responded by sabotaging the products which resulted in 271 fatalities. In his seminal paper, Rabin (1993) introduced fairness to game theory by modeling how if one player believes that her opponent is sacrificing her own material payoffs to help her, then she may be willing to sacrifice her own material payoffs as well to help her opponent in return; and if one player believes that her opponent is treating her badly, she may sacrifice her own material payoff to treat her opponent badly. As an example, Rabin shows how in the Prisoners’ Dilemma this allows for a “fairness equilibrium” (FE from now on) in which both players play “cooperate” . Rabin’s model is defined for two players in static games. Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) extended Rabin’s model to dynamic games for more players with their solution concept of “sequential reciprocity equilibrium” (SRE from now on). However, these models assume that players do not care about the outcomes of games in which they are not involved. In the real world individuals form emotions of fairness based on the treatment of others and these emotions can affect the outcome of their own games. For example, a mother may be nicer to someone who is nice to her daughter. And in countless interethnic conflicts, individuals from each of the groups involved have targeted innocent members of the other group to avenge previous offenses. Less tragically, individuals sometimes buy products at a higher price or of subpar quality solely because those products come from firms owned by their fellow countrymen or by members of their own ethnic group. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between the outcome of seemingly independent games (those games in which the players of one game are different to the players of the others), stemming from the emotions of fairness and reciprocity. For this, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004)’s model of reciprocity, in which individuals want to reciprocate the kindness or unkindness of other individuals, to a more comprehensive model that incorporates a sense of fairness that depends on the payoffs of other members of our own groups. Other economists have developed other models of reciprocity. Falk and Fischbacher (2006), Levine (1998), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000) are some examples. However, we focus in Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger’s model, given that we believe their approach of reciprocity based on intentions is essential to represent the idea of group reciprocity. The contribution of this article is to extend the concept of reciprocity with the following three stylized facts: Individuals want to increase the material payoffs of those individuals who belong to the same groups as them and are willing to sacrifice their own material payoffs in order to do it. Individuals treat more kindly those individuals who have been kind to other individuals who are close to them and individuals treat more unkindly those individuals who have been kind to other individuals who are close to them. The acts of kindness or unkindness of some members of a group can create sympathy or resentment towards all the members of their group and a desire for reciprocity towards each of these, even those who played no part in the original acts. We develop a game theoretic framework that incorporates these facts. In Sect. 2, we present evidence that support the stylized facts of our model. We review both empirical and experimental evidence. In Sect. 3, we introduce our model by extending Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004)’s model of sequential reciprocity to groups of individuals. We define a utility function that represents all three stylized facts mentioned above and define a new solution concept which we call “sequential group reciprocity equilibria”. In Sect. 3.1, we probe the existence of our solution concept in Theorem 1. Although the proof is in ""Appendix"", we give a brief explanation of the proof. In Sect. 3.1.1 we mention the differences between our model and the FE and SRE. In Sect. 3.2, we develop an example to show the relation that the outcome of one game has over the outcome of other games, due to emotions of group reciprocity. To show the interaction between groups of individuals, we work with the easiest case: two games of two players and two groups with two members. One of the members of each group play in each game. We get the following basic results: First, as the material payoffs of one game grow arbitrarily large, the outcome of that game dominates the emotions of reciprocity of the players who play in the other game. In the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily large payoffs is positive and both players are kind, the emotions of the players in the other game are going to be positive and they will be kind also in their own game. In the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily large payoffs is negative and both players are unkind, the emotions of the players in the other game are going to be negative and they will be unkind also in their own game. Second, in the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, when the material payoffs of one game become arbitrarily small, the sign of outcome of that game is the same as the sign of the outcome of the other game players in the game in which payoffs are small are kind only if players in the other game are kind and unkind if players in the other game are unkind. These two results are based on the same idea. If the stakes in one game are much higher in one game in relation to the other, the outcome of that game is going to dominate the emotions of the players also in other games. Third, if the material payoffs of both games are sufficiently asymmetric (i.e., individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to themselves), the outcome in which the sum of the material payoffs is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it concludes that in the outcome where the sum of the material payoffs is being maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own material payoffs by doing it). The reason is that in this case, the emotional payoffs is positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase their material payoffs by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional payoffs instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very nice). Fourth, in the case where one game is played first and then the other, and the material payoffs of the games are asymmetric enough, we find that the sequential group reciprocity equilibrium is that in which the outcome in which the sum of the material payoffs of the players is maximized. The reason for this is that the player in the first period than can be very kind or unkind, wants to be nice to her opposite in order for her own partner to be treated nicely in the second period. Finally, in Sect. 4, we conclude and discuss possible extensions.",3

Wallace,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Absolute purchasing power parity (PPP) between two countries holds if the cost of a market basket of tradable goods and services is the same in both countries in terms of a common currency. If there are no barriers to trade or transactions costs, any differences in the cost of the market basket are eliminated through arbitrage. Interestingly, Cassel (1918) advanced the PPP hypothesis as the norm under the aforementioned assumptions then sought to explain the apparent deviation from PPP in Sweden and its trading partners as arising from trade barriers. Empirical testing of PPP presents some difficulties, but surmountable ones. First, there are no data on the costs of a market basket of tradable goods and services. Instead researchers use price indexes, but indexes contain data on non-traded goods and services that are irrelevant in testing for PPP. Second, price indexes and nominal exchange rates are constructed by the averaging of observations drawn at different times and/or different locations. Such averaging can introduce bias into unit root tests for PPP (Taylor 2001). Third, evidence of mean reversion of the real exchange rate is regarded as evidence of purchasing power parity, but there is no guarantee that the mean to which a real exchange rate measure constructed using price indexes reverts is the PPP level. Of course there is no theoretical basis for mean reversion to a real rate different from the one associated with PPP either. Purchasing power parity in the real exchange rate between Mexico and the United States is examined in this study. Focus on this bilateral relation is justified because most of Mexico’s international trade has historically been with the US. This paper extends previous work on PPP for the Mexico–US relationship in two important ways. First, it makes use of the long-span, high-frequency data set developed by Ventosa-Santàularia et al. (2015), henceforth VGW, and updated to 2014. Wallace et al. (2011) used the 1930–1960 portion of this data set to test for PPP and Gómez-Zaldivar et al. (2013) studied PPP in Mexico with the data for 1969–2010, but this paper is the first after VGW to utilize the complete data set. Second, the study employs a recent approach to cointegration testing developed by Enders et al. (2008) to examine the PPP hypothesis. The Enders, Im, and Lee (henceforth EIL) methodology uses stationary instrumental variables for the integrated series of the empirical model to overcome the difficulties of inference posed by non-standard distributions of nonstationary variables. EIL show that the t statistics of the estimated model are asymptotically normal when nonstationary regressors are instrumented with stationary ones. Taylor (2001) shows that bias against the PPP hypothesis can arise in tests of stationarity of the real exchange rate due to temporal aggregation of high-frequency data in the construction of the lower frequency price indexes. He demonstrates that the bias reduces the power of unit root tests, but finds that bias diminishes with longer data spans. In light of Taylor’s work most studies of purchasing power parity have focused on industrial countries likely due to the availability of data over extended spans. The long-span data set used in this study, thus, mitigates the bias arising from temporal aggregation allowing tests of PPP for Mexico, a nation whose economic development has lagged that of the industrial countries. The long-span high-frequency data set put together by VGW and updated for this study is a composite from several different sources. Monthly, historical nominal exchange rate and price index data for Mexico, 1930–1960, are obtained from Cárdenas (1994) who cites the Bank of Mexico as a source, although the central bank does not provide these historical figures through its statistical website. Post-1960 data are from annual reports of the Bank of Mexico, commonly referred to as Banxico, as well as the Banxico website.",1

Mota,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The global slowdown and recent price developments renewed the interest in evaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy. It is widely acknowledged that an effective monetary policy relies on a well-functioning transmission mechanism. If changes in monetary policy rates are quickly and fully transmitted to retail rates, the latter have a faster impact on domestic demand and therefore inflation (Mishkin 1995; Becker et al. 2012). Conversely, if retail rates are sticky, the monetary policy goals take longer and are harder to achieve. As the Dominican Republic recently adopted an inflation targeting regime, it is even more relevant to ensure that changes in the monetary policy rates are quickly and fully reflected in retail rates to eventually affect inflation. The theoretical literature advanced several possible explanations as to why the interest rate pass-through may be slow, incomplete, more than complete, or asymmetric. These include asymmetric information, menu costs, switching costs, risk sharing, ownership of the financial system, economic conditions, and bank concentration. While the empirical literature for advanced and emerging economies is vast, the evidence for the Dominican Republic remains limited. In this paper, we estimate the interest rate pass-through for retail rates in the Dominican Republic. The contribution to the existing literature is twofold. First, we provide a wide spectrum of results for retail rates at different maturities and for a recent period, with some analysis of the fiscal costs (i.e., public sector borrowing costs) associated with monetary policy. Second, we test for asymmetries in the adjustment to equilibrium and simulate the symmetric and asymmetric adjustment of retail rates to changes in the monetary policy rate. We find evidence of complete pass-through to retail rates, confirming the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Similarly, our results indicate that government domestic bond yields increase when monetary policy becomes more contractionary. However, we also find evidence of a faster pass-through to lending rates than to deposit rates. Moreover, short-term deposit rates respond faster to policy rate cuts with respect to hikes, while short-term lending rates respond faster to policy rate hikes with respect to cuts. The theoretical literature associates asymmetries in the speed of adjustment to collusive market behaviors. Thus, measures to boost competition in the financial system could help to achieve a symmetric adjustment of retail rates. The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the theoretical contributions explaining rigidities and asymmetries in the interest rate pass-through, comments on the institutional features of the financial system of the Dominican Republic, and discusses the empirical evidence for the country. Section III presents the empirical strategy. Section IV discusses the results. Section V concludes.",6
26,1,Latin American Economic Review,13 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0040-y,The rise and fall of income inequality in Chile,December 2017,Francisco Parro,Loreto Reyes,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper presents evidence on the evolution of income inequality in Chile during the past two decades. We observe that income inequality rises from 1990 to 2000 and then falls from 2000 to 2011. The only exception is from 2006 to 2009, when income inequality increases. To empirically disentangle the main forces behind the dissimilarity in the behavior of income inequality across the pre- and post-2000 periods, we carry out a series of simple but informative decompositions to separate the contributions of the different components of income inequality. The measure of income inequality analyzed in this paper is the 80/20 ratio of per capita income. While several other measures of inequality are used in the literature (for instance, the Gini coefficient), the 80/20 ratio allows us to build our decompositions in an easy and clearly interpretable way.Footnote 1
 We first show that labor income inequality accounts for most of the changes in inequality observed during the whole period. Non-labor income inequality plays a minor role. Then, we decompose labor income inequality into its three main components: employment, hours worked conditional on being employed, and hourly wages. We show that the employment gap between the richest and poorest quintiles is particularly relevant for explaining the rise in income inequality from 2006 to 2009. Without changes in the employment gap, the trend of labor income inequality would resemble a perfectly inverted U-shaped curve. That is, we would observe a continuous rise of labor income inequality before 2000, followed by a continuous fall after 2000. Moreover, we show that the inverted U-shaped movement of labor income inequality among employed agents is almost entirely accounted for by a rise and fall in hourly wage inequality during the pre- and post-2000 periods, respectively. Inequality in hours worked has no relevant role. Changes in hourly wage inequality could be explained by differences in observable characteristics, such as experience and education; different prices for different skills in the labor market; and unobservables, that is, differences in prices and skills within groups. To disentangle the relative importance of those components of hourly wage inequality, we perform a decomposition in the spirit of Juhn et al. (1993). We show that both observable prices and quantities are important forces behind the rise and fall of hourly wage inequality. We discuss the forces moving the supply of and demand for different skills in the labor market. The evidence and discussion presented in this paper are consistent with a story in which several forces inherent to economic growth increase the demand for more educated workers and, therefore, the returns to education and inequality in earnings. As the supply of educated workers—especially those from more vulnerable groups—begins to respond, the rise in income inequality is moderated or even reversed. Our results point to education policies as the most effective way of reducing income inequality levels in the long term. Most of the evidence on income inequality for Chile is concentrated on the pre-2000 period, when income inequality slightly increased. The exceptions are some regional studies that mainly provide evidence on the contribution of price and quantity effects to the changes in the distribution of hourly wages (for instance, Azevedo et al. 2013a). Among the articles looking at inequality in Chile, only a fraction of them center the discussion on the forces that could explain the evolution of income inequality (Cowan and Gregorio 1996; Bravo and Marinovic 1997; Solimano and Torche 2007; Eberhard and Engel 2008). Other articles point to different issues that are related to inequality but not directly to its determinants. For instance, Contreras et al. (2004), Denis et al. (2007), and Sapelli (2013) study inter- and intragenerational mobility, Engel et al. (1999) and Bravo et al. (2001) quantify the redistributive effects of tax and social policies, Ruiz-Tagle (2007) forecasts future trends in income inequality, and Contreras and Ruiz-Tagle (1997) present evidence on inequality at the regional level in Chile. Moreover, those studies analyzing the determinants of income inequality in Chile mainly focus on the reasons why income inequality was high and relatively stable during the pre-2000 period in the context of the rapid growth of the Chilean economy. Our paper provides a more complete picture of the forces driving both the rise and fall of income inequality in Chile, through the use of simple decompositions based on the 80/20 ratio. As far as we know, no other study on Chile provides the type of analysis that we perform in this paper. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes and discusses the available evidence on income inequality in Chile as well as other countries of the region. Section 3 documents trends in income inequality over the past two decades and analyzes the importance of labor markets for understanding its evolution over time. Section 4 dissects labor income inequality into its three main components: wages, hours worked, and employment gaps. Section 5 decomposes changes in hourly wage inequality into observable quantities, prices, and unobservables, and discusses the main forces behind the documented evolution of the returns to higher education. Section 6 concludes.",4
26,1,Latin American Economic Review,09 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0039-4,Defence expenditure and economic growth in Latin American countries: evidence from linear and nonlinear causality tests,December 2017,Christos Kollias,Suzanna-Maria Paleologou,Nickolaos Tzeremes,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The empirical assessment of the economic effects of military spending is a contentious theme that has attracted considerable attention and debate without, however, the emergence of a robust and unequivocal consensus (inter alia: Alptekin and Levine 2012; Dunne and Tian 2013; Dunne and Smith 2010; Heo and Ye 2016). Essentially, the effects of such government outlays can be summarized into three broad categories: the opportunity cost of the resources allocated to national defence, encapsulated by the guns vs butter dilemma; demand stimulation; and supply side effects (inter alia: Drèze 2006; Dunne and Tian 2016; Dunne and Uye 2010; Hou and Chen 2013; Desli et al. 2016). The growth enhancing effects include increased employment of idle or underemployed resources, positive externalities, such as technological advances, that spillover to other sectors of the economy thus increasing productivity, infrastructure creation, and human capital formation. On the other hand, such spending can prove to be growth retarding through the crowding-out of other more productive forms of public spending as well as investment. Both cross-country and specific country case studies have empirically probed into this question with mixed findings, as noted above, although the scales do seem to tilt in favor of a negative net impact on growth (inter alia: Compton and Paterson 2016; Malizard 2015, 2016; Dunne and Tian 2015, 2016; Kollias and Paleologou 2016). The issue of the economic impact of military spending has also been addressed for Latin American countries. Ramos (2004) finds a positive effect on growth in the case of Mexico. For Guatemala, Reitschuler and Loening (2005) report findings that point to a positive and significant externality effect of defence spending at low levels of such expenditure but not so for higher levels. Using a sample of Asian and Latin American countries, Murdoch et al. (1997) find that defence is growth promoting but generates an opportunity cost in the form of displacing other public expenditures that also boost growth. Stroup and Heckelman (2001) for a group of African and Latin American countries establish a nonlinear relationship between defence and growth, with the findings indicating that low levels of such expenditure increase economic growth, whereas high levels decrease it. Scheetz (1991), in the case of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru, reports a negative effect on macroeconomic variables, such as growth, investment, and the current account balance. Klein (2004) also reports a negative net effect in the case of Peru over the period 1970–1996. Hoping to contribute to the existing body of literature for Latin America by extending both the time period as well as the sample of countries, this paper (re)addresses the issue of the economic effects of defence expenditure using SIPRI’sFootnote 1 new database (Perlo-Freeman and Sköns 2016; Smith 2016). SIPRI has recently extended its military expenditure data set that until now provided consistent data only from 1988 onwards. The new data setFootnote 2 has consistent defence spending estimates across countries that in a number of cases date back to 1949. Hence, it presents researchers with the opportunity to readdress the perennial question of the economic effects of military expenditure, since it allows to empirically probe into this issue for an appreciably longer time period compared to the previous studies. In the case of the Latin American countries, this implies the addition of more than 20 years in the sample period. There are obvious advantages associated with the availability of consistent and reliable time series with observations that cover longer periods. They offer the opportunity for researchers to reach more robust and reliable inferences over a longer time horizon that, in this case, spans both the bipolar and post-bipolar periods. Hence, better insights may be gained when it comes to the empirical appraisal of the economic effects of military spending. This paper, using both linear and nonlinear causality tests, examines the economic effects of defence spending in the case of the 13 Latin American countries. The tests cover the period 1961–2014. The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section contains a descriptive comparative presentation of the data used, while Section 3 epigrammatically addresses the role of the military in Latin America from a comparative perspective in terms of defence burdens and economic performance. In Section 4, the methodology employed is briefly outlined and the findings are presented and discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.",16
26,1,Latin American Economic Review,30 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-016-0038-x,Changes in rural poverty in Perú 2004–2012,December 2017,Samuel Morley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The period since year 2000 has seen remarkable world-wide progress in poverty reduction. But most of this progress is urban. Much less progress has been attained in the rural sector where about 45% of the rural population is still poor. Reaching the MDG goal of halving rural poverty rates over the 1990–2015 period has not been met. Rapid growth has helped but most poverty reduction has been urban, not rural. Devising a strategy to reduce rural poverty is one of the most significant challenges facing development experts. Peru is both a good example of the problem and a guide to possible solutions. It has always had a rural poverty problem. Even during the decades when Peru grew rapidly, most of the progress was either in the urban sector or on the coast. Over the 8-year period 2004–2012, there was a boom in Peru. Per capita income increased by over 5.5% per year and total poverty was cut by almost 60%.Footnote 1 But over two thirds of that reduction was urban. Urban poverty fell from 48% of the urban population in 2004 to only 16% 8 years later. Rural poverty rates fell too, but not nearly as fast. That would not present too much of a problem if the rural poverty population was small. But it is not. It comprised 47% of all the poverty in the country in 2012, and was concentrated in the high Andes where most of the rural population lives. This has always presented Peru with a vexing political problem, increasing the level of inequality and exacerbating the ethnic divisions within the country. Thanks to the extended economic boom of the last 10 years, Peru is well on its way to reducing urban poverty to first world levels. Even though rural poverty has not fallen nearly as quickly and has shown itself to be relatively insensitive to government efforts at poverty reduction, still Peru is one of only ten countries in the entire world for which we have comparable data where rural poverty has fallen by at least 3% per year since the millennium (Inchauste et al. 2012). Thus, Peru is both a good example of the rural poverty problem, and a possible guide to a successful strategy for rural poverty reduction. No one should imagine that reducing rural poverty in Peru was going to be easy. The amount of arable land per capita in the Andes is small, the climate is dry and cold and most of the rural population lives at least 10,000 feet above sea level (Morley 2011). Yet Peru despite these structural handicaps managed to reduce the rural poverty rate from 85% in 2004 to 55% 8 years later. How did they do this? That is the central question we want to address in this paper.Footnote 2 What role was played by rapid growth, sectoral growth in agriculture, rural–urban migration, government transfers, and improvements in education? What lessons can we learn from the Peruvian experience that can be transferred to other countries with a significant rural poverty problem? We will attempt to answer these questions by means of an analysis of two recent living standards measurement surveys, one in 2004 adjusted by updated population weights and a second in 2012.Footnote 3 These are big comparable national surveys from which the statistics on poverty in this paper are drawn. In section two of the paper we present an overview of the evidence from the surveys and disaggregate changes in family income over time. We calculate the fraction of the total change that was due to transfers, demographic factors and earned income. We show that far and away the largest factor for rural families was the growth in earned income. It came mainly from wages and mainly from employment growth in industrial or service sector activities, not from agriculture. In section three, we have found it informative to disaggregate the 2012 survey by what we will call equivalent cohorts by which we mean the age groups of 2004 as they appear 8 years later in 2012. Ideally we would like to be able to follow individuals over time using panel data. Unfortunately we do not have panel data. But the equivalent cohort treatment is what one could call a quasi-panel since it follows a given age cohort over time, using surveys that are both large and representative. Their use gives a significantly different picture of poverty reduction or rural–urban migration than the usual treatment. The equivalent cohort approach permits us to construct mobility matrices in section four of the paper. The first such matrix shows the movement of the 2004 population between the rural and urban areas and between the Sierra-Selva and the Coastal regions. It shows us how the rural population of the Sierra has been drawn to the urban sector, particularly within the Sierra itself. We also construct a second mobility matrix, this one by poverty, sector and cohort. This matrix quantifies the significant upward mobility of the 2004 rural and urban poverty population and gives a better understanding of the sources of rural poverty reduction by age and sector. It also quantifies an important distinction between poverty reduction and upward mobility as a measure of progress. Section five summarizes our findings and concludes with policy implications that can be drawn from the Peruvian case.",5

27,1,Latin American Economic Review,04 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-018-0058-9,"Growth, inequality and poverty dynamics in Mexico",December 2018,Alberto Javier Iniguez-Montiel,Takashi Kurosaki,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This study investigates the contribution of both growth and redistribution to poverty reduction in Mexico during the period from 1992 to 2014. Moreover, by controlling for the potential bias due to intertemporal changes in the official poverty lines and the spurious correlation bias that can occur if the same microdata are used to generate measures of growth, inequality, and poverty, this study intends to shed new light on the dynamic relationships that exist between growth, inequality and poverty in Mexico. This study thus helps validating important and hotly debated hypotheses in development economics. In the development economics literature, there is a general consensus that growth is good for the poor (Besley and Burgues 2004; Dollar and Kraay 2002) and that a reduction in inequality contributes to a decline in poverty (Bourguignon 2004; Dagdeviren et al. 2004; Lopez 2006; Ravallion 1997, 2005). However, some have shown that not all the benefits arising from growth trickle down to the poor (Datt and Ravallion 1992; Kakwani et al. 2000; Oxfam 2000). Furthermore, there is no guarantee that any improvement in the distribution of income raises the incomes of the poor (Iniguez-Montiel 2014). These issues have been hotly debated over the past decades (Jain 1990; Kakwani and Subbarao 1990; Kakwani et al. 2000; Kalwiji and Verschoor 2007; Lopez and Serven 2006; Ravallion 2001, 2007), particularly after the general agreement on the Millennium Development Goals (United Nations 2000), which embrace the ideology of a world free of poverty and hunger. Nevertheless, several important considerations have been either overlooked or downplayed, when analyzing the particular stories of individual countries. This study addresses two of these considerations. First, most studies consider the poverty line as being constant over time, and evaluate only the impact of real growth (growth at constant prices) on poverty, as this is the standard treatment in the intertemporal analysis of poverty (see, for example, Deaton 1997; Ravallion 1992). However, it is possible that the official poverty lines correspond to different levels of purchasing power over time, partly due to measurement errors, heterogeneous increases in the prices of goods that compound the basic-needs basket for the poor, and/or changes in the social notions of absolute poverty over time. To address this possibility, a “triple” decomposition of poverty change has been proposed by Günther and Grimm (2007). We apply their methodology to the case of Mexico to provide a more precise overview of the relationship between poverty, inequality, and economic growth in this country. Although this methodology uses the distribution-neutral growth or zero-growth-Lorenz-curve changes as a benchmark for the simulation exercises, it offers a clear picture of the manner in which growth, redistribution, and inflation interact dynamically, affecting poverty and the entire distribution of income or consumption. Second, most of the existing studies on the relationship between growth, inequality and poverty use the three measures compiled from the microdata of household income and expenditure surveys of the same year. When a household expenditure survey dataset is available, we can aggregate the data to compile empirical variables for mean consumption/income, poverty, and inequality. Since the three variables in any given period are dependent by construction, regressing one on the others causes a potential bias due to spurious correlation. Such regression analyses could be valid as a mere description of the distribution of individual-level consumption/income. However, it is difficult to infer the structural relationship between growth, inequality, and poverty from these exercises since the changes in poverty, average income, and inequality in the same period are linked by data construction. To avoid this spurious correlation, a regional panel data analysis, using a system of equations that carefully incorporates a lagged structure, was proposed by Kurita and Kurosaki (2011). We apply their methodology to the case of Mexico using “state” within Mexico as the unit of observation. The two methodologies are applied to repeated cross sections of household-level expenditure/income data for Mexico from 1992 to 2014. In the first methodology, the microdata are used at the household level and the decomposition is conducted for the national level, distinguishing between rural and urban areas. The results provide strong evidence that the key factor contributing to the reduction of poverty in Mexico has been the consistent decline of inequality observed after 2000 (Cortés 2013), particularly in the rural sector, whereas the factor that has continuously acted in the opposite direction, putting a strong break to the reduction effort and holding poverty at almost the same level as that in 1992, was the increase in food prices facing the poor since 2008. In the second methodology, we aggregate the microdata into a unique panel dataset at the state level to estimate a system of equations, which characterizes the dynamic relationship between growth, inequality and poverty in Mexico, by the generalized method of moments (GMM). We show that the parametrically estimated response from the second methodology is useful for understanding the decomposition results from the first methodology, and also for testing the validity of the relevant hypotheses for the case of Mexico. The GMM regression results indicate that Mexican states are characterized by income convergence and inequality convergence, that lower levels of inequality spur growth in the economy, that increasing income/consumption levels contribute to reducing inequality, and that poverty reduction in Mexican states is highly determined by inequality levels in the previous period. Growth is also found to be poverty reducing; however, the growth elasticity of poverty is about half the size of the inequality elasticity of poverty. All our results are highly robust, deepening our understanding of the relationship between poverty, inequality, and economic growth in Mexico. There are some relevant works in the recent literature that are related to our study and that deserve our early attention. First, the important contribution of Ros (2015), who discusses in detail the causes of low economic growth and high levels of inequality in Mexico, arguing that the Mexican economy has been trapped in a low-growth-level equilibrium during the last three decades, a situation in which low growth interacts with its determinants to maintain the stability of the same pervasive equilibrium. Moreover, Ros (2015) highlights the particular relationship that exists between growth and inequality in Mexico, where high levels of inequality contribute to reducing growth and low growth levels cause a higher concentration of income. According to our GMM results, this is indeed the case, and the benefits of a more equal distribution of income could be sizable for both the poor and non-poor alike because poverty would decline and overall income/consumption would increase simultaneously, thus reducing the poverty level further, as implied by the sizes and signs of our estimated coefficients. Another important work is the one of Hernández-Laos and Benítez-Lino (2014), who analyze the impact of the economic cycle on food poverty in Mexico, determining how the performance of the labor market affected the level of poverty during 2005–2012 by also estimating a system of equations at the state level by the GMM approach. Their results actually complement ours by identifying two important labor-market mechanisms that affect food poverty along the economic cycle, namely overall unemployment and lagged informal-sector employment with estimated elasticities of 0.06 and 0.08, respectively. It is important to mention that we also draw from their analysis to be able to provide strong evidence of the reliability of our estimates due to the non-representativeness of the data at the state level. Indeed, our estimates are highly robust even when using the state-level representative data of the Mexican labor market as proposed in Hernández-Laos and Benítez-Lino (2014). Finally, the study in Millán (2014) proposes a new methodology to decompose poverty changes into its growth and inequality contributions, arguing that the Datt–Ravallion methodology suffers from several drawbacks. It should be mentioned that the main results and conclusions drawn in Millán (2014) are not supported by ours, using either the decomposition methodology of Günther and Grimm (2007) or the parametric methodology of Kurita and Kurosaki (2011). Particularly, Millán argues that there is always a trade-off between growth and redistribution so that each time there is an economic recession, growth increases poverty and inequality decreases it, while exactly the opposite effects occur each time the economy expands; therefore, inequality must be poverty augmenting during growth spells (Millán 2014). As shown consistently in our study as well as in Campos-Vázquez and Monroy (2016), such a systematic trade-off is not an economic regularity in Mexico. Everything depends on how the distribution of income changes during economic expansions or recessions as suggested in the literature (Ravallion 2001; Lopez 2006; Cortés 2010). Therefore, our study does support a cooperative interaction between growth and inequality for/against the reduction of poverty such as the ones that occurred in Mexico during 1992–2006, 2000–2008, or 2006–2008. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the datasets and macroeconomic background. Section 3 presents the empirical model and results using the triple decomposition applied to household-level data, and Sect. 4 discusses briefly the theories that support the system of equations to be estimated before presenting the empirical model and results using the state-level panel data. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",9

Ibarra,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to recent development studies, a depreciated real-exchange-rate (RER) level can increase the rate of economic growth, particularly so in developing countries and in the medium run. But although many studies have supported this proposition, others have questioned it: a depreciated RER may facilitate but not ensure faster growth; or appreciations may hurt growth while depreciations play a more neutral role; or both appreciations and depreciations relative to an equilibrium level may in fact decelerate growth. Mexico, with its history of wide RER fluctuations and protracted appreciation trends, has not been immune to these controversies. But while different studies have reached contradictory results, none has tried to establish why this is so. The possible role of asymmetries, in particular, has not been properly studied. While there may be some consensus around the negative growth effects of appreciations, for example, the possibility of positive effects from depreciations remains more controversial. The present paper contributes to the literature on RER and growth with a detailed study of the Mexican case. Applying a methodology specifically designed to test for asymmetries, the paper shows the RER effects on capital accumulation in Mexico to be qualitatively symmetric but quantitatively asymmetric; thus, while appreciations indeed are detrimental to capital accumulation—particularly in manufacturing and the tradables sector—depreciations are beneficial, but to a lesser degree. The effects, moreover, are dynamically asymmetric, with depreciations leading to expansions in the long run but contractions in the short run. The results point to a possible explanation of the contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies of Mexico. Because of the country’s rich RER experience and its puzzling growth facts, it is hoped that the results will also contribute to a better understanding of the international evidence. The analysis relies on the estimation of non-linear error-correction autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. Recently developed by Shin et al. (2014) as an extension of the bounds-testing approach of Pesaran et al. (2001), the non-linear ARDL model can be used to explore in a rigorous and flexible way the multiple asymmetries that may arise out of changes in the RER. Based on this model, the paper presents two sets of estimations. In the first one, the dependent variable is the capital accumulation rate (the growth rate of the real net capital stock) in the private, non-residential sector of the Mexican economy. Using annual series from Mexico’s KLEMS database for the period 1992–2015, the paper estimates separate equations for manufacturing, tradables as a whole, and non-tradables. The results shed light on the role of tradables in the transmission of the RER to economic growth, a frequently mentioned but not much studied channel in the literature. In the second set of estimations, the dependent variable is the aggregate level of private investment (gross fixed capital formation in the private sector). Because of data restrictions, this second set of estimations cannot distinguish between tradables and non-tradables. But the higher frequency of the investment series—with quarterly observations for the period 1988–2016—allows a detailed analysis of trajectories based on the dynamic multipliers of the non-linear ARDL model. The multipliers trace the path followed by investment after a permanent change in the RER, thus revealing possible asymmetries between the short and long run. The paper proceeds as follows. After a brief review of the literature in Sect.  2, Sect. 3 describes the data and methodology, Sect. 4 presents the results—first for the capital accumulation rate, then for the investment level—and Sect. 5 concludes. An Appendix details data sources and definitions and provides the unit-root test results—showing a combination of stationary and non-stationary variables—that motivate the choice of estimation methodology.",1
27,1,Latin American Economic Review,01 October 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-018-0060-2,On the role of financial aid in a default episode,December 2018,Gabriel Cuadra,Manuel Ramos-Francia,Santiago Garcia-Verdu,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the academic literature, there is some consensus on the negative effects of sovereign default episodes. For instance, De Paoli et al. (2011), and Yeyati and Panizza (2011) find that sovereign defaults have an adverse impact on economic growth. The literature has underscored several transmission channels as sovereign defaults affect economic activity. For example, Fuentes and Saravia (2010) find that foreign direct investment tends to fall after a default event. Moreover, other papers have documented that default episodes commonly lead to higher borrowing costs, and at times, to lose access to international financial markets. Borensztein et al. (2009) find that the cost of borrowing is significantly higher immediately after a default episode (relative to the cost prior to the default). Arteta et al. (2008) document that foreign credit to the private sector declines after a sovereign default episode. Cruces and Trebesch (2013), and Richmond et al. (2009) find that debt restructuring can have a significant and lasting impact on access to foreign financing. In short, sovereign defaults are costly. However, for a government, there are benefits related to defaulting on its outstanding debt obligations. The economic literature has highlighted such benefits, particularly so, in papers that model sovereign default events based on a willingness to pay approach (Eaton and Gersovitz (1981)). In this context, an important issue for the international financial community, particularly so for multilateral institutions, has been the implementation of financial aid programs aimed at changing the incentives to default that a given country could face. Such an implementation has as an objective to prevent a sovereign default event. More generally, some economies have had (implicit or explicit) multilateral support when they have found themselves in financial difficulties. Other economies have had to live with the uncertainty of whether they could obtain such a support. As an important instance of the latter situation, we have the Argentina in the early 2000s. In such a case, given the substantial debt burden and the slowdown of economic activity, a full-fledged default took place. Critically, we believe that the choice to default is largely the dire consequence of an economic cost–benefit analysis, which depends on the macroeconomic conditions and constraints faced by each country, particularly so, its debt level and economic growth prospects, among others. To gain a better understanding of the key features explaining the decision to opt for financial aid or for default by a sovereign, this paper puts forward a dynamic stochastic quantitative model of a small open economy with endogenous fiscal policy, financial aid, and sovereign default. This model illustrates the main trade-offs that a government faces when considering such a decision. Relatedly, we explore the extent to which financial support (official aid) by a multilateral institution to Argentina could have had prevented the referred default episode. Our paper builds on and contributes to the literature on quantitative models of sovereign debt. Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), and Arellano (2008) were the first papers to develop quantitative models of sovereign default. They based their models on the theoretical contributions of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981). The model put forward in this paper shares key features with that of Cuadra et al. (2010), who develop a model of sovereign debt and fiscal policy to explain the pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policy in emerging market economies, and that of Arellano (2008) and Lizarazo (2013), who propose a stochastic discount factor to account for risk-averse foreign lenders. Other studies in the literature have incorporated conditional financial support into sovereign default models. For example, Boz (2011) ponders a model in which the government has access to credit from the private sector and from international financial institutions, which in this paper we refer to as multilateral institution. Each type of creditor offers a different debt contract. He then goes on to analyze how the government allocates its borrowing needs between these two types of creditors, and when it is optimal to default on its debt to the private sector. On their part, Fink and Scholl (2016) propose a model in which the government has access to loans from a multilateral institution. However, this institution imposes fiscal conditions that restrict public expenditure. Since public expenditure and private consumption are substitutes, the government responds by reducing the tax rate. This, in turn, increases private consumption. That is, financial support leads to a private consumption rise.Footnote 1 In contrast, in our model, a multilateral institution provides financial aid directly and imposes fiscal conditions that restrict the amount that government can borrow. Hence, in our case, domestic absorption unambiguously falls, in line with the data. More generally, several contributions have used a mixture of theoretical and empirical methods to assess the extent to which a highly indebted country needs to adjust its fiscal policy to stabilize its debt to GDP ratio. Berrittella et al. (2015) use a DSGE model to estimate the tax rate necessary to stabilize public debt in several countries. They find that, on average, it is close to 50%. Furthermore, they find that tax adjustments are important to mitigate short-term risks arising from high debt, while growth is necessary to ensure long-term debt sustainability. Trachanas and Katrakilidis (2013) find evidence that governments tend to increase taxes after they take spending decisions. In other words, they find evidence on the “spend and tax” hypothesis rather than on the “tax and spend” one. In an interesting contribution, Tielens et al. (2014) use a vector autoregressive model to assess the impact that Eurobonds could have on debt dynamics in Portugal, Ireland, and Greece. They argue that Eurobonds can improve budgetary sustainability by absorbing macroeconomic shocks and by decreasing uncertainty over debt forecasts. In turn, the theoretical model of Cheng et al. (2017) shows that, absent the role of lender of last resort for the central bank in a monetary union, banking regulation and government deposit guarantees may not be able to prevent the occurrence of twin banking and sovereign crises. Finally, there are contributions that study the effectiveness of bailout programs in ending or, at least, attenuating government debt crises. Li et al. (2015), for instance, study the history of IMF’s bailouts. They question the effectiveness of the austerity packages linked to the bailouts. They assert that the design of the packages tends to overlook the recipient country’s characteristics, and for the most part, focuses on short-term solutions that are often damaging in the long-term. In our model, a multilateral institution can provide conditional financial aid by transferring resources to the domestic government, and imposing certain fiscal conditions. In particular, it restricts the amount of resources that the government can borrow from foreign lenders. In turn, the government has the option to accept or decline the aid. In other words, there are both benefits and costs to such a decision. The model captures them with the following features. A parameter accounts for the size of the transfer, modeled as the fraction of the country’s outstanding debt. The other is a restriction on the debt’s size that the country can take on the next period. We see this as a way of instilling some fiscal discipline. It is worth mentioning that when a government is close to defaulting, it would be trying to reduce its leverage. The referred restriction should increase the pace at which a government would try to do so. Of course, ex ante, the restriction does not necessarily need to hold. This reduces the default probability, and consequently, lowers its borrowing costs, partly because investors know that fiscal discipline is, quite commonly, part of a financial aid package. This underscores the relevance of aid by multilateral institutions. As a caveat, we assume that the government can commit to fiscal discipline in the implementation of financial aid. This presupposes that there is no lack of commitment principle in this specific case. Such an assumption is not as strong as it may initially appear. We think that this is the case since the implementation of the financial aid package and fiscal discipline take place in the same period. In contrast, the commitment issue in the general sovereign debt setup involves several periods. Accordingly, the latter case does not preclude the lack of commitment principle in the general sovereign debt setup. We calibrate our model to Argentine data. It is able to account for several business cycle’s empirical regularities, such as, the countercyclical nature of interest rate spreads and the highly pro-cyclical character of domestic absorption. We then feed the model with a sequence of output shocks that resemble the dynamics of economic activity in Argentina from 1993 to 2002. The model is able to replicate the default episode of 2002. Then, we use our model as a laboratory with which we assess whether a financial aid program would have been useful to prevent the default event. Our quantitative framework suggests that financial aid could have sufficiently reduced the incentives to default, for instance, as reflected in the lower interest rate premium. More generally, one should consider that the difficulties faced by Argentina are multifaceted, to say the least. They entail a plethora of historical, cultural, institutional, political, or even other economic aspects that we do not account for in the model. Of course, a single model attempting to account for all of them would quickly become intractable. Thus, our model inevitable abstracts from several aspects, which could have been present in sovereign debt crises and could be, nonetheless, pertinent. Yet, we believe that our model captures key elements and essential economic incentives that policy makers face during a crisis. In particular, it emphasizes that under certain conditions, which we consider quite sensible, the decision to default on their sovereign debt might be the optimal one. It, moreover, highlights the role of financial aid provided by a multilateral institution in preventing a full-fledged sovereign default episode. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The second section presents the sovereign debt model. The following section has the calibration and the numerical exercise. It also illustrates the quantitative implications of the model. The last section has some key concluding remarks.",

No better proof of this fact than the name of this collection which refers to Argentina’s exceptionalism, thus assuming that there is something unusual, “exceptional”, for good or bad, regarding Argentina’s economic performance. It is a well-known fact that at the turn of the XXth century, Argentina was among the richest countries in the worldFootnote 1 and that after WWII started a long period of economic decline.Footnote 2 While by the turn of the XXIst century, Argentina still was, in PPP terms, the richest among large Latin American countries, and it had lost significant ground relative to its peer group of a century ago. This long stagnation has become to some an apparently unavoidable fate, only to be interrupted occasionally by brief growth spurts that inevitably provided the stage for the following crisis (a process that has been dubbed “stop go” dynamics).Footnote 3 In fact, studies about the Argentine perception of the business cycle indicate that Argentines tend to become pessimists in the midst of each economic boom as if anticipating the unavoidable next crisis (see Gabrielli and Rouillet 2003). This stagnation and perennial process of going forward and backwards has permeated not only the economic sphere, but has also been relevant in politics, as Argentina witnessed a string of military interventions between 1930 and 1983. It is perhaps in this parallel dimension, where Argentines feel that real progress has been made since 1983, as nowadays, there is virtually no possibility of an interruption of the democratic political process. However, has this improvement in the political sphere been matched by a similar success in economic performance? Not in the collective imagination. Since the return of democracy, the country has experienced two hyperinflations, several defaults and restructurings of its debt, many large devaluations, periods of persistent high inflation, deflation, introduction of parallel currencies, and deep economic crises. This poor economic performance has implied a volatile evolution of its per capita GDP growth and a deteriorating income distribution, as shown in Fig. 1. It is the long period between the 70s and the first decade of the 21st century that has built the belief of a stagnant economy. Taking 1983, the year of the restoration of democracy, as a starting point, output per capita has grown only 1.5% when considering the period until 2009. However, the per capita income of 1983, with ups and downs, was left behind only in 2002–2003. The per capita income of 1980 was left behind only in 2005, i.e., 25 years later.

The purpose of this paper is to challenge this view. In fact, we want to challenge the view that economic performance during Argentina’s recent democracy has been dismal, both in terms of earnings growth as well as in terms of income distribution. Using the shift in the Engel curves to re-estimate the relevant price levels, we will argue that real earning growth has been steady and much bigger than measured and that income distribution has improved. If we are able to convince our readers of our results, our work would throw a completely new light on recent economic performance. Under this new light, the exceptionalism that has been the focus of the other papers in this special collection would appear to have been left behind already two decades ago. With commodity prices on a relatively strong footing, a region that appears to be increasingly in order, and large wealth increases from the development of mining, agricultural, and energy resources, the prospect for Argentina looks bright in the foreseeable future. The outline of this paper is extremely simple. The next section explains the methodology to correct the bias in the price levels typically used to estimate real income growth; section results shows the estimation results; and the last section provides some final thoughts. Our conclusions are that Argentina’s exceptionalism is a presumption that still needs to be proven and that Argentina’s economic performance during our recent democracy, both in terms of income distribution and earnings growth, has been substantially better than accepted in the economic debate.",2

Its starting point is the decade of 1930, when the country displayed a rather high level of inequality—above other advanced economies. This high inequality set the stage for the policies of Peron and others, which were justified—in part—as attempts to make Argentina a less unequal nation. We deal with the international conditions, the policies and the macroeconomic performance behind these inequality trends in Argentina over the 20th century. However, any explanation of the dynamics of inequality and growth in Argentina faces strong limitations in terms of (1) economic theory, (2) the multitude of simultaneous confounding factors and (3) the quality of the statistical evidence available. Moreover, these limitations are reinforced by the peculiarly complex history of the country. We have adopted here a historical perspective. The evolution of income and wealth inequality during the process of development has attracted enormous attention in the economics literature.Footnote 1 From a historical perspective, this focus was initially concerned with the functional distribution of income between factors of production. The classical view saw workers, capitalists and landlords as separate classes, receiving wages, profits and rent. Workers were assumed to be at the bottom of the hierarchy, and a fall in their share increased inequality. In logic, there was no necessary reason. Later, the analysis has turned to the concept of personal distribution. Nevertheless, as pointed out in Atkinson (1997) many of the links between income distribution and the functioning of the economy are still missing in the theory: we do not know much about the precise connections between inequality and the macroeconomic variables, and the inter-relationships between economic performance and distribution. Economic theory offers a series of valuable insights, but it is not able today to provide a comprehensive explanation of the observed dynamics of individuals’ income and the joint distribution of earned income and capital income, taking simultaneously into consideration supply and demand forces, social norms, public choice issues and government actions. This is certainly not an easy task. Atkinson et al. (2010) recognize that building a link between theory and empirical specification is not straightforward. The Kuznets inverse-U curve is one of the best examples: its popularity far exceeds its empirical support. As indicated by Piketty (2001), Piketty (2003) and Alvaredo and Piketty (2009), Kuznets stressed in his 1955 article the key role played by wars, inflation, recessions, and the rise of progressive taxation, though this is not the part of the explanation that most economists choose to remember. It was only at the end of his presidential address to the 1954 annual meeting of the American Economic Association that he suggested that an additional process (based on the well-known two-sector model) might also have played a role. As he himself put it quite directly, what was at the stake in the 1950s was nothing but “the future prospect of the underdeveloped countries within the orbit of the free world.” Thus, the optimistic theory of the inverse-U curve is the product of the cold war, as stressed by Piketty (2006). Increasingly, multi-sector models have dominated the literature on the analysis of income distribution and growth in Argentina—see for instance the discussion and the model proposed by Galiani and Somaini in this special collection. While not able to satisfy Atkinson, Piketty and Saez’s demanding criteria, these simplistic theoretical models try to highlight the salience of Argentina’s starting conditions in terms of its comparative advantages in land and agriculture, and the complex political economy implied by the development of a relatively well-educated workforce in this context. These particular conditions set out a complicated political economy environment whereby distributional conflict drives the alternation between outward and inward-oriented development strategies, with fundamental consequences for long run growth and for inequality itself, both as a determinant and a result of economic policy. The consequences of this process can be appreciated in the evolution of income and its distribution over time for Argentina. Figure 1 displays the share of the top 1% of the income distribution between 1932 and 2007 based on personal income tax records, and the share of the top 1 and 10% from households’ surveys between 1974 and 2009. The plot is eloquent of Argentina’s distributive performance, with subsequent periods of raising and declining inequality. Figure 2 in turn illustrates the relative stagnation of real income over the long run, which grew by less than two-thirds over the same period. The combination of both graphs indicates that the interaction between changes in aggregate income levels and in their distribution is a salient feature of Argentina in the 20th century. It should be clear, however, that it is misleading to talk of “trends” when describing the evolution of income inequality. Instead, and along with Atkinson (1997) we follow a much more compelling episodic history of inequality changes in Argentina. The country experienced strong shocks and policy changes that affected the income distribution in different ways. Since the logic behind the inequality changes is different in each episode, a long-term perspective would miss much of the action, and would probably be unhelpful for thinking about the future. Like any other modeling exercise, however, this episodic history tries to highlight the main aspects from a very complex stream of phenomena. Our description and conclusions are, therefore, based on our reading of the events. In some way, the historical narrative is part of the evidence. As (Atkinson et al. 2010) point out, “in combining disparate sets of information, the authors are not carrying out a mechanical operation, but exercising judgement about the strengths and weaknesses of different sources. These narratives are of course subjective, reflecting the standpoints of the authors, and there will no doubt be disagreement about the interpretation of history. But equally they cannot be dismissed.” Source: Alvaredo (2010), Gasparini and Cruces (2010); The World Top Incomes Database The top income share in Argentina from tax records (national) and household surveys (Greater Buenos Aires), 1932–2009.

Figure reports the average real income per adult (aged 20 and above), expressed in 2000 Pesos As described by Della Paolera and Taylor (2001) and many other researchers, Argentina was once a relatively rich country that has consistently diverged from the industrial economies in the last 50 years; today it is indistinguishably a middle-income emerging economy. The deterioration of the country’s relative position is often referred to as one of the puzzling cases in the economics of development. It was not a smooth process. The wealth-creating export-based growth model initiated in the second half of the 19th century had its own limitations: high dependency rates, the need on external funding, a large but finite land stock.Footnote 2 Nevertheless, the circumstances helped create an atmosphere of unlimited growth possibilities, which was mutually shared by the ruling class, the people and the immigrants. In contrast, the last 50 years are much more difficult to summarize. While Western countries (including Australia and New Zealand, but also Mexico and Brazil) experienced significant growth after the Second World War, Argentina stagnated and later declined. Political turmoil, institutional instability, macroeconomic volatility, income stagnation, high inflation and two hyperinflations dominated the scenario. Cycles of poor economic performance and continuous political upheavals were associated with the conflict of interests between the landed gentry and the industrialist elite, and with the integration and final acceptance of the working classes into the social and political system. Between 1956 and 2004 real per capita GDP, only grew at an annual rate of less than 1%; if we consider the figures in the aftermath of the 2001 macroeconomic crisis, the average income did not virtually grew in the 30 years following 1973. By the end of 2002, the unemployment rate was well above 20%; GDP sunk by 20% and poverty rates skyrocketed, but recovery resumed rapidly, and the economy grew at annual rates of 7–9% until 2007. The academic and non-academic statements about Argentina’s performance regarding income distribution, growth and institutions are usually (always?) tainted by ideological preconceptions. We will not offer here a definitive view, but expect to provide the reader with some facts to judge those statements critically, as they need to be qualified. Robinson (2010) sensibly argues that “it is not possible to talk about the market distribution of income as if that were somehow free of politics. It is the political system, after all, that determines the nature of property rights and how free the market is.” There is the view that high inequality in the first decades of the twentieth century led to redistributive policies that made the country far more equal but also hurt its economic performance; this view sometimes sees a negative correlation between inequality and growth or, more frequently, it implies that the specific peronist social policies were fundamentally flawed. There are several steps in the argument, and it is unlikely that they will be 1 day uncontroversially settled. It is important to note here that the structural decline of capital concentration that took place between 1914 and 1945 in the developed countries does not seem to have had a negative impact on growth; on the contrary, per capita growth rates were substantially higher in the postwar period (years of the expansion of the welfare state) than in the nineteenth century: high levels of concentration were not a prerequisite for growth. The remainder of this paper attempts to make sense of these trends in long run income and its distribution by means of an analytical narrative that draws on original empirical evidence and on existing studies of the economic and political factors behind these trends. Section 2 covers the 1932–1973 period and is based mainly on income tax information, while Sect. 3 covers the years 1974–2007 based on household survey data. While the availability of the latter allows for a more detailed analysis at the micro-level, the narratives rely on the same implicit models, which highlight the salience of trade and comparative advantages, the population’s level of education and the ensuing distributional conflict and its related redistributive policies. The discussions, thus, cover a series of issues such as trade policy, terms of trade, taxation, technical change, macroeconomic performance, labor regulations, the power of unions and structural reforms. It is not possible to account for all the complex interactions and phenomena underlying the long period of time in these few pages, and this must be seen as a shortcoming. In this sense, this paper is not addressed to experts in the field, but to a broader general audience. Firstly, we do not analyze in depth almost any of the phenomena mentioned. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, this review mentions only briefly the political and social forces underlying the trends described here. Hopefully, by concentrating on the evolution of income distribution over time, our analysis complements the efforts regarding these other topics presented in this special collection. Interested readers are also referred to the cited bibliography. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 focuses on the dynamics of top incomes in Argentina since 1932 based on personal income tax statistics. Section 3 discusses the evolution of income inequality over the last 30 years based on survey data. Section 4 is devoted to the conclusions.",7
27,1,Latin American Economic Review,02 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0046-5,Some elements of Peronist beliefs and tastes,December 2018,Rafael Di Tella,Juan Dubra,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a seminal study, Díaz Alejandro (1970) blamed Argentina’s relative decline to the replacement of the export-oriented, market friendly policies of the early 1900s by populist, interventionist policies around the time of the great depression. While other authors have claimed that lower growth rates had already begun before the change in policies, Taylor (1994) has demonstrated that any “early retardation” accelerates after 1929, and again after 1950, with the onset of ineffective government intervention. In this account Argentina’s relative decline during the 20th century can be attributed, broadly, to economically inefficient “populist” policies supplied by leaders who often exploit a mass of uneducated, poor voters. Peron and his followers play a prominent role in such narratives of Argentina’s exceptional underperformance. Of course, there are some variations in the basic account. For example, it is often claimed that policymaking, even during relatively centrist administrations, was complicated enormously by the presence of a populist party demanding government intervention. But in the end, in this account (the “Diaz-Alejandro hypothesis”, for short), the key problem is Argentina’s populist tradition, which has fueled bad policies and political instability. A troubling aspect of this account, however, is that it does not explain why voters find populist policies appealing. As stated, this narrative soon has to conclude that democracy is not a reasonable way to elect the country’s leaders, and it is of some relevance that many Argentine conservatives ended up supporting military coups. Paradoxically, this narrative implicitly questions the very benefits that can be expected from free markets. The reason is that it maintains that the rational judgment of market participants cannot really be trusted (in political settings). Indeed, humans in this account must have some type of dual type of rationality: on the one hand they are able to make a reasonable use of information so that markets for goods and services are in fact quite efficient, but on the other hand they are unable to see that the leaders they elect are bad for them. Rationality in Diaz-Alejandro’s account of democratic capitalism is a bit like the Cheshire cat of Alice in Wonderland: now you see it, now you don’t. We structure this paper around the basic Diaz-Alejandro hypothesis (i.e., the view that Argentina’s relative decline is caused by the government’s supply of bad policies), but complement it by providing a theory of the demand for such “bad” policies. The evidence we gather suggests two peculiarities of populist beliefs: they are often wrong (for example, they involve unrealistic expectations concerning the inflationary costs of printing money); and they often reveal a distrust of market outcomes (markets result, for example, in “unfair” prices and wages). An implication of such beliefs is that voters can demand policies that lead to a decline in output, even when this is fully anticipated (because these policies are expected to bring about more “fairness”). In brief, an alternative title for our paper is “The Diaz-Alejandro hypothesis with rational voters”. The school of thought associated with Diaz Alejandro has sometimes been interpreted as suggesting that markets are good for growth. Thus, a policy is deemed “bad” when it interferes with the market. A more reasonable position in our view classifies policies as “bad” only when they clearly lead to unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances. Beyond some extreme cases, it is often difficult to agree on what makes a policy clearly unsustainable. For example, it is simply not obvious that populism is necessarily associated with unsustainable declines in investment. Theoretically, it is possible that Peron’s redistributive policies put enough money in the hands of workers to spur consumption. This, in turn, might provide a promising enough internal market to compensate investors for any political instability that populism might generate. And empirically, the evidence on the effect of populism on total investment is mixed, as we shall see (although there is some evidence of a negative effect when the focus is only private investment). Perhaps a more attractive version of the Diaz-Alejandro hypothesis assigns Argentina’s relative decline to the bottlenecks in foreign trade (produced by excessive aversion to trade with other countries), the large fiscal imbalances (produced by an underestimation of the costs of inflation) and the instability that some of Peron’s redistributive policies induced. In some cases, the negative effect of these policies was unanticipated by voters. But in other cases, agents understood the material costs, but were seeking outcomes that appeared more “fair” to them.Footnote 1
 Economists have not made significant progress in understanding Latin American populism because they tend to find the interest group theory of policy quite compelling. In the standard account, bad policies are put in place by special interests and voters would get rid of them if only they cared to vote or were able to organize. Interestingly, however, voters do vote in large numbers (by and large, voting is compulsory in Latin America), so the empirical appeal of the interest group theory of policy formation, at least in its simplest form, appears low. A more promising approach accepts that populist policies are in fact appealing to (at least some group of) voters, perhaps because they do not fully understand their implications, as argued in Dornbusch and Edwards (1991). These authors point out several instances were policymakers in populist governments espouse views that would not be standard in economics.Footnote 2
 Our analysis begins with a brief section on the historical and political background of Peronist policies (Sect. 2). It then contains three substantive parts. In the first, (Sect. 3), we use qualitative data from Peron’s early speeches (1944–55) to provide some evidence on Peron’s beliefs (i.e., positive descriptions of how the world works) and preferences (i.e., normative values describing how the world should work). These speeches suggest to us three simple but important points. First, Peron’s policies were known to his voters (in contrast to later Peronist presidents, such as Carlos Menem in the 1990’s, who was elected on a platform but changed it upon being elected). Second, what Peron is doing in the speeches, at least in part, is providing “meaning” by interpreting the evidence available in the light of (what we would call) a coherent model of the world. Although such “interpretation” is unusual in economic models, it is often discussed by scholars who study beliefs (and in “discourse analysis”). The third and final element in his speeches that we emphasize is that Peron gives a prominent role to the forces that determine income. In contrast to what the literature on varieties of capitalism has emphasized in terms of the origins of income (distinguishing between effort versus luck), Perón emphasizes the role of others in determining (reducing) our income through exploitation. This emphasis results in a focus on actors (foreign countries and rich local elites, whose center of vital interests was Europe rather than Argentina).Footnote 3 And in a focus on distinguishing the components of welfare: there are utility losses from being “exploited”, which go beyond the material losses (losing one’s dignity). In the second substantive part (Sect. 4), we study Peronist beliefs after Perón’s death and place them in comparative perspective by looking at data from the World Values Survey in the 1990s. Respondents that declare an intention to vote for Peronism are also those that are on low income and have low educational attainment (relative to the middle class: these surveys do not sample those at the top of the income distribution). This is consistent with our analysis of Perón’s speeches of the 1944–55 period, which appear to be on the left side of the political spectrum, and with specific events of that period (the burning of the Jockey Club, the anti-American slogans, etc.).Footnote 4 Our results suggest that most Argentine voters are on the left of the political spectrum (relative to voters in the US), but that, surprisingly, within Argentina, Peronist beliefs tend to be more on the right of the political spectrum relative to those of the opposition. In relative terms, Peronist beliefs in the 1990s appear to be similar to Republican beliefs. In other words, the opposition to Perón seems to have come from the conservatives while the opposition to the Peronists in the 1990s seems to have come from the ideological left (although in both periods the opposition seems to have been on higher income than the Peronists). Put differently, what appears to be exceptional in Argentina is that the middle class is ideologically to the left of those at the bottom of the income distribution. In the final substantive section (Sect. 5) we develop a model to explain a low “demand for capitalism”. If voters maximize something else than just their material payoff, then even with correct beliefs about how the world works they may demand bad policies (from the narrow point of view of maximizing income). A voter concerned with the fairness of outcomes is a case in point. Specifically, we assume that voters demand that firms behave kindly (and this must be true in some scenarios). When they do not, voters experience anger. Such anger can be expected to fall when selfish firms are punished. In Argentina firms are more likely to misbehave than in rich countries (perhaps because of low competition or because of low productivity), so the State must intervene (“regulate to humanize Capital”). Section 6 concludes.",1

Why, then, did it remain closed to world trade for 60 years during the twentieth century? In this paper we contend, like many other authors have in the past (see, among others, Díaz-Alejandro 1970, 1984; Mallon and Sourrouille 1975; O’Donnell 1977; Waisman 1987; Rogowski 1989; Gerchunoff 1989; Taylor 1994; Gerchunoff and Llach 2004), that a severe distributional conflict lies at the core of this phenomenon. In Argentina, for a large part of the twentieth century, what was efficient was not popular. In the words of one insightful economic historian of the Argentine Republic: “… Argentina is too transparently a Stolper–Samuelson country where a zero-sum view of economic policy is plausible in the short and even the medium term” (Díaz-Alejandro 1984). The ideas behind the Stolper–Samuelson theorem explain the increasingly pronounced urban–rural political cleavage seen in the aftermath of the Second World War; however, they do not explain the process of integration into world markets. We show that these processes can be understood once we add a non-tradable sector and frictions in the mobility of capital across sectors. Under these conditions, free trade can benefit all factors of production. However, even if that is the case, protectionism may persist if political institutions are not able to enforce long-term agreements between political actors. Up to the 1930s, Argentina was well integrated into the world economy and, although some protectionism naturally arose in the wake of the worldwide crisis of the 1930s, it was only after the Second World War that the country closed its economy off from world markets and then remained in a situation close to autarky until the mid-1970s. It was only after a long period of absolute economic decline and devastating hyperinflation that an intensive program of reform and integration into the world economy was adopted. In this paper, we present a simple three-sector model to narrate the economic history of Argentina during the twentieth century as seen through the prism of its integration into and dis-integration from the world economy. In our model, the primary sector uses land and capital to produce agricultural goods; the secondary sector employs labor and capital to produce manufactured or industrial goods; and the tertiary sector uses only labor to produce services. We assume that (as in fact is the case) Argentina has a comparative advantage in the production of agricultural goods. Thus, the economy exports agricultural goods and imports manufactured goods; services are non-tradable and are always produced in equilibrium. The government’s intervention in the economy is limited to taxing trade and distributing the proceeds among the relevant agents. We characterize the steady-state equilibria of this economy and show that the economy could operate under specialization and trade, where neither labor nor capital is employed to produce manufactured goods; under diversification and trade, where the manufacturing sector is active in production; or under autarky, where there is no trade (for the sake of completeness, we also show that there are other equilibria where the patterns of trade reverse). We focus on the functional distribution of income; therefore, we consider three socioeconomic groups: workers, landowners and capitalists. We use our model to characterize these different groups’ demands for protectionist policies. Assuming that capital moves between the primary and secondary sectors more slowly than labor moves between the secondary and tertiary sectors, we show that import-substitution policies exhibit path dependence. Indeed, this is a very important insight into understanding the economic history of Argentina. Using the insights derived from our model, we then argue that much of the distributional conflict that arose during that period was among owners of different production factors and that trade policies were widely used to shift income across groups. At the beginning of the century, the country specialized in the production of primary goods and was highly integrated into world trade. During the inter-war period, trade opportunities and the terms of trade worsened and this led to an incipient industrialization process. Argentina started the second half of the century with a very different economic configuration. Industrialization had come a long way, and integration into world markets was weak. These new economic conditions also changed the political equilibrium; urban workers employed in the manufacturing sector and industrialists were now major social actors and they were demanding protectionist policies. Traditional sectors comprising owners of factors employed in the primary sector, on the other hand, supported free trade policies. This distributional conflict surrounding trade policy shaped the politics of the second half of the century. The years that followed the Second World War were a time of an extraordinarily rapid expansion of trade, in which Argentina was not an active participant. Instead, it embarked on an ambitious process of import-substitution industrialization that resulted in bumpy cycles of economic expansion followed by sharp recessions. Argentina had the opportunity to return to an export-led growth strategy, but the new political forces that emerged from the industrialization process during the inter-war period were able to block any attempt to liberalize. Liberalization could have been achieved gradually, thus mitigating the losses of those with vested interests in protected activities. However, it would have required a set of political institutions capable of enforcing intertemporal agreements between political groups. Sadly, Argentina lacked such institutions (see Spiller and Tommasi 2009). Instead, the dismantlement of the import-substitution strategy came only after a substantial deterioration of economic and political conditions. The steps that were then taken toward liberalization were abrupt and applied as shock policies by political groups that had political power but that did not represent a consensus of the Argentine population. As a result, Argentina’s integration into world markets proved to be extremely costly in terms of inequality and poverty. Our main thesis is that the interplay of economic and political forces that were spurred by international conditions during the inter-war period trapped the country into an anti-trade equilibrium which limited economic growth. The conditions that generated the anti-trade trap in Argentina, however, should have also generated the same effect in other new-settler, land-rich economies. This poses a pressing question: Was Argentina the only economy that fell into an anti-trade trap? We argue that most economies that shared the endowment configuration of Argentina faced a distributional conflict of similar characteristics, but with different intensities and outcomes. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we relate our work with the existing literature and explain why we focus on trade policy. In Sect. 3, we set up and solve the model. In Sect. 4, we interpret the economic history of Argentina during the twentieth century as seen through the prism of our model. In Sect. 5, we compare Argentina with another new-settler, land-rich economy: Australia. Finally, in Sect. 6, we present our conclusions.",7

Taylor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is an old saying among economists, possibly apocryphal, and of unclear attribution: “throughout history there have been only four kinds of economies in the world: advanced, developing, Japan, and Argentina”. This idea can be more concretely grasped by looking at evidence on the long run levels of income per capita in a broad range of countries over the last two centuries in Fig. 1. Material living standards have advanced across the entire world, but the well-known Great Divergence is quite apparent. A few rich countries have become much richer; a larger group of poorer countries have grown more slowly average. Within each group are notable exceptions, with some very poor countries making little progress at all. However, most striking is those countries witnessing a reversal of fortune, moving from one group to the other. Source: Maddison (2007) The great divergence and Argentina. The set of once-poor countries that are now rich include Japan, where the transition began more than 100 years ago, and some other East Asian countries such as Korea and Taiwan, whose transition started only 50 years ago and is now almost complete. But going the other way there is only one notable case of a country that started life relatively rich and ended up comparatively poor: this is the great puzzle or paradox of Argentina. In the late nineteenth century, it was among the top five countries in income per capita, richer than all European countries except Britain and on a par with other rich settler societies such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. Its status among the richest economies reached a peak around 1913 when income convergence stopped. But even until 1929 it still clung on in this club, only to face a slow and widening relative decline thereafter. It is now close to the average country in the world given its level of income per capita, and its citizens enjoy only 40% of the average income per capita of the 12 core countries of Western Europe. In a complementary chapter by Lucas Llach in this volume, written with a different focus, some important background is developed for the topics explored here. Llach discusses how the prosperity of Argentina in the circa 1913–1929 period was potentially fragile and thus vulnerable to reversal: the pre-1914 boom had been narrowly built on the physical capital of railways and the cereal lands of the pampas they made viable, but the potential for broader growth via industrial and human capital was constrained. On wider human development measures, including schooling and health, Argentina lagged its rich country rivals, and on a regional basis its wealth was heavily concentrated in the city of Buenos Aires and its surrounding province. Such were the peculiar initial economic conditions in Argentina circa 1929. To complement those findings, this chapter looks elsewhere, and in two different directions: it looks back to some of the theories of historical “deep determinants” and how they might relate to Argentina’s malaise; and it steps forward to look at the evolving story after the Great Depression with these initial conditions kept in mind. I explore some of the main contours of the Argentina “macropuzzle” as the great divergence in per capita incomes emerged and then widened after 1929, and look at some of the quantitative explanations that have been advanced for it, in particular, the central roles played by barriers to trade and investment. There are many of these (and other) distortions in Argentina—perhaps too many for the tastes of economists easily seduced by monocausal explanations tied to a toy model with a minimum of parameters. But we are in a country with an untidy economic history: in economic policy terms, it is a place where almost anything that could go wrong has, at some time, actually gone wrong. In this weirdest of historical laboratories, dozens of strange economic policy experiments have been run in the last 200 years, often for long periods, and not infrequently with lasting consequences. Still, in sum, a focus on some key “microexplanations” can help us to understand a lot of what went wrong at the nexus of public policy and economic performance. Yet beyond the search for immediate causes, of equal or greater concern to some economists has been the search for so-called “deep determinants” of economic outcomes, consisting of causally—and often temporally—distant factors that might be placed as primal or exogenous factors which “explain” the proximate cause and, hence, the ultimate outcome of economic underperformance. Among the most widely cited explanations are a country’s geography (including land/resource endowments as well as climate/disease environment), its colonial experience, and the origins of its legal system. We shall review each of these explanations as applied to the Argentine case, and find that, in contrast to many other countries, most of these explanations do not fit all that well. For example, Argentina is a predominantly temperate country, it has been dominated by European settlement, it has maintained high literacy despite the inequality, and its legal origins are a peculiar hybrid of common and civil law ideas. Thus, in the debate over the causes of economic success and failure, Argentina stands as an exception to many of the rules which seem to apply elsewhere, deepening the mystery. This contrast leaves us with the “macropuzzles”: we have much work left to do to piece together a plausible story not only of what went wrong, but why it went wrong. What were the political economy mechanisms that derailed Argentina in the twentieth century? A century ago, despite some bumps in the road, the country was prosperous and literate, in a temperate zone, economically open, had reasonably tolerable rule of law, and was progressing towards macroeconomic stability and a liberal constitutional democracy. It was not so unlike the other settler countries. Today, a century later, it looks very different. In the two main sections of the paper that follow we look at some commonly discussed proximate factors behind Argentina’s relative economic decline. We attempt to put these factors in some kind of empirical perspective and evaluate how much they might have contributed to Argentina’s economic slow down. To do so we will be primarily concerned with the steady-state impact of such effects on output. In all cases, the exact levels of these distortions have varied substantially over time, but given the slow convergence to steady state in any benchmark neoclassical model (empirically or theoretically), these factors will have a high degree of historical persistence across years and decades in any calibrated dynamic model. With the strong forces of inertia noted, it is worth keeping in mind the kind of income gaps we have to explain. The income per person level in Argentina today (about $8000) is about two-fifths of that in the rich world Western Europe (about $20,000). Thus, we are looking for a factor, or set of factors, that when imposed on a rich country can cause income to fall by a factor of 2/5 (or drop 60%); or equivalently, factors which when removed from a poor economy could cause incomes to rise by a factor of 5/2 (or increase by 150%). Or, perhaps more cleanly, in log terms we seek to explain a change in relative income of just under 1.000 log points.",10

Glaeser,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Both Buenos Aires and Chicago grew enormously over the late nineteenth century as nodes of a transportation network that brought the produce of the New World’s rich, but relatively unpopulated, hinterlands to the tables of the world. (Figure 1 shows the parallel population growth of both places.) In the early 1900s, the two cities dominated meat-packing in the Americas and were great centers of grain shipments. About one-half of the populations of both cities were immigrants, who had come to take advantage of high wages in these urban areas. Both cities were governed by functioning but imperfect democracies, and both were famous for their corruption. Sources: Historical data for Chicago from One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, by Homer Hoyt, and data for 1940–2005 from the U.S. Census. Historical data for Buenos Aires is from Anuario Estadístico de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires and Anuario Municipal, and data for 1950–2005 from Poblacion de Buenos Aires Population growth of Chicago and Buenos Aires, 1800–2005. Over the course of the twentieth century, the paths of the two cities have, of course, significantly diverged, just as the paths of Argentina and the U.S. have diverged. Buenos Aires has had faster population growth, but Chicago has become much richer and has also been generally free of the regime-changing political uprisings that have challenged the Argentine capital.Footnote 1 In this paper, we ask whether differences between the cities at the start of the twentieth century can help us to make sense of their divergent paths since then. On a functional level, the cities in 1900s appear quite similar. In both cases, rail lines brought wheat and beef into the port. From there, the beef was processed and the produce shipped east. The stockyards that carve up cattle and pigs are big employers in both places. Refrigeration significantly aids the exports of both cities. By 1910, the income gap between the two cities had closed to the point where real wages were about 70% higher in Chicago, which is substantially less than the gap was in 1890 or today. Yet there were significant differences in Chicago and Buenos Aires even in 1910, beyond that income gap. First, the education levels of Chicago residents seem to have been much higher. This difference does not reflect educational enrollments, which seem broadly similar after 1884 Argentine education reform. Instead, the adults coming into Buenos Aires seem to have been much less educated than those coming into Chicago. The main reason for this difference is that rural–urban migrants in the U.S. were much better educated, reflecting the strength of the American common school movement in the early nineteenth century. Chicago also had more German immigrants, who were relatively well educated, while Buenos Aires disproportionately attracted immigrants from the less well-educated countries of Spain and Italy. Second, Chicago moved much more quickly towards being an industrial producer as well as a transformer of raw commodities. Capital per worker appears to have been about 2.44 times higher in Chicago than in Buenos Aires in 1914. Value added per worker appears to have been 2.25 times higher in Chicago, which can readily explain the 70% wage gap. Chicago’s production of goods was, to a large extent, oriented towards providing goods for the prosperous Midwestern hinterland. The market for Buenos Aires-made manufactured goods was much smaller, because the Argentine farmers were much poorer. Moreover, Chicago had a long track record of innovation, and in many areas, such as mechanical reapers, it was on the forefront of new technologies. By contrast, Argentina was an importer of technological ideas through much of the twentieth century. Chicago’s higher human capital levels may help explain why Chicago was more technologically developed, but in any event, by 1930, Chicago is essentially an industrial town, while Buenos Aires is still focused on raw food production and commerce. Last but not least, political forces in Buenos Aires and Chicago were different. While Chicago had universal manhood suffrage since the Civil War, Buenos Aires had a much more limited electoral base until 1914. More importantly, Buenos Aires is Argentina’s capital while Chicago is not the capital of the U.S. The combination of commerce and politics in Buenos Aires means that uprisings in the city have the ability to topple national governments. Comparable uprisings in Chicago, such as the Haymarket riot, were only of local concern. The concentration of population in Buenos Aires seems to have made the country less politically stable. In the fourth section of this paper, we attempt to assess the relative importance of these difference factors by using cross-national evidence. Inevitably; this pulls us away from a city-level focus to a more national perspective. We examine the ability of pre-World War I variables, including income, industrialization, education, urbanization and political instability to explain cross-section income variation today. All of these variables are strongly correlated with current per capita GDP levels, but measures of schooling in 1900 have the strongest connection to modern income. Using coefficients from cross-national regressions, we estimate that the differences in education between Argentina and the U.S. in 1900 can, in a mechanical decomposition, explain almost all of the differences in current income levels. But why is the connection between historical education levels and current income so tight? The direct effect of education on earnings can explain only a small portion of the link. Education, however, is also correlated with political outcomes. Stable democracies are much rarer in less well-educated countries (Glaeser et al. 2007). Lower levels of education in Argentina can help us to understand that nation’s twentieth century political problems. However, education also seems to have a strong direct impact on national income levels, which can, perhaps be understood as stemming from the connection between area-level human capital and the state of technological development.",6
27,1,Latin American Economic Review,05 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40503-017-0055-4,Introduction to Argentine exceptionalism,December 2018,Edward L. Glaeser,Rafael Di Tella,Lucas Llach,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Argentina began the 20th century as one of the wealthiest places on the planet. In 1913, it was richer than France or Germany, almost twice as prosperous as Spain, and its per capita GDP was almost as high as that of Canada. Until the 1930s, the French used the phrase “riche comme un Argentin” to describe the foolishly rich. The century’s golden beginning was followed by far less prosperous decades. Over the last 100 years, Argentina’s place in the hierarchy of nations dropped precipitously, falling behind not only Europe but also many of the growing countries in Asia. Why did a nation that was doing so well end up doing so poorly? Argentina’s mediocre 20th century performance matters not only for students of Latin American economic history. That performance stands as a warning to the world. No country is too rich to fail. The set of essays in this journal collects different perspectives that attempt to make sense of what went wrong in Argentina, in the hope that more knowledge will improve Argentina’s future and help other nations to avoid future pitfalls. This special collection was the brainchild of John S. Reed, whose generosity is only matched by his intellectual curiosity and care for Argentina. This introductory essay reviews the seven papers included in this special collection dedicated to exploring the puzzle of Argentina’s economic performance during the 20th century. Section II begins by summarizing the facts. We rely, like much of the research community, on the data gathered by Angus Maddison, supplementing it with other sources. There is some controversy regarding whether Argentina was really wealthier than Western Europe, but there is little doubt that Argentina was, in fact, quite prosperous by world standards. That prosperity was not shared equally across Argentines, but that was hardly unusual. Between 1870 and 1930, Argentina experienced robust growth and remained wealthy by world standards. Between 1930 and 1970, Argentina continued growing, but at a slower pace than the world as a whole. By 1975, Argentina’s income had slipped to being 60% of incomes in France. Then, after 1970, Argentina stagnated and during some years even declined. Argentina’s 20th century path serves as a cautionary tale about how a wealthy country can lose its way. In Sect. III, we outline four basic hypotheses present in the literature on Argentina’s economic decline. The first hypothesis suggests that Argentina’s decline is not exceptional after all—maybe Argentina was not really rich, in a broad sense of the word, by 1929, and maybe, recent figures underestimate the growth in GDP (and welfare) due to critical structural changes. The other three hypotheses emphasize bad institutions (e.g., a Democracy too weak to defend itself), bad policies, and bad luck in international markets. Of course, this classification is only an attempt to order the discussion, as each of the four hypotheses admits several variations and often complement one another.Footnote 1 Bad policies often emanate from bad institutions. Indeed, a feature of the seven papers in this special collection is that they are related to each other as, typically, the economic factors that bedeviled Argentina reinforced each other. Section IV of this essay presents and summarizes the papers and ties them to one or more of the four hypotheses. Finally, in Sect. V, we emphasize the core themes running through the essays in this special collection. Argentina was different at the start of the 20th century: it had less education, technology, and probably also weaker political institutions. Those factors made Argentina particularly vulnerable to economic shocks and that vulnerability led to dire political consequences. The lack of human capital also made it particularly hard to find new ways to grow throughout most of the past one hundred years, especially when global changes challenged a previously successful economic model. Argentina’s bad 20th century is surprising, but it is not inexplicable. It is the outcome of adverse shocks, and policies that responded to those shocks, impacting a country that had only natural-resource-driven prosperity.",10
28,1,Latin American Economic Review,12 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-019-0081-5,Frontiers in the economics of crime: lessons for Latin America and the Caribbean,December 2019,Laura Jaitman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The Latin America and the Caribbean region has made progress in many socioeconomic areas. In the last two decades, the region grew on average more than 3% annually, with many countries experiencing growth rates close to 4%. With the uptake of growth in the past decade, poverty rates decreased, school attendance and health indicators improved, and many countries reported gains in terms of more inclusive growth. In contrast to these positive developments, however, crime in the region has increased. Crime and violence are a major concern in Latin America and the Caribbean, where one of every four citizens says that insecurity is the main problem in their lives, even worse than unemployment or the state of the economy. Their concerns are not without reason, as Latin America and the Caribbean is in fact the most violent region on earth. While the region is home to fewer than 9% of the world’s population, it accounts for 33.5% of the world’s homicides according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC 2019). Its annual homicide rate of 24 per 100,000 population in 2017 is more than three times the world average, six times that of the United States, and 20 times that of the United Kingdom. Overall, crime imposes significant costs on the Latin American and Caribbean economies, absorbing at least 3.5% of the region’s economic output. This conservative estimate is comparable to the amount the region spends annually on infrastructure (Jaitman 2015, 2017). Despite the magnitude of the security problem in Latin America and the Caribbean, crime and violence and the public policy response to it have received significantly less research attention than other development disciplines. This relative lack of attention stands in marked contrast to the significant rise in importance and prominence of research on crime and violence in richer countries. One of the most evident problems is deficient information systems, which result in scarce and unreliable data. Crime statistics in the region are fragmented, inconsistent, and aggregated only to the most macro-levels. The lack of information and weak national statistics systems on crime thwarts accurate diagnosis, monitoring, and evaluation of crime and interventions to counter it. Many countries are making progress on the statistics front, but the lack of political will and capacity for robust research is an obstacle to finding solutions to the crime problem. A sound research agenda on citizen security is critical to guide policies in this area. Although research on crime economics has been growing in the developed world, in Latin America and the Caribbean this topic is still understudied (Fig. 1). Conducting rigorous research on citizen security programs is difficult in the region. One challenge is of political nature: security in the developing world is a sensitive topic closely related to public opinion and to political concerns. Citizen security interventions are often driven by politics, dogma, and emotions. The dissemination of research projects is frequently obstructed when those projects run counter to established political gains, expose corruption, or simply are considered by political operators to undermine society’s perception of security. The high rotation of public servants in this area also precludes longer-term research projects. (Source: Adapted to Latin America from Draca and Machin (2015)) Papers on economics of crime in leading economics journals. Journals include Econometrica, Economica, Journal of Law and Economics, Journal of Political Economy, The American Economic Review, The Bell/RAND Journal of Economics, The Economic Journal, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, The Review of Economic Studies, and The Review of Economics and Statistics. LAC: Latin America and the Caribbean The objective of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the crime situation in the region and develop an informed discussion on its potential drivers and solutions. For that purpose, a crime economics framework is employed, as it provides a useful setting to analyze in a pragmatic rather than ideological way the different crime prevention and crime control strategies. The study of crime using an economic framework and explicitly including deterrence considerations can be traced to the late eighteenth century (Posner 2004) with Cesare Beccaria’s Dei delitti e delle pene in 1764 and Jeremy Bentham’s Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation in 1780. The most influential work on the crime economics movement is arguably “Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach” (Becker 1968). In its most stylized form, Becker’s model proposes that criminals are rational individuals who compare the expected cost and benefit of committing crimes and conducting legal activities, and then select the option with the higher expected net payoff. This basic model is very general and flexible (Polinsky and Shavell 1999; Lee and McCrary 2009, develop a more refined version). Through this lens, high crime rates are a consequence of the higher expected net benefits from illegal activities for prospective criminals. This is due to a low expected return to education or legal jobs, or to a low expected cost of committing crimes (for example, because of the low probability of apprehension), or most likely a combination of both factors. Social prevention interventions are intended to increase the payoff of legal activities, thus making crime less attractive. In the case of social prevention activities targeting youths, a training or employability program increases the possibilities of labor market attachment and, thus, potential earnings in the legal sector, ultimately reducing the attractiveness of criminal activity. Inside prisons, rehabilitation programs are intended to achieve similar objectives, raising the benefits of legal behavior upon release. Other interventions may increase the expected cost of committing crimes, thus having a deterrence effect on prospective criminals. These interventions operate on three levels: the certainty, severity, and celerity of punishment. Certainty refers to the probability of legal sanctions given the commission of a crime, and touches on all elements of the criminal justice system from policing to the judiciary. Severity refers to the onerousness of the sanction imposed, which is related not only to norms of punishment, but also to the characteristics of prisons. Celerity, which is less studied, refers to the lapse in time between the commission of a crime and its punishment, which again depends on decisions at all stages of the criminal justice system (Nagin 2013). The literature on crime economics has evolved for the most part empirically to test different implications of the Becker model mainly related to an increase in the severity and certainty of punishment and the improvement of the returns to legal activities (educations and jobs). This paper reviews the evidence, which is concentrated in developed economies, and shows the implications for improving security policies in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, there are important questions in the crime economics literature that are still unsettled in the growing body of research even for developed countries, and that are relevant for the Latin American and Caribbean context. For example, the impact of changes in economic incentives in terms of the returns to committing crimes has not been developed in the literature. This is very important because most crimes are acquisitive, and studying how illegal markets function can advance the understanding of criminal behavior and networks and how to fight them (see Galiani et al. 2019 for recent extensions to the traditional Becker model). The next section of this paper reviews the crime situation in Latin America and the Caribbean compared to other regions and describes some features of the heterogeneity within the former. Section 3 outlines the main framework of crime economics using the Becker (1968) model and its most recent extensions to add a dynamic component to the originally static model of crime. Section 4 relates the policy implications of the model to the empirical evidence in developed countries and in Latin America and the Caribbean. The paper concludes by proposing concrete areas for future research and action that are particularly relevant for Latin America and the Caribbean.",10

While income dispersion significantly increased over the 1990s in most Latin American countries, the decade of 2000 was marked by a widespread fall in socioeconomic and labor disparities (López-Calva and Lustig 2010; Gasparini et al. 2011).Footnote 1 Recent data for the 2010s suggest a slowing down of the pace of that fall and even indicate signs of stagnation and reversion in some economies (Gasparini et al. 2016). Understanding the drivers of these changing patterns is a difficult task, plagued by all sorts of methodological and data problems. In this paper, we contribute to that aim by providing evidence on patterns of wage skill premiums and labor supply by educational categories, exploiting a large database of microdata from harmonized national household surveys. Looking at wage premiums is important as the main source of inequality in household incomes (at least in the household incomes captured by surveys) is dispersion in earnings. The analysis is based on a simple but illustrative supply and demand equilibrium framework that has been applied successfully to the study of returns to labor market skills in developed countries (Katz and Murphy 1992; Goldin and Katz 2009) as well as in some developing economies (Montes Rojas 2006; Acosta and Gasparini 2007; Acosta and Montes Rojas 2008; Galiani 2009; Manacorda et al. 2010; Gallego 2012; García Swartz and Gasparini 2011). The methodology is based on an examination of changes in wage differentials and the relative supply of workers with different levels of educational attainment, from which consistent patterns in relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor can be derived. This framework is applied to a large database of microdata from harmonized Latin American national household surveys (SEDLAC database). In particular, we make use of more than 10 million individual observations in 250 surveys conducted in almost all countries in the region over the period 1991–2013. Although there is heterogeneity across countries, we find a pattern of rather constant increase in the relative supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers over the period. Consistently, the returns to secondary education completion fell over time. However, in contrast, the returns to tertiary education display a remarkably changing pattern common to almost all economies: a significant increase in the 1990s, a strong fall in the 2000s, and a deceleration of that fall in the 2010s. We conclude that supply-side factors seem to have limited explanatory power relative to demand-side factors in accounting for changes in the wage skill premium. The rest of the document is organized as follows. The next section explores the motivations for conducting this analysis, documenting briefly the secular expansion in education in the region and trends in income inequality over the last two decades. Section 3 describes the basic supply and demand framework to account for changes in wage skill premium and the relative supply of workers with different skill levels, whereas Sect. 4 presents and discusses the main results. Section 5 examines the role of supply and proxies for demand factors in the evolution of regional aggregates by means of regression analysis. Section 6 ends with some brief concluding remarks.",6

28,1,Latin American Economic Review,15 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-019-0076-2,The rise and fall of Argentina,December 2019,Rok Spruk,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"On the eve of World War I, the future of Argentina looked bright. Since its promulgation of the 1853 Constitution, Argentina had experienced strong economic growth and institutional modernization, which had propelled it into the ranks of the 10 wealthiest countries in the world by 1913. In the aftermath of the war, Argentina’s income per capita fell from a level approximating that of Switzerland to its current middle-income country status. Although numerous theories have been suggested to explain the swift decline, the general consensus highlights the fundamental importance of institutional environment in shaping the path of economic growth and development (North 1990; Weingast 1997). Although the literature has provided a great deal of evidence, the counterfactual scenario to Argentina’s path to underdevelopment remains poorly understood. This paper exploits the temporal variation in institutional breakdowns to consistently estimate the contribution of de jure and de facto political institutions to long-run development, drawing on Argentina’s extensive historical bibliography (Rosa 1965; Elizagaray 1985; Waisman 1987; Sábato 1988; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006b). This paper addresses Argentina’s economic development in a long-term historical perspective from its rapid growth takeoff during the Bellé Époque and its subsequent infamous transition from a rich country in early twentieth century to the underdeveloped one down to the present. In this respect, this paper highlights the role and pivotal importance of institutional framework for sustained long-run growth and development. Drawing on the Argentina’s infamous transition to an underdeveloped country, it shows how the absence of broad-based de jure and de facto political institutions creates the conditions for economic stagnation, which can be very hard to overcome regardless of the quality of policy-making. Using the case of Argentina, the paper shows that either a transition to dictatorship or the transition to democracy can produce negative effects on long-run growth if the de facto political institutions such as a broad-based access to collective action for non-elites do not support the de jure institutional changes. Numerous theories have been used to explain Argentina’s transition from a rich country to the underdeveloped one. Not everyone agrees that low-quality institutional framework per se is the root cause of Argentina’s underdevelopment. The general thrust of these theories emphasizes the role of the closing of the frontier expansion, differences in the political traditions linked to large-scale nineteenth century immigration, immigration policies, underinvestment in human capital, the comparative advantage in agriculture and its adverse implications for technology, and the role of culture acting as a brake rather than filer in the process of long-run development. Like Australia and Canada, Argentina was an exporter of primary goods, and until the mid-twentieth century, it followed a development path similar to theirs. Compared with other areas in Latin America, Argentina had a small indigenous population; a low population density; and a favorable stock of natural resources, which precipitated sizable export-driven growth despite the country’s geographic isolation from key international markets (Gallo 1983; Duncan and Fogarty 1984; Di Tella and Platt 1986). The question remains, what caused a society that achieved astonishing wealth within 50 years following its independence from Spain to embark on a path of comparative decline? Sanz-Villarroya (2005) identified 2 years of structural break in Argentina’s development path compared with those of Australia and Canada: 1896 and 1899. Those years marked important points in Argentina’s long-lasting decline in comparison with the two countries. In a comparative perspective, Argentina’s institutional development differed from the United States, Canada or Australia in several key dimensions. After the 1853 Constitution, Argentina embarked on the path of institutional modernization associated with a rapid economic growth fueled by large-scale immigration from Europe and elsewhere. The 1853 Constitution enshrined universal suffrage which had been enforced in 1912 following Sáenz Peña Law. But compared to U.S, Canada and Australia, Argentina never finished the transition to the open democracy supported by the rule of law. When the military formally broke the constitutional order in 1930, Argentina embarked on the path of unstable institutional development frequent back-and-forth transitions between dictatorship and democracy. Instead of embarking on the path to sustained institutional development, Argentina underwent a tumultuous electoral fraud with a near erosion of the system of checks and balanced that precipitated the rise of populist leaders, like Juan Péron, to power. Unstable de jure and de facto institutional framework failed to promulgate growth-enhancing economic policies. Instead, it molded government-backed favoritism of dominant interest groups and encouraged pervasive rent-seeking instead of productive economic activity. On the balance, such institutional framework condemned Argentina to decades of stagnant productivity and poor economic growth. This paper looks at 28 countries in the period 1850–2012 and constructs the latent indices of de jure and de facto political institutions using several existing datasets such as Marshall et al. (2013) and Vanhanen (2000, 2003). Deploying a structural model of long-run development with time-varying de jure and de facto political institutions and a series of time-invariant covariates, this paper estimates the contribution of de jure and de facto political institutions to long-run development conditional on the confounding effects previously identified in the literature. The counterfactual scenario is built by constructing an alternative de jure and de facto institutional series in the absence of institutional breakdowns. The synthetic control and difference-in-differences estimates suggest that had such breakdowns not occurred and had Argentina followed the institutional trends of its nearest-counterpart countries, it would be among the richest countries today. We find that making de jure and de facto political institutions more inclusive for the non-elites is associated with an increase in per capita income between 1.8 and 2.6 percent, ceteris paribus. The estimated effect of de jure and de facto political institutions on long-run growth is robust across multiple specification checks, and does not disappear once the confounding effects of physical capital accumulation and human capital investment in the standard Cobb–Douglas production function setup are appropriately taken into account. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the historical background behind Argentina’s institutional breakdowns and long-run decline. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework. Section 4 discusses the underlying empirical design. Section 5 presents the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 6 provides results and counterfactual estimates. Section 7 presents the paper’s conclusions.",9

28,1,Latin American Economic Review,14 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-019-0074-4,Poverty alleviation strategies under informality: evidence for Latin America,December 2019,Martin Caruso Bloeck,Sebastian Galiani,Federico Weinschelbaum,Male,Male,Male,Male,"For several decades, poverty has been on a steady downward path, both worldwide and in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Growth in incomes and a decline in inequality in the 2000s have triggered these improvements. Still, there is room for progress, and poverty reduction remains a top priority for societies and policymakers in the LAC region. This paper is therefore dedicated to assessing the effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies. In terms of poverty, LAC has consistently ranked in the middle of the remaining regions of the world, below Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and Northern Africa, but above South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and sub-Saharan Africa. With the exception of this last region, all regions have gone through a sustained process of poverty reduction. The fall in poverty in LAC has been underpinned by long-run growth in the region, although there has been frequent macroeconomic instability. Inequality generally rose in the 1990s, while it has fallen in the 2000s. With some exceptions, the gains in the 2000s have more often offset the declines in the 1990s, implying that declines in inequality have contributed to declines in poverty. This paper estimates the contribution of growth and inequality toward poverty reduction by means of regression-based decompositions, finding that growth has been the main driver behind falling poverty in LAC. This is not because declining inequality is ineffective at reducing poverty—far from it, the estimates indicate that the elasticity of poverty with respect to inequality is rather large, especially in the region. The reason is rather that inequality has not fallen consistently from its values at the beginning of the sample. That being said, growth and sustained declines in inequality are necessarily long-term strategies for poverty reduction. Even when growth and declines in inequality are sustained, this paper argues that there is a need to complement these developments with poverty alleviation programs. This is because improvements do not automatically spill over to everyone, and groups without the proper human capital and access to better opportunities are unlikely to be able to gain their share of these benefits. The effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs depends crucially on whether they can efficiently target the poorest sector of the population. High-income countries have mainly relied on means testing strategies to gauge this efficiently, but this requires being able to verify whether incomes have been reported accurately. In a context with huge levels of informality, as is the case in LAC, incomes are generally unobservable to program administrators. As a result, developing countries have adopted proxy means testing mechanisms to assess the poverty status of potential beneficiaries. This paper compares the performance of these and other alternative mechanisms by means of a formal model. While means testing may steer workers away from more productive opportunities in the informal sector, it allows for a more flexible design of transfers and a greater pro-poor character for a program. On the other hand, proxy means testing generates no distortions in workers’ decisions, but the overall pro-poor nature of the program is constrained by the ability of observable characteristics to accurately predict poverty levels. Additionally, since means testing programs do not provide income support for informal workers, the effect of complementing means testing with transfers to informal workers is analyzed. When transfers are granted to all informal workers, the level of filtration to the non-poor is possibly large, while it is not possible to provide greater transfers to the poorest informal workers. As a result, indiscriminate transfers to informal workers are a rather inefficient way to reduce the incidence and depth of poverty. Transfers to informal workers assigned through proxy means testing generate distortions in labor market decisions, a result that contrasts with the effect of proxy means testing alone. Finally, this paper considers how the design of redistributive programs affects the budget constraints of the public sector. Informality diminishes public revenues for a given tax rate or requires a higher rate for a desired revenue level. Additionally, it makes taxation of the non-poor and targeting of the poor less efficient, weakening the overall distributive effect of public programs. These effects are stronger if income support is provided to informal workers, even by means of proxy means testing. In view of this, this paper argues that greater reliance on means testing may be suitable in LAC. The main reasons are that means testing is a more pro-poor design, curbs the size of the informal sector and the losses in revenues associated with it, and avoids unnecessary filtration to the non-poor. The next section of this paper discusses methodological issues behind the measurement of poverty and presents the evidence on poverty in LAC and the rest of the world. Section 3 studies the role of growth and inequality in poverty reduction and estimates the elasticities of poverty with respect to growth and inequality. It also quantifies the contribution of each of these factors to poverty reduction in LAC. Section 4 uses a formal model to examine income-support programs for the poor in the context of high informality and draws conclusions for improvements in policy design. Finally, Sect. 5 puts forth the conclusions and implications of the paper.",4

Ben Goodwin,Fidel Gonzalez,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The negative health and quality of life implications of pollution have been extensively documented. Nevertheless, global air pollution continues to rise, with an 8% increase in world pollution levels from 2007 to 2013. Virtually, all of the most polluted cities are in the developing world, with 98% of cities in developing countries experiencing unsafe exposure levels at some point. In these cities, air quality regulations often take a back seat to other priorities. Mexico City exemplifies this problem with over 22 million inhabitants living in one of the most polluted cities in the western hemisphere (WHO 2014). Arguably, the two largest and most important market choices individuals make are where to work and live. Theory suggests that a disamenity such as air pollution is tied into these markets as individuals jointly make labor and housing decisions, considering the attributes of a local area. As air pollution is universally perceived as detrimental to quality of life, individuals may require to be compensated, either through higher wages or lower housing prices, to live in areas with lower air quality. Mexico City provides a unique opportunity to help understand the relationship between pollution, labor, and housing markets within a single city in a developing country. It has a large middle-class population that has the ability and flexibility to make decisions within the labor and housing markets. In addition, plagued by chaotic traffic, households may choose to live closer to their employment to eliminate long commutes. With its unique topography, Mexico City sits at the bottom of a bowl surrounded by mountains, trapping particulate matter and other pollutants. Further, low winds, its tropical location, elevations over 2200 m (7300 feet), a large population, industry, and an aging fleet of vehicles all combine to create high levels of pollution. In this study, we measure the value of clean air to the residents of Mexico City captured by housing and labor markets. We estimate the compensating differential for individuals to tolerate air pollution using a dual-sorting hedonic model as initially developed by Roback (1982). We take into account the interconnection between housing and labor markets along with the local amenities offered within neighborhoods. We focus on the detrimental amenity of air pollution in the form of particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter (PM10). This is the most visible air pollutant measurement and has the greatest impact on people’s perception of pollution levels (WHO 2014). We assemble a rich dataset that is rarely available for a developing country. We combine environmental data from various agencies and use GIS to link it to individual home sales and wages of the buyers. Our dataset contains information on the actual transacted price of the home, physical characteristics of the housing unit, and socioeconomic information of the household purchasing the home. We merge this information with the neighborhood’s hourly PM10 readings and daily rainfall to analyze the simultaneous impact of PM10 concentrations on housing prices and income. While previous work looks at aggregate data and average home values across cities, our unique dataset allows us to focus at the individual house level within a city, which greatly alleviates the problem of migration, distances, and information costs. Our paper undertakes a simultaneous equation three-stage least squares (3SLS) instrumental variable approach that accounts for endogeneity and omitted variable bias. The system of equations allows us to account for the suspected correlation of the disturbances between the equations. We also use location fixed effects at the postal code level to address for time unvarying variables and minimize the impacts of spatial autocorrelation. In Mexico City, we find that PM10 can be strongly instrumented by rainfall. Rain scrubs air pollution from the atmosphere through the process of wet deposition (Barmpadimos et al. 2011). While rain can be considered an amenity that affects the choice of where to work and live, it should not be a concern in our case. Country-level studies that compare cities across large distances, such as the U.S., may present large precipitation variations that can influence household’s decisions on where to live. Our study, however, focuses on a single city without the large variations in rainfall that may impact these decisions. Further, if rain acts as an amenity in itself, it would have an opposite effect on pollution. High rain would be considered a negative amenity in an urban setting, whereas it has a positive effect on air quality. If this is the case, our estimates would provide a lower bound of the effects of air pollution on housing prices and incomes. Another potential concern is that rain variations could affect wages through agricultural yields. However, this is not an issue in our paper, as there is no agriculture in our urban setting. We further alleviate these concerns by including zip code fixed effects and additional controls in all of our regressions. Our results suggest that the residents of Mexico City are compensated for higher pollution levels through both the labor and housing markets. Our estimates show that the elasticity between pollution and house prices is − 0.30 and the wage elasticity equals 1.60. These results translate into an average household needing to be compensated by US$ 83.96, or 2.98% of average income per month to accept a 1 µg/m3 increase in average PM10 levels. As with any hedonic work, we caution extending these estimates beyond our geographic area of study. Further, comparing our results with other studies should be done with care, as different data, time-frames, methodologies, and outcomes measured may render different and hard to compare results. With this caveat, our results are roughly on the higher end relative to studies in both developed and developing nations. For Mexico, Rodriguez-Sanchez (2014) replicates the Bayer et al. (2009) two-stage hedonic model that accounts for migration costs within Mexico, estimating an annual willingness to pay (WTP) between US$ 46.90 and 283.61. Gonzalez et al. (2013) use similar data to ours for Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, and calculate a marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for housing values in the range of US$ 36.34 to 43.47. Filippini and Martinez-Cruz (2016) use a contingent valuation survey in a high-pollution municipality within Mexico City and find an average WTP of US$ 262 per respondent. Chakraborti et al. (2019) estimate land values within Mexico City and find a marginal WTP of US$ 231.77 per average land parcel. For Chile, Lavín et al. (2011) estimate an inter-city hedonic approach that includes both the housing and labor markets, and find a monthly value of a marginal improvement in air quality between US$ 3 and 6. Carriazo and Gomez-Mahecha (2018) construct a demand function for air quality in Bogotá, Colombia, and estimate a willingness to pay of US$ 12.16 per month per household. While the unique elements of each study do not allow for a direct comparison, our actual housing transaction and household-level data should provide more precise estimates relative to previous studies that rely on average city-level housing prices and wages. Estimates of the value of air quality are of great practical interest to policy makers. If estimates under-represent the value of clean air, then this discourages government policy aimed at mitigating pollution, with all its health and quality of life implications.",4
28,1,Latin American Economic Review,31 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-019-0075-3,Evidence-based gender equality policy and pay in Latin America and the Caribbean: progress and challenges,December 2019,Rosangela Bando,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Men and women may sometimes have different roles, which impact the exercise of human rights. For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean region women work more yet get less formal compensation or benefits in exchange for it. The average woman in the region works 25 h more per month than the average man (United Nations 2015b), and half the women in the region work for no pay or profit at all (World Bank 2016). A pay gender gap implies limits to individual choice based on sex, thus violating individual human rights. Note that the word “gender” refers to a social construct. Gender denotes a group of behaviors that society considers appropriate for men and women (WHO 2015). Thus, gender gaps refer to differentials between the sexes derived from different treatment by society. The word “sex,” on the other hand, denotes the biological and physiological characteristics that separate men and women (WHO 2015).Footnote 1
 Governments in the region need policies to promote equal enjoyment by men and women of human rights, including the right to reap economic and social benefits. Despite the current gender gap in Latin America and the Caribbean, there has been significant progress in the region. Women have increased their labor participation since the 1990s more than in any other region in the world. The percentage of employed women 15 years of age and older increased from 38 to 50% from 1991 to 2014 in Latin America and the Caribbean, in contrast to a decrease from 49 to 46% in the rest of the world (World Bank 2016).Footnote 2 However, it is still an open question how much of this labor increase constitutes a substitution for unpaid work and how much of it is actual additional labor. Economists cannot fully explain why women continue to assume unpaid work in society and bear the cost associated with it. Neither is it clear why society continues to bear the social and economic costs associated with gender segregation into occupations. Economists have studied labor and pay gender gaps since the 1950s. The general argument built to date includes several components. Biology and social norms interact to determine skills. Skills and technology produce goods and services that individuals trade. Institutions regulate trade to reduce transaction costs. Thus, biology, social norms, technology, and institutions influence the pay gender gap. Researchers have found that these factors interact and influence the gender gap at several stages. Therefore, researchers are challenged to find simple solutions. Policymakers and researchers are working together to address the challenge. This paper aims to aid these efforts. It summarizes the progress in research, explains the rationale for the main theories to explain gender gaps, summarizes pay gap studies in the region in the last 10 years, and lists the main challenges to generating evidence-based gender equality policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Studying gender gaps is important for two reasons. The first is that gender gaps limit individual choice based on sex. The second article in the Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as […] sex” (United Nations 1948). However, the observed inequality in pay between men and women is related to limits to freedoms. For instance, Duflo (2012) noted that gender would not influence spending if informal mechanisms enabled individuals to voice their preferences. However, women allocate more resources than men to the education and health of children (Thomas 1990; Duflo 2003; Duflo and Udry 2004). In Mexico, married women’s earnings reduce within-household inequality because they share their income with other household members (Campos-Vázquez et al. 2012). In the government sphere, the gender of the decision-maker also influences public spending (Yañez-Pagans 2014). Thus, pay gaps reflect gaps in the ability of individuals to voice their preferences. The second reason why it is important to study gender gaps is that these gaps deter economic growth. Indeed, women tend to invest more than men in human capital for future generations (Duflo 2003; Duflo and Udry 2004). Gender gaps also undermine collective action. Women are more likely to be out of the labor market or to work in the informal sector (ILO 2013b, 2015b). Thus, tax collection and social coverage is particularly limited for women.Footnote 3 In addition, women are less likely to participate in the democratic process as leaders (Zetterberg 2009), and gender segregation into certain occupations also contributes to deterring economic development (World Bank 2012). The relationship between women’s empowerment and economic development is not trivial. Evidence shows that simply endowing women with resources does not always result in economic gains. For example, Udry (1996) found that men’s farming plots were more productive than women’s plots in Africa. Banerjee et al. (2015) found no evidence the gender of the recipient of microcredit loans in Mexico mattered for returns. Overcoming gender gaps can be difficult, and perpetuating gender gaps is likely to deter some paths to economic growth.Footnote 4
 This study focuses on the gender gap in pay and how it is related to other important gender issues in the region. There are three features of the scope and limitations of this study. First, the study focuses on economic labor models of individual choice. One concern related to gender issues is that social norms drive gender gaps. Therefore, other studies could consider studying gender gaps from a collective decision-making perspective. Second, this study discusses aggregate evidence that allows for establishing relationships among contributing factors. As a result, it leaves out a rich body of literature on case studies or descriptions of behavior based on small samples. Third, this study will discuss policies related to gender issues in the last 10 years. A historical view demands a broader discussion and is beyond the scope of this work.",9
28,1,Latin American Economic Review,17 October 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40503-019-0071-7,Do changes in divorce legislation have an impact on divorce rates? The case of unilateral divorce in Mexico,December 2019,Edith Aguirre,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Divorce has legally existed in Mexico for over a century. In contrast to other countries such as Italy, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Ireland or Chile, where divorce was forbidden until 1971, 1977, 1981, 1987, 1997 and 2004, respectively, the Mexican legislation has allowed for divorce since 1914. However, to file for divorce, a mutual agreement between the spouses had to exist; otherwise, a contested divorce (where the parties do not agree and need to fight it out in court) still had to take place. Therefore, compared to Australia or the USA, where unilateral divorce (a divorce in which one spouse ends the marriage without the consent of the other spouse) has been popular since the early 1970s, the country has lagged behind. Divorce rates in Mexico have exhibited an upward trend in the past decades, but after the introduction of unilateral divorce in some entities, this trend has grown remarkably. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze whether divorce rates respond to the implementation of unilateral divorce within the context of a developing country, in this case, Mexico. Mexico comprises 32 entities, 31 states and Mexico City. Each one of them regulates its citizens independently through their own constitutions, civil codes and penal codes, among others, which are the counterparts to the comprehensive federal regulatory structure. All petitions for divorce are handled by entity courts. In October 2008, Mexico City was the first entity to approve unilateral divorce, and since then, 17 states have also moved to eliminate fault-based divorce. It took 7 years, between 2008 and 2015, for these changes to happen in 12 entities, but in only 1 year, 2016, six more allowed no-fault divorce.Footnote 1 A possible explanation for the increasing number of states that have recently modified their legislations in terms of divorce is that in July 2015, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation determined that it is unconstitutional for states not to allow a spouse to end a marriage unilaterally, without the need to provide a cause to dissolve the marriage.Footnote 2 However, the Supreme Court resolution regarding unilateral divorce does not make any state law invalid, since it is only a jurisprudential thesis.Footnote 3 From a legal perspective, unilateral divorce is therefore settled in the country, but there is an implementation problem that causes longer and strenuous divorce processes in those states that have not yet adopted divorce on no grounds. Table 1 shows the entities that have modified their local laws to adopt no-fault divorce, the year when the reform was introduced, and information about the legislation that validates unilateral divorce in the state.Footnote 4
 The economic literature suggests that state interventions to correct externalities are not necessary when property laws are clear and transaction costs are low because the parties will get together and negotiate a private agreement until they reach an efficient solution. Based on this assumption, efficient bargaining has been extended to marriage decisions, and the claim is that if the spouse who wishes to leave the marriage can bargain at a low cost with the spouse who wishes to stay, the only factor that matters for the dissolution of the union is the compensation negotiated, regardless of the allocation of property rights or legal liability (Becker et al. 1977). The argument is further elaborated in Becker (1991, p. 331): “A husband and wife would both consent to a divorce if, and only if, they both expected to be better off divorced. Although divorce might seem more difficult when mutual consent is required than when either alone can divorce at will, the frequency and incidence of divorce should be similar with these and other rules if couples contemplating divorce can easily bargain with each other. This assertion is a special case of the Coase theorem (1960) and is a natural extension of the argument (…) that persons marry each other if, and only if, they both expect to be better off compared to their best alternatives.” The theoretical justification provided by Becker (1991) framed in terms of Coase’s (1960) theorem leads to the conclusion that only inefficient marriages would disolve and efficient divorces would occur, regardless of the legal system. Therefore, modifications in divorce legislation should have no effect on the total number of divorces, and the adoption of a no-fault divorce regime should have no effect on divorce rates. However, critics of Becker’s proposition have emerged. Even if there were perfect information and no transactional costs, it has been argued that divorce laws would affect divorce decisions because of the importance of assets and resource allocation before and after the divorce, along with divorce legislation, for determining the gains and losses from dissolution and for influencing the decision to end the marriage (Clark 1999). In addition, if Coase’s theorem as applied to marriage contracts were discarded, it has been claimed that to assume that divorce rates are not influenced by divorce legislation because the gains from marriage are not affected by more liberal divorce laws would be to deny that the easier it is to get a divorce, the lower is the value of marital surplus due to more attractive outside options (Mechoulan 2005). In an effort to reconsider the theoretical validity of the so-called Becker–Coase theorem, within the context of households that consume public as well as private goods, it has been found that as a general rule, reforms in divorce legislation are expected to affect divorce rates, but the effect can be either positive or negative, according to the situation of each couple. Moreover, this opens up the possibility that the Becker–Coase theorem can still hold, as long as the consumption of the public goods involved in the marriage is not altered after the divorce (Chiappori et al. 2015). Sometimes changes in public policies have unintended effects on people’s lives and their relationships with others. Even though no-fault divorce legislation was originally intended as a solution for inherent disputes in a fault-based divorce regime, research in different countries has demonstrated that unilateral divorce laws have caused an increase in the total number of divorces than would have occurred otherwise. The discussion regarding the impact of unilateral divorce has turned into a battleground in the public sphere. While some claim that it is a less adversarial divorce system, which respects the privacy of the marriage since no evidence against either of the spouses is needed, others argue that unilateral divorce laws undermine the institution of marriage, encouraging marital irresponsibility and taking away bargaining leverage from the party who is neither at fault nor desirous of a breach, since the processes of determining property distribution, alimony and child custody are separated from the divorce trial. To add to the debate on the effects of unilateral divorce, it has been argued that social changes after the Second World War led to a rise in the number of inefficient marriages and that no-fault legislation contributed to transforming previously inefficient marriages into efficient divorces but also to converting efficient marriages into inefficient divorces (Allen 1998). Furthermore, it has been suggested that during the period from 1965 to 1996, the adoption of unilateral divorce law in the USA caused an increase in violent crime rates of approximately 9%. In the years following the reform, it was observed that mothers in adopting states were more likely to become the head of the household and to fall below the poverty line, especially less educated mothers. A potential link between the unilateral reform and the increase in crime might have been worsening in the economic conditions of mothers and the increase in income inequality as unintended consequences of the reform (Caceres-Delpiano and Giolito 2012). Empirical evidence also shows that adults who were exposed to unilateral divorces as children have lower family incomes, are less educated and separate more often (Gruber 2004). On the other hand, making divorce easier decreases domestic violence for both men and women, reduces female suicide, lowers the number of females murdered by intimates and has a positive effect on marriage investments such as female labor force participation (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006; Stevenson 2007). Research on no-fault divorce indicates both positive and negative effects when legislation is modified to allow for unilateral divorce, depending on the particular subject under analysis. From a policy perspective, changes in divorce legislation might play an even more important role in Mexico than in developed countries, strengthening women’s bargaining position in the household, where women often lack the authority to make key decisions. For instance, in terms of gender violence, data for Mexico show that around 45% of women who have been in a relationship between 2006 and 2016 have experienced intimate partner violence.Footnote 5 Unilateral divorce not only represents an option for abused wives to escape their marriages, but it also contributes to reducing domestic violence because husbands are less likely to abuse given a more credible threat to leave the marriage. Women in developing countries are also more economically dependent. Mexican female labor market participation is below the average for OECD countries with the second lowest rate only after Turkey (OECD 2017). As a result, the potential costs of divorce that Mexican married women bear can be disproportionately higher relative to men. Divorce on no grounds reduces the time spent on accusations and legal fees, helping women cope better with the financial divorce burdens and increasing their chances to end a bad marriage. In this paper, to analyze the unilateral divorce effect on divorce rates in Mexico, a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis is conducted using aggregate divorce data at the state level following the methodology proposed by Wolfers (2006) and Friedberg (1998). In each year, the states that have adopted unilateral divorce are considered the treatment group, while the states that remain under the fault-based legislation are considered the control group. The DD technique has been used widely to study numerous policy questions, and it is considered a popular tool for applied research in economics. The results indicate that the shift toward divorce on no grounds raises the divorce rate by 0.30 annual divorces per thousand people and accounts for a 26.4% increase in the total number of divorces in the states that modified their legislation during the period 2009–2015. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the impact of unilateral legislation on divorce rates in a Latin American country, and it aims to contribute to a better understanding of divorce outcomes in the region, as well as the implications of these types of polices in developing countries. The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 introduces the relevant literature; Sect. 3 discusses the estimation strategy; Sect. 4 presents the data; Sect. 5 shows the results for the static and dynamic specifications, as well as the results for alternative empirical approaches that are followed; and Sect. 6 presents the conclusions.",2

Chumacero,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Governments have the tendency to attribute good outcomes to their policies (skills) and bad ones to negative external shocks outside of their control (luck). That is certainly the case in Bolivia. As in many other dimensions, the economic debate regarding the sources of the economic performance during the (continuing) tenure of President Evo Morales, is polarized. Opponents consider that most (if not all) of the good economic indicators are due to extraordinarily favorable external conditions.Footnote 1 Acolytes consider that a major role has to be attributed to the heterodox policies that the government has implemented, and compare favorably recent economic indicators, against the ones of, what they tend to call, the “neoliberal past” (Arce 2016). Economists have long understood that one of the most prevalent and pernicious logical fallacies is to attribute a causal effect to a correlation.Footnote 2 Thus, a rigorous effort to ascertain how important were skills (or lack thereof) and luck, requires more than informal comparisons, declarations, and charts.Footnote 3
 Answering this question is not easy, as an obvious counterfactual is not readily available. That is, ideally, we would like to know how would Bolivia have fared if faced with the same external conditions, but with different internal policies than the ones pursued by President Morales. In experimental terms, we would like to quantify what were the effects of receiving the “Evo Morales treatment,” when no natural control group is available. This paper attempts to do so, using three methodologies. For completeness, each one is described, justified, and implemented. Presenting more than one approach helps to narrow down the possible answers, highlights their strengths and weaknesses, and provides robustness checks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes and implements a methodology known as the synthetic control method. Section 3 uses a panel data model. Section 4 uses a simple dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (DSGE). Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Campos-Vázquez,Eduardo M. Medina-Cortina,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent decades, the global obesity epidemic and its public health implications have been a worldwide concern. Governments have promoted policies to check its growth, including the imposition of excise taxes on high-calorie foods (OECD 2013). Medical research has provided ample empirical evidence linking obesity to the consumption of soft drinks (Andreyeva et al. 2011; Brownell et al. 2009; Cutler et al. 2003). The governments of Norway (1981), Australia (2000), Finland (2011), France (2012), and several cities in the U.S. (Berkeley in 2014 and Chicago, Oakland, and Philadelphia in 2017) have implemented taxes on soft drinks. In this paper, we analyze the impact of Mexico’s 2014 national soft drink tax on final prices and the effect that establishment competition has over the tax pass-through. The epidemic of overweight and obesity in Mexico is alarming.Footnote 1 According to the OECD (2013), Mexico has a rate of obesity second only to the United States. In 2012, the proportion of individuals either obese or overweight was 69.4% for men and 73% for women, figures which have tripled since 1980 (Barquera et al. 2010). In January 2014, the federal government addressed this problem by promulgating a new tax of 1 peso (1 MXN) per liter on beverages with added sugar.Footnote 2 The tax is equivalent to 0.12 USD PPP, more per liter than the same tax in France, but lower than taxes in Denmark, Finland, and the city of Berkeley, California. In order to reduce consumption, such a tax needs to increase the final price. However, economic theory holds that the burden of taxation depends crucially on the market structure (Fullerton and Metcalf 2002; Anderson et al. 2001). In the long run, under perfect competition, homogeneous goods, and constant marginal costs, the pass-through effect of a tax increase is a one-to-one relation. On the other hand, if firms hold some degree of market power and the goods taxed are not perfectly homogeneous, price adjustments may vary at the establishment or brand level, and they may be either undershifted or overshifted into final prices (Delipalla and Keen 1992; Weyl and Fabinger 2013). Given such considerations, the present study evaluates the pass-through of the tax, the influence on the tax of competition among stores, and after-tax price dispersion, using a confidential dataset of product-specific prices (classified by brand and presentation).Footnote 3 The dataset is provided by the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO). By law, this agency collects store-specific weekly prices for a large set of products throughout the country and makes the current data available to consumers through an internet portal, “¿Quién es quién en los precios?” (“Who’s Who in Prices?”). Historical data, however, are not provided to the public; this type of datais confidential and was provided to us under a collaboration agreement. Most of the data collected relate to consumer goods, such as food, beverages, medicines, and electronic appliances. The panel used in this study captures information from 553 stores that sold soft drinks in 27 cities in Mexico during 2012–2014, with a total of almost one million weekly price observations. In order to capture the effect of competition on the tax pass-through, we adopt a standard measure from the empirical literature on supermarket competition. Using fixed-radius circles of 2 and 5 km, we find the exact number of relevant competitors surrounding each establishment for which we possess price information, and we weight it by the number of employees to value its proportional competitive influence (Ellickson and Grieco 2013; Castañeda 2012; Hausman and Parker 2010; Ridley et al. 2010; Downing 1973). Using reduced-form price equations, we find that the pass-through effect of the one-peso tax per liter is 1.12 pesos for sodas, 1.52 pesos for sports drinks, 0.25 pesos for juices, and 0.24 pesos for powdered drink mixes. A one standard deviation increase in the number of competitors decreases the overall tax overshifting by 38%, although for individual drink types, the effect is statistically significant only for sodas. We also find that price dispersion is related to the extent of local competition, moving from a market with 20 competing stores to one with 29 lowers the overall price dispersion by 10%. This effect is exacerbated after the exogenous price shock caused by the tax: the net effect is 16%. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short review of the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the Mexican excise tax on soft drinks. The dataset and descriptive statistics for pricing behavior are introduced in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy and the models to be estimated. Section 6 discusses the results and their possible policy implications. Finally, Sect. 7 provides some concluding remarks.",9

The tourism sector represents an important part of the world gross domestic product (GDP), employs directly and indirectly an important proportion of the global work force, represents an important share in total exports, and foreign direct investment (FDI) represents an important source of world’s tourism investment. The expansion of this sector resulted in an increase in fossil energy consumption and in important green house gas (GHG) emissions. However, investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy related to the touristic sector seem generating significant returns within a short payback period. In addition, a great proportion of travelers are found to promote environmentally friendly tourism and are willing to pay for related experiences (United Nations Environment Program 2011). All these reasons make studying the interaction of tourism with these economic variables, and particularly with renewable energy, worth considering. To the best of our knowledge, with the exception of the Ben Jebli et al. (2015a) study for Tunisia, no research has been implemented on the dynamic linkages between renewable energy and tourism. This paper attempts to remedy this lack of studies by investigating the interaction of tourism with renewable energy, economic growth, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, FDI and international trade. To this end, the analysis employs data on a panel basis coming from Central and South American countries, while it focuses on the relationship between tourism and renewable energy. Our sample is chosen from Central and South America because they are considered among the richest regions in biodiversity and renewable energy potential. Central America belongs to the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Hotspot and contains nearly 8% of the earth’s biodiversity (Global Energy Network Institute 2012). In addition, it is a geologically active region with both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions usually happening, and 80% of it is mountainous, while the coastal areas are flat. These features make this region rich in renewable energy resources for electricity generation. Regional integration can help this region to move to 100% dependency on renewable energy for electricity generation, while increasing economic and energy security, decreasing dependency on foreign oil, developing greenly, and decreasing poverty (Global Energy Network Institute 2012). This paper examines the causal link between renewable energy consumption, international tourist arrivals, trade openness ratio, economic growth, foreign direct investment, and CO2 emissions by considering a panel composed of 22 Central and South American countries. We also estimate the long-run impact of renewable energy consumption, international tourist arrivals, trade, FDI, and GDP on CO2 emissions. The paper is closely related to that by Ben Jebli et al. (2015a), but it differs from it on several aspects. First, in the current paper, we use panel methods, whereas in the previous paper, time series methods are used. For this purpose, the Pesaran (2004) cross-sectional dependence (CD) statistic, and the Pesaran (2007) and Smith et al. (2004) second-generation panel unit root tests are used. Second, in the current paper, the renewable energy consumption comprises all types of renewable resources, whereas in the previous paper, only combustible renewables and waste are considered. Third, in the current paper, we add international trade and FDI variables that were not there before. This study is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives an idea about tourism and renewable energy in the world. Section 3 is a literature review, while Sect. 4 is concerned with data presentation and empirical methodology description. Section 5 is designated for long-run parameters estimates, while Sect. 6 reports Granger causality. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the paper with policy recommendations.",127
