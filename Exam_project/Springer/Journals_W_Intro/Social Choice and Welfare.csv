Here is the correct proof along with a statement of the result. Suppose F satisfies unlimited domain. F satisfies Pareto indifference and binary independence of irrelevant alternatives if and only if F satisfies strong neutrality. First, suppose that F satisfies strong neutrality. That binary independence of irrelevant alternatives is satisfied follows from setting x=z and y=w in the definition of strong neutrality. To show that Pareto indifference is implied, let \(U = \overline{U}\) and y=z=w. Strong neutrality implies that \(xR_{\Upsilon } y\) if and only \(yR_{\Upsilon } y\) whenever U(x)=U(y). Because \(R_{\Upsilon }\) is reflexive, this implies \(xI_{\Upsilon } y\). Now suppose that F satisifies unlimited domain, Pareto indifference and binary independence of irrelevant alternatives. Consider two profiles \(\Upsilon ,\overline{\Upsilon } \in {\user1{\mathcal{D}}}\) and four (not necessarily distinct) alternatives x, y, z, w∈X such that \(U{\left( x \right)} = \overline{U} {\left( z \right)} = u\) and \(U{\left( y \right)} = \overline{U} {\left( w \right)} = v\). By unlimited domain, there exist profiles \(\Upsilon ^{1} ,\Upsilon ^{2} ,\Upsilon ^{3} ,\Upsilon ^{4} \in {\user1{\mathcal{D}}}\) such that U
1(x)=u, U
1(y)=v, U
1(w)=v, U
2(x)=u, U
2(y)=v, U
2(w)=v, U
3(x)=u, U
3(y)=v, U
3(z)=u, U
4(y)=v, U
4(z)=u and U
4(w)=v. By binary independence of irrelevant alternatives,
 . By Pareto indifference, \(yI_{{\Upsilon ^{1} }} w\) and, therefore,
 . Using binary independence of irrelevant alternatives again, we obtain
 . By Pareto indifference, \(wI_{{\Upsilon ^{2} }} y\) and, therefore,
 . By binary independence of irrelevant alternatives,
 . By Pareto indifference, \(xI_{{\Upsilon ^{3} }} z\) and, therfore,
 . By binary independence of irrelevant alternatives,
 . By Pareto indifference, \(yI_{{\Upsilon ^{4} }} w\) and, therefore,
 . Using binary independence of irrelevant alternatives once more, we obtain
 . Combining the above equivalences, we obtain
 and strong neutrality is satisfied. ▪",3

The classical example, born in legal theory, is that three jurors in a court trial disagree on which of the following three propositions are true: the defendant has broken the contract \((p)\); the contract is legally valid \((q)\); the defendant is liable \((r)\). According to a universally accepted legal doctrine, \(r\) (the ‘conclusion’) is true if and only if \(p\) and \(q\) (the two ‘premises’) are both true. So, \(r\) is logically equivalent to \(p\wedge q\). The simplest rule to aggregate the jurors’ judgments—namely propositionwise majority voting—may generate logically inconsistent collective judgments, as Table 1 illustrates. There are of course numerous other possible ‘agendas’, i.e., kinds of interconnected propositions a group might face. Preference aggregation is a special case with propositions of the form ‘\(x\) is better than \(y\)’ (for many alternatives \(x\) and \(y\)), where these propositions are interconnected through standard conditions such as transitivity. In this context, Condorcet’s classical voting paradox about cyclical majority preferences is nothing but another example of inconsistent majority judgments. Starting with List and Pettit’s (2002) seminal paper, a whole series of contributions have explored which judgment aggregation rules can be used, depending on, firstly, the agenda in question, and, secondly, the requirements placed on aggregation, such as anonymity, and of course the consistency of collective judgments. Some theorems generalize Arrow’s Theorem from preference to judgment aggregation (Dietrich and List 2007a; Dokow and Holzman 2010; both build on Nehring and Puppe 2010a and strengthen Wilson 1975). Other theorems have no immediate counterparts in classical social choice theory (e.g., List 2004; Dietrich 2006a, 2010; Nehring and Puppe 2010b; Dietrich and Mongin 2010). It is fair to say that judgment aggregation theory has until recently been dominated by ‘impossibility’ findings, as is evident from the Symposium on Judgment Aggregation in Journal of Economic Theory (List and Polak 2010). The recent conference ‘Judgment aggregation and voting’ in Freudenstadt in 2011 however marks a visible shift of attention towards constructing concrete aggregation rules and finding ‘second best’ solutions in the face of impossibility results. The new proposals range from a first Borda-type aggregation rule (Zwicker 2011) to, among others, new distance-based rules (Duddy and Piggins 2012) and rules which approximate the majority judgments when these are inconsistent (Nehring et al. 2011). The more traditional proposals include premise- and conclusion-based rules (e.g., Kornhauser and Sager 1986; Pettit 2001; List and Pettit 2002; Dietrich 2006a; Dietrich and Mongin 2010), sequential rules (e.g., List 2004; Dietrich and List 2007b), distance-based rules (e.g., Konieczny and Pino-Perez 2002; Pigozzi 2006; Miller and Osherson 2008; Eckert and Klamler 2009; Hartmann et al. 2010; Lang et al. 2011), and quota rules with well-calibrated acceptance thresholds and various degrees of collective rationality (e.g., Dietrich and List 2007b; see also Nehring and Puppe 2010a). The present paper contributes to the theory’s current ‘constructive’ effort by investigating a class of aggregation rules to be called scoring rules. The inspiration comes from classical scoring rules in preference aggregation theory. These rules generate collective preferences which rank each alternative according to the sum-total ‘score’ it receives from the group members, where the ‘score’ could be defined in different ways, leading to different classical scoring rules such as the Borda rule (see Smith 1973; Young 1975; Zwicker 1991, and for abstract generalizations Myerson 1995; Zwicker 2008; Conitzer et al. 2009; Pivato 2011b). In a general judgment aggregation framework, however, there are no ‘alternatives’; so our scoring rules are based on assigning scores to propositions, not alternatives. Nonetheless, our scoring rules are related to classical scoring rules, and generalize them, as will be shown. The paradigm underlying our scoring rules—i.e., the maximization of total score of collective judgments—differs from standard paradigms in judgment aggregation, such as the premise-, conclusion- or distance-based paradigms. Nonetheless, it will turn out that several existing rules can be re-modelled as scoring rules, and can thus be ‘rationalized’ in terms of the maximization of total scores. Of course, the way scores are being assigned to propositions—the ‘scoring’—differs strongly across rules; for instance, the Kemeny rule and the premise-based rule can each be viewed as a scoring rule, but with respect to two very different scorings. This paper explores various plausible scorings. It uncovers the scorings which implicitly underlie several well-known aggregation rules, and suggests other scorings which generate novel aggregation rules. For instance, a particularly natural scoring, to be called reversal scoring, will lead to a new generalization of the Borda rule from preference aggregation to judgment aggregation. The problem of how to generalize the Borda rule has been a long-lasting open question in judgment aggregation theory. Recently, an interesting (so far incomplete) proposal was made by Zwicker (2011). Surprisingly, his and the present Borda generalizations are somewhat different, as detailed below.Footnote 1
 Though large, the class of scoring rules is far from universal: some important aggregation rules fall outside this class (notably the mentioned rule approximating the majority judgments, proposed by Nehring et al. 2011). I will also investigate a natural generalization of scoring rules, to be called set scoring rules, which are based on assigning scores to entire judgment sets rather than single propositions (judgments). Such rules are examples of Zwicker’s (2008) ‘generalized scoring rules’ for an abstract aggregation problem whose inputs and outputs are arbitrary objects rather than judgment sets (see also Myerson 1995; Pivato 2011a).Footnote 2
 After this introduction, Sect. 2 defines the general framework, Sect. 3 analyses various scoring rules, Sect. 4 goes on to analyse several set scoring rules, and Sect. 5 draws some conclusions about where we stand in terms of concrete aggregation procedures.",24

An experiment,October 2014,Fabio Galeotti,Daniel John Zizzo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We present the results of an experiment to test the effect of singling out an individual on trust and trustworthiness. The act of singling out an individual from a group based on his or her socio-economic categories (e.g. gender, race, age, income, political view) is a pervasive phenomenon of economic and social life. It occurs whenever a subject, who has specific attributes that make him or her potentially different from the others, ceases to be an ordinary and usual person, and becomes a distinct one in the eyes of the other people. More precisely, singling out can be defined as an inter-group situation in which one group is a singleton group made up of a single individual- the singled out individual-, whose social identity is perceived as different by a second group that is larger in size. Someone can be singled out because he or she possesses some desirable qualities; therefore, the status of being singled out can be associated with a positive social standing. For instance, in organizational and workplace settings, an employee may be object of social recognition or appraisal for his or her desirable socio-economic characteristics (e.g. age or experience) or because he or she belongs to a privileged group, such as in the case, reported by Heikes (1991), of white-male nurses working in all-female environment. As result, he or she loses the status of ordinary member, and acquires a positive aura of uniqueness in the eyes of his or her colleagues or superiors. A subject can also be singled out by others because he or she possesses undesirable qualities; therefore, the status of being singled out can coincide with a negative social standing. In line with the previous example, an employee may be singled out by his or her colleagues or a superior for reproach or because he or she is disliked within the team or belongs to socially disadvantaged minorities, such as women or racial/ethnic minorities. The literature in social psychology offers several examples of solo or token individuals who have been singled out in the workplace by colleagues or superiors because of their undesirable qualities (e.g. see Kanter 1977; Yoder and Aniakudo 1997; Niemann and Dovidio 1998; DePaulo and Morris 2006). When the status of being singled out is attributable to something undesirable about the socio-economic characteristics of the subject, the latter may also be object of social exclusion, marginalization, stigmatization, negative stereotypes, bullying, or, more generally, negative discrimination (e.g. Heatherton et al. 2000; Abrams et al. 2005). In other words, the status of being singled out can be a precondition for these social mechanisms. While in some cases there may be a consensus among the members of the group on who is the singled out individual, in others the latter is selected by a specific individual, such a manager in an organizational setting:Footnote 1 an agent who has the right and power to enforce the status of being singled out. This paper presents an experiment designed to test specifically the behavioral implications of singling out. We do so in the context of trust games. A trust game is a standard stylized setup used in the economic literature to study trusting behavior and trustworthiness. Economists are aware of the importance that both trust and trustworthiness play in economic interactions, especially with respect to the formation of social capital (e.g., Putnam 2000). In particular, they reduce the costs of transacting (Frank 1988), promote efficiency in markets (Arrow 1974), improve cooperation (Smith et al. 1995) and increase firms’ ability to adapt to complexity and change (Korsgaard et al. 1995). Trust and trustworthiness are also considered to be “at the core of group life” (Hogg et al. 2005, p. 193). In particular, they play a fundamental role in ensuring the stability of a group or a team, and, therefore, are important in organizational and workplace settings. Anything that perturbs the stability of the group or team may affect the way in which the members trust and fulfill each other’s trust. As singling out may have important consequences in terms of group and team cohesion in organizations, it may then also affect trust and trustworthiness. For this reason, the trust game appears to be a natural environment where to test, as a starting point, the economic implications of singling a member out in a group. To test these implications, we artificially induced a status of being singled out in the lab. Under a positive frame, the most preferred match in the experiment is singled out, whereas, under a negative frame, the least preferred match in the experiment is singled out. We controlled for identification effects by varying the extent to which the status of being singled out could be identified by non-singled out subjects. That is, in certain sessions, the singled out individual was identified with a mark (i.e. an asterisk), and, therefore, recognizable by the other subjects, whereas in other sessions the singled out participant was not marked with an asterisk, and, therefore, could not be identified by the other participants. Furthermore, we tested the implications of having a random assignation of such status under a neutral frame. In particular, rather than having the status of being singled out assigned by the participants, it is randomly assigned by the computer and, therefore, is not associated to being the least or most preferred match. We also investigated the effects of singling a member out under a negative frame when one specific individual rather than the whole group is responsible of such decision. To check the robustness of our results against what we refer as the individual characteristics hypothesis, we tested and rejected the possibility that singled out subjects behaved differently because of the individual characteristics that made them singled out. As such, this study provides evidence of the ‘pure’ effect of singling out an individual from a group, controlling for the individual characteristics of the singled out individual. Our key finding is that singling out individuals has a negligible effect on trust and is potentially negative in terms of trustworthiness. More specifically, we find that singled out subjects in the negative framework return considerably less than non-singled out subjects, probably because they do not feel any bond with the other members but anger and resentment for the attribution of a lower status. In contrast, the singled out subjects in the positive framework display a bimodal behavior, returning either more or less, probably depending on whether they perceives themselves as insiders or outsiders. We also find that non-singled out subjects return substantially less to the singled out subject but only when they do not feel responsible of the distinct status of this person. Finally, we find that trustworthiness generally decreases if there is a singled out subject. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the related literature. Section 3 describes the experimental design. Section 4 presents the alternative behavioral conjectures about the implications of singling an individual out. Section 5 reports the main results. Section 6 provides a discussion of the findings and concludes.",3

More precisely, given a set of individuals and a set of alternatives, an effectivity function assigns to each coalition of individuals a collection of subsets of alternatives. Effectivity functions derive from many concepts in game theory and social choice theory: for example game forms, social choice correspondences, simple games. More generally, effectivity functions can be used to describe the distribution of power or rights. For instance, a constitution can be modelled as an effectivity function (Gärdenfors 1981; Peleg 1998): alternatives are social states, and to say that a coalition is effective for a set of alternatives means that this group of individuals is legally entitled to the social state being in the designated set. According to this last interpretation an effectivity function is a centralized concept describing the rights of individuals. This leads directly to the question whether we can find a set of decentralized rules (practical laws) such that individuals and coalitions, by acting according to these rules, obtain the same rights as described by the effectivity function. In more formal terms: can we find a game form which provides all coalitions with the same power as the effectivity function? This question was already answered in Moulin (1983), who showed that any monotonic and superadditive effectivity function can be represented by a game form. An important further question is whether we can find rules (in accordance with the constitution) such that there is a situation in which the society is stable, that is, in some state of equilibrium. Peleg et al. (2002) answered this question by characterizing effectivity functions that have a Nash consistent representation, i.e., a game form representing the effectivity function and having a Nash equilibrium for any profile of preferences of the individuals. See Peleg and Peters (2010) for an extensive treatment of this topic and related issues. An important open question in this area is the following. If we take into account that information may be incomplete—individuals are not sure about the preferences, i.e., types, of other individuals—when is it possible to have a representation of an effectivity function that is Bayesian Nash consistent? d’Aspremont and Peleg (1988) consider ordinal Bayesian incentive compatible representations of committees: they study effectivity functions derived from simple games and their representation by so-called decision schemes, which assign probability distributions over the alternatives, such that there exists a Bayesian incentive compatible Nash equilibrium under incomplete information with private values. Recently, Peleg and Zamir (2014) show that, without additional restrictions except for the standard ones, effectivity functions can be Bayesian Nash consistently represented by generalized decision schemes; their proof of this result uses the uniform core (Abdou and Keiding 1991). The question under which conditions such a representation by a deterministic game form exists, remains open. In the present paper we consider the case of incomplete information with private values: the preference of a type of a player does not depend on the types of the other players. Compared to d’Aspremont and Peleg (1988) and Peleg and Zamir (2014) we impose a considerably stronger requirement: given an effectivity function, when does there exist a representing game form such that, for any information structure (i.e., vector of type sets of the players), there exists an ex post Nash equilibrium for any preference profile, that is, a strategy combination which results in a Nash equilibrium for every realization of the types? On the one hand, this is a very desirable situation, since players do not have to rely on their beliefs about the types of the others, and they do not have to spend time and effort on finding out the types of the other players. Moreover, every ex post equilibrium has the no regret property which means that no player has an incentive to change his action even if he were to be informed of the true types of the other players. These considerations are similar to the ones justifying implementation in ex post Nash equilibrium (e.g., Bergemann and Morris 2008). It is also a first step towards characterizing Bayesian Nash consistent representations, as every ex post Nash equilibrium is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for any vector of beliefs. On the other hand, as can be expected, this requirement turns out to be rather restrictive. Our main result is as follows. An effectivity function (for \(n\) individuals or players) has an ex post Nash consistent representation exactly if there exists an \((n-1)\)-player coalition and a subset \(C\) of alternatives for which this coalition is effective, such that all other \((n-1)\)-player coalitions are effective for all singletons in this set \(C\). The intuition behind this condition is that in equilibrium there is one player restricted to choose his most preferred alternative from \(C\), while all other players are restricted in such a way that they are not able to influence the outcome by unilateral deviation. In the case \(n=2\) this condition is equivalent to at least one of the two players being a so-called singleton player: a singleton player is a player for whom all minimal sets for which this player is effective, are singletons. We also show that, if only one of the players has more than one type, then ex post Nash consistency imposes no additional restrictions compared to Nash consistency (as in Peleg et al. 2002). In the final part of the paper we provide a short discussion on effectivity functions that have no ex post Nash consistent representation, but for which a representation exists if we restrict the number of types—a special case being the mentioned one where only one player has more than one type. Throughout the paper we concentrate on existence of ex post Nash equilibria and leave other possible properties (e.g., Pareto optimality of such equilibria) from consideration. The approach of looking for equilibrium consistent representations of effectivity functions should be distinguished from the approach followed by implementation theory. Suppose we are given a social choice correspondence. In implementation theory one looks for a game form of which, for each profile of preferences, the set of equilibrium outcomes coincides with the set of outcomes assigned by the social choice correspondence. No condition is put on off equilibrium outcomes. In contrast, in an equilibrium consistent representation the outcomes attainable in the game form by individuals and coalitions should coincide with the outcomes attainable via the social choice correspondence or, equivalently, its associated effectivity function. In this sense, requiring equilibrium consistent representation is a strengthening compared to implementation; the weakening is that only existence of an equilibrium outcome is required. Nevertheless, for a given equilibrium consistent representing game form, one can construct a social choice correspondence by assigning all equilibrium outcomes to a given preference profile; then, obviously, this social choice correspondence is implemented by the game form. The literature on implementation theory also deals with implementation in ex post equilibrium. This solution concept is mainly used in situations with interdependent valuations, because of tractability and robustness against informational assumptions. Several authors show that for one-dimensional signals, ex post implementation is possible if the single crossing property is satisfied (Cremer and McLean 1985; Dasgupta and Maskin 2000; Bergemann and Välimäki 2002; Perry and Reny 2002). More recent work deals with ex post equilibria in multidimensional signal settings. Jehiel et al. (2006) show that the only ex post implementable social choice functions in a generic class of environments are constant functions, whereas Bergemann and Morris (2008) provide conditions for full implementation in ex post equilibrium if the genericity requirement fails. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces definitions and notations. In Sect. 3, we present our basic representing game form. This game form is extended and modified in several ways in the rest of the paper. Section 4 analyzes the case of two players, and Sect. 5 generalizes to more than two players.

Pérez-Castrillo and Wettstein (2001) provided a strategic (noncooperative) foundation by introducing a bidding mechanism that implements the Shapley value payoffs as unique subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs. In this paper we explore the effect of introducing discounting in this bidding mechanism. Assuming that after each rejection of the proposal the amount available to be distributed among the remaining players in the next round is discounted by a parameter \(\delta \in [0,1]\), we show that this modification of the mechanism of Pérez-Castrillo and Wettstein (2001) yields the corresponding \(\delta \)-discounted Shapley value as the payoff distribution in every subgame perfect equilibrium of this game.Footnote 1 These solutions are introduced by Joosten (1996) who showed that all of them satisfy the famous Hart and Mas-Colell reduced game consistency [(see Hart and Mas-Colell (1988, 1989)]. This class of solutions contains the Shapley value (for \(\delta =1\)) and equal division solution (for \(\delta =0\)) as extreme cases. Therefore, the solutions characterized by this bidding mechanism make a trade-off between marginalism and egalitarianism, such that the higher (lower) the discount factor the more weight is put on marginalism (egalitarianism). Following Nash (1953), besides this implementation we provide an axiomatization of the discounted Shapley values. Most axiomatic characterizations of the Shapley value use some axiom related to null players (i.e. players whose marginal contribution to any coalition is zero). An axiomatic comparison of the Shapley value and the equal division solution is made by van den Brink (2007) who considers several axiomatizations of the Shapley value and shows that replacing an axiom concerning null players by a similar axiom concerning nullifying players (i.e. players whose presence in a coalition implies the coalition earns zero worth) characterizes the equal division solution. For example, in the original axiomatization of the Shapley value by efficiency, the null player property, symmetry and additivity, replacing the null player property (which states that null players receive a zero payoff) by the nullifying player property (which states that nullifying players receive a zero payoff) characterizes the equal division solution. In the underlying paper we generalize both axioms by introducing a \(\delta \)-reducing player in a game as a player such that any coalition containing this player earns a fraction \(\delta \in [0,1]\) of the worth of that coalition without this player. Then the \(\delta \)-reducing player property states that such a player receives a zero payoff. Clearly, \(\delta =1\) implies that player i’s marginal contributions are all zero, and thus yields the null player property of the Shapley value. On the other hand, \(\delta =0\) implies that the worth of any coalition containing player i is zero, and thus this yields the nullifying player property. It turns out that replacing the null or nullifying player property (in the axiomatizations of the Shapley value, respectively, equal division solution) by this \(\delta \)-reducing player property characterizes the corresponding \(\delta \)-discounted Shapley value. Besides the original axiomatization of Shapley (1953) we also adapt the characterizations of Young (1985) and Chun (1991). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains preliminaries on TU-games and solutions. In Sect. 3 we provide a strategic implementation of the discounted Shapley values. In Sect. 4 we provide axiomatic characterizations. Finally, Sect. 5 contains concluding remarks.",21

Much of the initial scholarly debate focused on what kind of utility specification was most appropriate for characterizing people’s average behavior. The specific motives explored in the literature can be roughly classified into altruistic preferences (Andreoni et al. 2008), distributional preferences (Bolton and Ockenfels 2000; Fehr and Schmidt 1999), and reciprocal preferences (Charness and Rabin 2002; Falk and Fischbacher 2006). Altruistic preferences involve a weight on the others’ payoffs, distributional preferences typically involve a penalty on the distance from some equitable reference point, and reciprocal preferences are conditional on actions by others. Extant studies of people’s pro-social behavior have looked at relatively few decisions by each individual and established models of social preferences have been informed by this kind of aggregate information. However, some of the more recent evidence has shown that individual motivations are quite heterogeneous. This is important from a positive point of view, since aggregate behavior often needs to be understood in terms of the interaction of agents with different kinds of social preferences. To better understand heterogeneity is also important from a normative standpoint. Fairness ideals can be expected to be diverse and to understand public debates on distributive justice one needs to have information about this diversity. As Almas et al. (2010) put it, “most adults believe that differences in individual achievements and efficiency considerations [...] may justify an unequal distribution of income”. But, they disagree on which unequal distributions they consider to be fair. From a normative point of view, understanding the heterogeneity of preferences and views may help to get a better understanding of the sources of these disagreements. Cappelen et al. (2007) analyze how views on fairness ideals depend on individual characteristics, including talent and disposition to effort. Konow (2009) documents the existence of large variance in fairness ideals in a realistic experiment in which the diversity of moral judgments is sensible to the manipulation of information conditions in the laboratory. For both positive and normative reasons it is, therefore, necessary to generate information that directly pertains to individuals’ social preferences. Experiments make it possible to generate rich data sets of this kind and this can yield important advantages in some cases. Some previous studies collect such data sets. Brandts and Schram (2001) study a public good environment in which subjects have to make contribution decisions for 10 different relative prices of a private and public good. This yields a complete ‘contribution function’ for each subject and makes it possible to reject in a simple way the long-lived hypothesis that subjects contribute positive amounts only by mistake. In Johansson-Stenman et al. (2002) subjects are asked to choose between alternative states with different uniform income distributions. Through choices between alternative states they obtain information about participants’ degree of relative risk aversion and the degree of positionality (the concern for relative standing). 
Andreoni and Miller (2002) ask whether experimental subjects’ concern for altruism or fairness can be expressed as a well-behaved preference ordering. They had their subjects make between 8 and 16 dictator-type allocation decisions in which they distributed tokens between themselves and another person. Each of these involved a given endowment of tokens as well as an own payoff from keeping a token and a payoff to the other from giving a token to the other. Of these situations 11 involved a token endowment, a positive value to the decision-maker of keeping each token and a positive value (for the other person) of each of the tokens being passed to him or her. These eleven situations involved five different levels of token endowments and seven different values for the relative price of giving. The other five situations effectively involved budget constraints that sloped up—people could spend tokens on taking tokens away from others—with the aim of finding out about the importance of what the authors call “rational jealousy”. This design makes it possible to obtain a broad picture of behavior and to study the consistency of behavior in their context. Andreoni and Miller (2002) report that a large part of their subjects’ decisions can be represented by three kinds of simple distributional preferences: purely selfish, Leontief and perfect substitutes preferences.Footnote 1
 
Blanco et al. (2011) study the behavior of subjects that play the ultimatum game, the dictator game, a sequential prisoner’s dilemma and a public good game. Their data show that inequality aversion has good predictive power at the aggregate level but performs less well at the individual level. Iriberri and Rey-Biel (2013) ask for actions over sixteen modified dictator games with three possible choices each and elicit beliefs about other subjects’ actions in the same task; their focus is on the correlation between actions and beliefs and the impact of social information. They report that subjects with different interdependent preferences have indeed different beliefs about others’ actions. 
Cappelen et al. (2011) use a multi-stage dictator game where the donation is preceded by a production stage in which dictators had to invest their endowment to obtain a (high or low) return. They obtain information about subjects’ social preferences from a standard experiment with real stakes and self-reported information on fairness ideals coming from surveys. Relative to a base experimental condition (the B-treatment), they prime different fairness rules in their E-treatment and find a persistent heterogeneity of subjects’ ideals across information conditions and experimental methods (with real stakes or using self-reported data). In this work, we attempt to measure the impact both qualitative and quantitative of these three basic factors. First, through a series of different binary choices we elicit whether subjects are willing—and to what extent—to increase or decrease others’ payoffs at different costs to their own payoffs. Second, we study how such decisions depend on whether the decision maker is in an advantageous or disadvantageous position. Third, we study whether these same subjects modify their willingness to sacrifice depending on whether another subject has foregone various types of outside options (reciprocity). In this way, we present a joint analysis of the importance of distributional aspects linked only to payoffs and of reciprocity influences of the kind related to menu-dependence.Footnote 2
 In our experiments, each of our participants has to make numerous sequential pair-wise choices between two alternative states described only by payoffs to himself and to another person. In designing these choice problems we were guided by what previous experimental and modeling studies have identified as some of the basic influences that need to be taken into account when dealing with interdependent motivation. The first of these is that many people care about the payoffs of others in several respects. People may care about the relation of their own payoffs to those of others, about the sum of payoffs to all involved, as well as about other payoff-related aspects. The second lesson that has been learned from previous work is that people may also be influenced by a variety of circumstances surrounding the act of choice that are not directly payoff-relevant. These circumstances may include aspects like the features of foregone payoff distributions, the procedure by which an outcome is reached and the beliefs that people hold about the intentions behind others’ choices. Our design allows us to study the relevance of these different forces at the individual level. We present a regression analysis of behavior based on the individual data. Our results show that reciprocity linked to menu-dependence is never significant in our data. We also find that subjects are influenced by the price of sacrificing money and by whether they choose from a strong or from a weak position. We then use our data to study individual behavior more formally. Previous research has identified several possible specifications of social preferences models.Footnote 3 These different specifications can be nicely embedded in the general model presented in Charness and Rabin (2002). In particular, the model includes a parameter that captures reactions to positive and negative actions. On the basis of this model we use our data for a mixture-of-types model estimation. Our results exhibit considerable heterogeneity of types. We find a large fraction of selfish subjects. We also find that social-welfare maximizers are more frequent than inequity-averse subjects. None of the preference types that emerge involve a significant value of the parameter related to positive or negative actions.",5

Preventative actions, such as destroying a terrorist training ground, benefit all governments that are potential terrorist targets, as the terrorist’s power to inflict damage is reduced, while the costs are borne entirely by the government that initiates the action. Defensive actions such as increased screening at points of entry or reinforcing the perimeter of an embassy may reduce the attractiveness of the defending government, while making other countries relatively more attractive as targets. These tradeoffs are explored theoretically in a series of articles that identify the fundamental externalities associated with preventative and defensive counterterror strategies (Sander 2003; Sandler 2005; Arce and Sandler 2005a, b; Sandler and Siqueira 2006). In a “Nested Prisoner’s Dilemma” framework, Arce and Sandler (2005a) model this choice as a pair of Prisoner’s Dilemma games, combined into a \(3\times 3\) matrix consisting of three policy alternatives: Defense, Prevention, and Take No Action. They use this framework to illustrate the difficulty faced by countries that desire to coordinate on a policy of preventative action. While Prevention is the most efficient choice in the game, each country is tempted to free ride on the others’ investment. With defensive policies, countries capture the benefits of their investment, but impose “costs” (in the sense of increased likelihood of attack) on other countries. The Nash equilibrium of the game is for both countries to invest in defensive actions, an outcome that is doubly inefficient in that it is both Pareto dominated and minimizes the utilitarian sum of the countries involved. Thus countries face a difficult problem in coordinating on effective counterterrorist policies. The incentive structure of the interaction implies that countries acting in their individual self-interest will fail to reach the optimal policy choice, and instead each invests in sub-optimal defensive policies. International organizations have arisen to combat myriad collective action problems. With respect to terrorism, peacekeeping is an activity that is often rationalized as a means of stabilizing areas that may otherwise turn out to be terrorist breeding grounds. The two institutions that carry out the majority of peacekeeping missions—the UN and NATO—are financed by voluntary contributions, making the question of burden sharing for preventative counterterror policies a central one. INTERPOL is another international organization that is voluntarily financed, and its MIND/FIND database for stolen and lost travel documents, for example, has been shown to be cost effective in combating terrorism (Sandler et al. 2011). A promising avenue for testing the effect of alternative policies to enhance counterterror policy coordination is to simulate countries’ choices in the lab. Testing such policies in the field is costly or impossible. The lab provides a kind of wind-tunnel for exploring policy options at a relatively low cost. The impact of the incentive structure of a given policy can be evaluated, and alternatives compared. This is the approach we use in the current paper. The current paper utilizes the experimental environment developed in Arce et al. (2011a, b), which experimentally tests the theoretical predictions of the Nested PD game.Footnote 1 In their experiment, subjects were matched in stable pairs for 20 rounds. In the 21st round subjects were re-matched and the stakes increased by a factor of 10. As is common in experimental studies of repeated standard PD games (Sally 1995), non-equilibrium behavior was clearly evident in early rounds of the 20-round section of the experiment. Initially 55 % of subjects played Prevention, 30 % chose Take No Action (maintained the status quo) and 15 % acted non-cooperatively and selected the Defense strategy, consistent with Nash equilibrium play. By the 20th round, 60 % of the subjects behaved non-cooperatively. In the 21st round, 58 % behaved non-cooperatively and 26 % cooperatively (the remainder chose Take No Action). Hence, while the experimental results are not as dire as theory predicts, the collective action problem remains one that subjects do not easily overcome on their own; hence we consider institution building in the form of cost-sharing rules for preventative counterterror policy. We expand this framework to test the ability of a stylized institution, cost sharing, to alleviate the collective action problem. In the experiment we implement three different levels of cost sharing, while holding the Nash equilibrium of the game constant. Our experimental conditions can be interpreted as different policies enforcing the sharing of the cost of investing in Prevention: this policy diminishes the risk that others will free ride on such a decision. Policies vary in the extent to which players share the cost of choosing Prevention. Cost sharing serves to partially internalize the positive externality associated with Prevention, while keeping the negative externality of choosing Defense constant. We systematically manipulate the intensity of cost sharing in a linear way. The cost of Prevention is not shared at all in the Baseline, one unit is shared in the Low Burden Sharing condition, two units in the Moderate, and three in the High Burden Sharing treatment. We find that cost sharing can be a powerful policy choice, boosting the utilization of the optimal policy, but only when the level of cost sharing is high. Low levels of cost sharing are more symbolic than effective, and have little impact on strategy choices, with more than half of the pairs playing the defensive strategy. But a high level of cost sharing (as in our High Burden Sharing treatment) induces almost around 85 % of the pairs to cooperate,Footnote 2 choosing mutual Prevention. The experimental analysis of cost sharing in Prisoner Dilemma and related games is not new, and can be traced back to Smith (1980) analysis of contract mechanisms. It is far from the goal of this paper to make a complete survey of this particular branch of the extensive literature on cost-sharing mechanisms.Footnote 3 However, the natural reference for our paper is Andreoni and Varian (1999), who analyze a two-stage variant of a PD game in which players are allowed to make side payments. In this setting, the unique sub-game perfect equilibrium is efficient and supported by their experimental test. Charness et al. (2007) extend their analysis to show that side payments can be efficient in PD games when players have the chance of simultaneously choose a binding transfer in a preliminary stage. The compensation mechanism in Charness et al. (2007) transforms the PD into a coordination game in which mutual defection can still be an equilibrium in some treatments. However, as in Andreoni and Varian (1999), most transfers observed in the experiment were consistent with a SPE involving mutual cooperation, suggesting that cooperation gains are explained by equilibrium play.Footnote 4
 Our experimental test of different cost sharing mechanism differs from previous papers in three main respects. First, the degree of cost sharing is not selected by subjects, but rather exogenously imposed. We consider this to be the right approach when trying to identify the behavioral implications of different institutions. Second, all treatments share the same inefficient Nash equilibrium prediction: mutual Defense. Rational, selfish players should not change their behavior relative to our control treatment with no cost sharing. We believe this feature provides a strong test for the emergence of cooperation under different cost sharing rules. Our last contribution has to do with the double-externality game and the asymmetric nature of our cost sharing mechanism. While Prevention generates a positive externality, Defense generates a negative one. Cost sharing is implemented only for the Prevention strategy. This asymmetry is of particular interest in the domain of counterterrorism policies and has never been explored in the laboratory. This paper contributes to the literature on conflict resolution. Our results strongly suggest that the effectiveness of different policies is heavily mediated by behavioral biases, hard to anticipate in a theoretical model, but easy to estimate in the lab. Our between-subjects experimental design tests different cost sharing policies in a simple decision environment. Subjects do react to the introduction of a cost sharing mechanism, even when all games share the same theoretical prediction. However, they respond only when the level of cost sharing is high. The significant increase in the utilization of the optimal strategy is stable across the 20 repetitions of the original game, and observed again in one last round in which the stakes are much higher and participants are randomly re-matched. In this sense, this paper extends cost sharing to a new environment, and shows the necessity of a better understanding of how different institutions solve conflict by inducing more out-of-equilibrium cooperative play. Finally, it illustrates the power of the lab in exploring policy alternatives. Our work contributes to the growing experimental literature on terrorism and counterterrorism policy (e.g., Cadigan and Schmitt 2010; Colombier et al. 2011; Arce et al. 2011a provide a survey.) The lab is increasingly being utilized to examine questions in this area that are difficult to address using observational or survey data, or theory alone. We return to this discussion in the conclusion. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section we present the Nested PD game used in our experiment. Section 3 presents the experimental design, Sect. 4 presents our hypothesis, and Sect. 5 procedures. Section 6 analyzes the results and the last section concludes.",3

As we discuss below, these shares are closely related to a celebrated result in graph theory, the Gallai–Edmonds (GE hereafter) Structure Theorem. Although the recurrent appearance of this theorem in different bargaining contexts is intriguing and hints at a deeper connection between the economic power of player-nodes and their classification in the GE partition, a specific bargaining framework may lie behind this connection. Particularly, the examination of some proposed non-cooperative mechanisms reveals that they are (implicitly) centralized and, hence, conducive to outcomes that maximize the number of trades. As the GE theorem characterizes the structure of maximum matchings in a graph, its connection to the outcome of a centralized bargaining game may appear unsurprising. However, we show that some recently proposed and completely decentralized protocols lead also to equilibrium payoffs that reflect the GE partition. Furthermore, we show that several cooperative solution concepts, which are driven by the competition among players and coalitions, lead to results that confirm the essential importance of the Structure Theorem. Given its pervasiveness in a rich variety of bargaining environments, we believe that the Structure Theorem should take its rightful place as a fundamental result at the intersection of graph and game theory.",2

Jean-Jacques Herings,Harold Houba,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Decisions on collective choice problems are often taken by means of majority voting, and the analysis of majority voting is therefore an important topic in political economy. When preferences are such that some alternative beats every other feasible alternative in a pairwise vote, i.e. there is a Condorcet winner, then this will be the outcome reached for a huge variety of games that capture the underlying institution. Such would be the case for instance in models with real-time agenda setting and fixed defaults as in Banks and Duggan (2000), in models with evolving defaults as studied in Bernheim et al. (2006), as well as in the more traditional social choice approach. Unfortunately, Condorcet winners may not exist and this gives rise to the Condorcet paradox in which any alternative can be reached from any other by a sequence of alternatives, where each alternative in the sequence beats the previous one by a pairwise majority vote as has been demonstrated in McKelvey (1976, 1979). It has been shown in the literature that the occurrence of the Condorcet paradox is not an artifact. Work by Plott (1967), Rubinstein (1979), Schofield (1983), Cox (1984), and Breton (1987) shows that this paradox occurs generically. The lack of Condorcet winners is also a frequently observed empirical phenomenon. Balinski and Laraki (2010) provide a detailed documentation of the occurrence of the Condorcet paradox in the 1976 Cabernet-Sauvignon wine tasting in Paris, the 1994 general election of the Danish Folketing, and the 2007 French presidential election. Roessler et al. (2013) explain the underdevelopment of the Roman metro system as a consequence of a Condorcet cycle in the majority preferences over building a metro, preserving antiquities, and not digging. In its most simple form the paradox features three players, three alternatives, and players’ preferences such that a pairwise vote over the alternatives results in a Condorcet cycle: one pair of players prefers the second alternative to the third alternative, another pair of players prefers the first alternative to the second alternative, and a third pair of players prefers the third alternative to the first alternative. Whether and how players reach an agreement in this case is an open issue. It is the main research question addressed in this paper. We take the strategic bargaining approach to analyze the Condorcet paradox, an approach that is advocated in Baron and Ferejohn (1989) and Banks and Duggan (2000) to study collective decision problems and that extends the seminal work on bargaining by Rubinstein (1982) and Binmore (1987). Such an approach makes explicit how alternatives that are up for voting are selected and how players vote on alternatives, both on and off the equilibrium path. Our analysis complements the one of Baron and Ferejohn (1989), who use this bargaining protocol to examine the collective decision problem of dividing a surplus, or the more general framework of coalitional bargaining in Chatterjee et al. (1993), which is the relevant case when the players can make arbitrary side-payments and have utility functions that are linear in the side-payment received. In every bargaining round, exogenous and positive recognition probabilities select one player who has the right to propose. This recognized player either proposes one of the three alternatives or gives up the right to propose in which case the bargaining proceeds to the next round. In the former case, the other players publicly vote in a sequential order. Majority voting among three players implies that one vote in favor suffices for acceptance, after which the alternative will be implemented, and players receive their utility. Otherwise, no alternative is implemented and we proceed to the next round where random selection determines the next proposer. Perpetual disagreement leads to a utility of zero for every player. We are interested in the case where bargaining occurs relatively fast, so where players do not heavily discount the future. To analyze this case, we derive equilibria for the limit case where players do not discount the future at all. We characterize the set of stationary subgame perfect equilibria (SSPE). A subgame perfect equilibrium is said to be stationary if the strategy of a player is the same whenever the player faces the same continuation game. In identifying identical continuation games, we follow the approach suggested in Maskin and Tirole (2001) for determining the notion of a stationary strategy. For a foundation of stationary equilibria, we refer to Bhaskar et al. (2013). When a player proposes his middle or worst alternative, it will be accepted for sure by the player for whom this is the best alternative. Since proposing his middle alternative strictly dominates proposing his worst alternative, a player will never propose his worst alternative in an SSPE, and the SSPE utility of a player conditional on being the proposer weakly exceeds the utility of his middle alternative. When a player proposes his best alternative, it may or it may not be accepted by the player for whom this is the middle alternative, and it will be rejected by the player for whom this is the worst alternative. A proposing player thereby effectively faces a trade-off between getting the utility of his middle alternative for sure and proposing his best alternative, which may result in a rejection and thereby ultimately in the continuation probability distribution on alternatives. We show that the continuation utility of a player is at most equal to the utility of his middle alternative, from which it follows that there is an advantage to propose. This implies that, except for degenerate cases, a player is never willing to give up his right to propose. Similarly, a player responding to a proposal consisting of his middle alternative may accept it, thereby securing the utility of his middle alternative, or may reject it, ultimately leading to the continuation probability distribution on all the alternatives. We define an equilibrium type by the number of players that propose their best alternative for sure, as well as the number of players that accept their middle alternative for sure. We show that across all parameter values seven equilibrium types are possible, three of which occur for a degenerate set of parameter values only, leaving four generic equilibrium types. Our main results are as follows. 
Existence We derive a very simple condition that is necessary and sufficient for the existence of an SSPE in mixed strategy profiles. To express this condition, we define a player’s risk coefficient as the ratio of the utility difference between his best and middle alternative to the utility difference between his middle and worst alternative. The risk coefficient of a player is less than or equal to one if and only if the player prefers his middle alternative to the fair lottery over his best and worst alternative. Risk coefficients are equal to a particular transformation of the risk limit of Zeuthen (1930) and Harsanyi (1977). The condition for existence states that the geometric mean of the players’ risk coefficients should be less than or equal to one. As a side result, we also identify the smaller subclass of preferences for which pure strategy SSPEs exist. 
Generic uniqueness For generic parameter values, SSPE utilities are unique, though in degenerate cases multiple SSPE giving rise to different utilities may co-exist. 
Delay depends crucially on the division of bargaining power In bargaining models a suitable way to express bargaining power is by the choice of recognition probabilities, where more bargaining power corresponds to a higher recognition probability. The division of bargaining power is a key factor to explain expected bargaining delay. For each specification of the agents’ utility functions it is possible to divide bargaining power in such a way that no delay occurs at all. At the same time, when almost all the bargaining power goes to a single agent, expected delay goes to infinity. 
Stochastic cycles Infinite cycles occur according to the logic of the Condorcet paradox by assumption. However, within a cooperative game theoretic setting, Chwe (1994) argues that cycles cannot occur when players are farsighted. We study SSPE cycles in the sense of whether there is a positive probability that an equilibrium path can result in which all three alternatives have been proposed and rejected before some alternative is accepted. Generically, such SSPE cycles do not occur, though SSPE cycles are possible in degenerate cases. 
Higher recognition probabilities may lead to a worse bargaining position We investigate the comparative statics on outcome probabilities induced by changes in the recognition probabilities in our discrete choice model featuring the Condorcet paradox. We consider the case where an increase in the recognition probability of a player leads to a proportional decrease in the recognition probability of the other two players. We say that a player’s bargaining position improves if the probability of receiving his best alternative increases and the probability of receiving his worst alternative decreases. Restricting attention to the generic parameter values for which there is a unique SSPE, we find that increasing a player’s recognition probability either improves his bargaining position, or has no effect at all, or worsens his bargaining position. 
Lower risk coefficients lead to a weakly improved bargaining position We investigate the comparative statics on outcome probabilities induced by changes in the risk coefficients. Restricting attention to the generic parameter values for which there is a unique SSPE, we find that decreasing a player’s risk coefficient either has no effect at all or leads to a higher probability of attaining his best alternative and a lower probability of attaining his worst alternative, so improves the player’s bargaining position. Since our equilibria will be described as solutions to a finite number of equations in the same number of unknowns, for generic values of our parameters, one can apply the implicit function theorem to derive equilibria nearby the SSPE with discount factor equal to one as a function of the discount factor. It follows that results regarding comparative statics of equilibria carry over to discount factors close to one. SSPE existence is not an issue for values of the discount factor below one. In the presence of discounting, equilibrium existence follows from standard results on equilibrium existence in stochastic games, see Fink (1964), Takahashi (1964), and Sobel (1971). For this class of games, Haller and Lagunoff (2000) show that the set of stationary equilibria is generically finite. Herings and Peeters (2004) show that generically there is an odd number of stationary equilibria. For parameter values where the geometric mean of the players’ risk coefficients is less than or equal to one, consider a sequence of discount factors tending to one from below. Then there is a corresponding sequence of SSPEs converging to the equilibrium when the discount factor is equal to one, which implies that the probability of reaching an agreement in a given bargaining round is bounded away from zero when the discount factor tends to one. On the other hand, for parameter values where the geometric mean of the players’ risk coefficients is above one, there is no such sequence of SSPEs, and the probability of reaching an agreement in a given bargaining round tends to zero when the discount factor tends to one. Herings and Houba (2015) provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between SSPEs for high discount factors and the limit equilibrium. Our properties regarding the existence of equilibrium and the occurrence of delay in an SSPE depend also crucially on our assumption that collective decision making concerns the choice out of a finite set of alternatives. In the case studied by Baron and Ferejohn (1989), the collective decision problem of dividing a surplus of size one and discount factors below one, there is essentially a unique SSPE and this equilibrium does not involve delay as has been shown by Eraslan (2002) and Eraslan and McLennan (2013). Banks and Duggan (2000) generalize the set-up of Baron and Ferejohn (1989) in several directions, and study collective decision making on a non-empty, compact and convex set of alternatives. They also include an analysis of the case where all discount factors are equal to one. The condition of limited shared weak preferences (LWSP) says that if an alternative distinct from some given alternative is weakly preferred to the given alternative by all members of an arbitrary coalition, then it can be approximated by alternatives that all members of the coalition strictly prefer to the given alternative. The model of Baron and Ferejohn (1989) satisfies LWSP. Banks and Duggan (2000) show that LWSP is sufficient for the existence of an SSPE without delay in the case with a non-empty, compact and convex set of alternatives, even when all discount factors are equal to one. Apart from offering insights in collective choice problems, our model also applies to coalition and network formation, and thereby to marriage and roommate problems. Proposing an alternative corresponds to proposing a coalition in a coalition formation context and to proposing a link in a network formation model. Bloch (1996) studies a sequential game of coalition formation when the division of the coalitional surplus is fixed and payoffs are defined relative to the whole coalition structure. Bloch (1996) shows for the rejector-proposes protocol introduced in Selten (1981) that core stable coalition structures can be attained as a stationary subgame perfect equilibrium of the game, but that stationary subgame perfect equilibria in pure strategies may fail to exist when the condition of core stability is violated. When coalitional externalities are absent, one obtains the class of hedonic games studied in Bloch and Diamantoudi (2011). They note that, in roommate problems with odd top rings, equilibria in pure strategies do not exist. When interpreted as a game of coalition formation, our model allows for three non-trivial coalition structures to form, and the Condorcet cycle in our model is equivalent to the absence of a core stable coalition structure and the presence of an odd top ring. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the bargaining model. Section 3 analyzes the case where all players are symmetric. Section 4 introduces the notion of SSPE and characterizes the set of SSPEs as the solutions to a specific system of equations. In that section, we also derive some of the general properties and reduce the complexity of the problem at hand. Then, Sect. 5 analyzes this system by summarizing the various equilibrium types discussed before. The details of the calculations are relegated to Appendix A. All the other proofs can be found in Appendix B. Section 6 combines all the results of Sect. 5 and studies the questions of SSPE existence and uniqueness. Section 7 analyzes the potential for delay and cycles and Sect. 8 the comparative statics on outcome probability vectors induced by changes in recognition probabilities and risk coefficients. Section 9 concludes.",11

Samsura,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"We study a variation of stable sets for abstract decision problems. An abstract decision problem is represented by a pair (X, R), where X is a set of alternatives and R is a dominance relation on X. Here, we read xRy as x dominates y for any x, y belonging to X. Moreover, we limit our discussion to a nonempty finite X and asymmetric R. The concept of stable set is offered in Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) and interpreted in terms of accepted standards of behaviour based on two stability conditions. A subset V of X is called a stable set of (X, R) if it possesses two properties: (i) no alternative in V is dominated by another alternative in V(called internal stability); (ii) any alternative outside V is dominated by some alternative inside V(called external stability). However, these two stabilities fail to guarantee the existence of stable sets for all abstract decision problems. For instance, stable set will not exist in case of \(x_{1}Rx_{2},x_{2}Rx_{3},\ldots ,x_{6-1}Rx_{7},x_{7}Rx_{1}\). As for the existence of stable sets, see Lucas (1992) for an excellent review of the state of knowledge at that time. To solve the existence problem of stable sets, several generalizations and modifications of the notion of stable sets have been proposed in the literature. These extensions can be roughly divided into two categories. In the first category, the focus is on redefining dominance relation. Examples are generalized stable sets in Van Deemen (1991) and socially stable sets in Delver and Monsuur (2001). As for generalized stable sets, both internal stability and external stability are defined in terms of the transitive closure of R while as for socially stable sets, internal stability is defined by the asymmetric part of transitive closure of R with the restriction on this solution, but external stability is defined by R. The focus of the second category is on the reconstruction of criteria of stabilities. Examples are absorbing set in Kalai et al. (1976) and generalized optimal choice set in Schwartz (1986), admissible set in Kalai and Schmeidler (1977), and m-stable set in Peris and Subiza (2013). All these modifications in this category satisfy a weakened internal stabilityFootnote 1 and an alternative notion of external stability.Footnote 2 The relations between all these generalizations are summarized in Inarra et al. (2005), Nicolas (2009) and Peris and Subiza (2013). Here, we approach stable sets of abstract decision problems by introducing a new dominance relation (denoted by \(R^{\omega }\)) that is an extension of R and a modification of the transitive closure of R. The motivation for this is that R is so strong that stable sets defined by it may not exist in some circumstances while the transitive closure of R is so weak that a generalized stable set defined by it disagrees with stable set even if R is acyclic.Footnote 3 With \(R^{\omega }\), we revisit the notion of stable sets and get an extension of stable sets that we call extended stable sets. It will be verified that the solution of extended stable sets not only solves every abstract decision problem, but also exactly equals to the solution of stable sets when R is acyclic. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall some basic notations and definitions concerning abstract decision problems and represent the concepts of stable set and of generalized stable set. In Sect. 3, we first offer an extended dominance relation \(R^{w}\), then compare it with R and the transitive closure of R. Subsequently, the concept of extended stable sets and the technique of contraction are introduced. Sects. 4 and 5 are respectively devoted to the characteristics of extended stable sets and their relations with stable sets and generalized stable sets. We give a short concluding remark and directions for further research in Sect. 6.",2

Take kidney allocation problems as an example. One difficulty with mechanisms that match donors to recipients is that doctors are reluctant to state complete preferences over kidneys. However, the same doctors do not seem to have any problem choosing the “best” kidney for a particular patient from a given set. The limited resources available to test whether a kidney is a good match might drive this apparent contradiction.Footnote 1 Alternatively, consider the allocation of elementary school slots. The choices of a family in which the mother strategically whittles down the options before the father picks a school are only rationalizable if the parents’ preferences are aligned.Footnote 2 As a third example consider the choice of a medical residency program. To reduce the complexity of the choice-problem a med-school graduate might use a sequence of incomplete rankings to eliminate all but a few alternatives which she then considers in detail.Footnote 3
 Is the Pareto optimality of matching mechanisms robust to the introduction of boundedly rational behavior? To answer this question, I consider Papai’s (2000) hierarchical exchange mechanisms, which comprise many theoretically and practically relevant matching mechanisms.Footnote 4 I derive two different preference-relations from choice functions. An agent lightly prefers x to y if he chooses x from some set that also contains y; he solidly prefers x to y if he never chooses y when x is also available. While the agents’ light preferences imply a restrictive notion of Pareto optimality, their solid preferences imply a permissive notion of Pareto optimality. In line with standard matching theory I find that any Pareto optimum that satisfies the restrictive notion can be obtained as the outcome of any fixed hierarchical exchange mechanism for some initial endowment and that any outcome of hierarchical exchange satisfies the permissive notion of Pareto optimality. In contrast to standard matching theory I find that the set of outcomes of hierarchical exchange is strictly nested between the two Pareto sets and that different hierarchical exchange mechanisms cover different sets of outcomes. Agents do not have to stray far from rational behavior for these two results two hold; in fact I show that minimal deviations from rational behavior suffice.",2

(2016) and Thomson (2016)]. A particularly challenging issue is the fair allocation of indivisible items, which comes up in many real world situations such as divorce settlements, the allocation of courses to students, etc. To evaluate allocation procedures, many intuitive fairness criteria, such as envy-freeness, equitability or proportionality have been used. In the case of divisible items and cardinal utilities, those criteria can be rather easily applied and well known results [e.g., Steinhaus (1948)] show that an envy-free and equitable division of a cake always exists [see also Brams and Taylor (1996)]. In contrast, when we are concerned with indivisible items, even the satisfaction of one of the most basic fairness criterion, proportionality, which requires each of \({n}\) agents to receive at least one \({n}\)th of her value of the whole set of items, might be out of reach. The simple example of dividing one single and indivisible item among two agents easily shows the problem. Different paths of tackling the fair division problem of allocating indivisible items have been taken. Herreiner and Puppe (2002) assume the agents to rank all possible subsets of items and follow a maximin approach, i.e., try to find an allocation of all items to the agents that maximizes the minimum rank of the assigned sets in the preferences of the agents. This approach, however, has two drawbacks. First, the elicitation of such preferences might be an impossible task for the agents, already with a few items (10 items, e.g., lead to the task of ranking more than 1000 sets) and, second, finding the maximin allocation is computationally difficult. To overcome the problem of ranking thousands of sets, many papers only use value information about the single items, mostly incorporating an additivity assumption. This means that the value of any set of items is determined by the sum of the values of the items it contains and therefore no dependencies between items are considered [see, e.g., Brams and Taylor (2000), Bouveret and Lang (2011) and Baumeister et al. (2013)]. Even less information is used when the allocation is based purely on ordinal preference information, e.g., as in Brams et al. (2014) or Aziz et al. (2014). They devise procedures satisfying certain fairness criteria in case a fair allocation exists. In this limited informational framework certain fairness criteria, however, have to be appropriately adapted, sometimes requiring the restriction to situations where the number of items is a multiple of the number of agents or restricting the setting to two agents only. Probably the most simple approach from an informational perspective is based on picking sequences [see Brams and King (2005) and Bouveret and Lang (2011)] in which the agents pick items according to some pre-defined order.Footnote 1 Finally, Budish (2011) translates the ”I cut you choose” procedure from the cake-cutting literature to the indivisible items setting and focuses on what he calls maximin shares, i.e., the minimal share that an agent would receive if she was to divide the items into \({n}\) piles and being the last to pick her pile. This approach was used by Procaccia and Wang (2014) who showed that there is always an allocation that guarantees an agent 2 / 3 of her maximin share. In the cake-cutting setting, the notion of maximin share is equivalent to the notion of proportionality. This is not the case when we are concerned with the allocation of indivisible items, where proportionality is the stronger property. A general analysis of the differences in various fairness properties for the case of additive preferences has been undertaken by Bouveret and Lemaître (2014), providing a whole scale for fairness properties. In this paper we focus on the property of proportionality when agents are assumed to have ordinal preferences over a given set of items. The positional information from the ordinal preferences in addition with an additivity assumption will then be used to determine preferences over sets of items. In this setting we show, by using particular picking sequences, that proportionality will—under certain assumptions—be achieved and checking for the existence of such an allocation is computationally easy. To be able to discuss the value of sets of items, we assign Borda scores to the single items determined from positional information in the agents’ preferences. Although its origins stem from voting theory, in which it is widely discussed and analyzed [see Saari (1995)], Borda scores are also used as Borda utilities in welfare economics [see, e.g., Fleurbaey and Hammond (2004)]. The Borda rule—in case of \({k}\) items—assigns \({k}-1\) points to an agent’s top ranked item, \({k}-2\) points to her second ranked item, and so forth, down to zero points for her lowest ranked item. Hence, since we assume additivity, the value of a set of items depends directly on the positions in which the items are ranked by the agent [see, e.g., Brams et al. (2001)].Footnote 2 This seems to be a reasonable approach in case no other than ordinal information is available. Moreover, it could be seen as satisfying an important idea of ordinality, namely that the difference between any two neighboring items in the ranking is identical. Actually, as in addition we assume balanced allocations, i.e., every agent receives the same number of items [and therefore the number of items is a multiple of the number of agents as, e.g., in Brams et al. (2014)], any affine transformation of the Borda scores can be used. As long as the difference between neighboring items remains identical our results do not change. Hence the results are robust for a whole class of scoring rules applied to this setting. Finally, we assume the agents to behave sincerely, i.e., we are not concerned with strategic behaviour of any kind. The paper is structured as follows: The next section introduces the general framework. Section 3 discusses the general case in which the number of agents is \({n}\ge 2\). This is followed by certain specific results on the two agents case. Section 5 concludes the paper.",6

Each agent receives a (possibly empty) set of objects and, possibly, pays money for the set. He has a preference relation over the set of pairs consisting of a set of objects and a payment. An allocation specifies how the objects are allocated and how much each agent pays. An (allocation) rule is a mapping from a class of admissible preference profiles, which we call a “domain,” to the set of allocations. An allocation is efficient if, without reducing the total payment, no other allocation makes all agents at least as well off and at least one agent better off. A rule is efficient if it always selects an efficient allocation. A rule is strategy-proof if, for each agent, it is a weakly dominant strategy to report his true preferences. We investigate the existence of efficient and strategy-proof rules. Our model can be viewed as a multi-object auction model. Much of the literature on auction theory assumes preferences to be “quasi-linear.” This means that the valuations over sets of objects are not affected by payment level. On the quasi-linear domain, the so-called “VCG rules” (Vickrey 1961; Clarke 1971; Groves 1973) are efficient and strategy-proof, and they are the only rules satisfying these properties (Holmström 1979). As Marshall (1920) demonstrates, preferences are approximately quasi-linear if payments are sufficiently low. However, in important applications of auction theory such as spectrum license allocation, house allocation, etc., prices are often equal to or exceed agents’ annual revenues. Excessive payments for objects may impair an agent’s ability to purchase complements for an effective use of the objects, and thus may influence the benefit the agent derives from the objects. Another reason why preferences may not be quasi-linear is that an agent may need a loan to be able to pay high prices, and typically financial costs are nonlinear in borrowing.Footnote 1
\(^{\text {,}}\)
Footnote 2
 Another common assumption is the “unit-demand” property.Footnote 3 It says that given a payment level, for each set of objects, the most preferred one in the set is at least as good as the set itself. For unit-demand preferences, there exists the minimum Walrasian equilibrium price, which is lower than any other Walrasian equilibrium price. Thus, on the “unit-demand domain,” minimum price Walrasian (MPW) rules are well-defined. A minimum price Walrasian (MPW) rule always selects an allocation associated with the minimum price Walrasian equilibria for each preference profile. The MPW rules are strategy-proof on the unit-demand domain (Demange and Gale 1985). It is straightforward to see that the MPW rules satisfy the following additional two properties: One is individual rationality, which says that each agent finds his assignment at least as desirable as getting no object and paying nothing. The other is no subsidy for losers, which says that the payment of an agent who receives no object is nonnegative. On the unit-demand domain, when there are more agents than objects, the MPW rules are the only rules satisfying efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy for losers (Morimoto and Serizawa 2015).Footnote 4
 Although the unit-demand assumption is suitable in some important cases such as house allocation, etc., in many other cases, some agents may well wish to receive more than one object, and indeed, many authors have analyzed such situations.Footnote 5
 Now, a natural question arises. On a domain that is neither quasi-linear nor unit-demand, do efficient and strategy-proof rules exist? This is the question we address. To state our result, we need an additional property of preferences. A preference relation satisfies the multi-demand property if given a payment level, when an agent receives an object, receiving some additional object(s) makes him better off. We show that when there are more agents than objects, on any domain that contains enough variety of unit-demand preferences and at least one multi-demand preference relation, no rule satisfies efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy for losers. In most impossibility results in the literature on strategy-proofness, the incompatibility of a list of properties of rules is established on a fixed domain.Footnote 6 On the other hand, our result is more general in the sense that the incompatibility of our properties holds on any domain containing enough variety of unit-demand preferences and some multi-demand preferences. This article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the model and basic definitions. In Sect. 3, we introduce the unit-demand model and the richness condition. In Sect. 4, we define the minimum price Walrasian rule. In Sect. 5, we state our result and show the sketch of the proof. Sect. 6 concludes. All the proofs appear in the Appendix.",15

There are a single agent and a principal. The agent holds private information t from some set T. We call t the type of the agent, and T the type set. Depending on the agent’s type the principal wants to select an allocation, or take an action, a from some set A. We call the function \(f : T \rightarrow A\) which determines this selection the allocation rule. We allow for monetary transfers given by a payment function \(p : T \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\) which the principal uses in order to orchestrate incentives. The agent has cardinal preferences for allocations parameterized by his type, given by a valuation function
\(v: A \times T \rightarrow \mathbb {R}\), and quasi-linear utility for allocations and payments. We will call the triple (T, A, v) an environment. Such environments occur as building blocks in numerous applications in the theory of incentives. In particular they have been studied in the context of mechanism design. We assume that the agent and the principal interact by a revelation mechanism in which the agent announces a type t, which may be different from his true type s, and the principal allocates f(t) and makes transfer p(t), yielding utility \(v(f(t),s) + p(t)\) for the agent. We call f
implementable if there exists a p that makes truthful reports of the agent a weakly dominant strategy, that is, for all s, t in T: Central questions in the theory of incentives are (1) a characterization of all implementable allocation rules f, (2) ways to construct payments p, and (3) conditions on when p is unique up to a constant. The latter property is called revenue equivalence due to its applications in auctions. In this paper we provide answers to these questions for the case when T is a convex subset of \(\mathbb {R}^d\). Our first result shows that an allocation rule is implementable if and only if it is implementable on every 2-dimensional subset of T. Let us call a rule f line-implementable if it is implementable when restricted to any line-segment on T, and locally implementable if for every type t there exists some open neighborhood of t on which it is implementable. Our second result states for the same setting as above that a rule is implementable if and only if it is locally implementable and line implementable. Both results do not require any assumptions on the valuation functions v or the cardinality of A. We only need convexity of T and that the allocation rule in question, if line-implementable, satisfies revenue equivalence on lines. We then restrict to valuation functions that are continuous in types. For such settings, we strengthen the second result by showing that an allocation rule with a finite range is implementable if and only if it is line implementable. The last result generalizes a well-known theorem by Saks and Yu (2005), and yields as well a new, very easy proof of the original result. All results are achieved by using directed graphs whose node sets consist of the set of types, and which have arcs between any two types s and t with length equal to value differences (more precisely, the length of arc (s, t) equals the value difference for the outcome at t if an agent is of type t versus of type s). Non-existence of cycles with negative lengths, called cycle monotonicity determines whether a rule is implementable, in which case shortest paths lengths yield incentive compatible payments. Also, it is a property on path lengths that determines whether a rule satisfies revenue equivalence. This approach goes back to Rochet (1987). It has been put into graph theoretic terms by Gui et al. (2004) and Heydenreich et al. (2009), and fully refined in the monograph of Vohra (2011). Non-existence of negative cycles of two nodes, called 2-cycle monotonicity is a direct generalization of monotonicity of allocation rules in single-item auctions. This triggered a serious of results showing that for particular multi-dimensional environments 2-cycle monotonicity implies cycle-monotonicity. All these results require v to be linear in T, in which case 2-cycle monotonicity coincides with line-implementability. Our results show that replacing 2-cycle monotonicity by line-implementability provides the right means to extend these results beyond the case of linear valuations. By way of an example we show that line-implementability is a strictly stronger condition than 2-cycle monotonicity. The definition of an environment used here assumes a single agent, while mechanism design deals typically with more than one agent. This is not limiting the applicability of our results as our definition can be used to grasp the perspective of each individual agent in a mechanism design context. For example, if we are interested in dominant strategy implementable allocation rules f, we get an environment for each select agent and for each possible type report of all other agents. The allocation rule describes the influence of the selected agent’s type reports, given the reports of other agents. Similar does the payment rule determine his payment for outcomes, given the report of the other agents. If we are interested in Bayesian Nash Implementation, the allocation rule maps types of a selected agent to a distribution of outcomes, induced by the distribution of truthful type reports of other agents. 
Related work Characterizing settings where 2-cycle monotonicity is sufficient for cycle monotonicity has been a prominent topic in mechanism design (Archer and Kleinberg 2014; Ashlagi et al. 2010; Bikhchandani et al. 2006; Carbajal and Müller 2015; Mishra et al. 2013; Saks and Yu 2005). Common to this literature is a representation of an environment that differs from ours. We shall call it a domain representation, as opposed to our parameter representation. A domain representation associates every type with a function \(\tau \), mapping outcomes to values. A domain is a set of such functions. Both representations are closely linked since domains can be considered as type sets in parameter representations with \(v(\tau ,a) = \tau (a)\), implying that v is in fact a linear function in types. Vice versa, parameter representations induce a domain \(\{v(.,t)\ |\ t \in T\}\). However, convex sets of types in parameter representations do not necessarily induce convex domains. In fact, our results strictly extend work on domain representations whenever the induced domain representation is not convex. We provide an example in Sect. 4. Also, the type set T in a parameter representation might be finite-dimensional while A is infinite, in which case the previous literature is silent as well. For finite A, a parametrization by types may allow for a low-dimensional compact representation of private information, contrary to a high-dimensional corresponding domain. Think for example of additive valuations in multi-item auctions, where a type represents a value for each of the m items, allowing for types of dimension m, while the corresponding domain has dimension \(2^{m}-1\). Within the framework of parameter representations, a different strand of mechanism design literature deals with explicit representations of payments in terms of path integrals of a particular vector field, yielding generalizations of the Mirrlees representation of indirect utility (Mirrlees 1971). For valuation functions that are differentiable in types Milgrom and Segal (2002) show that such representations follow from the envelope theorem. Krishna and Maenner (2001) prove a similar representation to hold for convex valuation functions. Mirrlees’ representation can as well be used for characterizing implementable allocation rules. For example, Jehiel et al. (1999) and Jehiel and Moldovanu (2001) derive characterizations for auction environments with linear valuation functions. They show that existence and path-independence of certain integrals provides necessary and sufficient conditions for implementation. This approach has been simplified by Archer and Kleinberg (2014). They show that for convex type set T and linear valuation functions monotonicity on line-segments and path-independence of path-integrals along the border of triangles are sufficient for implementability. Furthermore, they show that any rule that is locally implementable, is implementable on all of T. Berger et al. (2009) extend the results of Archer and Kleinberg (2014) to convex valuation functions. We show that neither linearity nor convexity of valuation functions is needed to yield such characterizations, if one replaces the Mirrless representation of indirect utility by distances along line-segments in directed graphs. All what is needed is revenue equivalence on lines and convexity of the type set. Thereby, we significantly extend the approach by Archer and Kleinberg (2014) and Berger et al. (2009). A different generalization of the characterization literature based on Mirrlees representations has been proposed by Carbajal and Ely (2013). They show how for settings without revenue equivalence a weaker form of Mirrlees representation can be achieved by integration of correspondences. We elaborate on this work in Sect. 3. Carroll (2012) has investigated the role of local implementability as well. He shows that every locally incentive compatible mechanism is incentive compatible if the type space is convex. In related work, Mishra et al. (2015) give a different characterization for ordinal type spaces that includes payment-only incentive compatibility as an additional necessary and sufficient condition. While Caroll as well as Mishra et al. derive characterizations in terms of local properties of an allocation rule and a payment rule, our results, as those of Archer and Kleinberg (2014) and  Berger et al. (2009), yield characterizations in terms of local properties of just the allocation rule. At the same time, the results by Carroll and Mishra et al. are more general as they cover ordinal as well as polyhedral type spaces. 
Organization In Sect. 2, we define our setting and introduce necessary notation and previous results. We present our main characterization of implementability (Theorem 3) in Sect. 3.1. Then we provide extensions of the results of Archer and Kleinberg (2014) about local implementability (Theorem 4, Sect. 3.2) and of Saks and Yu (2005) for allocation rules with finite range (Theorem 5, Sect. 3.3). In Sect. 4 we apply our results to an example given in Vohra (2011).",5

However, research in behavioural economics has uncovered many systematic patterns in individuals’ choices that are not consistent with traditional assumptions about the context-independence of revealed preferences, calling into question the idea that revealed preferences are indicators of welfare. These findings suggest that economics may need a different normative criterion. In this paper, I develop the approach proposed by Sugden (2004) and McQuillin and Sugden (2012), in which the objects of normative assessment are profiles of individuals’ opportunity sets. McQuillin and Sugden’s papers define an Opportunity Criterion for assessing such profiles. This criterion does not refer to preferences, and can be justified even if revealed preferences are context-dependent or dynamically inconsistent. Those papers show that, in every competitive equilibrium of an exchange economy, the profile of opportunity sets induced by that equilibrium satisfies the Opportunity Criterion.Footnote 1 In the present paper, I ask whether that criterion (or some variant of it) requires the profile of opportunity sets to have the properties of competitive equilibrium. I define a stronger version of this criterion, the Strong Opportunity Criterion. I show that every competitive equilibrium satisfies the Strong Opportunity Criterion and that, in the limit as an economy is replicated, the set of opportunity profiles that satisfy the Strong Opportunity Criterion shrinks to the set induced by competitive equilibrium. Formally, the Strong Opportunity Criterion is closely related to the core, and the convergence theorem that I present is closely related to the Core Convergence Theorem conjectured by Edgeworth (1881/1967) and proved by Debreu and Scarf (1963) and (in a mathematically different form) by Aumann (1964). Conceptually, however, a preference-independent assessment of opportunity profiles is fundamentally different from a conventional preference-based assessment of economic outcomes. My results show that close analogues of canonical welfare theorems can be proved without assuming that individuals act on consistent preferences and without using preference-satisfaction as the normative criterion. This parallelism suggests that the concepts of preference and rational choice are less essential to normative economics than economists have often thought.",3

An election, i.e., a collection of preferences represented as total orders on a set of candidates, is single-peaked if the candidates can be ordered linearly—on a so-called axis—so that each preference is either strictly increasing along this ordering, or strictly decreasing, or first increasing and then decreasing. See Fig. 1 for examples and Sect. 2 for formal definitions. Intuitively, the axis reflects the society’s ordering of the candidates and voters always prefer candidates that are closer to their ideal candidate over those farther away. In political elections, for example, this axis could reflect the left-right spectrum of the candidates or a natural ordering of political issues such as the maximum income tax. The vote \(V_1: c_4> c_5> c_6> c_3> c_2> c_7> c_1\), shown as a solid line, is single-peaked with respect to the axis \(c_1<c_2<c_3<c_4<c_5<c_6<c_7\). The vote \(V_2: c_3>c_5>c_4>c_2>c_6>c_1>c_7\), depicted as a dashed line, is not single-peaked with respect to this axis since both \(c_3\) and \(c_5\) form a peak. However, note that both votes are single-peaked with respect to the axis \(c_1<c_2<c_3<c_5<c_4<c_6<c_7\)
 Single-peaked preferences have several nice properties. First, they guarantee that a Condorcet winner exists and further that the pairwise majority relation is transitive (Inada 1969). Thus single-peaked preferences are a way to escape Arrow’s paradox (Arrow 1950). Second, non-manipulable voting rules exist for single-peaked preferences (Moulin 1980) and hence the single-peaked restriction also offers a way to circumvent the Gibbard-Satterthwaite paradox (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975). By adopting an algorithmic viewpoint, a third advantage becomes apparent. Restricting the input to single-peaked preferences often allows for faster algorithms for computationally hard voting problems (Brandt et al. 2015; Betzler et al. 2013; Walsh 2007; Faliszewski et al. 2011b). In this paper we perform an extensive combinatorial analysis of the single-peaked domain. Our aim is to establish results on the likelihood that an election is single-peaked for some axis. To be more precise, we allow the axis to be chosen depending on the preferences and do not assume that it is given together with the election. We consider three probability distributions for elections: the Impartial Culture (IC) assumption in which all total orders are equally likely and are chosen independently, the Pólya urn model which assumes a certain homogeneity among voters and Mallows model in which the probability of a vote depends on the closeness to a given reference vote (with respect to the Kendall-tau distance). Our main results are the following: 
Configuration definable restrictions Many domain restrictions can be characterized by forbidden configurations, in particular the single-peaked domain. We prove a close connection between configurations and permutations patterns. This novel connection allows us to obtain a very general result (Theorem 8), showing that many domain restrictions characterized by forbidden configurations are very unlikely to appear in a random election chosen according to the Impartial Culture assumption. More precisely, while the total number of elections with n votes and m candidates is equal to \((m!)^n\), the number of elections belonging to such a domain restriction can be bounded by \(m! \cdot c^{n m}\) for some constant c. 
Counting single-peaked elections We perform a detailed combinatorial analysis of the single-peaked domain by counting the number of single-peaked elections. The number of single-peaked elections immediately yields the corresponding probability with respect to the Impartial Culture (IC) assumption, which is the number of single-peaked elections divided by the total number of elections. We establish an upper bound for the number of single-peaked elections which asymptotically matches our lower bound result (Theorem 11). In addition, we show exact enumeration results for elections with two voters or up to four candidates (Theorem 12). Our results rigorously show that the single-peaked restriction is highly unlikely to appear in random elections chosen according to the IC assumption. This holds even for elections with few votes and candidates (cf. Sect. 8). Most of our results can easily be translated to the Impartial Anonymous Culture (IAC) assumption (Proposition 13). 
Pólya urn model In contrast to the IC assumption, single-peaked elections are considerably more likely if elections are chosen according to the Pólya urn model. We provide a lower bound on the corresponding likelihood (Theorem 14) and show that, if a sufficiently strong homogeneity is assumed, the probability of an election with n votes being single-peaked is larger than 1 / n (Corollary 15). 
Mallows model We encounter the most likely occurrence of single-peaked elections under Mallows model. As for the Pólya urn model we establish a lower bound result on the likelihood (Theorem 16). If the dispersion parameter \(\phi \) is sufficiently small , we are able to show that single-peaked elections are likely to appear (Corollary 17 and Table 4). 
Related work Computing the likelihood of properties related to voting has been the focus of a large body of research. The most fundamental question in this line of research is the choice of appropriate probability distributions, see the survey of Critchlow et al. (1991). We would like to mention two particular properties of elections that have been studied from a probability theoretic point of view: the likelihood of manipulability and the likelihood of having a Condorcet winner. An election is manipulable if a voter or a coalition of voters is better off by not voting sincerely but by misrepresenting their true preferences. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite paradox (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975) states that every reasonable voting rule for more than two candidates is susceptible to manipulation. However, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite paradox does not offer insight into how likely it is that manipulation is possible. Determining this likelihood both for single manipulators and coalitions of manipulators has been the focus of intensive research. Results have been obtained under a variety of probability distributions: for example under the Impartial Culture assumption (Slinko 2002a, b; Friedgut et al. 2008; Isaksson et al. 2012), the Pólya urn model (Lepelley and Valognes 2003), the Impartial Anonymous Culture (Favardin et al. 2002; Slinko 2005). The likelihood that an election has a Condorcet winner or, its converse, the likelihood of the Condorcet paradox has been the focus of many publications (see the survey of Gehrlein (2006) as well as more recent work of Gehrlein et al. (2013, 2015) for more recent research). In particular, we would like to mention that the likelihood of an election with three candidates having a Condorcet winner under the Impartial Anonymous Culture assumption is \(\frac{15(n+3)^2}{16(n+2)(n+4)}\) for odd n and \(\frac{15(n+2)(n^2+8n+8)}{16(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)}\) for even n (Gehrlein 2002). We will comment on the relation between these result and our results in Sect. 9. 
Organization Preliminaries are established in Sect. 2. The results on configuration definable restrictions can be found in Sect. 3, results on counting single-peaked elections in Sect. 4, results on the IAC assumption in Sect. 5, results on the Pólya urn model in Sect. 6 and results on the Mallows model in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8 we provide numerical evaluations of our results and discuss their implications. We conclude the paper in Sect. 9 with directions for future research.",19
48.0,4.0,Social Choice and Welfare,07 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-017-1034-z,Probabilistic opinion pooling generalized. Part one: general agendas,April 2017,Franz Dietrich,Christian List,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic opinion pooling. Suppose several individuals (e.g., decision makers or experts) each assign probabilities to some events. How can these individual probability assignments be aggregated into a collective probability assignment, while preserving probabilistic coherence? Although this problem has been extensively studied in statistics, economics, and philosophy, one standard assumption is seldom questioned: the set of events to which probabilities are assigned—the agenda—is a \(\sigma \)-algebra: it is closed under negation (complementation) and countable disjunction (union) of events. In practice, however, decision makers or expert panels may not be interested in such a rich set of events. They may be interested, for example, in the probability of a blizzard and the probability of an interest-rate increase, but not in the probability of a blizzard or an interest-rate increase. Of course, the assumption that the agenda is a \(\sigma \)-algebra is convenient: probability functions are defined on \(\sigma \)-algebras, and thus one can view probabilistic opinion pooling as the aggregation of probability functions. But convenience is no ultimate justification. Real-world expert committees typically do not assign probabilities to all events in a \(\sigma \)-algebra. Instead, they focus on a limited set of relevant events, which need not contain all disjunctions of its elements, let alone all disjunctions of countably infinite length. There are two reasons why a disjunction of relevant events, or another logical combination, may not be relevant. Either we are not interested in the probability of such ‘artificial’ composite events. Or we (or the decision makers or experts) are unable to assign subjective probabilities to them. To see why it can be difficult to assign a subjective probability to a logical combination of ‘basic’ events—such as ‘a blizzard or an interest-rate increase’—note that it is not enough to assign probabilities to the underlying basic events: various probabilistic dependencies also affect the probability of the composite event, and these may be the result of complex causal interconnections (such as the causal effects between basic events and their possible common causes). We investigate probabilistic opinion pooling for general agendas, dropping the assumption of a \(\sigma \)-algebra. Thus any set of events that is closed under negation (complementation) can qualify as an agenda. The general notion of an agenda is imported from the theory of binary judgment aggregation (e.g., List and Pettit 2002, 2004; Pauly and van Hees 2006; Dietrich 2006; Dietrich and List 2007a, 2013; Nehring and Puppe 2010; Dokow and Holzman 2010; Dietrich and Mongin 2010). We impose two axiomatic requirements on probabilistic opinion pooling: the familiar ‘independence’ requirement, according to which the collectively assigned probability for each event should depend only on the probabilities that the individuals assign to that event; the requirement that certain unanimous individual judgments should be preserved; we consider stronger and weaker variants of this requirement. We prove two main results: For a large class of agendas—with \(\sigma \)-algebras as special cases—any opinion pooling function satisfying (i) and (ii) is linear: the collective probability of each event in the agenda is a weighted linear average of the individuals’ probabilities of that event, where the weights are the same for all events. For an even larger class of agendas, any opinion pooling function satisfying (i) and (ii) is neutral: the collective probability of each event in the agenda is some (possibly non-linear) function of the individuals’ probabilities of that event, where the function is the same for all events. We state three versions of each result, which differ in the nature of the unanimity-preservation requirement and in the class of agendas to which they apply. Our results generalize a classic characterization of linear pooling in the special case where the agenda is a \(\sigma \)-algebra (Aczél and Wagner 1980 and McConway 1981).Footnote 1 For a \(\sigma \)-algebra, every neutral pooling function is automatically linear, so that neutrality and linearity are equivalent here (McConway 1981 and Wagner 1982).Footnote 2 As we will see, this fact does not carry over to general agendas: many agendas permit neutral but non-linear opinion pooling functions. Some of our results apply even to agendas containing only logically independent events, such as ‘a blizzard’ and ‘an interest-rate increase’ (and their negations), but no disjunctions or conjunctions of these events. Such agendas are relevant in practical applications where the events in question are only probabilistically dependent (correlated), but not logically dependent. If the agenda is a \(\sigma \)-algebra, by contrast, it is replete with logical interconnections. By focusing on \(\sigma \)-algebras alone, the standard results on probabilistic opinion pooling have therefore excluded many realistic applications. We also present a new illustrative application of probabilistic opinion pooling, namely to probabilistic preference aggregation. Here each individual assigns subjective probabilities to events of the form ‘x is preferable than y’ (or ‘x is better than y’), where x and y range over a given set of alternatives. These probability assignments may be interpreted as beliefs about which preferences are the ‘correct’ ones (e.g., which correctly capture objective quality comparisons between the alternatives). Alternatively, they may be interpreted as vague or fuzzy preferences. We then seek to arrive at corresponding collective probability assignments. Each of our linearity or neutrality results (with one exception) is logically tight: the linearity or neutrality conclusion follows if and only if the agenda falls into a relevant class. In other words, we characterize the agendas for which our axiomatic requirements lead to linear or neutral aggregation. We thereby adopt the state-of-the-art approach in binary judgment-aggregation theory, which is to characterize the agendas leading to certain possibilities or impossibilities of aggregation. This approach was introduced by Nehring and Puppe (2002) in related work on strategy-proof social choice and subsequently applied throughout binary judgment-aggregation theory. One of our contributions is to show how it can be applied in the area of probabilistic opinion pooling. We conclude by comparing our results with their analogues in binary judgment-aggregation theory and in Arrovian preference aggregation theory. Interestingly, the conditions leading to linear pooling in probability aggregation correspond exactly to the conditions leading to a dictatorship of one individual in both binary judgment aggregation and Arrovian judgment aggregation. This yields a new unified perspective on several at first sight disparate aggregation problems.",20

Part two: the premise-based approach,April 2017,Franz Dietrich,Christian List,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Suppose each individual member of some group (expert panel, court, jury etc.) assigns probabilities to some events. How can these individual probability assignments be aggregated into a collective probability assignment? Classically, this problem has been modelled as the aggregation of probability functions, which are defined on some \(\sigma \)-algebra of events, a set of events that is closed under negation and countable disjunction (and thereby also under countable conjunction). Each individual submits a probability function on the given \(\sigma \)-algebra, and these probability functions are then aggregated into a single collective probability function. One of the best-known solutions to this aggregation problem is linear pooling, where the collective probability function is a linear average of the individual probability functions. Linear pooling has several salient properties. First, if all individuals unanimously assign probability 1 (or probability 0) to some event, this probability assignment is preserved collectively (‘consensus preservation’). Second, the collective probability for each event depends only on individual probabilities for that event (‘event-wise independence’). Third, all events are treated equally: the pattern of dependence between individual and collective probability assignments is the same for all events (‘neutrality’). In many practical applications, however, not all events are equal. In particular, the events in a \(\sigma \)-algebra may fall into two categories (whose boundaries may be drawn in different ways). On the one hand, there are events that correspond to intuitively basic propositions, such as ‘it will rain’, ‘it will be humid’, or ‘atmospheric \(\hbox {CO}_{2}\) causes global warming’. On the other hand, there are events that are intuitively non-basic. These can be viewed as combinations of basic events, for instance via disjunction (union) of basic events, conjunction (intersection), or negation (complementation). It is not obvious that when we aggregate probabilities, basic and non-basic events should be treated alike. For a start, we may conceptualize basic and non-basic events differently, in analogy to the distinction between atomic and composite propositions in logic (the latter being logical combinations of the former). Second, the way we assign probabilities to non-basic events is likely to differ from the way we assign probabilities to basic events. When we assign a probability to a conjunction or disjunction, this typically presupposes the assignment of probabilities to the underlying conjuncts or disjuncts. For example, the obvious way to assign a probability to the event ‘rain or heat’ is to ask what the probability of rain is, what the probability of heat is, and whether the two are correlated.Footnote 1 If this is right, the natural method of making probabilistic judgments is to consider basic events first and to consider non-basic events next. Basic events serve as ‘premises’: we first assign probabilities to them, and then let these probability assignments constrain our probability assignments for other, non-basic events. In this paper, we propose an approach to probability aggregation that captures this idea: the premise-based approach. Under this approach, the group first assigns collective probabilities to all basic events (the ‘premises’) by aggregating the individiduals’ probabilities for them; and then it assigns probabilities to all other events, constrained by the probabilities of the basic events. If the basic events are ‘rain’ and ‘heat’, then, in a first step, the collective probabilities for these two events are determined by aggregating the individual probabilities for them. In a second step, the collective probabilities for all other events are assigned. For example, the collective probability of ‘rain and heat’ might be defined as a suitable function of the collective probability of ‘rain’, the collective probability of ‘heat’, and an estimated rain/heat-correlation coefficient, which could be the result of aggregating the rain/heat-correlation coefficients encoded in the individual probability functions. This proposal can be expressed more precisely by a single axiom, which does not require the (inessential) sequential implementation just sketched, but focuses on a core informational restriction: the collective probability of any ‘premise’ (basic event) should depend solely on the individual probabilities for this premise, not on individual probabilities for other events. We call this axiom independence on premises. Our axiomatic analysis of premise-based aggregation is inspired by binary judgment-aggregation theory, where the premise-based approach has also been characterized by a restricted independence axiom, for instance by Dietrich (2006), Mongin (2008), and Dietrich and Mongin (2010). For less formal discussions of premise-based aggregation, see Kornhauser and Sager (1986), Pettit (2001), List and Pettit (2002), and List (2006). The way in which we have just motivated the premise-based approach and the corresponding axiom is bound to prompt some questions. In particular, although the distinction between ‘basic’ and ‘non-basic’ events is arguably not ad hoc, there is no purely formal criterion for drawing that distinction.Footnote 2 However, there is another, less controversial motivation for the premise-based approach. Our central axiom—independence on premises—privileges particular events, called the ‘premises’. We have so far interpreted these in a very specific way, taking them to correspond to basic events and to constitute the premises in an individual’s probability-assignment process. But we can give up this interpretation and define a ‘premise’ simply as an event for which it is desirable that the collective probability depend solely on the event-specific individual probabilities. If ‘premises’ are defined like this, then our axiom—independence on premises—is justified by definition (though of course we can no longer offer any guidance as to which events should count as premises).Footnote 3
 We show that premise-based opinion pooling imposes significant restrictions on how the collective probabilities of the premises can be determined. At the same time, these restrictions are not undesirable; they do not lead to ‘undemocratic’ or ‘degenerate’ forms of opinion pooling. Specifically, given certain logical connections between the premises, independence on premises, together with a unanimity-preservation requirement, implies that the collective probability for each premise is a (possibly weighted) linear average of the individual probabilities for that premise, where the vector of weights across different individuals is the same for each premise. We present several variants of this result, which differ in the nature of the unanimity-preservation requirement and in the kinds of connections that are assumed to hold between premises. In some variants, we do not obtain the ‘linearity’ conclusion, but only a weaker ‘neutrality’ conclusion: the collective probability for each premise must be a (possibly non-linear) function of the individual probabilities for that premise, where this function is the same for each premise. These results are structurally similar to, but interpretively different from those in our companion paper (Dietrich and List 2017), to which we shall refer as ‘Part I’. Furthermore, our results stand in contrast with existing results on the premise-based approach in binary judgment aggregation. When judgments are binary, independence on premises leads to dictatorial aggregation under analogous conditions (see especially Dietrich and Mongin 2010). Our results apply regardless of which events are deemed to serve as premises. In the extreme case in which all events count as premises, the requirement of independence on premises reduces to the familiar event-wise independence axiom (sometimes called the strong setwise function property), and our results reduce to a classic characterization of linear pooling (see Aczél and Wagner 1980; McConway 1981; see also Wagner 1982, 1985; Aczél  et al. 1984; Genest 1984a; Mongin 1995; Chambers 2007).Footnote 4

Such an assumption is, however, increasingly viewed as being unrealistic, especially as it relates to high-skill individuals. When high-skill individuals are immobile, redistributive taxation must take into consideration that these individuals may change their labour supply along the intensive margin. That is, high-skill individuals may work less, thus reducing the amount of income available for redistribution. When high-skill individuals are internationally mobile, they have the additional option of changing their labour supply along the extensive margin, i.e., they may emigrate. An often-employed method to capture the threat of emigration is to introduce type-dependent participation constraints into the optimal tax problem; see, e.g., Osmundsen (1999), Krause (2009a), Simula and Trannoy (2010, 2012), and Lehmann et al. (2014). Naturally, these additional constraints reduce the level of social welfare attainable. In this paper, we introduce the threat of emigration by high-skill individuals into a two-period nonlinear income tax model without commitment. As in the related literature, this threat is captured by introducing a participation constraint for high-skill individuals. However, we show that the introduction of the high-skill type’s participation constraint facilitates redistribution and increases social welfare in the short-run, and has no effect on social welfare over the long-run. One may wonder how it is possible that the introduction of a binding constraint into an optimisation problem does not reduce the maximised value of the objective function. The participation constraint appears in period 2 and it does reduce the maximised value of the objective function (social welfare) in that period, but the specific manner in which social welfare is reduced—by limiting redistribution—enables a higher level of social welfare to be obtained in period 1. Thus social welfare summed over both periods remains unchanged. The intuition can be summarised as follows. In period 1 the government does not know each individual’s skill type, and therefore implements standard (incentive-compatible) nonlinear income taxation which induces individuals to reveal their type. However, high-skill individuals know that if they reveal their type in period 1, they lose their information advantage and will be subjected to first-best taxation in period 2. This means that high-skill individuals must be offered a very attractive tax treatment in period 1 to reveal their type, to compensate them for having to face first-best taxation in period 2. Accordingly, the ability of the government to redistribute in period 1 is severely limited. However, the threat of emigration reduces the extent of redistribution possible in period 2, meaning that high-skill individuals require less compensation in period 1 to reveal their type. This enables the government to implement more redistribution in period 1, which correspondingly increases first-period social welfare. The threat of emigration limits redistribution and reduces social welfare in period 2, but optimal taxation balances the short-run benefits against the long-run costs. Thus the threat of emigration has no effect on the level of social welfare summed over both periods. In terms of previous results, the paper most closely related to ours is that by Leite-Monteiro (1997). He also finds that increased international mobility may enhance redistribution, but his model is entirely different to ours. In Leite-Monterio’s model, the government can always implement first-best personalised lump-sum taxes, and changes in the country’s skill composition after migration takes place is what makes enhanced redistribution a possibility. By contrast, in our model the participation constraint ensures that no one migrates, so the skill composition remains unchanged. Our paper is also related to the literature on dynamic Mirrlees (1971) nonlinear income taxation without commitment, e.g., Roberts (1984), Apps and Rees (2006), Brett and Weymark (2008a), Krause (2009b), Berliant and Ledyard (2014), and Guo and Krause (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015a, b). In dynamic Mirrlees models, the question arises as to whether the government can or cannot commit to not using skill-type information revealed by individuals in earlier periods when it implements taxation in latter periods. A common theme in the literature is the highlighting of how different and counter-intuitive optimal policy can be when the commitment assumption is relaxed. The present paper provides another example of a result that, at first glance, appears quite counter-intuitive. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and the structure of optimal taxation, while Sect. 3 presents and discusses our result. Section 4 discusses other possible solutions to the optimal tax problem, and what these would imply for our result. Section 5 concludes, and the proof of our result is contained in an appendix.",4

Examples include, among others, poverty traps, economic cycles or inefficient conventions (Masiliūnas 2017; Cooper and John 1988; Adsera and Ray 1998; Morris 2014). In these settings, individuals may benefit from choosing an action that changes the status quo, but it would require the coordination of a sufficient number of individuals to do so. Revolutions are also akin to these setups. Citizens that protest might change a bad regime if the number of participants is above a certain threshold. One issue to be considered is that part of the population might be unwilling to participate in the revolt. In this paper, we look at the effect of communication technology (mass or social media) to overthrow a dictator when the majority wants to change the regime, but there is heterogeneity of types and part of the population is unwilling to change the status quo. In the last years, there have been many mass mobilizations that attracted considerable public attention internationally. The mass protests that started the uprisings against the regimes in the Arab world, the demonstrations of the Indignados movement in Spain, the Occupy Wall Street movement or the Hong Kong’s Umbrella revolution are the most prominent examples. A distinguishing feature of these events was the omnipresence of social media (especially, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). Many scholars (e.g. Castells 2011; Edmond 2013; Manacorda and Tesei 2016; Enikolopov et al. 2016) wonder how these new information technologies affect social movements. Do they help to overthrow autocratic regimes more easily than the former technology? Social media affect the evolution of protests in various ways. First, social media provide access to alternative information about the true state of the economy and the government’s performance. This information may be limited under mass media, especially when the government controls it. Social media help to inform audiences around the world about the unfolding of the events, attracting international attention and provoking diplomatic pressure. Finally, social media offer an easy, quick and inexpensive means of communication that facilitates the spread of information among the participants. This, in turn, may help to foster coordination, a key factor to achieve the goals of any movement. One interesting insight along these lines is one by Daron Acemoglu. When asked about overthrowing dictators he pointed out the following: “It is a question of coordinating people’s beliefs, I need to know if other people agree with me and are willing to act. What really stops people who are oppressed by a regime from protesting is the fear that they will be part of an unsuccessful protest. When you are living in these regimes, you have to be extremely afraid of what happens if you participate and the regime doesn’t change.”Footnote 1 Descriptions of the recent revolutions seem to highlight the importance of social media in efficient mobilization. Individuals fear that not enough people will go to the protests, so uncertainty about the turnout is a major obstacle. When mass media (e.g., TV or radio) report about attendance, then the audience does not know the reasons why individuals did not go. In social media these reasons can be revealed. For instance, Ghonim (2012) mentions the existence of opinion polls online to find out why people decided (not) to go to the protest. The comments on Facebook help also to get insight into the decision-making of others and serve to raise spirits. Ghonim describes that he was surprised to see among the supporters persons that he did not expect to see. All this together helps to “break the barrier of fear” (Ghonim 2012) and allows individuals know that they are enough and together they can bring down the dictator. Although social media seem to have a notable effect on mobilizing the masses, we lack a formal model that attempts to capture its effects on mobilization. In this paper, we use game theory to show how this technology may help to change the status quo in an autocratic regime. Our starting point is that willingness to participate in the protests depends on the perceived costs and benefits of participation. Arguably, heading out onto the streets implies the costs of facing tear gas, rubber bullets and potential arrest and incarceration. Benefits involve the perceived gains in participating in an uprising that may bring about a better future, provided it succeeds. The probability of success is highly related to the number of participants. Yet, when a potential protester decides whether to participate, possibly she has only a vague idea about if sufficient other people will participate. Different types of media may affect these beliefs (and the resulting mobilization) in diverse ways. To investigate the effects of social media on mobilization, we study how individuals’ decisions to participate in the revolution are affected by two different communication technologies: mass and social media. We posit that when an individual obtains information through mass media then she gets to know the actual state of the revolution in that moment, whereas when informed via social media she is able to observe the sequence of decisions leading up to that state. For instance, when searching in Twitter the individual gets the last conversations about the topic, and by scrolling down the page she is able to see all previous tweets about it, the use of hashtags indeed facilitates this task. In Facebook, the users may comment on the events and all previous comments can be read. When people chat in a group with Whatsapp, the complete talk is recorded in the smartphone of each participant. We suppose that tweets, chats and comments are informative about the individuals’ decision to join the protests or to stay at home. As stated by participants in the Hong Kong’s Umbrella revolution, “If your friends ask you to join the protest, they just Whatsapp you: ‘Hey, I am going, are you?’ Then you quickly decide.” (Parker 2014). By contrast, when TV or radio inform about the state of a given event, the precise history remains hidden, only aggregate information about the turnout is reported.Footnote 2
 We rely on these distinctive features of mass and social media and model the problem of revolution as a coordination problem. We suppose that there are two groups in the society. One of them consists of individuals who want to overthrow the dictator (willing individuals). The another one is composed of individuals who do not want to change the regime but prefer the status quo (unwilling individuals). We assume that there are enough willing individuals to bring about a change and overthrowing the dictator is the socially efficient outcome. That is, if all willing individuals revolt, then the dictator is toppled. However, if the number of protesters (those willing individuals who actually head onto the streets) falls short of a critical mass, then the dictator remains in power and may punish those who participated in the failed revolt. We assume that individuals choose in sequence whether or not to revolt. Before making her decision, each individual is informed about the state of the revolution. The information that an individual receives depends on the communication technology. As discussed above, mass media allow individuals to learn how many people have already chosen to participate (i.e. the actual state of the revolution), whereas individuals observe each of the past decisions (e.g. the precise history) when information is channeled through social media. First, we show that when the type of individuals (that is, if she is willing to revolt or not) is public information, willing individuals take part in the revolution in case of both communication technologies and, thus, the dictator is overthrown. Interestingly enough, it is not necessarily the case when there is no communication technology and thus individuals receive no information about the state of the revolution. If willing individuals believe that other willing individuals will not revolt, then it is possible to have an equilibrium outcome where nobody revolts. This, in turn, shows that the mere existence of communication technologies (i.e., mass or social media) can facilitate that social movements achieve their objective by shrinking the set of beliefs, compared with the case in which no information is disclosed. Second, we study a more realistic setup in which the type of individuals is not observed (i.e. it is private information). Although it is common knowledge in our model that there are enough willing individuals in the society to change the regime, the type of communication technology becomes relevant in this setup. We show that mass media do not necessarily enable willing individuals to organize themselves efficiently. Thus, depending on the perceived costs and benefits, willing individuals might choose not to revolt in equilibrium. However, successful revolution is the unique equilibrium outcome when individuals use social media, independently of the severity of punishment that protesters may suffer if they fail to overthrow the dictator. This result shows that communication through social media facilitates that revolutions succeed more than when communication is channeled through traditional mass media. Although our comparison of mass and social media suggests that they are competing communication technologies, our results are aimed at answering the question about how social media enhance mass media’s ability to mobilize individuals. The results gleaned from the empirical evidence support the idea that citizens perceived social media to be very important during the Arab Spring (Howard et al. 2011; Lang and De Sterck 2014), including the Tunisian revolution (Marzouki et al. 2012) or the protests in Egypt (Attia et al. 2011; Azab 2012; Lim 2012; Tufekci and Wilson 2012). Hence, microblogging activity (Qin et al. 2016) or the amount of tweets (Acemoglu et al. 2014; Steinert-Threlkeld et al. 2015) might have been related to the incidence and the intensity of protests. There is indeed a causal relationship between social media and mobilization according to Manacorda and Tesei (2016) and Enikolopov et al. (2016). Manacorda and Tesei (2016) study how coverage of mobile phone signals affected the occurrence of protest and individual participation on the whole African continent between 1998 and 2012.Footnote 3 They show that mobile phones promoted protests and helped mass mobilization during economic downturn. Enikolopov et al. (2016) show that the penetration of VK, the dominant Russian online social network, affected protest participation in a series of protest during 2011. More concretely, a 10% increase in penetration increased the probability of a protest by almost 5% and the number of participants by roughly 20%. Section 2 reviews briefly the relevant literature. Section 3 presents our model. We derive our theoretical results in Sect. 4, where we also discuss the application of our model, by presenting two examples in which we assess the differences between mass and social media in yielding different outcomes in a revolution.

Nax,Stefano Balietti,Dirk Helbing,Male,Male,Male,Male,"We conducted an experiment to investigate the welfare consequences of implementing a ‘fuzzy’—rather than a fully precise—mechanism in the context of voluntary contributions games. Our aim is to take a first step in the direction of improving our understanding of the consequences of implementing institutions based on inherently imprecise mechanisms.Footnote 1 This inquiry is relevant before any potential policy recommendations can be made, because real-world implementations would rarely be without flaw, particularly in the context of private, voluntary contributions. Most investigations of mechanisms in the context of social dilemmas presume that there is perfect observability. Inherently, however, introducing a mechanism in the real world will produce substantial fuzziness. This is due to the fact that players’ individual actions are often not perfectly observable, to the players and to the authority. ‘Imperfect public monitoring’ is ubiquitous in the real world (Abreu et al. 1990; Fudenberg et al. 1994), and there exists a rich body of theoretical investigations in various social dilemma contexts closely related to ours such as noisy prisoners’ dilemmas (Wu and Axelrod 1995) and team production without individual feedback (Alchian and Demsetz 1972).Footnote 2 Previous experimental studies of social dilemma games with imperfect monitoring have revealed that noise may play a crucial, non-trivial role in determining the performance of a mechanism and in sustaining cooperation generally.Footnote 3
 In this paper, we investigate a fuzzy mechanism for voluntary contributions games. Voluntary contributions games, as introduced by Marwell and Ames (1979, 1980), provide parsimonious models to capture the strategic interaction underlying public goods provisioning.Footnote 4 In the baseline implementation of these games, individual players make private, costly contributions that create a public good which is then shared equally amongst all players. In the absence of suitable mechanisms, there are insufficient private incentives for contributing behaviors, and universal non-contribution is the unique Nash equilibrium. This is reflected in many economic experiments on voluntary contributions games by a decay of contributions over time (Ledyard 1995; Chaudhuri 2011). Outcomes with high contributions can only be expected when a suitable mechanism is implemented. Several mechanisms are known.Footnote 5 Successful mechanisms are able to change the incentive structure of the game in such a way that high contributions are stabilized. Numerous lab experiments have shown how voluntary contributions are stabilized through their introduction (Ledyard 1995; Chaudhuri 2011). An important difference between the typical lab setting and the real world is that a real-world implementation of the mechanism would rarely be without flaw. Instead, the real-world mechanism would be fuzzy, that is, subject to various sources of monitoring imperfections, mechanism imprecision and other environmental noise due to, for example, measurement error or enforcement issues. In this paper, we aim to advance in the direction of understanding fuzzy mechanism implementation. We therefore conduct a novel type of voluntary contributions experiment where we test a mechanism by varying its degree of fuzziness. Our baseline is the mechanism of ‘contribution-based competitive grouping’, as was introduced in a recent, seminal paper by Gunnthorsdottir (2010). Under this mechanism, players are grouped based on their individual voluntary contributions.Footnote 6 As a result, non-contribution is no longer a dominant strategy. Instead, players have incentives to contribute positive amounts if others do likewise in order to be matched with them. Contribution-based grouping changes the game’s entire incentive structure without requiring payoff transfers. Universal non-contribution, the least efficient outcome, continues to be a Nash equilibrium. However, new, more efficient equilibria may also emerge that feature high contribution levels. These new equilibria are characterized by an asymmetric strategy profile such that a vast majority of players contributes fully and a small minority of player free-rides.Footnote 7 Several recent lab experiments confirm coordination on the asymmetric high-efficiency equilibria with high aggregate precision (Gunnthorsdottir 2010; Gunnthorsdottir and Thorsteinsson 2011; Gunnthorsdottir et al. 2010; Rud and Rabanal 2015). The focus of this paper is on (i) the performance of ‘fuzzy’ variants of Gunnthorsdottir (2010)’s mechanism, and (ii) on their welfare consequences in terms of efficiency and equality. Fuzzy variants of Gunnthorsdottir (2010)’s mechanism were recently formulated by Nax et al. (2014) introduction of an additional parameter (interpretable as variance) that measures the degree of imprecision inherent to the competitive grouping’s basic functioning.Footnote 8 This fuzzy generalization of contribution-based group matching is referred to as ‘meritocratic matching’. Compared to the basic mechanism, meritocratic matching works as follows: instead of grouping players based on actual contributions, actual contributions are ‘noised’ by variance \(\sigma ^2\) (measuring fuzziness/imprecision), and players are grouped based on these noised contributions. Meritocratic matching thus bridges the no-mechanism case of random matching and contribution-based competitive grouping continuously: when \(\sigma ^2=0\) the mechanism corresponds to contribution-based competitive grouping; when \(\sigma ^2\rightarrow \infty \) the mechanism approaches random re-matching as in a standard implementation (Andreoni 1988). Nax et al. (2014) show that high-efficiency equilibria exist provided the mechanism is precise enough implying a bound on \(\sigma ^2\). In this study, we investigate the welfare properties of meritocratic matching for a wide range of \(\sigma ^2\) values. Theory predicts existence of high-efficiency Nash equilibria for some of these values, but not for all, and not for \(\sigma ^2\rightarrow \infty \). Our results summarize as follows. We confirm that the asymmetric high-efficiency equilibria are coordinated upon with high aggregate precision when they exist, validating theory predictions and previous lab studies. Contrary to theoretical predictions, however, we provide novel evidence that higher levels of meritocracy also increase ex post equality. Moreover, we find that these unambiguous welfare gains are even realized when the mechanism is too fuzzy for theory to even predict existence of high-efficiency equilibria. We view high fuzziness as the realistic ‘default’ implementation of our mechanism. However, a policy maker could somehow choose to reduce the mechanism’s inherent noise (e.g. by investing into monitoring or implementation technologies). Viewing the mechanism’s inherent noise, therefore, as some sort of policy variable and without explicitly modeling the involved costs of ‘setting the noise’, we can draw the following main policy conclusion from our results: provided that there is ex ante equity (as there was in our experiment by design), it would be unambiguously welfare-beneficial to introduce meritocratic matching, even if the mechanism remains very fuzzy. The remainder of this document is structured as follows. Next, we provide details of the model and of the experimental design. In Sect. 3, we present the results of our welfare investigation. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 4.",3

Emel Öztürk,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"An allocation is envy-free if no individual prefers another individual’s commodity bundle to his own. The envy-freeness criterion was introduced to capture the ethical ideal of equality in a setting of ordinal preferences that are not comparable between individuals.Footnote 1 Indeed, an envy-free allocation achieves equality in the sense that it leaves no individual worse off (in his own judgment) than any other individual. An alternative egalitarian interpretation, due to Kolm (1971), stresses that an envy-free allocation is such that it could have arisen by letting each individual choose a bundle from an identical opportunity set (e.g., the set of bundles in the given allocation). Envy-freeness is a crude criterion. It distinguishes only two classes of allocations, those that are envy-free and those that are not. There are good reasons to consider envy measures that provide more discriminatory envy rankings of allocations. Since envy-freeness generalizes the idea of equality to the setting of ordinal and non-comparable preferences, the study of envy measures is a natural extension of the theory of inequality measurement.Footnote 2 Further, allocations that are both envy-free and Pareto efficient are not guaranteed to exist in non-transferable-commodities or production settings. Hence, allocations in the Pareto efficient subset that minimize an envy measure constitute interesting compromises.Footnote 3 Similarly, in the problem of allocating indivisible objects when money transfers are allowed, there is no allocation rule that is envy-free, strategy-proof and budget-balanced. Again, an envy measure can be used to choose among the strategy-proof and budget-balanced allocation rules.Footnote 4
 We introduce a new class of envy measures. Throughout, we discuss the connections with envy measures proposed by Feldman and Kirman (1974), Chaudhuri (1986), Diamantaras and Thomson (1989), Tadenuma and Thomson (1995) and Fleurbaey (2008). Whereas these previous envy measures were proposed on the basis of their direct appeal, we use an axiomatic approach in order to make intuitions explicit. We develop our class in two steps. First, we examine the consequences of imposing decomposability. This axiom requires that, for each partitioning of the population in two subgroups, envy in the total population can be written as the sum of the envy within subgroups and the envy between subgroups. In combination with a basic normalization axiom, decomposability implies that envy is measured by \(\sum _i\sum _j E_{ij}\), where \(E_{ij}\) measures how much individual i envies individual j and depends only on the bundles of i and j and the preferences of i. The value of \(E_{ij}\) is zero if i does not envy j, and positive otherwise. Second, we formulate two axioms, betweenness and proportionality, that deal with envy comparisons in the simple two-individual setting. Assume that the two individuals are i and j, and that i envies j but not vice versa. Betweenness demands that envy decreases if i’s bundle improves or if j’s bundle worsens according to i’s preferences. Proportionality requires that, for cases where the bundles of individuals i and j are proportional to each other, envy is smaller if the radial distance between the bundles is smaller. We show that betweenness and proportionality are incompatible. We weaken the latter axiom to r-proportionality, which applies the idea of proportionality only if the bundles of i and j are proportional to a predetermined reference bundle r. Given anonymity, the axioms betweenness and r-proportionality imply that \(E_{ij}\) is an increasing function of the ratio \(u_i({x_j})/u_i({x_i})\), where \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) are the bundles of individuals i and j and \(u_i\) is a ‘ray’ utility representation of i’s ordinal preferences. The ray utility function depends on the chosen reference bundle r and is singled out by the axioms as the utility representation to be used. The next section introduces notation and provides an overview of the envy measures proposed in the literature. Sections 3 and 4 tackle the two steps discussed above. Section 5 combines the two steps into a single class of envy measures and discusses its properties. Section 6 concludes with a brief discussion of the connection with multidimensional inequality measurement.",6

50.0,2.0,Social Choice and Welfare,04 October 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-017-1084-2,Preferential votes and minority representation in open list proportional representation systems,February 2018,Margherita Negri,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The label proportional representation (PR) refers to any multi-member district system where seats are assigned to parties in proportion to the share of votes they receive. An important distinction within this class of electoral systems relates to the rules governing seat allocation within parties. Suppose a party running with a list of ten candidates wins four seats in a district: which of the candidates on its list will be elected? In some countries (among many others, Argentina, Israel, Spain and South Africa), seat allocation follows a ranking of candidates that is determined by party leaders before election. In the example, the first four candidates on the party list would be assigned the seat under this system. Voters cannot modify the ranking and can only cast a vote for a party list as a whole. In other countries (e.g. Belgium, The Netherlands or Sweden), voters can affect the ranking decided by parties by casting a specific vote (a preferential or preference vote) for some candidates within the list. Candidates obtaining enough preferential votes are elected independently of their position on the original ranking. In the example, if, say, the tenth candidate on the list received enough preferential votes, she would be elected in place of one of the first four candidates. Finally, there are countries (e.g. Finland and Brazil) where rankings are solely determined by preferential votes. Under this system, the four seats won by the party in the example would be assigned to the four candidates obtaining the highest number of individual votes. The three systems are known as closed, flexible (or semi-open) and open list PR, respectively. It is important to remark that, under flexible and open list PR, voters can cast a vote both for a party and for some candidates. The party-vote is what differentiates these systems from limited vote. Preferential votes under open list PR (and, to some extent, under flexible list PR) are equivalent to approval voting within party lists: voters decide to approve (and not rank) some of the politicians appearing on the ballot. Only one approval vote can be cast for each candidate (no cumulative voting). The total number of approval votes that can be expressed can vary a lot from country to country. For example, it is equal to one in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Brazil, it varies from one to five—depending on the electoral district—in Greece and it coincides with the total number of candidates on the list in Belgium. This paper investigates the extent to which the interests of minority groups can be protected under open list PR systems. As a measure of representation of minorities, I consider the number of elected candidates representing the group.Footnote 1 If minorities were able to organize themselves into parties, the question would boil down to the analysis of seat allocation across parties. The extent of minority representation would then only depend on the mapping of votes into seats and on the presence (and level) of minimum thresholds for representation. This is the focus of the literature on threshold for representation and threshold for exclusion (among others, Rae et al. 1971; Lijphart and Gibberd 1977; Taagepera 1998).Footnote 2 However, party structures in countries using PR systems might not necessarily represent the minority/majority divide. For example, Huber (2012) shows that the “ethnicization” of voting behavior (i.e. the correlation between voting decisions and individuals’ ethnicity) is actually lower under PR than it is under first-past-the-post systems. In other words, ethnic groups often split their votes across different parties and there might not be parties primarily receiving votes from one specific ethnic group. This happens because, “although PR makes it possible for ethnically oriented parties to form, it also makes it easy for non-ethnic parties to compete for ethnic votes”.Footnote 3 In such a scenario, then, minority candidates might appear on party lists that represent different interests. The rules governing seat allocation within party lists become of key importance to determine the level of minority representation in this context. The paper considers a society divided in two groups of unequal size, that I call minority and majority. Voters vote under open list PR: they must cast a vote for one out of two parties and assign some preferential votes to candidates within its list. Voters can only approve candidates belonging to the list of the party they voted for and can cast at most one preferential vote per candidate. The seats won by the party are assigned to the candidates in the list who received the largest number of preferential votes. I assume list composition is dictated by the law: lists must contain a share of candidates representing each group equal to the relative size of the group in the population. Furthermore, I make a number of conservative assumptions on voters’ characteristics. First, I assume that members of each group are perfectly able to coordinate. This allows to consider a game between two players, the minority and the majority.Footnote 4 A similar degree of coordination is assumed in ethical voters models (Coate and Conlin 2004; Feddersen and Sandroni 2006). Groups preferences are defined on the minority/majority dimension: each group aims at maximizing the number of elected candidates representing its interests. Voters are perfectly able to distinguish minority and majority candidates. Finally, all candidates representing the same group are identical and cannot campaign to attract votes from different groups.Footnote 5 What I am considering is therefore a best-case type of scenario. Even under this scenario, my results show that minority representation can be very limited under open list PR. In particular, the analysis highlights a clear negative relationship between the number of preferential votes and the number of elected candidates representing the interests of the group. Perfectly proportional representation (a situation where the share of elected minority candidates is equal to the relative size of the group in the population) is guaranteed only if voters can cast a small number of preferential votes. The intuition behind the negative correlation between number of preferential votes and minority representation is as follows. An important characteristic of open list PR is that candidates are guaranteed to be elected if the number of preferential votes they receive is above a specific threshold. Guaranteed here means that their election is independent of the total number of seats won by their party and the number of preferential votes obtained by other candidates. The threshold turns out to be proportional to the number of preferential votes that can be expressed. When voters can cast few preferential votes, the threshold is low. Then, the votes of the minority are enough to guarantee that (the votes received by) some minority candidates pass the threshold. The larger the number of preferential votes, the lower the ability of the minority to cast enough votes on specific candidates and guarantee their election. Furthermore, an increase in the number of preferential votes produces a “multiplier” effect on the power of the majority. Assume the minority contains two individuals, while the majority contains six. The difference between the total number of preferential votes that can be expressed by the two groups is 4 if each individual can cast one preferential vote, 8 if they can cast two, 12 if three, etc. If the majority equally splits its votes across the two parties, it will be able to give more and more preferential votes to more and more majority candidates, eventually preventing the election of any minority candidate. Even though ethnic politics versus class politics is a dilemma mostly in developing countries,Footnote 6 a similar dilemma exists in democratizing countries.Footnote 7 Consider a society divided along a class (i.e. income-related) dimension and an ethnic dimension. Suppose that the two parties in my model are the party of the rich and the party of the poor. When the poor of both ethnic groups prefer to channel their frustration through ethnic politics, the relevant coalition is between the rich majority group and the poor majority group, against the rich and poor minority groups. In this case, the scenario is similar to the one I consider in my model.Footnote 8 If the system is open list PR and many preferential votes can be cast, the majority ethnic group will divide up optimally the votes across parties, because its main goal is coordinating to defeat the minority group. Taking a step back and considering the constitutional stage in a democratizing country, these conclusions imply that an ethnic majority group might prefer to choose an open list PR system with a large number of preferential votes. Whenever the ethnic politics cleavage dominates the class cleavage, this system will allow to reduce the representation of the minority group. In the baseline model, parties are passive players. Given the quota system specified by the law and the assumptions about candidates’ characteristics, they essentially can play no role in deciding list composition. This very simplified and stylized scenario constitutes a first step in the analysis of minority representation under open list PR and allows to obtain clear and precise conclusions about the effect of the number of preferential votes. In Sect. 4.1, I briefly discuss the possibility of endogenizing list composition. I assume parties want to maximize the number of seats won and can decide how many minority and majority candidates to include in their lists. Two interesting insights emerge from this extension. First, contrary to what one would expect, the incentives to include minority candidates in the list are weaker when few preferential votes are allowed. Under reasonable assumptions on voting behavior in the subgames, no equilibrium exists where both parties include minority candidates in their lists. In addition, there can be an equilibrium where both parties only contain majority candidates. When voters can cast a large number of preferential votes, these type of equilibria are harder to sustain. Interestingly enough, the primary reason for including minority candidates in the list is not to attract the votes of the minority. Indeed, when the minority votes for a party and many preferential votes can be cast, the majority always best responds by voting for that party too. The number of votes assigned to the party by the group is strictly greater than the number of voters in the minority. In this way, some majority candidates in the party receive an amount of preferential votes that is strictly larger than the one received by any minority candidate, gaining priority in the allocation of seats (the larger the amount of preferential votes that can be expressed, the larger the number of such candidates and the lower the number of elected minority ones). By including minority candidates in their lists, then, parties are able to attract a consistent amount of votes by the majority. The discussion in Sect. 4.1 confirms how the main analysis in the paper is conducted under a best-case scenario for the minority. When list composition is dictated by the law, the group can be represented in parliament only if the number of preferential votes that can be expressed is small enough. In this case, however, parties have very low incentives to actually include minority candidates in their lists. Overall, this strengthens the conclusion that minority interests can be poorly protected under open list PR. The results suggest that the best way to achieve perfect minority representation is to limit the number of preferential votes that can be expressed and impose a system of quotas on party lists. A second important insight of Sect. 4.1 is that, if parties care about maximizing the number of seats won, a situation in which only one party contains minority candidates (or, in other words, the existence of a “minority party”) is unlikely to occur. Whenever only one party contains minority candidates in its list, two possible incentives can arise. First, the party might be tempted to replace the minority candidates with majority ones to attract more votes by the majority. Second, the other party might be induced to include minority candidates in its list too. When few preferential votes can be expressed, both incentives can arise, depending on the specific assumptions one makes about equilibria in the voting subgames. Equilibria with “minority parties” exist only under very specific assumptions. When the number of preferential votes is large, only the second effect arises. As noted above, by assuming a cohesive minority behavior I am stacking the deck against the results I obtain in the model. My results show that, even if the minority is perfectly able to coordinate, open list PR can be associated with very limited minority representation. Clearly, reducing the coordination power of the minority would only strengthen this conclusion. On the other hand, reducing the coordination power of the majority would probably result in higher minority representation. However, for a fixed degree of coordination ability, the comparative statics on the effect of the number of preferential votes would persist. The chances of electing a minority candidate in a party decrease when (i) enough majority voters vote for that party and (ii) they give enough preferential votes to their favorite candidates. Limiting the coordination ability of the majority would affect both components. However, for a given probability that enough majority voters vote for a party, an increase in the number of preferential votes definitely increases the number of majority candidates obtaining a consistent amount of votes. This reduces overall minority representation. Section 6.1 further discusses this intuition and provides an illustrative example. The negative correlation between minority representation and the number of preferential votes had already been established for limited vote systems (Lijphart et al. 1986). In these systems, all candidates appear on the same ballot, voters do not cast a vote for parties and can only express preferential votes for candidates. The elected candidates are those who received the largest number of votes. Open list PR therefore differs from limited vote because of the possibility to cast a vote for a party list. The importance of my contribution with respect to the literature on limited vote stems from two observations. The first is more practical. Open list PR is a much more widely used electoral system than limited vote.Footnote 9 Establishing how well minority interests are protected under this system is therefore of great relevance. The second observation is more technical: the presence of a party-vote in open list PR is a relevant difference with respect to limited vote. Two effects come into play. First, while under limited vote a candidate competes with all the other candidates, under open list PR she primarily competes with the subset of politicians on the same party list. Most importantly, the election of a minority candidate in a party is independent of the number of votes received by candidates in the other party. This limits the power of the majority to reduce minority representation: while under limited vote it is enough to assign enough votes to many majority candidates, under open list PR the group must assign enough votes to many candidates in both parties. The second effect arises from party behavior. Under open list PR, parties have stronger incentives to include minority candidates in their lists. The intuition is explained in Sect. 5 with the help of an example. The two effects combined imply a (relatively) better performance of open list PR in protecting minority interests. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 contains the results. Section 4 extends the analysis to endogenous list formation and larger number of parties. This is followed by a comparison between open list PR and limited vote (Sect. 5). Section 6 discusses the assumption of perfect coordination and provides an example about class- versus ethnic-identity. Section 7 concludes. All proofs can be found in the Appendix.",3

It seems that an important, perhaps previously neglected, element is the extensive margin and its reaction to financial incentives at the beginning and at the end of the working life. This has led to a number of models with endogenous retirement dates in a life cycle setup, e.g. Prescott et al. (2009), Rogerson and Wallenius (2009) and Ljunqvist and Sargent (2014). However there is still little work on the interaction between nonlinear taxes and pension schemes. Indeed Diamond (2009) states Apart from some simulation studies, theoretical studies of optimal tax design typically contain neither a mandatory pension system nor the behavioral dimensions that lie behind justifications commonly offered for mandatory pensions. Conversely, optimizing models of pension design typically do not include annual taxation of labor and capital incomes. Recognizing the presence of two sets of policy institutions raises the issue of whether normative analysis should be done separately or as a single overarching optimization. To make progress in this direction, the present study takes as a premise that two simple policy instruments are available to the (utilitarian) government: an age-independent nonlinear tax schedule and a pension scheme that depends on a single aggregate statistic of the work life. We adopt a Ramsey approach rather than a Mirrlees one. In this respect, we sharply differ from the dynamic optimal taxation literature that allows for very general tax instruments, possibly depending on the agents’ age and on their entire labor income histories (Grochulski and Kocherlakota 2010; Weinzierl 2011; Shourideh and Troshkin 2012; Michau 2014). To study the redistributive power of pensions in this Ramsey environment, we regard pension benefits as transfers to the agents that are conditioned upon a verifiable variable. In practice, the government offers a menu of pension plans, and each agent chooses her preferred option depending on her characteristics. Our main goal is to understand how the incentive constraints associated with pension choices affect the design of optimal taxes. To this aim, following the optimal taxation literature (Saez 2001, 2002; Jacquet et al. 2013), we proceed by evaluating welfare effects of small tax reforms around the optimum. The literature defines the mechanical or equity effect as the welfare change that would occur if there were no behavioral responses. Studies differ in the kind of behavioral responses they consider. Responses at the intensive margin give rise to substitution effects while responses at the extensive margin give rise to participation effects. The literature derives optimal tax formulae in these various contexts, sometimes allowing for income effects in labor supply. As noticed by Diamond (1998), however, the formulae are much simpler in the absence of income effects. Here, we assume away income effects, which are difficult to handle when a retirement system is in force. We focus on the extensive margin, appropriate to discuss the retirement decision.Footnote 1 In a first step, we examine how labor supply behavior depends on taxes and pensions. Under a pension system, agents face constraints on labor supply because they need to achieve a certain lifetime performance to receive their pension benefits. These constraints tend to reduce the (positive) labor supply responses to tax cuts compared to the case without pension. There is, however, a distinct, subtler effect which turns out to go in the same direction. The strength of the labor supply constraints placed by the pension system is itself endogenous, a function of the tax schedule: a tax cut reduces the pressure placed by the pension regime on labor supply because it becomes easier for the agent to meet a given pension requirement. This second effect, which we call “feedback effect of taxes on pension incentives”, further reduces the labor supply response to tax cuts. Our main contribution is to analyze the welfare effects of tax reforms when pensions are optimally designed by the government. Redistribution requires extracting rent from agents with high productivities and/or low opportunity costs of work. Rent extraction, however, is to be weighed against efficiency concerns. In principal-agent models, the rent-efficiency tradeoff is best described with the notion of virtual surplus, first introduced by Myerson (1981) in the context of auctions.Footnote 2 Using this methodology, we distinguish the efficiency effect of taxes (effect of taxes on net production) from their redistributive effect (effect on lifetime consumption inequalities), while accounting for endogenous pension choices. In a redistributive economy, we find that the presence of a pension scheme attenuates the usual forces that govern the welfare effects of tax reforms. While usually taxes are useful to redistribute wealth across agents and are detrimental to efficiency, the feedback effects of taxes on pension incentives introduce new forces that play in the opposite directions, making taxes both less redistributive and less detrimental to productive efficiency. In a specialized framework—same marginal utility of consumption for all agents, decreasing productivity and increasing pecuniary cost of work with age—we show that an optimal combination of tax and pension eliminates all rents coming from observable productivity differences. Furthermore it suppresses all upward labor supply distortions and reduces downward distortions. At the optimum the two instruments fully specialize: pensions provide the incentives to work, while taxes do all the redistribution. The study which is closest to ours is that of Cremer et al. (2004). Our framework, however, differs from theirs in a number of important dimensions. First, Cremer et al. (2004) adopt a mechanism design approach and when it comes to implementation allow for a general, hybrid policy instrument that incorporates both pensions and taxes. Second, at the implementation stage, they restrict their analysis to a simple form of heterogeneity (two types). Third, their pension is based on retirement age. Here, the pension scheme lets entitlements depend on the agents’ entire work history (through an aggregate statistic), and consequently the pension system exerts pressure on labor supply all over the agents’ life cycles. As a consequence, the interaction between the fiscal and pension instruments is more complex than the implicit tax on prolonged activity that is well explained by e.g. Gruber and Wise (1999) and Cremer and Pestieau (2016). Finally, it should be noted that the present study focuses on redistribution and ignores a number of important aspects of pension systems, such as uncertainty and insurance (Diamond and Mirrlees 1978; Golosov et al. 2016), political considerations (Cremer et al. 2008), and demographics (Brett 2012). The article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the economic environment, the government instruments, and the second-best problem. Section 3 explains how a pension system may constrain labor supply decisions and how this constraint depends on the shape of the nonlinear tax schedule, thus introducing the “feedback effects” of taxes on pension incentives. Section 4 shows that at the second-best optimum of a redistributive economy interior types have their labor supply constrained by the pension system, and that the pension feedback effects increase the redistributive role and decrease the efficiency role of income taxes. Section 4.6 provides a calibrated example with two types.",1

The conclusion of the literature is that the publication of polls influences how the electorate votes (Myerson and Weber 1993; Morton et al. 2015). This influence is the reason why many countries have restrictions on how, when and if a poll should be published. Chung (2012) provides information about poll restrictions in 83 countries and finds existence of a blackout period for pre-election opinion polls in 38 of them. The restrictions can range from a ban on publishing polls for a specific time before the election, like in Italy (15 days) or in Greece (15 days until 2014, 1 day since), to an outright ban during the entire campaign period like in Singapore. In the last decade in many countries there have been public discussions on whether these types of restrictions should be posed or lifted. In 2012 India’s Chief Election Commissioner stated that opinion polls and exit polls should both be banned.Footnote 1 A 2013 survey in the United Kingdom, where there is not a ban on publishing pre-election opinion polls, showed that three out of ten MPs supported the idea of such a ban.Footnote 2
 These restrictions and discussions show that the issue of the interaction between opinion polls and elections is important both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view. The motive behind such bans is usually to let the electorate vote “trully” without the influence of the results of opinion polls, an influence which is perceived as bad. The fear that polls may be biased, in which case the electorate might base its decision on false information, is often used to argue in favor of restrictions. Another argument is that basing the decision itself on the information generated by opinion polls might distort the election results away from the “ true” preferences of the electorate.Footnote 3 On the other hand, opinion polls are useful inasmuch as they clear some uncertainty in the political environment leading to more efficient decision making by political actors. Examples of uncertainty include uncertainty about valence of the candidates as e.g. in Kendall et al. (2015) or on the actual policy-ideology of candidates as in Baron (1994). In democracies with proportional representation system where parties compete for parliament seats, these seats can be seen as a measure of political power; a ruling party that controls enough seats to just secure a majority might be more moderate in its policies than a party that controls a larger fraction of the parliament. For this reason a moderate voter may choose not to vote for her favorite party if she feels that it may be too strong. Therefore a moderate voter who is happier with a more equal (or a particular) split of parliamentary seats would like to know how the rest of the voters will vote before she decides her own vote, implying that she would need to have some information about the distribution of the rest of the voters. This idea can be seen, for example, in McMurray (2017) or in Morton et al. (2015). In an experimental study Ceci and Kain (1982) show that moderate voters, when instructed that the latest poll showed that a candidate “ commanded a substantial lead over the other”, tend to report that they would vote for the trailing one. The goal of this paper is to examine the effects that opinion polls might have in the behavior of voters in proportional representation systems. In particular, we analyze under what conditions the publication of opinion polls during the electoral campaign leads to complete information. To do so, we construct a simple two-party proportional representation system with a continuum of voters and fixed policy proposals. It is assumed that the implemented policy is a combination of the parties’ proposals with weights given by their vote shares. Voters care about the implemented policy, which implies that they have preferences over the vote shares received by the parties. Even though there is a continuum of voters we will assume that they behave as if they could have some (small) impact on the electoral outcome. In this case, an agent’s optimal voting decision might depend on the other agents behavior. Voters have incomplete information about each other’s preferences and therefore about their voting behavior. A voter’s information about other voters’ preferences can be improved through a series of polls. Polls provide information on the percentage of people who declare that they will vote for each party as well as the percentage of undecided people. It is assumed that agents always respond honestly to the questions in the opinion polls. It turns out that the agents most likely to report that they do not know what they will vote yet are the more moderate ones. The paper first shows under which conditions on the distribution of citizens’ preferences a sequence of polls will be able to reveal the complete information case. With every poll the undecided mass of agents decreases, as more citizens are sure of what to vote. After enough polls agents have (almost) complete information. However, for other distributions of voters’ preferences, after a number of polls the undecided mass of agents stops decreasing and additional polls cannot provide any further information. The paper also shows that the implemented policy is not monotonic in the number of polls: the publication of one last additional poll before the election may result in an implemented policy that is further away from the policy that would result under complete information. To the best of our knowledge this is the only paper that examines polls and proportional representation together in a dynamic setting. It is also important to mention that this model provides three predictions: (1) the positive correlation between undecidedness and centrist ideologies, (2) the non-monotonicity of vote shares with respect to the number of opinion polls and (3) the decrease of the mass of undecided voters when more polls are published. As explained below, each of these three predictions can be also generated by other models but we do not know of any model that predicts the three of them at the same time. Many papers have examined how opinion polls affect voters and parties through the information they reveal. Denter and Sisak (2015) show that poll results affect campaigning spending which in turn affect how voters vote. Bernhardt et al. (2009), Morgan and Stocken (2008) and Meirowitz (2005) show that polls are used to clear uncertainty over voters preferences, but at the same time this can give rise to strategic poll answering on behalf of the voters. McKelvey and Ordeshook (1985) show that polls create a “bandwagon” effect in favor of the leading party, while Goeree and Großer (2006) and Taylor and Yildirim (2010) show that the opposite “underdog” effect can appear through the mobilization of the voters of the trailing party. In both of these papers it is argued that through polls it is possible that the “wrong” side may win. Klor and Winter (2006) show in an experiment that in both close and lopsided elections polls have a bandwagon effect, and in a later paper (Klor and Winter 2014) they use US Gubernatorial elections data to show that the increase in participation in elections is greater for the supporters of the leading candidate. Großer and Schram (2010) find similar results. Herrmann (2014) examines polls under proportional representation and shows that voters act strategically, trying to anticipate the future coalitions after the election takes place. In his model there are three types of voters using the results of polls to vote strategically in order to influence the future coalitions, while in our model there is a continuum of voters whose voting intentions have a dynamic relationship with poll results. The implemented policy seen as a compromise among different ideological sides, or power sharing, is not a new idea (Alesina and Rosenthal 1996; Grossman and Helpman 1996; Llavador 2006; Sinopoli and Iannantuoni 2007; Saporiti 2014; Matakos et al. 2015, 2016; Herrera et al. 2015) . Ortuño-Ortín (1997) discusses a two-party setting where implemented policy is a convex combination of the two parties’ platforms generated using a continuous function of the parties’ shares in the election. Sahuguet and Persico (2006) point out that in a proportional system parties need to maximize their share (rather the probability of getting at least 50% of the vote) and that the implemented policy is at least partly influenced by the minority party. 
Herrera et al. (2015), in a proportional representation setting similar to the one of this paper, show that the “marginal voter’s curse” has the effect that voters with low quality information abstain and do not vote for fear of casting a vote for the wrong side. Finally, voters may choose to support the party to which they feel least ideologically close, an idea which is shared by the concept of the “protest vote” by which voters may want to punish, or control the power of their favorite party (see eg. Myatt 2017). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model and provides the main results about the possible convergence to the full information case. Section 3 concludes.",

Parliamentary elections constitute one of the most classic examples where multiwinner rules are regularly used. For country-wide elections, societies typically use the district-based First-Past-the-Post rule, or a party-list system, or some mixture of the two [nonetheless, some countries use other rules for this purpose, such as SNTV or STV (Lijphart and Aitkin 1994)]. In smaller-scale elections, where it is possible for the voters to rank all the candidates, many other rules become available; for example, the k-Borda rule (Debord 1992) selects committees where each member receives broad support from the electorate, the Chamberlin–Courant rule (Chamberlin and Courant 1983) finds committees with diverse membership, and the Monroe rule (Monroe 1995) is designed to achieve proportional representation. Apart from political elections, multiwinner rules are useful for many other purposes: to shortlist candidates for a job interview (Barberà and Coelho 2008; Elkind et al. 2017), to determine the locations of public facilities (Zanjirani and Hekmatfar 2009), in a wide range of scenarios where resources need to be selected and assigned to the agents for their (shared) use (Skowron et al. 2016), in segmentation problems (Kleinberg et al. 2004), or even in search strategies of genetic algorithms (Faliszewski et al. 2017; Sawicki et al. 2017). In business applications, company strategists deciding which sets of products to advertise on the front pages of their websites implicitly use multiwinner elections to make their choices (Lu and Boutilier 2011, 2015). Since these tasks are very different in spirit, one may presume that not all rules are equally suitable for all scenarios. This makes the question of comparing different rules, and of understanding their nature and their shortcomings (including their computational difficulty), very relevant. One approach to advance our understanding of the nature of multiwinner rules is to view them as extensions of certain well-understood single-winner ones. For example, Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) can clearly be viewed as an extension of Plurality, because it selects the k candidates with the k highest numbers of the first-place votes. However, this is not the only point of view that one can take in generalizing Plurality. For instance, one could argue that a voter’s most preferred committee consists exactly of those k candidates that this voter ranks in top k positions, and, so, if under the Plurality rule a voter gives a point only to his or her most preferred candidate, then under a multiwinner Plurality a voter should give points only to those candidates that belong to his or her most preferred committee. In fact, this is exactly how the Bloc rule works, and one can argue that Bloc is an extension of Plurality to the multiwinner setting as well. Naturally, there are also many other rules that would qualify for this title. Our goal in this paper is to seek and study such rules. Our goal requires some justification. It is widely acknowledged that the single-winner Plurality rule has only one advantage: simplicity. Apart from this, it is considered a very bad rule—for instance, during the “Voting Power in Practice” workshop, held in 2010 at the Chateau du Baffy, Normandy, the participants (who were experts in voting procedures) were asked to rank election rules. Laslier (2012) reports that Plurality was considered the worst. One of the most serious drawbacks of Plurality is that voters are pressured to vote for one of the two candidates they predict are most likely to win, even if their true most preferred candidate is neither of them; they do that from the fear of casting a ‘wasted vote’ (Dummett 1984). However, in the multiwinner setting this pressure becomes milder, because there are more candidates to be elected. We view this as one reason why multiwinner analogues of Plurality are worth investigating. We seek multiwinner analogues of Plurality within the family of committee scoring rules, recently introduced by Elkind et al. (2017). This is a natural choice because Plurality belongs to the class of positional scoring rules and committee scoring rules generalize this class to the multiwinner setting. (However, looking for such rules beyond the class of committee scoring rules would not be unthinkable.) Further, we take the following axiomatic approach. We note that Plurality is the only single-winner scoring rule that satisfies the simple majority criterion,Footnote 1 which stipulates that a candidate ranked first by more than half of the voters must be the unique winner of the election. The fixed-majority criterion, introduced by Debord (1993), extends this notion to the world of multiwinner elections by requiring that, if there is a simple majority of voters, each of whom ranks the same k candidates in the top k positions (perhaps in a different order), then these k candidates should form the unique winning committee.Footnote 2 Thus, all in all, we seek committee scoring rules that satisfy the fixed-majority criterion. One can verify that SNTV fails the fixed-majority criterion for all \(k>1\), but that Bloc does satisfy it. Yet, Bloc is not the only fixed-majority consistent rule within the class of committee scoring rules. In fact, our approach led us to the discovery of a new class of voting rules, which includes all committee scoring rules satisfying the fixed-majority criterion. We call them top-k-counting rules. As in the case of Bloc, they take only the top k preferences of the voters into consideration. Specifically, under a top-k-counting rule, each voter awards points to every committee on the basis of the number of this voter’s top k candidates that are members of the committee; the committee with the most points collected from all the voters wins. The function that determines the score of a committee based on the number of committee members ranked in the top k positions by a voter will be called the counting function. As it turns out, the nature of this function (e.g., whether it is convex or concave) has very strong impact on both axiomatic and computational properties of the voting rule it defines. We provide an (almost) full characterizationFootnote 3 of fixed-majority consistent committee scoring rules and we analyze the computational complexity of their winner determination problems. More specifically, we obtain the following results: We prove that all committee scoring rules that satisfy the fixed-majority criterion are top-k-counting rules and we establish a condition on the counting function that is necessary and sufficient for the corresponding top-k-counting rule to satisfy the fixed-majority criterion. This condition is a fairly mild relaxation of the classic notion of convexity; in particular, if the counting function is convex then the corresponding top-k-counting rule satisfies the fixed-majority criterion. We show that a number of top-k-counting rules are \({\mathrm {NP}}\)-hard to computeFootnote 4 (for example, we show an example of a rule that closely resembles the Bloc rule and is hard even to approximate). There are, however, some polynomial-time computable ones (for example, the Bloc and the Perfectionist rules; the latter one is introduced in this paper). We show that if the counting function is concave, then the corresponding top-k-counting rule fails the fixed-majority criterion, but the rule seems to be computationally easier than in the convex case. Specifically, for top-k-counting rules defined via concave counting functions we present a polynomial-time \({(1-\frac{1}{e})}\)-approximation algorithm and an exact fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (parameterized by the number of voters) for the problem of computing the highest-scoring committees. All in all, there is no unique multiwinner analogue of Plurality, even if we restrict ourselves to polynomial-time computable committee scoring rules, but there is a rich class of such rules that deserves further investigation.",14

(2018) and Darmann (2018) respectively. In this setting, there is a set of agents and a set of activities to which the agents should be assigned, where each agent can take part in at most one activity. The agents’ preferences depend on the activity itself and the number of participants in that activity. As particular examples consider the organizer of a workshop who plans to set up social activities for the free afternoon, or a company that wants to provide free sports classes for its employees (Skowron et al. 2015) in order to raise their overall satisfaction. Since these take place simultaneously, each agent can take part in at most one activity; of course, the choice of abstaining from any activity, i.e., doing nothing, should be a valid option as well. It is plausible to assume that the preferences of the agents do not depend on the activity alone but also on the number of agents taking part in the respective activity, since, e.g., a table tennis tournament with 40 players and only one table will not be desired even by a passionate table tennis player. A natural goal of the organizer now would be to find a reasonable assignment of agents to activities without forcing an agent to participate when she is not willing to. Another example would be a company that has several possible projects to which some of its employees should be assigned instead of performing their common working tasks, as a bonus in form of a variation from their usual work or in order to let them gain additional experience in project work. However, each of the employees might have different preferences over the projects and the number of agents engaged in the corresponding project teams. As an efficiency consideration, the company is interested in assigning the employees in a way such that they bear a reasonable level of motivation in working on the projects; in particular, the company does not want that employees are poorly motivated for the assigned project with the corresponding team size in the sense that an employee would rather opt out (and perform their usual working tasks in the company instead). In this paper, we consider the group activity selection problem with ordinal preferences (\({\textsf {o}}\hbox {-}{\textsf {GASP}}\)), in which the agents’ preferences are strict orders over pairs “(activity, group size)” including the possibility “do nothing” to which we refer as the void activity. The goal, of course, would be to assign agents to activities in a reasonable manner. As indicated above, a main requirement is that the assignment should be individually rational, meaning that no agent should be forced to take part in an alternative she deems unacceptable, i.e., would rather prefer doing nothing to. The purpose of this paper is to study the aspect of strategyproofness involved when such assignments are provided. Our contribution and relation to the literature Our focus is laid on the main solution concepts studied in the group activity selection problem: maximum individually rational, core stable, and Pareto optimal assignments respectively. In natural, special preference domains we analyze the strategyproofness of the respective single-valued aggregation functions and possibly multi-valued aggregation correspondences with respect to the number of activities involved. 
Darmann et al. (2018) introduce the general group activity selection problem \({\textsf {GASP}}\), where the agents’ preferences are weak orders over the pairs “(activity, group size)”. There, the problems of finding a stable assignment, for stability notions such as Nash and core stability, and, above all, finding a maximum individually rational assignment—that is an assignment maximizing the number of agents assigned to a non-void activity in an individually rational assignment—are studied from a computational viewpoint in the approval-based variant \({\textsf {a}}\)-\({\textsf {GASP}}\). Darmann (2018) considers the problem of finding Pareto optimal and stable solutions in the strict preference setting of \({\textsf {o}}\)-\({\textsf {GASP}}\), for different stability notions including the one of core stability. In both works the focus is laid on the special cases of increasing and decreasing preferences. Loosely speaking, with increasing preferences an agent would like as many other agents as possible to join the same activity; in the decreasing preferences case, an agent would like to share the same activity with as few other agents as possible. In this paper we analyze the aspect of manipulability involved in providing maximum individually rational, core stable, and Pareto optimal assignments. Typically, these assignments are not unique; our main interest hence is laid on aggregation correspondences which output the set of all maximum individually rational, core stable, and Pareto optimal assignments respectively. We particularly focus on the special cases of increasing, decreasing, and—more generally—single-peaked preferences. Our results show that such an aggregation is, unfortunately, susceptible to strategic manipulation already for a small number of activities involved: while for the cases of one and two activities some robustness results can be achieved, for three activities all of the considered solution concepts allow for strategic manipulation with respect to each of the preference extensions considered. In addition, it turns out that the negative results generalize to an impossibility result for any aggregation process that respects individual rationality when the mild condition of unanimity is imposed (which is satisfied by basically any reasonable aggregation), for restricted instances of \({\textsf {o}}\hbox {-}{\textsf {GASP}}\) already (see Sect. 5.4). Whether the aggregation of individual preferences into a group solution is susceptible to strategic manipulation is one of the central questions in social choice theory. Such an aggregation function (which outputs a single outcome) or aggregation correspondence (which outputs a set of outcomes) is strategyproof, and hence not manipulable, if no agent can be better off by misrepresenting her true preferences. In its classical framework, both strategyproofness of aggregation functions [see, for instance, Barberà (2010), and the seminal papers by Gibbard (1973) and Satterthwaite (1975)], and of aggregation correspondences [see, e.g., Barberà et al. (2001), Brandt and Brill (2011) and Brandt and Geist (2014)] has been well-studied. Clearly, comparing different assignments, an agent will prefer one which yields the best alternative for her. Comparing sets of assignments, however, is less obvious. Instead of asking the agents to give a ranking over all possible sets of outcomes (which requires to rank an exponential number of possibilities), the typical assumption is that the preferences over the single alternatives can be extended to binary relations over sets of alternatives. Of course, such a preference extension can be performed in various ways [see, e.g., Barberà et al. (2004) and Barberà (2010)]. We consider the well-known Gärdenfors extension (Gärdenfors 1976) and include the natural maxi–max extension and maxi–min extension (see Moretti and Tsoukiàs 2012) in our analysis: in an optimistic mindset, one might hope for the most-preferred among the possible alternatives; having a pessimistic view, one might be worried by the least-preferred among the alternatives. Strategyproofness of coalition formation rules has been studied in several papers, often axiomatically motivated. Rodríguez-Álvarez (2009) characterizes single-lapping rules over the domain of additively representable or separable preferences by four axioms including strategyproofness. Pápai (2004) uses strategyproofness as one of the characterizing axioms of these rules in general domains. Further literature on strategyproofness of coalition formation games, in connection with core stability, includes the works of Alcalde and Revilla (2004), Cechlárová and Romero-Medina (2001), and Sönmez (1999). Closely related problems have been considered in the works of Lee and Shoham (2015) and Long (2018). Both in the anonymous stable invitation problem (ASIP) of Lee and Shoham (2015) and in the group selection problem of Long (2018), the objective is to determine a single subgroup of agents in a reasonable way given the agents’ preferences over group size (including 0). ASIP can be understood as the group activity selection problem with a singleFootnote 1 activity; Lee and Shoham (2015) provide the impossibility result that a strategyproof mechanism for ASIP that always outputs an individually rational and envy-free solution cannot exist. Also the group selection problem of Long (2018) might be interpreted as the group activity selection problem with a single activity under a certain domain restriction. Long (2018) assumes the agents’ preferences to be strict and single-peaked, where their notion of single-peakedness implies that each agent’s set of group sizes preferred over the outside option is an (possibly empty) integer interval starting from one. In contrast, the notion of single-peakedness for the group activity selection problem used in this paper does not yield the analogous implication. However, Long (2018) proposes two aggregation functions (rules) that output a Pareto optimal and individually rational assignment, and provides an axiomatic justification for each of them. We add to these results by showing that, in the terminology used in our paper, a strategyproof aggregation function outputting a maximum individually rational assignment cannot exist in the group activity selection problem with only one activity when all agents’ preferences are decreasing (and therefore single-peaked), while for the increasing case each such aggregation function is strategyproof. In addition, imposing a rather mild and natural condition—which is satisfied by all of the considered aggregation correspondences including the one restricted to Pareto optimal assignments—we provide a general impossibility result for aggregation functions and correspondences (w.r.t. Gärdenfors and maxi–min extension) for the case of two activities and increasing preferences. Note that our work distinguishes from Lee and Shoham (2015) and Long (2018) in several aspects. For instance, we mainly focus on aggregation correspondences instead of single-valued aggregation functions. Secondly, with maximum individual rationality and core stability we consider different solution concepts. Thirdly, we take into account also the case of more than just one activity. In particular, for the maxi–max, maxi–min and Gärdenfors extension we provide the link between strategic manipulability and the number of available activities in the considered group activity selection problem. Further related work includes those of Jackson and Nicolò (2004) and Massó and Nicolò (2008). In their setting, agents have preferences over both alternatives and group size, and the goal is to determine a single alternative together with a group of agents who jointly use the alternative. Massó and Nicolò (2008) assume gregarious preferences, i.e., for each alternative the agents want additional agents to join the group; the focus is laid on efficient and both internally and externally stable allocations. Jackson and Nicolò (2004) assume that for each group size the agents’ preferences over the alternatives are single-peaked; they consider the domains of pure congestion and pure cost-sharing as special cases (these domains translate to the cases of decreasing and increasing preferences respectively in our framework). They provide the result that, even in the domain of pure congestion, only dictatorship is compatible with strategyproofness, Pareto efficiency and the property of outsider independence. Finally, the group activity selection problem is also related to anonymous and non-anonymous hedonic games. Note that in non-anonymous hedonic games, agents have preferences over the possible coalitions they could be part of; in the anonymous variant these preferences only depend on the size of the coalition. In contrast, in \({\textsf {o}}\hbox {-}{\textsf {GASP}}\) (and in \({\textsf {GASP}}\) in general), the agents’ preferences depend both on the considered activity and the size of the group of agents participating in that activity. However, the setting of \({\textsf {GASP}}\) (and hence \({\textsf {o}}\hbox {-}{\textsf {GASP}}\)) can, in a somewhat bulky and artificial way, be embedded in the general hedonic game framework (see Darmann et al. 2018 for details). In particular, the model considered in this work allows for a much more compact representation and has some natural special cases to which we turn our attention. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the model of \({\textsf {o}}\hbox {-}{\textsf {GASP}}\) and some basic definitions. The concepts of strategyproofness and the preference extensions involved are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we discuss manipulability in the case of a single activity. Section 5 considers the aspect of strategic manipulation involved when there are at least two activities, and ends with a general impossibility result for any aggregation function/correspondence satisfying unanimity. Section 6 provides an outlook towards future research questions and concludes the paper.",2

Preferences are given as a weak order for each voter. Using this information, social choice functions choose a set of winning alternatives. Suppose instead that the goal is to split the alternatives into good alternatives and bad alternatives with the separation between both sets being as large as possible. Duddy et al. (2014) note that social choice functions, viewed as producing a partition into winning and non-winning alternatives, are not the right tool for this task. For example, consider a class of students that is to be divided into beginners and advanced learners based on how they are ranked by teachers. The goal is to form two groups of students such that the differences in skill level within each group are as small as possible. If all teachers agree on their top-ranked student, any reasonable social choice function would uniquely choose the unanimously top-ranked student. Hence, the group of advanced learners would consist of only this one student; all other students would be put into the beginners group. In our example this is likely to be an undesired result, since the differences in skill within the beginners group would be barely reduced compared to the entire class. Thus, we need to drop some of the properties that seem appealing for social choice functions. A more suitable tool for our task are social dichotomy functions (Duddy et al. 2014), which yield ordered 2-partitions of the alternatives. We interpret ordered 2-partitions as having the approved alternatives in the first set and the disapprovedalternatives in the second set. In contrast to selecting the best alternatives, there is inherent symmetry in the problem of finding a good separation; in particular, social dichotomy functions should usually satisfy reversal symmetry: if all of the inputpreferences are reversed, then the output will also be reversed, so that approved and disapproved alternatives switch place. Social dichotomy functions are appealing as a tool for summarizingpreference information: a group can compile their preferences to obtain a single binaryclassification into promising and unpromising alternatives. In general, the input and output of a social dichotomy function may express any kind of structure on the set of alternatives; it need not suggest a better–worse relationship. For example, suppose a number of experts has different assessments on how political parties should be ordered on the left–right spectrum. Based on this information, a social dichotomy function can be used to group parties into left-wing and right-wing.Footnote 1 We consider a social dichotomy function that is based on Borda scores. A preference profile specifies for each voter a weak order on an alternative set A. Given a preference profile, the (symmetric) Borda score of an alternative a is obtained as follows: a gains a point for each voter i and each alternative b such that \(a\succ _i b\); a loses a point if \(b\succ _i a\); no points are assigned if \(a\sim _i b\). Hence, the average Borda score is 0. Borda’s rule is the social choice function that returns the alternatives with maximum Borda score. The social dichotomy function that we consider in this paper is the Borda mean rule which outputs all dichotomous weak orders in which all alternatives with above-average Borda score are approved, and all alternatives with below-average Borda score are disapproved. If there are alternatives with precisely average Borda score, then the rule returns several orders with all ways of breaking the ties. This rule was defined by Duddy et al. (2014) and further discussed by Duddy et al. (2016, Section 5) and Zwicker (2018). Notice that the Borda mean rule satisfies reversal symmetry. An example illustrating the Borda mean rule is given in Fig. 1. A preference profile for three voters and five alternatives. Each column depicts the preferences of one voter whose preference ranking is listed from top to bottom. The symmetric Borda scores of a and b are 12 and 6, respectively; each of c, d, and e has a symmetric Borda score of \(-\,6\). Hence, the Borda mean rule returns the dichotomous weak order that approves a and b and disapproves c, d, and e. Note that even though b is Pareto dominated by a, b is approved Reversal symmetry (similarly defined) is also a natural property for socialpreference functions, which return a set of linear orders of the alternatives. We will see that social dichotomy functions are more closely related to social preferencefunctions than to social choice functions. Kemeny’s rule (Kemeny 1959) is an example of a social preference function that has been very influential in social choice theory. Young (1995) predicted that “the time will come when it is considered a standard tool for political and group decision making”. Given a preference profile, the rule assigns to each possible weak order \(\succcurlyeq \) a Kemeny score: the order gains a point for each voter i and each pair of alternatives \(a,b\in A\) such that \(a\succ b\) and \(a\succ _i b\); the order loses a point if \(b \succ _i a\); no points are assigned if \(a \sim _i b\). Thus, the Kemeny score of\(\succcurlyeq \) indicates how much pairwise “agreement” there is between the output order \(\succcurlyeq \) and the input preferences. Kemeny’s rule returns the set of all linear orders with maximum Kemeny score. 
Zwicker (2018) introduced the idea of using Kemeny scores to define aggregation rules for other output types. For example, suppose we maximize the Kemeny score over the family of relations \(\{x\} \succ A{\setminus }\{x\}\) that have a unique most-preferred element and that are indifferent between all other alternatives. This yields precisely the relations whose most-preferred element is a winner of Borda’s rule. In his paper, Zwicker (2018) proposed the k-Kemeny rule which returns the k-chotomous weak orders of highest Kemeny score; a weak order \(\succcurlyeq \) is called k-chotomous if its induced indifference relation \(\sim \) partitions A into at most k indifference classes.Footnote 2 2-chotomous orders are usually called dichotomous; these are the orders that partition the alternatives into a set of approved and a set of disapproved alternatives. Hence, the 2-Kemeny rule is a social dichotomy function. Duddy et al. (2014) showed that the 2-Kemeny rule is identical to the Borda mean rule. This equivalent definition of the Borda mean rule suggests that it is a good tool for finding dichotomies that maximize the separation between the set of approved and the set of disapproved alternatives. Social choice theory abounds with proposals for voting rules; which of them should we use, and in which contexts? Axiomatic characterizations provide some of the strongest reasons in favor of using certain rules. For example, Kemeny’s rule is largely seen as a very attractive social preference function because of its characterization by Young and Levenglick (1978) [though there are other reasons, such as the rule’s interpretation as a maximum likelihood estimate (Young 1988)]. In this paper, we present an axiomatic characterization of the Borda mean rule, using the same axioms as the characterization of Kemeny’s rule by Young and Levenglick (1978). Thus, the above argument in favor of Kemeny’s rule applies just as well to the Borda mean rule, hopefully establishing its place as a very natural social dichotomy function. In formal terms, our result is that the Borda mean rule is the unique social dichotomy function satisfying neutrality, reinforcement, faithfulness, and the quasi-Condorcet property.Footnote 3 Our proof follows a similar structure to Young’s (1974a) characterization of Borda’s rule. In particular, we also use linear algebra and exploit the orthogonal decomposition of weighted tournaments popularized in social choice theory by Zwicker (1991).Footnote 4 In contrast to Young and Levenglick (1978), we do not need any convex separation theorems. Most of our axioms are commonly used, including the uncontroversial axioms of neutrality (requiring that all alternatives are treated equally) and faithfulness(requiring sensible behavior in single-voter situations). Reinforcement (often known asconsistency) is the workhorse of many axiomatic characterizations in social choice. It is a variable-electorate axiom which requires that if the same dichotomy is selected in two disjoint profiles, then it is still selected if we merge the two profiles into one. Reinforcement is typically satisfied by rules which maximize a sum of the “scores” that each voter assigns to a potential output. The most specialized axiom in ourcollection is the quasi-Condorcet property, introduced by Young and Levenglick (1978) and also used by Barthélemy and Janowitz (1991). It requires that a “dummy alternative” (one that is tied with every other alternative in a pairwise majoritycomparison) can move around freely within the output relation. (We give a formaldefinition below.) The quasi-Condorcet property is stronger than the cancellation axiom and thus, in conjunction with reinforcement, implies that the output can only depend on the weighted majority relation (see Lemma 2). None of the four axioms in our collection can be dropped without the characterization result breaking down (see Sect. 8). Our result applies to various possible input types. In particular, it applies when votes are given by linear orders, or when they are given by arbitrary weak orders. It also applies to j-chotomous weak orders whenever \(j \geqslant 3\); thus, our result characterizes Zwicker’s (2018) (j, 2)-Kemeny rule for each \(j\geqslant 3\), which is the Borda mean rule as applied to profiles of j-chotomous weak orders. More generally, our proof works whenever the domain of allowed preference orders forms a McGarvey domain, that is, whenever every possible weighted majority tournament (with only even weights or only odd weights) can be induced by a profile using such orders. The domains of linear orders, of weak orders, and of j-chotomous orders (\(j\geqslant 3\)) are McGarvey domains. In contrast, the domain of dichotomous orders is not a McGarvey domain, and our proof does not apply to this domain.",5

By payment services, we mean the services provided by the banking system that facilitate payment for goods and services. There is of course, a large literature on the optimal taxation of fiat money, the so-called inflation tax literature. This literature focuses on conditions for the zero taxation of cash, i.e. the Friedman rule, which says that the nominal interest rate should be zero. In this literature, however, it is assumed, without exception, that cash is the only medium of payment, or that some goods can be bought on credit, and so the issue of how services provided by the banking system should be taxed is not addressed.Footnote 1 This focus on cash may have been justified years ago, when the use of a bank account meant the writing of a check, and most transactions were made using cash. However, the focus on the literature on cash is clearly increasingly unrealistic because technological advances have allowed so-called electronic transfer of funds at the point of sale, by using credit and debit cards. These services are rapidly overtaking cash as means of payment for retail transactions.Footnote 2 For example, based on a large-scale payment diary survey, conducted between 2009 and 2012 in seven major countries, Bagnall et al. (2016) report that the share of the number of transactions with cash is on average of 62% (between 46 and 82%, varying by country), while its value share is on average of 35% (between 15 and 65%).Footnote 3 As expected, this shows that a larger number of smaller transactions are made by cash, and that larger value transactions are made by other means. In recent years, the share of cash has fallen further. For example, in the US, the share of cash in retail transactions fell from 40% in 2012 to 32% in 2015 (Matheny et al. 2016). On the other hand, it is unlikely that cash will disappear altogether as a medium of payment; as reported by the Cash Product Office of the US Federal Reserve, “In 2015, cash continued to dominate small-value transactions, with cash being used for more than 50% of transactions under $25....(and) for more than 60% of purchases under $10.” (Matheny et al. 2016, p6). Again, in another large scale payment diary survey in the Euro Area in 2016, for a subset of EU countries, Esselink and Hernández (2017) report an even higher ratio of cash usage than Bagnall et al. (2016), for countries such as Cyprus, Greece, and Malta, which used above 70% cash by transactions value. Does the choice of payment method matter? At a macroeconomic level, Philippon (2015) and Bazot (2018), show that the costs of financial intermediation for the banking sector in the US and Europe are considerable; for the US, they estimate these costs at around 2.5% of assets intermediated. The specific costs of operating payments services such as Mastercard, Visa etc are also large; for example a 2012 study by the European Central Bank estimated the average resource cost of non-cash payment systems across EU-27 at about 1% of GDP (Schmiedel et al. 2012). This translates to about 2.8% of the value of consumption facilitated by payments systems.Footnote 4 But, these costs have to be set against the benefits to consumers in terms of greater time saving, convenience, and security. Given these two methods of payment for goods, the question then arises as to how they should be taxed, if a government has to use distortionary taxes to raise revenue. This paper studies the optimal tax structure in a model that combines the transaction cost theory of the demand for money (for example Correia and Teles (1996), Teles (2003)), with the model of Freeman and Kydland (2000), which allows for substitution between cash and use of bank accounts. In our model, the household demands different varieties of goods in different quantities, and these can be paid for either by cash, or by electronic transfer of funds at the point of sale, provided by a bank account. We will call this account a payment account (PA).Footnote 5 The time transactions cost of using cash is modeled in the usual way, by assuming that goods bought with cash require a time input from the household, which can be lowered by holding a higher stock of real money balances. We model the cost of using a PA by assuming that the bank charges a per transaction fee to the seller of the good, which is then passed on to the consumer by the seller.Footnote 6 To make our point as clearly as possible, we assume the use of the PA requires no time input from the household. While this is an abstraction, it is increasingly close to reality, with so-called ”contactless” payment via debit card, and mobile phone apps for management of bank accounts becoming increasingly widespread. To ensure that the choice between cash and a PA is not trivial, we assume that cash has a real resource cost, as in Correia and Teles (1996). The reason for this is that if cash were free, the optimal inflation tax would be zero, and then the household would use only cash.Footnote 7 We then show that in equilibrium, there will be a ”switch point” above which varieties in greater demand will be bought using the PA. The government has a fixed revenue requirement in each period, and to finance this, can tax the payment fees charged by banks, and can also tax real money balances via an inflation tax. In addition, the government has the use of a consumption or income tax. In this setting, we characterize optimal payment service taxes i.e. the structure of taxes on both real money balances and the fees, as well as the consumption tax. Our main contribution is to develop simple formulae for the optimal ad valorem taxes on both real money balances and transactions fees. It turns out that the structure of taxes on these two payment methods only depend on the characteristics of the time transactions cost of cash, not the form of the household utility function. Specifically, in our setting, the time used for transactions is a function of the quantity of goods bought with cash (cash purchases), and real money balances. Then, both the sign of each tax, and the ratio of these two taxes, depend only on the properties of the time transactions cost function. Assuming that this function is homogeneous of degree k,  both taxes are decreasing in k. The tax on cash is also increasing in elasticity of the marginal time transactions cost of additional cash purchases with respect to real money balances. Similarly, the tax on fees is also increasing in elasticity of the marginal time transactions cost of additional cash purchases with respect to cash purchases. If \(k\le 1\), the tax on real money balances is always positive, but the tax on fees may be negative. We also find conditions on the time transactions cost of cash such that the taxes are positive, and that the tax on cash is always higher than the tax on fees. The general intuition for these results is based on the concept of a “virtual” time endowment. Specifically, we can reduce the tax design problem for the government to a completely standard one, except that the household has, instead of a fixed time endowment, a “virtual” time endowment that is endogenous, and depends on k and the share of goods bought with cash and real money balances. This virtual time endowment is of course not directly taxable, but can be indirectly taxed by taxes on payment services insofar as they affect the share of goods bought with cash and real money balances. For example, a tax will be positive if it indirectly reduces the virtual time endowment. Thus, in general terms, the intuition is similar to that of Corlett and Hague (1953), who argue that taxes should be set to indirectly tax non-taxable leisure. However, the specific mechanism is quite different; in Corlett and Hague (1953), the key variable is the degree of complementarity in preferences between leisure and the taxed goods. Here, it is the properties of the transactions technology that are key. We also relate our results to the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) production efficiency result. One can interpret the transactions technology in our model as a form of household production, where inputs in the form of cash balances and PAs, combined with market purchases and time, produce final consumption. Our result is that even with a constant returns transactions time technology, these inputs to final consumption should generally be taxed. In other words, the Diamond–Mirrlees principle that inputs should not be taxed with constant returns in production does not extend to the household in this context. Our results also have implications for the literature on the optimal inflation tax. For example, we show that the findings of Correia and Teles (1996) are not robust to introducing substitutability between cash and PAs.Footnote 8 Specifically, we show that when both payment media are used, real money balances should be taxed even when \(k=1\), in contrast to their findings when cash is the only medium of payment.Footnote 9 We then turn to some numerical simulations, using a calibrated version of the model. We find that, consistently with our analytical results, both the inflation tax and the tax on fees decrease markedly as the returns to scale in transactions costs increase from zero to one. The results show also that both inflation tax and the tax on fees decrease as the bank fee increases. This is interesting as the move away from cash that we currently observe is ultimately driven by technological innovation that reduces fees. Moreover, when the fee is large or when returns to scale are close to one, the tax on fees can be negative i.e. bank fees should be subsidized. We also find that the tax on bank fees can be greater or less than the rate of consumption tax although both taxes are of the same order of magnitude. Our findings have some implications for the current policy debate on the taxation of banks, especially in Europe, where it is the view of many, including the European Commission, that banks are under-taxed, because many of their services are exempt from VAT.Footnote 10 In this debate, it is largely assumed that within a consumption tax system, such as a VAT, it is desirable to tax financial services at the standard rate of VAT e.g. Ebrill et al. (2001).Footnote 11 Our results provide some support for this position, in that we find that payment services provided by banks should be taxed positively in a number of cases. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of related literature. Sections 3–5 outline the model. Section 6 presents the main results. Section 7 presents a calibrated version of the model, and Sect. 8 concludes.",3

Applications of such an approach do exist, for instance, in social sciences (in particular, in economics) and philosophy whenever we have to handle situations in which sets of objects need to be compared on the basis of pure ordinal information about the individual objects. This problem has been widely discussed in the social choice literature and normative justifications for such rankings over sets of objects have been provided (see Barberà et al. 2004 for an extensive survey). However, also the literature on fair division of indivisible objects is concerned with the comparison of sets of objects whenever different allocations have to be compared. Recently, various papers explicitly use the sum of some kind of positional scoresFootnote 1 with respect to the ranking of the single objects and, in particular, Borda scoresFootnote 2 of its respective elements (and their sum of points) to compare the different sets (see, e.g., Brams and Taylor 2000; Brams et al. 2003; Brams and King 2005; Bouveret and Lang 2011; Baumeister et al. 2017; Brams et al. 2017 or Kilgour and Vetschera 2018). In that literature the Borda-sum ranking is used to deal with issues such as efficiency, proportionality or envy-freeness, because these are hard to tackle with purely ordinal and non-additive information. A thorough analysis of rules based on Borda scores for the objects has - to the best of our knowledge—not yet been considered.Footnote 3 We fill this gap by providing axiomatic characterizations for the Borda-sum ranking. However, we will show that its use also comes at a certain price. In particular, we show that, using Borda scores, any comparison of sets of objects depends on the total number of objects available. A change in this number may change the ranking between the sets. This problem exists for all types of comparisons, whether they are between sets of equal cardinality or unequal cardinality. Nevertheless, there might still be acceptable applications for such a rule. These may, for instance, require the assumptions that the set of objects is clearly fixed and unchangeable and that we are comparing exclusively sets of equal cardinality. Given such a restricted framework, we provide a characterization of the whole family of rules based on Borda scores that compare sets of equal cardinality. In addition, we extend this characterization to rules that compare sets of unequal cardinality. Our characterization results are, essentially, built upon four different axioms. Those contain well-known axioms from the literature, such as Extension Rule and Strict Independence, but will also introduce two new axioms. One of them, Trading, is concerned with compensating the switch in an object with its lower ranked neighbor by another switch of another object with its higher ranked neighbor. An axiom of a certain resemblance is given in Bossert and Slinko (2006) (by means of Translation Neutrality), which requires that if the best (worst) objects of two sets are translated by one position, the relative ranking of the resulting sets does not change. The second, Irrelevance of Worst Object, determines a sort of origin to the Borda score by assuming that the worst object has essentially zero value and therefore does not increase the value of a set in case it is added. Related work. The general problem of ranking sets of objects admits many interpretationsFootnote 4 (Barberà et al. 2004). For instance, one could be interested in situations in which, from any set of objects, eventually one will be chosen. In that respect rankings are mostly determined by comparing either the best or worst (or both) objects in the sets.Footnote 5 On the other hand, additive rules, in the more general setting of additively representable preferences over sets of n-tuples (via some utility representation), have also been analyzed (see, e.g., Fishburn 1970). We add to that literature by aggregating Borda scores with respect to the ranking over the single objects for the comparison of sets of objects. For the considered setting the question about additive representability of the preferences via some real-valued function v is hence also related to de Finetti (1931) who provides necessary conditions for an additive representability via v. In a more recent work, Alcantud and Arlegi (2008) analyse the family of rankings over finite subsets of a given set that are additively representable. This work also has a certain vicinity to the freedom of choice literature in which freedom of choice from a set of objects is evaluated based on the ranking of the objects (see, e.g., Pattanaik and Xu 1990). Our paper, however, focuses on the evaluation of sets of objects when joint use is assumed, i.e., the objects are not mutually exclusive (see, e.g., Bossert 1995). The importance of such an approach can be seen, for example, in situations where political parties negotiate over the distribution of governmental departments in a coalition, firms have to agree on a distribution of tasks among them, teams of workers have to be assigned, or sets of objects in a divorce settlement are allocated. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the formal framework. In Sect. 3 we present a paradoxical situation in connection with the Borda-sum ranking. Section 4 provides a characterization of a family of rules based on Borda scores that compare sets of equal cardinality. This is extended to a characterization of a particular family of rules for comparing sets of unequal cardinality in Sect. 5. The independence of the axioms is shown in Sect. 6 and, finally, Sect. 7 concludes the paper.",5
53.0,3.0,Social Choice and Welfare,20 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-019-01191-9,Strategyproof judgment aggregation under partial information,October 2019,Zoi Terzopoulou,Ulle Endriss,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The framework of logic-based judgment aggregation introduced by List and Pettit (2002) provides a rich environment in which to study collective decision making. It has been found useful by researchers in Legal Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Mathematics, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence (alike see, e.g. List and Puppe 2009; List 2012; Grossi and Pigozzi 2014; Endriss 2016). While there now is a substantial and significant body of literature on a variety of topics in judgment aggregation, the analysis of the incentives of individuals to misrepresent their own judgments has only received limited attention to date. One aspect in particular so far has been ignored entirely, namely the fact that in practice an individual considering to manipulate the outcome of a judgment aggregation rule typically will not have full information regarding the judgments to be submitted by her peers, which intuitively constrains her own ability to manipulate successfully. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a model of strategic manipulation in judgment aggregation under partial information. Example. To illustrate the basic idea, we begin with an example, inspired by Bovens and Rabinowicz (2006). Suppose a committee of five professors—Alice, Bob, Carol, Deniz, and Enrique—has to decide whether one of their junior colleagues should receive tenure. Regulations stipulate that the candidate needs to be found to perform at an excellent level with regards to research, teaching, and service to the profession. They also stipulate that on each of these issues the committee should decide by majority, and tenure should be granted if and only if there is a majority for each of the three issues. The private views of the committee members are shown in the following table: Committee Research? Teaching? Service? Tenure? Alice Yes No Yes No Bob Yes Yes Yes Yes Carol Yes Yes Yes Yes Deniz No No No No Enrique No Yes Yes No Let us refer to the issues of excellence in research, teaching, and service as the premises and to the issue of whether tenure will be granted as the conclusion. Thus, the committee is using the well-known premise-based rule (Pettit 2001; Dietrich and Mongin 2010). If all committee members provide truthful judgments, then tenure will be granted, as there will be a majority on each of the three premises. Now consider Alice, who would not be entirely happy with this outcome. If she—somehow—knows the others will vote as shown in the table, then she can lie and claim that she believes the candidate’s performance on research to be insufficient. In that case, the majority decision on research would come out negative and tenure would not be granted. Thus, given full information and assuming Alice only cares about the conclusion, she has an incentive to manipulate. In fact, this does not change if she has less information. Even if she has no information at all about the expected judgments of her colleagues, she could simply vote “No” on all three premises, which would be a safe strategy that would avoid the candidate getting tenure whenever Alice’s judgment is pivotal on any of the premises she truthfully accepts, and it would simply not change the outcome on the conclusion in all other cases. But for the actual scenario above, a lie by Alice on the candidate’s performance regarding service would be an ineffective lie, as the majority in favour is too strong to begin with. Now suppose Alice cares not only about the conclusion: the outcome on the conclusion is what is most important to her but, all else being equal, she would rather have the collective judgment on the premises recorded in the official minutes of the meeting to be as close as possible to her own truthful judgments. Thus, if it does not affect the conclusion, she would not want to lie about a given premise. Hence, if Alice does not have full information and is unsure whether she is pivotal on the issues of research and service, then she cannot safely manipulate. Related work  The idea of modelling strategic individuals who may manipulate by misrepresenting their truthful judgments was introduced into the judgment aggregation literature by Dietrich and List (2007c).Footnote 1 Adopting an axiomatic perspective, Dietrich and List characterise the family of all strategyproof judgment aggregation rules, i.e., all rules that are immune to strategic manipulation, but also show that all rules that have certain desirable properties must be manipulable. These—largely negative—results presuppose full information on the part of any potential manipulator. In search for more positive news, one route to take is to impose domain restrictions, i.e., to limit the range of judgments that a group can submit. For example, if the group’s judgments are always unidimensionally aligned,Footnote 2 then the majority rule—which is known to be strategyproof (Dietrich and List 2007c)—does not suffer from the familiar problem of sometimes returning inconsistent outcomes (List 2003). A second approach is to look for aggregation rules for which strategic manipulation may be mathematically (hence theoretically) possible, but computationally (hence practically) intractable. Such computational barriers against strategic manipulation in judgment aggregation were first considered by Endriss et al. (2012). For example, the problem of deciding whether the premise-based rule can be manipulated successfully in a given profile is NP-complete. Further results of this kind have been obtained by Baumeister et al. (2015) and de Haan (2017). But arguably the most natural approach towards containing strategic manipulation, namely informational barriers against manipulation, so far has been neglected in research on judgment aggregation. The situation is somewhat different in other areas of social choice theory. While voting and preference aggregation suffer from similarly negative results in the general case—starting with the seminal Gibbard-Sattherwhate Theorem (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975)—and while domain restrictions (Gaertner 2001) and computational barriers to manipulation (Conitzer and Walsh 2016) have been investigated extensively in this domain as well, in the context of voting there also have been several attempts at capturing the notion the partiality of the information available to a manipulator in an election. For instance, Osborne and Rubinstein (2003) propose a model under which every voter knows the preferences of a small sample of the electorate and believes that this sample is representative. Chopra et al. (2004) work with a directed graph, called the knowledge graph, where voter i is taken to know the preferences of voter j if there is an edge from node i to node j in the graph. Conitzer et al. (2011) investigate a more general setting, where the set of possible preference profiles\(\mathcal {W}_i\) that a voter i deems possible is given explicitly. This model is developed further by Reijngoud and Endriss (2012), who assume that the information available to each voter is induced by some opinion poll. This model, also employed by Endriss et al. (2016), is the closest to the one we are going to develop in this paper. Finally, in a related model explored by Meir et al. (2014), each voter is taken to consider possible the set of preference profiles in some neighbourhood of the true profile. Most of these authors, like us in this paper, assume that individuals are extremely risk-averse, in the sense that they will only consider manipulating if, given the information available to them, they consider it certain that the outcome will not be worse than if they vote truthfully and they consider it possible that the outcome will be strictly better. Our contribution  In this paper, we introduce a model of strategic manipulation in judgment aggregation under partial information and show that some—but not all—known negative results concerning the existence of reasonable strategyproof judgment aggregation rules break down once we abandon the classical assumption of full information. Concretely, the simple plurality rule, which selects the overall judgment chosen by the largest number of individuals and which fails to be strategyproof under full information (Dietrich and List 2007c)—is immune to strategic manipulation if individuals do not have any information about the judgments of others at all. While assuming zero information is a strong assumption, another result shows that we can always find an aggregation rule that fails to be strategyproof under full information but is strategyproof under partial (but nonzero) information. Our results regarding one of the most important judgment aggregation rules used in practice, the premise-based rule, heavily depend on the assumptions we wish to make regarding the preferences of the individuals, which—together with the information they have access to and the aggregation rule in use—determine their incentives to manipulate. Specifically, we distinguish whether individuals only care about certain issues or whether they care about different issues to different degrees. Our results show that (i) when individuals care much more about conclusions than premises, then the premise-based rule can be rendered strategyproof by withholding only a negligible amount of information and that (ii) when individuals care equally about all issues, then the premise-based rule is strategyproof under both full and partial information. These results provide an interesting contrast with a result due to Dietrich and List (2007c), which shows that when individuals care only about the conclusion, then the premise-based rule fails to be strategyproof (this also is true under both full and partial information). Paper overview  The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we summarise some of the fundamentals of judgment aggregation and fix our notation. In Sect. 3, we first recall relevant definitions and results due to Dietrich and List (2007c) and then introduce our model of strategic manipulation under partial information. Several results highlighting the differences between full and partial information are given in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 focuses on results regarding the premise-based rule.Footnote 3 Section 6 concludes. Proofs of all technical results have been relegated to the “Appendix”.",5

Li,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Public procurements account for a substantial part of economies worldwide. In the European Union (EU), more than 250,000 public authorities spend approximately 14% of GDP on the purchase of services and supplies each year.Footnote 1 Naturally, corruption is a common concern in public procurements. To prevent corruption, most countries implement laws and regulations to guarantee the necessary competition and transparency in public procurements. For instance, the EU requires a minimum of 35 days for a public contract notice in an open procedure, for which any business can submit a bid; and in a restricted procedure, for which only those who are pre-screened are invited to submit a bid, a public authority must invite at least 5 bidders to the competition process.Footnote 2 The belief underlying these rules is that competition may help improve efficiency and reduce corruption. The literature has mainly focused on the effects of competition on corruption, yet has paid relatively less attention to the reverse causality between them. In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation of the effects of corruption on equilibrium competition and social welfare in a public procurement auction. Specifically, in our model, there is a government agent, such as the Department of Defense, a bureaucrat who runs the auction on behalf of the government, and a number of potential firms who can submit bids for the government contract if invited. The government needs to pay costs to screen and invite firms to participate, and the corrupt bureaucrat may request a bribe from the winning firm.Footnote 3 We consider a standard first-price procurement auction, which is common in practice.Footnote 4 In the auction, the firm with the lowest production cost wins, and the price received by the firm is equal to its bid. Given the value of the contract, the government’s objective is to minimize the government spending, e.g., the sum of the invitation costs and the price paid to the winning firm. The bureaucrat, if corrupt, cares about a weighted average of the bribe received by him and the government payoff; if honest, his objective is in line with that of the government. In the absence of corruption, we first show that the bureaucrat will invite more than the socially optimal number of firms to the auction, under the standard assumptions that firms’ cost distribution is of decreasing reversed hazard rate (DRHR) and that there is a positive invitation cost.Footnote 5 In other words, the optimal number of firms that maximizes the government’s payoff is larger than the efficient number of firms that maximizes social welfare. This over-invitation result is not surprising as the government is not modeled as a social planner in our model. The intuition behind the result is that inviting an extra firm reduces the expected total surplus of the firms, due to increased competition, which is ignored by the payoff-maximizing government but is taken into account in the total social welfare. We then introduce corruption into the model, in which the bureaucrat requests a bribe from the winning firm of the auction. We consider two common forms of bribery. The first is a fixed bribe in which the bureaucrat requests the winning firm to pay a fixed amount as a bribe. For instance, the fixed bribe can be in the form of a commission fee or a kickback that is common in the real world (Inderst and Ottaviani 2012). The second is a proportional bribe, whereby the winning firm must share a proportion of its revenue with the corrupt bureaucrat (Acemoglu and Verdier 2000; Amir and Burr 2015). For example, in Indonesia, the former president Suharto was publicly known as “Mr. Twenty-Five Percent” because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation give him 25% of the income.Footnote 6 Our main result is that the effects of corruption on equilibrium competition and social welfare vary across different forms of bribery. When the bribe is a fixed amount, the corrupt bureaucrat invites the same number of firms as in the absence of corruption, as his marginal incentive of inviting firms remains the same as before. Therefore, corruption in this form does not affect equilibrium competition. However, it does change social welfare and resource allocation in equilibrium. We show that, under the expectation of paying a fixed bribe upon winning, all firms will mark up their bids by the same amount, which in turn increases the expected payment of the government to the winning firm. As a result, the fixed bribe is paid by the government, and it does not hurt the firms at all. The increased public expenditure by the government then implies welfare loss due to the marginal cost of distortion of public funds. By contrast, under a proportional bribe, the corrupt bureaucrat may invite either fewer or more firms to the auction, depending on how much the bureaucrat weights his personal interest relative to the government payoff. We first show that, in this case, firms will adjust their bids proportionally in equilibrium. Second, there are two opposite effects on the equilibrium competition. On the one hand, as firms’ bids increase proportionally, the distribution of the bids becomes more dispersed, which decreases competition in the auction. In response to it, the bureaucrat needs to encourage competition by inviting more firms. On the other hand, the bureaucrat also has an incentive to discourage competition, as the winning firm’s revenue is decreasing in the number of firms in the auction. The relative magnitude between these two opposite effects determines the equilibrium level of competition. We further investigate the effects of government information disclosure on auction outcomes. When firms’ areas of specialization are differentiated, revealing more project information by the government may induce a more dispersed distribution of firms’ cost estimates. For example, information disclosure may drive up the cost estimates of some firms that find it is a mismatch to their areas of specialization, while driving down those of others that find it to be a good match. As a result, firms’ cost estimates become more dispersed. We show that information disclosure increases both the efficient and the optimal number of firms in procurement auctions. The intuition is that under information disclosure, firms’ cost estimates become more dispersed, and the auction becomes less competitive than before. It is then better to invite more firms to participate in the auction. Finally, we also explore the policy implications of our results. For the regulation of public procurements, we show that imposing a requirement on the minimum number of bidders may be effective only when it lies in a reasonable range. For instance, if it is too low, it will not impose real restrictions on a corrupt bureaucrat’s choice; if it is too high, it may instead cause a welfare loss. Motivated by Rose-Ackerman (1978)’s argument that increasing in competition helps reduce corruption, there is a strand of literature studying the effects of competition on corruption in a large variety of economic contexts, and the results suggest that the relationship is complicated. For example, Shleifer and Vishny (1993) and Bliss and Di Tella (1997) show that the effect of competition on corruption depends on the nature of corruption. In the empirical studies, Ades and Di Tella (1999) and Emerson (2006) find that market competition and corruption are negatively related, while Alexeev and Song (2013) find a positive relationship between the strength of competition and the extent of corruption. The existing literature has paid relatively less attention to the effects of corruption on competition, though its empirical importance has been emphasized. One exception is Amir and Burr (2015), who examine theoretically the effects of corruption in the entry-certifying process on market structure and social welfare for a Cournot industry. Our paper joins a small but growing literature that restricts attention to corruption in public procurements.Footnote 7 Specifically, two papers examine the relationship between competition and corruption in procurement. Celentani and Ganuza (2002) study the impact of the number of potential suppliers on equilibrium corruption in the agency model and find that corruption may be higher in a more competitive environment. Compte et al. (2005) analyze the effect of corruption on price competition in which the corrupt bureaucrat may offer a firm an opportunity to readjust its bid and firms compete for this favor by making bribe offers. In this paper, we investigate the effects of various forms of bribery on the number of invited firms and social welfare in procurement auctions. In the context of auctions, corruption is commonly described as an act in which a bureaucrat manipulates the auction rules in exchange for bribes. For example, Compte et al. (2005) and Menezes and Monteiro (2006) consider a corruption model in which the bureaucrat may offer a favored firm an opportunity to readjust its initial bid in exchange for a bribe. Other related papers include Burguet and Perry (2009) and Arozamena and Weinschelbaum (2009). Another strand of literature studies corruption in multidimensional procurement auctions, whereby the government may care about both the price and quality of the project. Celentani and Ganuza (1999, 2002) and Burguet and Che (2004) examine corruption in which the bureaucrat manipulates the quality assessment to favor the firms offering higher bribes. In our paper, the auction rule is taken as given, yet the bureaucrat may endogenously determine the competition level in the auction. Specifically, the bribery studied in our paper is a form of “harassment bribe” (Basu 2011), in which the bribe is exchanged for delivering entitled services rather than undue favors. Our paper is also related to the literature on auctions with participation costs. The participation costs can be either paid by the bidders (McAfee and McMillan 1987; Levin and Smith 1994), or by the auctioneer (Szech 2011; Li 2017; Lee and Li 2018). The benchmark setting of our model is closely related to Szech (2011). Though different from her model of ascending second-price auction, we study a first-price procurement auction, yet the extension is straightforward according to standard auction theory. The key differences in our model are twofold: first, we consider a public procurement auction with a broader definition of social welfare, which takes Szech (2011) as a special case; second, the focus of our paper is on the effects of corruption on equilibrium bidding strategy, competition and social welfare in a public procurement auction. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the benchmark model of procurement auction with no corruption. Section 3 studies the equilibrium outcomes under corruption, and there are two cases, the fixed bribe and proportional bribe. Section 4 provides some further discussions, and Sect. 5 presents our concluding remarks.",1

We assume that the state is ex-post verifiable. We design stochastic mechanisms but do not assume either expected utility or quasi-linearity. The central planner attempts to achieve the allocation implied by the social choice function that is contingent on the state. The central planner, however, cannot observe the state before determining an allocation. Hence, he (or she) designs a mechanism to induce informed players to reveal their knowledges about the state. This mechanism must incentivize them to make the desirable (i.e., truthful) announcements as unique equilibrium behavior. The problem of this study is to clarify whether the central planner can design such effective mechanisms.Footnote 1 We assume that the state becomes verifiable after the central planner determines the allocation. For instance, by conducting a follow-up survey, the central planner obtains a resultant verifiable consequence of the allocation decision that includes information about the state. The central planner utilizes this information for ex-post monetary transfers with players as a clue to detecting their lying. We show that by making ex-post monetary transfers contingent on this verified information as well as their announcements, the central planner can design a mechanism to effectively penalize any detected liar, making all players willing to make their desirable announcements. Owing to this ex-post verifiability, we can impose the following various severe restrictions on mechanism design. We use iterative dominance in strict terms as the solution concept, which is defined as the set of all strategy profiles that survive through the iterative removal of strictly dominated strategies. We impose the uniqueness of such an iteratively undominated strategy for each player, even if iterative dominance is a very weak solution concept. Next, we require a mechanism to be bounded in the terminology of Jackson (1992); we consider only mechanisms whose message spaces are finite. Moreover, we use only small monetary transfers; we require any transfer to be close to zero off the equilibrium path, and even no transfers on the equilibrium path. We show that any social choice function is uniquely, and exactly, implementable in iterative dominance, where we design a bounded mechanism, use only small transfers, and make no transfers on the equilibrium path. Importantly, we do not assume either expected utility or quasi-linearity, even if we design a stochastic mechanism according to the method explored by Abreu and Matsushima (1992a, 1994). All we need on utility functions in this study is a much weaker condition than expected utility and quasi-linearity; each player’s utility function is continuous in monetary transfer and lottery, and is increasing in monetary transfer. It is generally important to investigate various aspects of bounded rationality in the implementation literature. This study designs a mechanism that has the unique equilibrium at every state; this equilibrium implies a simple honest-reporting behavior. However, to make players recognize that this is the unique one, the designed mechanism may force them to take an involved rational thinking. The number of iterations of reasoning to reach the uniqueness is an example of such complexity measures in iterative dominance. Glazer and Rosenthal (1992) pointed out that there is a trade-off between the length of this iteration and a focal point. Arya et al. (1995) demonstrated a simple mechanism in which two rounds of iterations are enough to reach the uniqueness. As a response to Glazer and Rosenthal, Abreu and Matsushima (1992b) emphasized the importance of public recognition that complicated iterations can be reduced to simple iterations of a single step argument. In contrast to these works, this study focuses on another question on bounded rationality; can a player properly make the desirable choice at a step even if he (or she) is not the expected-utility maximizer? This study gives a positive answer to this question. It is well known in the implementation literature that with no ex-post verifiability, Makin-monotonicity is a necessary condition for a social choice function to be implementable in Nash equilibrium (e.g., Maskin 1999). Maskin-monotonicity is a quite demanding condition for a deterministic social choice function. Matsushima (1988) and Abreu and Sen (1991) demonstrated a device of virtualness, which can drastically calm this difficulty by approximating a deterministic social choice function to a stochastic social choice function. However, this virtualness crucially depends on expected utility. In contrast, this study assumes ex-post verifiability. With ex-post verifiability, Maskin-monotonicity is no longer necessary. Because of this irrelevance, we can apply the Abreu–Matsushima stochastic method even to the case without expected utility (also without quasi-linearity) with ease. The functioning of the stochastic method a la Abreu and Matsushima relies just on the local linearity of preferences, which is automatically implied by the above-mentioned continuity and increasingness. There exist previous works such as Hansen (1985), Mezzetti (2004), and Deb and Mishra (2014) that incorporated verifiability into mechanism design. These works showed that verifiability makes incentive compatibility more easily satisfied. In contrast, this study’s concern is the impact of verifiability on uniqueness. In this respect, this study is related to Kartik and Tercieux (2012) and Ben-Porath and Lipmann (2012), which investigated full implementation with hard evidence, stating that the great degree to which each player’s showing hard evidences directly proves his (or her) announcement to be correct is crucial in full implementation. The companion paper (e.g., Matsushima 2017) extends this study’s result to the case in which the state is only partially verifiable. The organization of this study is as follows. Section 2 shows the model that assumes continuity and increasingness, instead of expected utility and quasi-linearity. Section 3 explains small monetary transfers and ex-post verifiability. Section 4 introduces iterative dominance. Section 5 constructs a mechanism that is finite and stochastic. Section 6 shows the main theorem. Section 7 generalizes this study’s results to incomplete information with two or more players. We show that even with incomplete information and even with two players, any ex-post incentive compatible social choice function is uniquely, and exactly, implementable in iterative dominance in the same manner as complete information with three or more players. Section 8 concludes.",4

For instance, both the outcome of a round-robin sports competition and the majority relation of voters in an election can be represented by a tournament. A question that occurs frequently is therefore the following: given a tournament, how can we choose the “best” alternatives in a consistent manner? This question has been addressed by a rich and beautiful literature on tournament solutions, which have found applications in areas ranging from sports competitions (Ushakov 1976) to multi-criteria decision analysis (Arrow and Raynaud 1986; Bouyssou 2004) to biology (Schjelderup-Ebbe 1922; Landau 1953; Slater 1961; Allesina and Levine 2011). Over the past half century several tournament solutions have been proposed, two of the oldest and best-known of which are the top cycle (Good 1971; Schwartz 1972; Miller 1977) and the uncovered set (Miller 1980).Footnote 1 Given that the purpose of tournament solutions is to discriminate the “best” alternatives from the remaining ones, it perhaps comes as a surprise that many common tournament solutions—including the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the minimal covering set—select all alternatives with high probability in a large random tournament (Fey 2008; Scott and Fey 2012). Put differently, the aforementioned tournament solutions almost never exclude any alternative in a tournament chosen at random. Nevertheless, these results are based on the uniform random model, in which all tournaments are drawn with equal probability, or equivalently each edge is oriented in one direction or the other with equal probability independently of other edges. For a large majority of applications of tournaments, one would not expect that this assumption holds. Indeed, stronger teams are likely to beat weaker teams in a sports competition, and candidates with a large base of support have a higher chance of winning an election. Moreover, real-world tournaments often exhibit a certain degree of transitivity: If alternatives a, b, and c are such that a dominates b and b dominates c, then it is more likely that a dominates c than the other way around. A more general model of random tournaments is the Condorcet random model, previously considered by Frank (1968), Łuczak et al. (1996), Vassilevska Williams (2010) and Kim et al. (2017). In this model, there is a linear order of alternatives, which can be interpreted as an ordering of the alternatives from strongest to weakest. For each pair of alternatives, the probability that the edge is oriented from the alternative that occurs later in the linear order to the alternative that occurs earlier in the linear order is p, independently of other pairs of alternatives.Footnote 2 Crucially, the value of p is the same for all pairs of alternatives. The Condorcet random model generalizes the uniform random model, since the latter can be obtained from the former by taking \(p=1/2\). Łuczak et al. (1996) showed that under the Condorcet random model, the top cycle selects all alternatives as long as \(p\in \omega (1/n)\). The same authors show furthermore that this bound is tight, that is, the statement no longer holds if \(p\in O(1/n)\).Footnote 3 Although the Condorcet random model addresses the issues raised above with regard to the uniform random model, it is still rather unrealistic for two important reasons. Firstly, in tournaments in the real world, the orientation of different edges are typically determined by different probabilities. For instance, in a sports tournament the probability that a very strong team beats a very weak team is usually higher than the probability that a moderately strong team beats a moderately weak team; a similar phenomenon can be observed in elections. Secondly, even though one can roughly order the alternatives in a tournament according to their strength, it is often the case that not all probabilities of the orientation of the edges respect the ordering. Indeed, this precisely corresponds to the notion of “bogey teams”—weak teams that nevertheless frequently beat certain supposedly stronger teams. Given the limitations of the uniform random model and the Condorcet random model, it is natural to ask whether previous results continue to hold under more general and realistic models of random tournaments, or whether they break down as soon as we move beyond these restricted models. In this paper, we show that a number of tournament solutions, including the top cycle and the uncovered set, still choose all alternatives with high probability under a significantly more general model of random tournaments. Unlike the Condorcet random model, our model does not rely on an ordering of the alternatives. Instead, the orientation of each edge is determined by probabilities within the range \([p,1-p]\) for some parameter p, and these probabilities are allowed to vary across edges. The only substantive assumption that we make is that the orientations of different edges are chosen independently from one another. Under this model, which is more general than both the uniform random model and the Condorcet random model, we establish in Sect. 3 that the top cycle almost never rules out any alternative as long as \(p\in \omega (1/n)\), thus generalizing the result by Łuczak et al. (1996). We also show that our bound is asymptotically tight, and that analogous results hold for two other tournament solutions based on the set of Condorcet winners and losers as well. Moreover, we prove in Sect. 4 that the uncovered set is likely to include the whole set of alternatives when \(p\in \omega (\sqrt{\log n/n})\). This bound is again asymptotically tight, and the same holds for another tournament solution based on the uncovered set. Since the condition that the top cycle or the uncovered set chooses all alternatives have meaningful graph-theoretic interpretations—the top cycle is the whole set of alternatives if and only if the tournament is strongly connected,Footnote 4 and the uncovered set fails to exclude any alternative exactly when all alternatives are kingsFootnote 5—we believe that our results are of independent interest in graph theory and discrete mathematics. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with experimental data in Sect. 5. The study of the behavior of tournament solutions in large random tournaments goes back to Moon and Moser (1962), who showed that the top cycle almost never rules out any alternative in a large tournament chosen uniformly at random. In fact, they proved a stronger statement that the probability that the top cycle excludes at least one alternative is inverse exponential in the number of alternatives; the estimate was later made more precise by Moon (1968) in his seminal book on tournaments. Bell (1981) also considered the top cycle but assumed that tournaments are generated from the preferences of a large number of voters, each with a uniform random ranking over the alternatives; he likewise found that the top cycle selects all alternatives with high probability under this assumption. Fey (2008) and later Scott and Fey (2012) established results on several tournament solutions including the uncovered set, the Banks set, the Copeland set, the minimal covering set, and the bipartisan set using the uniform random model. While the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the minimal covering set are likely to include all alternatives in a large random tournament, the same event is unlikely to occur for the Copeland set. On the other hand, the bipartisan set chooses on average half of the alternatives in a random tournament of any fixed size (Fisher and Ryan 1995); it is the unique most discriminating tournament solution satisfying standard properties proposed in the literature (Brandt et al. 2018). The discriminative power of tournament solutions has also been investigated empirically by Brandt and Seedig (2016). Building on the observation that the distributions of real-world tournaments are typically far from uniform, these authors examined the behavior of eleven common tournament solutions on tournaments generated according to stochastic preference models and empirical data. The stochastic models that they used include the impartial culture model, the Mallows mixtures model, and the Pólya–Eggenberger urn model. They reported that under these more realistic models, most tournament solutions are in fact much more discriminating than the analytical results for uniform random tournaments suggest.",5

Voters express themselves, a rule amalgamates them, thecandidates’ scores—measures of support—determine their order of finish, and the winner. Traditional methods ask voters to express themselves by comparing them: ticking one candidate at most (majority rule, first-past-the-post) or severalcandidates (approval voting), candidates’ total ticks ranking them; rank-ordering the candidates (Borda rule, alternative vote or preferential voting, Llull’s rule, Dasgupta–Maskin method, etc.), differently derived numerical scores ranking them. However, no traditional method measures the support of one candidate.Footnote 1 Instead, the theory of voting (or of social choice) elevates to a basic distinguishing axiom the faith that in an election between two candidates majority rule is the only proper rule. Every traditional method of voting tries to generalize majority rule to more candidates and reduces to it when there are only two candidates. Yet majority rule decides unambiguously only when there are two candidates: it says nothing when there is only one and its generalizations to three or more are incoherent. Using the majority rule to choose one of two candidates is widely accepted asinfallible: since infancy who in this world has not participated in raising their hand to reach a collective decision on two alternatives? de Tocqueville (1831, p. 379) believed “It is the very essence of democratic governments that the dominance of the majority be absolute; for other than the majority, in democracies, there is nothing that resists”.Footnote 2 Judging from Sadurski’s (2008, p. 39) assertion—“The legitimating force of themajority rule is so pervasive that we often do not notice it and rarely do we question it: we usually take it for granted”—that conviction seems ever firmer today. Students of social choice well nigh universally accept majority rule for choosing between two alternatives, and much of the literature takes Condorcet consistency—that a candidate who defeats each of the others separately in majority votes must be the winner (the Condorcet-winner)—to be either axiomatic or at least a most desirable property. Why this universal acceptance of majority rule for two candidates? First, the habit of centuries; second, May’s (1952) axiomatic characterization; third, the fact that it is strategy-proof or incentive compatible; fourth, the Condorcet jury theorem (Condorcet 1785). Regrettably, as will be shown, the majority rule can easily go wrong when voting on but two candidates. Moreover, asking voters to compare candidates when there are three or more inevitably invites the Condorcet and Arrow paradoxes. The first shows that it is possible for a method to yield a non-transitive order of the candidates, so no winner (Condorcet 1785). It occurs, e.g., in elections (Kurrild-Klitgaard 1999), in figure skating (Balinski and Laraki 2011a pp. 139–146, 2014a), in wine-tasting (Balinski and Laraki 2013). The second shows that the presence or absence of a (often minor) candidate can change the final outcome among the others. It occurs frequently, sometimes with dramatic global consequences, e.g., the election of George W. Bush in 2000 because of the candidacy of Ralph Nader in Florida; the election of Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 although all the evidence shows François Bayrou, eliminated in the first-round, was the Condorcet-winner. A recent econometric study of French parliamentary (1978–2012) and local (2011, 2015) elections Pons and Tricaud (2017) shows that in 19.2% of the 577 elections the presence of a third minor candidate in run-offs causes a change in the winner and concludes “that a large fraction of voters are ...‘expressive’ and vote for their favorite candidate at the cost of causing the defeat of their second-best choice” (Pons and Tricaud 2017, p. 42). How are these paradoxes to be avoided? Some implicitly accept one or the other (e.g., Borda’s method, Condorcet’s method). Others believe voters’ preferences are governed by some inherent restrictive property. For example, Dasgupta and Maskin (2004, 2008) appeal to the idea that voters’ preferences exhibit regularities—they are “single-peaked”, meaning candidates may be ordered on (say) a left/right political spectrum so that any voter’s preference peaks on some candidate and declines in both directions from her favorite; or they satisfy “limited agreement”, meaning that for every three candidates there is one that no voter ranks in the middle. Another possibility is the “single crossing” restriction (e.g., Barberà and Moreno 2011; Moulin 1988b; Puppe and Slinko 2015): it posits that both candidates and voters may be aligned on a (say) left/right spectrum and the more a voter is to the right the more she will prefer a candidate to the right. Such restrictions could in theory reflect sincere patterns of preference in some situations; nevertheless in all such cases voters could well cast strategic ballots of a very different stripe. Moreover, all the sets of ballots that we have studied show that actual ballots are in no sense restricted. There are many examples. (1) An approval voting experiment was conducted in parallel with the first-round of the 2002 French presidential election that had 16 candidates. 2587 voters participated and cast 813 different ballots: had the preferences been single-peaked there could have been at most 137 sincere ballots (Balinski and Laraki 2011a, p. 117). (2) A Social Choice and Welfare Society presidential election included an experiment that asked voters to give their preferences among the three candidates: they failed to satisfy any of the above restrictions (Brams and Fishburn 2001; Saari 2001). (3) A recent study of voting in Switzerland uses principal component analysis to show that at least three dimensions are necessary to map voters’ preferences, so the one-dimensional single-peaked condition cannot be met (Etter et al. 2014). Real ballots—true opinions or strategic choices—eschew ideological divides. All of this, we conclude, shows that the domain of voters’ preferences is in real life unrestricted. An entirely different approach is needed. This has motivated the development of majority judgment (Balinski and Laraki 2007, 2011a, 2014a) based on a different paradigm: instead of comparing candidates, voters are explicitly charged with a solemn task of expressing their opinions precisely by evaluating the merit of every candidate in an ordinal scale of measurement or language of grades. Thus, for example, the ballot in a presidential election could ask: Having taken into account all relevant considerations, I judge, in conscience, that as President of France, each of the following candidates would be: The language of grades constituting the possible answers may contain any number of gradesFootnote 3 though in elections with many voters five to seven have proven to be good choices. A scale that has been used is: 
Outstanding, Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor, To Reject;
 The method then specifies that majorities determine the electorate’s evaluation of each candidate and the ranking between every pair of candidates—necessarily transitive—with the first-placed among them the winner. Majority judgment has been criticized by the proponents of the traditional paradigm in articles, reviews, and talks (Bogomolny 2011; Brams 2011; Edelman 2012; Felsenthal and Machover 2008; Fleurbaey 2014). Most objections have been answered in chapter 16 of Balinski and Laraki (2011a), see also Balinski (2019). New arguments to the no-show paradox (Moulin 1988a) charge are detailed in a companion paper (Balinski and Laraki 2019). The present article gives a completely new argument for majority judgment that responds to the objection that it does not agree with the majority rule on two candidates, i.e., that it is not Condorcet-consistent. This paper first gives a new description of majority judgment that shows it naturally emerges from a majority principle when candidates are assigned grades. Then, it shows that majority rule on two candidates is not incontestable, it is open to serious error because it admits the “domination paradox”: it may elect a candidate whose grades are dominated by another candidate’s grades. The infallibility of majority rule on two candidates has been challenged before. Dahl charged: “By making ‘most preferred’ equivalent to ‘preferred by most’ we deliberately bypassed a crucial problem: What if the minority prefers its alternative much more passionately than the majority prefers a contrary alternative? Does the majority principle still make sense? This is the problem of intensity, ...[W]ould it be possible to construct rules so that an apathetic majority only slightly preferring its alternative could not override a minority strongly preferring its alternative?” (Dahl 1956, pp. 90–92). Finally, starting from the basic principles that justify majority rule (May’s axioms), majority judgment is characterized as the unique method based on evaluations that satisfies those same principles, avoids the Condorcet and Arrow paradoxes, andcoincides with majority rule on two candidates when the electorate is “polarized”, that is, when the higher (the lower) a voter evaluates one candidate the lower (the higher) she evaluates the other, so there can be no consensus. Majority rule does not violate domination on polarized candidates, and since it is incentive compatible on that domain, so is majority judgment, and that is when voters are most tempted to manipulate.",8

Judgment aggregation is a formal framework for group decision making in logically rich domains, modelling situations where the judgments of several individuals need to be aggregated into a single collective judgment. The development of judgment aggregation was originally inspired by problems in legal theory (Kornhauser and Sager 1993). Since then, judgment aggregation has attracted the interest of scholars in a variety of disciplines at the interface of economics and philosophy (see, e.g., List and Pettit 2002; Dietrich 2006; Pauly and van Hees 2006; Nehring and Puppe 2008; List and Puppe 2009a; Dokow and Holzman 2010; List 2012), and has also been studied within the areas of computer science and artificial intelligence (see, e.g., Grossi and Pigozzi 2014; Baumeister et al. 2016; Endriss 2016). Uniformly across all research fields where judgment aggregation can be applied, important considerations concern the properties—also known as axioms (Thomson 2001)—of the specific aggregation rules that are employed (List and Pettit 2002; Dietrich and List 2010). Axioms in judgment aggregation play a normative role, meaning that they formally define requirements that we would like an aggregation rule to satisfy, motivated by philosophical, political, or ethical concerns. In this paper we delve deeply, both conceptually and technically, into one of the axioms that are prominent in the literature on judgment aggregation, namely neutrality (Dietrich and List 2007a, 2008; List 2012; Endriss 2016).Footnote 1 Neutrality demands that all the propositions judged by the individuals should be treated symmetrically during aggregation—without any kind of differentiation. This clearly is a natural requirement for some applications, as it encodes a basic notion of fairness. But, as we are going to argue, in most domains in which judgment aggregation can be applied the propositions to be judged will be very diverse in nature and, therefore, the classical neutrality axiom is too strong a requirement. In particular, different propositions are often associated with different standards of acceptance—respecting their relative acceptability does not necessarily mean treating them symmetrically. To prepare the ground for this argument, let us consider an example. Suppose the governor of Arizona has to make two decisions concerning the state:  Should a wall be constructed separating Arizona and Mexico? Should the tuition fees for the state colleges be increased? It is publicly known that in order for the wall to be built a very high budget is required, so for that budget to be covered money has to be collected (also) through more tuition. Since there is a lot at stake for the governor, he puts together a committee of counselors to help him settle the issues, and the committee happens to be quite diverse, consisting of four pure democrats and six extreme conservatives. Suppose the counselors—not deviating from their party lines—express the judgments depicted in the table that follows.  Wall? Tuition? 6 Counselors Yes Yes 4 Counselors No No Thus, the governor observes that 60% of the committee members agree with building the wall, and that exactly the same counselors who want the wall support the increase on college tuition as well. As expected, everyone also acknowledges that they cannot accept the wall construction without a tuition raise (as can be seen from the table above, nobody says yes on wall and no on tuition). But given these judgments of the committee, how will the governor make a final decision? First, regarding the tuition, it makes sense that the governor is determined to simply follow the opinion of the majority of the counselors; this is an issue that will only have some local effects in the state of Arizona, so a simple majority by the committee members suffices for the governor to make a decision in favour of an increase. However, constructing a wall will have much more serious consequences to Arizona’s finances and international relations with Mexico, so the governor only feels confident to decide in favour of it if he has at least a 2 / 3 majority of the committee backing him on this (which he does not have in this case).Footnote 2 Overall, the governor would now like to increase tuition but not build a wall, even though the committee provided the same support on both issues. Apparently, in situations like the one described above, propositions may vary in meta-value: Judgments on certain propositions may have much more severe and large-scale effects than judgments on others. Then, we arguably should treat propositions of the same kind symmetrically, while we may still want to apply very different standards across the different kinds. Our conceptual contribution in this paper is to propose a new family of axioms that can account for such diversity between the propositions under consideration, providing a refinement of the standard notion of neutrality in judgment aggregation.Footnote 3 Our axioms capture a plethora of scenarios based on an acceptability relation, which is a binary relation expressing the relative acceptability of the different propositions in a decision-making domain. Given such an acceptability relation A, an A-respecting aggregation rule imposes equal treatment only for those propositions that are linked to each other by A. However, if one proposition \(\varphi \) is related to another proposition \(\psi \) via A, but the converse is not true, then an A-respecting rule merely has to ensure that the standards for accepting \(\varphi \) are at least as demanding as those for accepting \(\psi \). We provide multiple application-driven examples for concrete definitions of relations.Footnote 4 Our technical contribution is twofold. First, known impossibility theorems state that no aggregation rule satisfies certain combinations of desirable axioms (List and Pettit 2002, 2004; Pauly and van Hees 2006; Dietrich 2007; van Hees 2007). We investigate to what extent this pessimistic finding can be avoided by relaxing neutrality as far as the original impossibility theorem in the field, due to List and Pettit (2002), is concerned. We focus on a family of simple yet powerful scenarios (so-called conjunctive and disjunctive agendas), which are the most extensively studied scenarios in the literature (Chapman 1998; Pettit 2001; Dietrich and List 2007c; Chapman 2002; Hartmann and Sprenger 2012; Terzopoulou and Endriss 2018), and we find that the classical impossibility can be circumvented for several cases of practical interest. Second, we provide a precise characterisation of scenarios for which it is safe to require individuals to use an aggregation rule that is A-respecting (given an acceptability relation A between the propositions), in the sense of never resulting in a logically inconsistent outcome. This subsumes known results regarding the special case of the standard neutrality axiom (Endriss et al. 2012). Although we are the first to formalise the concept of weakening neutrality in judgment aggregation, the idea was already briefly mentioned more than fifteen years ago in Footnote 4 of the the seminal paper by List and Pettit (2002). Having said this, List and Pettit only discuss the option of limiting neutrality to propositions that belong to the same equivalence class, while our definition accounts for a much broader spectrum of relations that may occur, motivated by the immense diversity of possible aggregation domains. More recently, Slavkovik (2014) also noted that judgment aggregation often deals with propositions of diverse types and, to account for this, argued for considering non-neutral aggregation rules. But her focus is on proposing new rules, rather than on studying the neutrality axiom itself. Others have observed that certain intuitively reasonable aggregation rules in fact violate the standard neutrality axiom. For example, contrary to what one might expect, even though the well-known Kemeny rule is neutral in the context of preference aggregation, this rule—which is also known as the median rule—is not neutral in judgment aggregation (Costantini et al. 2016). Moreover, in many classical examples of judgment aggregation (like some versions of the doctrinal paradox due to Kornhauser and Sager 1993) propositions are distinguished, being either premises or conclusions—as Mongin (2012) observes in his Footnote 13, standard neutrality (the part of the so-called systematicity axiom discussed by Mongin that is relevant here) is not sensitive to this distinction. In conclusion, while neutrality clearly is a debatable property and while that point has been made repeatedly in the literature, relaxing this overly demanding axiom has not yet received the attention it deserves. In this paper we close this gap. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we recall the basic model of judgment aggregation and review the standard neutrality axiom. Section 3 then introduces our new family of axioms, motivated by a number of typical examples demonstrating that in settings of judgment aggregation propositions will often be associated with different standards of acceptance, which we would like to respect. The next two sections contain our main technical results: we study the impact that relaxing neutrality has on the impossibility of List and Pettit (2002) in Sect. 4, and we determine under which conditions rules satisfying our new axioms are safe in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes. In the Appendix we include a comparison of the definition of classical neutrality with two alternative definitions, inspired by the subtly different way in which neutrality usually is defined in preference aggregation.",1

So far, the literature has mostly focused on one-shot implementation, while the existing work on repeated implementation has assumed that the same agents are alive in all periods. However, the current debate about environmental protection, sustainable development or pension reform often involves arguments about intergenerational equity. To study whether intergenerational equity can be achieved, we need a setup that explicitly allows for different generations of agents. Or said differently, once we introduce different generations, it gives rise to novel normative issuesFootnote 1 and we may want to know if these norms can be achieved when agents behave strategically. Therefore, our goal is to study what can or cannot be implemented in a setup with different generations of agents. We now outline the model. Every period there are n agents alive and these agents belong to different generations, that is, they have different ages. Every T periods the oldest agent dies and a new agent is born. Thus, each agent lives exactly for nT periods. Agents’ preferences are additively separable over time and the current period preferences of agent depend on his type. The objective of designer is captured by a social choice function (SCF), which specifies a socially desirable alternative for every period as a function of types of those agents who are alive in that period. Because the designer never observes agents’ types, she needs to design a sequence of mechanisms, called a regime, that allows her to elicit this information and, at the same time, to select the desired alternative in every period on the equilibrium path. If there exists such a regime, we say that the SCF is repeatedly implementable. Our goal is to characterize the SCFs that are repeatedly implementable. We assume complete information among agents and use subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) as our solution concept. We model generations similar to how it is done in the literature on repeated games played by overlapping generations (OLG) of players. For example, Cremer (1986) studies the possibilities of cooperation among players in such games when \(T=1\), while Salant (1991), Kandori (1992) and Smith (1992) derive folk theorems by allowing T to be large. The only difference with the current model is that in these papers, it is assumed that when an agent dies, he is replaced with his exact copy. The OLG setup can be applied in many contexts. As mentioned, we can study whether intergenerational equity is achievable in the context of sustainable development or pension reform. Cremer (1986) and Kandori (1992) argue that the OLG games provide a natural theory of organizations. For example, different workers join and leave a firm at different times, which helps to sustain cooperation among them. From the perspective of implementation theory, we can ask what goals a manager can achieve if she is less informed than the workers. The US Senate is another example of institution that neatly fits the OLG framework: senators serve a six years’ term and every two years, one third of them is reelected. Alternatively, we can think that there are n different institutions (firms, countries) that are run by individuals (managers, heads of state) and, more often than not, individuals of different institutions are replaced at different times. We study repeated implementation of SCFs under two opposite assumptions about the agents’ types: when the agents’ types do not change during their lifetime and when new types are drawn every period. Under the former assumption, we obtain the following results. We first show that any SCF that is repeatedly implementable, must satisfy a mild condition, which we call OLG-unanimity. It states that if all agents, no matter what their types are, agree on the best alternative and if by lying, they can obtain this alternative in every period, then the SCF must be a constant function that always selects this alternative. Intuitively, it is impossible to incentivize the agents to reveal their true types because they already get their highest possible lifetime payoff. Next, we construct a regime and show that any SCF that satisfies OLG-unanimity, is repeatedly implementable if there are at least three agents, \(n\ge 3\), and they live long enough, namely, \(T\ge 3\). Because agents’ types do not change during their lifetime, a lie about their types does not need to be challenged immediately, but it can also be done by next generations. Also, OLG-unanimity condition implies that if an SCF is not a constant function,Footnote 2 then there exists an agent who does not expect his highest possible lifetime payoff. This agent can always be incentivized to challenge the lie of other agents. This allows us to obtain very permissible results in terms of SCFs that are implementable. The regime that is used to prove the sufficiency result, borrows elements of the canonical mechanism that is used in one-shot implementation in SPE (Moore and Repullo 1988; Abreu and Sen 1990; Vartiainen 2007). We will elaborate on the connection to one-shot implementation in SPE in Sect. 3.1. The results are different when the agents’ types are drawn anew every period. We show now that if an SCF is not generation-efficient in the range, then it is not repeatedly implementable when T is large. Generation-efficiency in the range extends the concept of efficiency in the range that was introduced by Lee and Sabourian (2011), to the OLG setup. It requires that there does not exist an SCF whose range is contained in the range of the SCF that is being implemented, but which gives higher expected payoff to every agent. The intuition for the result is as follows. If an SCF is not generation-efficient in the range, then by lying, the agents can obtain higher payoffs. Also, because types now change every period, any lie must be challenged and tested immediately. This, however, imposes a limit on the size of reward that the agent who challenges, can receive (otherwise he will also challenge when the others are not lying). Finally, for large enough T, the gains from sticking to the lie will exceed this reward. To show this result, we build on the aforementioned papers that prove folk theorems for OLG games and, specifically, on Smith (1992). Repeated implementation has been studied by Kalai and Ledyard (1998), Chambers (2004), Lee and Sabourian (2011), Mezzetti and Renou (2017) and Azacis and Vida (2019).Footnote 3 However, in all these papers, the same set of agents is alive in all periods. Thus, these papers do not consider the implementation of SCFs that can capture any intergenerational social choice considerations. Further, Kalai and Ledyard (1998) and Chambers (2004) assume that the state of the world is drawn only once and is kept fixed for all periods. Hence, their setup corresponds to the case in our model when the type of agent is kept fixed throughout his lifetime. Like us, they obtain very permissible results. On the other hand, Lee and Sabourian (2011); Mezzetti and Renou (2017); Azacis and Vida (2019) assume that in a model with discounting, a new state is drawn in each period. While the last two papers study what can be implemented for a given discount factor, Lee and Sabourian (2011) show that only SCFs that are efficient in the range, can be repeatedly implementable when the discount factor is sufficiently high. Thus, we provide a counterpart to their result in the OLG setup. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally describes the model. Section 3 deals with the case when the agents’ types do not change during their lifetime, while Sect. 4 deals with the case when new types are drawn every period. Appendix A contains all the proofs.",

Figure 1 provides an overview for selected developed countries. Adjusting this unsustainable fiscal situation is among the main fiscal policy challenges of the near future. Yet, fiscal policy before the crisis casts serious doubts upon a successful fiscal adjustment process. Contrary to the prescriptions of optimal debt policies (e.g. Barro 1979; Startz 1989), governments persistently accumulated debt in peace time. As convincingly argued by a large and growing literature, politics is at the heart of this problem (see Alesina and Passalacqua 2016; von Weizsäcker 1992, 2015). Source: IMF World Economic Outlook Database, April 2016 Ratio of gross public debt to GDP for selected countries. Although the debt problem is shared by most countries, there are marked differences. Consider the two countries with the largest debt-to-GDP ratio, Japan and Greece. Whereas Greece has gone through considerable turmoil in the past years with haircuts and even default repeatedly on the table, Japan “continues to enjoy low and stable interest rates” (Hoshi and Ito 2014). The conventional explanation put forward in the literature is the large fraction of domestic debt in Japan, which is purportedly less susceptible to default (Hoshi and Ito 2014; see Mallucci 2015, for an overview of domestic to total debt ratios). Yet, default on domestic government debt is hardly rare (Reinhart and Rogoff 2011). This raises the question why some countries default on their domestic debt, while others don’t. A special feature of government debt is the associated promise of transfers from future to current generations, usually made without the consent of the former. Why are these promises kept? Tabellini (1991) shows that repudiating the debt affects both the inter- and the intragenerational distribution of resources. Concretely, debt repudiation harms the wealthy members of the old generation more than the poor. Intergenerational altruism then implies that the children of the wealthiest debt holders join the old in a coalition which supports repayment of the debt. The central aspect of Tabellini’s paper is the link between inter- and intragenerational redistribution, “a topic which is surprisingly understudied both theoretically and empirically” (Alesina and Passalacqua 2016, p. 2626). In this paper, we investigate more closely when and how the old generation can exploit the link between inter- and intragenerational redistribution to make the repayment of debt politically viable. The main objective of the paper is to provide controlled empirical evidence on the theoretical framework proposed by Tabellini (1991). However, we also offer some novel theoretical insights on the factors determining intergenerational redistribution. We develop a version of Tabellini’s (1991) model with a finite number of players and strategies. The model exposes a so-far neglected aspect of intergenerational redistribution, namely coordination. Similar to Tabellini (1991), the repayment of debt is politically viable if and only if government bonds are held neither too narrowly nor too widely. Contrary to Tabellini (1991), this property of the debt distribution is not predetermined by the initial wealth distribution in our model. Instead, the members of the old generation may generate a debt distribution with the desired property by coordinating their bond investments. Accordingly, domestic debt will be honored, if coordination is successful, and it will be repudiated otherwise. As a consequence, the repayment of debt may become politically viable under less stringent assumptions on the initial wealth distribution. A moderate amount of wealth inequality favors debt repayment, because it facilitates coordination. On the other hand, debt repayment may not be viable even with a favorable wealth distribution, if coordination fails. Our model also discloses that the old generation effectively employs a divide-and-conquer strategy towards the young generation. Although the young generation is opposed to issuing debt ex ante, successful coordination enables the old to form a coalition with some of the young voters. This insight connects our paper to a wide literature in political economics (see Sect. 2) which holds the potential to shed new light on e.g. the role of budgetary institutions and constitutional reform. We also extend the theoretical basis of this literature by adding coordination as a prerequisite for divide-and-conquer. The paper’s main contribution lies in the empirical validation of the redistributive mechanism proposed by Tabellini (1991). We provide an experimental paradigm to investigate the interplay between redistribution, coordination, and divide-and-conquer. This is important as empirical studies on this topic are often plagued by problems of data availability, measurement, and causality. It is not clear, for example, how a binding vote on debt repudiation could be organized in practice.Footnote 1 Experiments have the potential to overcome some of these issues and to stimulate future empirical studies (see also Sutter 2003; Fochmann et al. 2018; Battaglini et al. 2019). In our experiment, subjects repeatedly play the simplest possible version of the model with two parents (members of the old generation) and four children (members of the young generation) who each receive a wealth endowment. The game proceeds in two stages: First, the two parents simultaneously decide over their bond investments. Second, parents and children vote on accepting or rejecting the investments. If investments are accepted by a strict majority, investments must be repaid with interest and the costs are shared equally among all children. Otherwise, parents lose their investments. The structure of payoffs enables parents to induce a majority preferring acceptance by successfully coordinating their investments. We implement two treatments that differ with respect to the difficulty of coordination: In treatment Unequal, parents receive unequal endowments and coordination succeeds, if both parents invest their entire endowment. In contrast, in treatment Equal, both parents receive the same endowment and one of the parents must invest less than the other to induce a majority favoring acceptance. Accordingly, coordination is hard and repayment should not ensue based on the predictions of Tabellini (1991). Our experimental results show that the link between inter- and intragenerational redistribution is exploited both if coordination is easy and if it is hard. In treatment Unequal, parents coordinate a majority preferring debt repayment in almost 80% of game plays, and the debt is repaid three out of four times. Though coordination is less successful in treatment Equal, parents manage to coordinate in almost half of the game plays and the debt is repaid two out of three times. In summary, coordination plays an important role in the strategic creation and exploitation of minorities, and thus e.g. in the accumulation of public debt. Still, our results also show that individuals’ risk and pro-social preferences limit the extent to which redistribution takes place. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 introduces the game-theoretic model and derives the equilibria. Section 4 presents the experimental results. Section 5 concludes. The appendix contains the proofs, complementary statistical results, and the experimental instructions.",1

When contests arise between groups, respective members win or lose the prize collectively. However, individuals in a group may have different positions, skills, prize valuations, and various impacts over the outcome of the competition. When the prize has private characteristics, this within group heterogeneity can lead to personalized incentives, such as highly skilled players receiving a higher share of the prize over lower skilled ones. Conversely, an egalitarian allocation of prizes may be used to encourage cooperative behaviours among members. At the beginning of the Republic of Rome, for example, the tribunes equally distributed the spoils of war among all army members, including those who only guarded the settlements and protected the wounded. After 407 BC, the Roman Senate introduced different incentives according to the roles performed by the members of the army: ordinary soldiers received a third of the wage of the knights and half of the wage of centurions. A similar rule was used under Napoleon’s Empire. Nowadays, victorious soldiers are awarded medals according to their rank in the army. Likewise, candidate prime ministers assign party members to different ministries. The assignment of the most influential people to the key ministries affects their efforts during the campaign and eventually the outcome of the elections. Finally, collective competitions are pervasive in the workplace, where, for example, department stores, retail chains, sales and production departments set up monetary rewards for the most productive teams. Nationally representative surveys reveal that 52% of firms use teamwork in the US, and 47% of British firms organized more than 90% of their workforce into teams; and 70% of Fortune 1000 companies use some form of team incentive (Bandiera et al. 2011). In general, it seems evident that the way in which members are rewarded according to their roles and responsibilities affects how much they contribute to the group goal. Thus, the purpose of this article is twofold: to propose an allocative rule that maximizes group effectiveness, hereafter the “optimal prize allocation”; and to study how a change in the distribution of abilities within a group affects its effectiveness. We study our questions using a model with the following features: it allows for between and within groups heterogeneity; it classifies contests as “easy” and “hard” depending on whether the marginal costs are concave or convex; and each group has a manager that announces the optimal prize allocation only to her members. Our analysis reveals the following results. In easy contests, the optimal prize allocations assigns the entire prize to one group member, the most skilled one. On the other hand, in hard contests in which players’ marginal productivities are unbounded above, it rewards all group members . If the contest is hard and players’ marginal productivity are bounded above, then only the most skilled members of a group are certain of receiving a positive share of the prize for any distribution of abilities. Furthermore, we find that a change in the distribution of abilities within a group affects the probability of winning of all competing groups. Specifically, if the contest is either easy or a specific subset of hard, then the more the heterogeneity within a group, the higher the group probability of winning. Finally, we rank the probability of winning of the competing groups from highest to lowest under two prize divisions: the “egalitarian” allocation, i.e. the prize is equally shared among members of the same group; and the optimal prize allocation. Surprisingly, the ranking resulting from the egalitarian allocation can be fully reversed by implementing the optimal prize allocation. Much progress has been made in the study of contests since the seminal work of Tullock (1980).Footnote 2 In regards to group contests for public good, related set-ups are analyzed by Baik (1993, 2008) and Ryvkin (2011). The former shows that if players have linear cost, then only the most skilled member in every group contributes to the group cause. The latter, however, shows that all group members are active participants if costs are strictly convex. Moreover, Ryvkin (2011) studies how a contest organizer has to sort (heterogeneous) players in same size groups to maximize the aggregate effort exerted in the competition. His results are that if the players’ cost function is moderately (sufficiently) steep, then a more (less) balanced competition increases aggregate effort. Thus, one could wrongly assume that the same result extends to the optimal prize allocation because both papers relate to the steepness of the cost function. However, this is not the case since the two definitions of steepness differ substantially.Footnote 3 In addition, we do not focus on maximizing aggregate effort, for example by allowing groups to compete for different prizes, rather on how a group manager strategically chooses to split the prize among her members. In regards to group contests for private good, the literature has considered the following ways of prize division among the winning group members: the “egalitarian” rule, used among others, by Esteban and Ray (2001) and Cheikbossian (2012) to study the group size paradox; the “relative effort” rule, which works as an incentive device, analysed by Nitzan (1991a); and any linear combination between the “egalitarian” and the “relative effort” rule studied by Nitzan (1991b) and Nitzan and Ueda (2011, 2018), meaning part of the prize is divided equally (egalitarian rule) and the rest proportionally according to each member’s effort (relative effort rule). Since the use of a relative effort allocation puts members of the same group in competition for the internal division of the prize, its full implementation eliminates the free-riding problem. However, its use effectively assumes that relative efforts can be costlessly observed and rewarded. Alternatively, a model with costs of monitoring needs to be introduced as in Ueda (2002). Even though this requirement seems innocuous, it reduces the applicability of this incentive device to few cases.Footnote 4 Conversely, the egalitarian rule does not require that the individual contributions are observable, but it clearly tempts group members to free-ride on other’s contributions because they win or lose the prize as a group, i.e. winning the share of the prize is a “collective good”. To the best of our knowledge, the few works that study allocative schemes and do not require monitoring, assume symmetry among players and focus on the effects of within group inequality. Nitzan and Ueda (2014) focus on the effects of intra-group heterogeneity in prize shares. The authors find that in easy (hard) contests the greater (lesser) the inequality in prize share, the higher the group efficiency. Cubel and Sanchez-Pages (2014) demonstrate through Atkinson’s index of inequality that egalitarian groups have a higher probability of winning the contest when the efforts of the group members are complementary, or the contest is hard. There are two main differences between these models and our own: first, while they study exogenous variations in prize allocations, we analyse the endogenous choices of the optimal one; second, in our model players can be heterogeneous in their ability. If players are symmetric, group members choose the same amount of contribution in equilibrium. On the other hand, if they are heterogeneous, they react to the same incentive differently. As a matter of fact, in our model different levels of within group heterogeneity affects both the distribution of the prize among group members and the probability of winning of all groups. Section 2 contains the preliminaries of the model; Sect. 3 presents our model of contests with managers and discusses the effect of within group heterogeneity; Sect. 4 concludes.",2

These trade-offs arise from an information friction that endogenizes the feasible tax instruments: the government knows the distribution of types in the population and it can also observe the actual earned income of each individual, but is not able to observe the specific type of any given individual. Personalized lump-sum taxes and transfers are therefore not available but public observability of earned income at the individual level allows the government to tax earned income on a nonlinear scale. The vast majority of papers in the optimal tax literature assume that agents differ along a single dimension (market ability). This is due to tractability considerations. Given certain assumptions on the utility function, it enables a monotonic relationship between an agent’s unobserved type and the slope of his/her indifference curve in the earnings-consumption space. This property, referred to as ’single-crossing’ (hereafter, SC), allows the researcher to provide a full characterization of the set of implementable contracts while restricting attention to local incentive constraints linking adjacent types. In the case of a continuum of types, it also implies that the incentive constraints can conveniently be expressed in terms of differential equations. When agents differ along multiple dimensions, however, the SC property will generally be violated, as there is no natural way to order agents in a multidimensional space.Footnote 1 A comparatively small literature analyzes optimal income taxation with multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity, and these contributions can roughly be divided into four strands. A first strand assumes that the additional dimensions of heterogeneity enters additively separable in the utility function, thereby not affecting individuals’ trade-offs between pre-tax and after-tax income (see e.g., Kleven et al. 2009; Jacquet et al. 2013; Scheuer 2014; Bastani et al. 2020). A second strand imposes restrictions such that the various dimensions of heterogeneity can be collapsed into one dimension and parameterized by a single index (see, e.g., Boadway et al. 2002; Choné and Laroque 2010; Golosov et al. 2013; Rothschild and Scheuer 2014; Lockwood and Weinzierl 2015). A third strand analyzes more general forms of heterogeneity, but focuses attention to quantitative analysis of models with a small discrete number of types (see, e.g., Bastani et al. 2013; Judd et al. 2018). Finally, a fourth strand comprises papers that provide a characterization of optimal marginal tax rates while remaining agnostic about which incentive-compatibility constraints are binding in equilibrium (see, e.g., Cremer et al. 1998; Cremer and Gahvari 2002; Micheletto 2008). Compared to the existing literature referred to above, the purpose of this paper is to provide a more thorough investigation of the consequences descending from abandoning the SC condition. For this purpose, we set up a simple two-type model where the SC condition is naturally violated, and we characterize the properties of a second-best optimum by considering the entire second-best Pareto frontier (hereafter, PF).Footnote 2 The model that we consider is a standard intensive-margin optimal income tax model where agents have identical preferences and heterogeneous market abilities, but where we also allow for heterogeneity in “needs” for a work-related good/service, i.e. a good/service that some agents need to purchase in order to work.Footnote 3 It is this bi-dimensional heterogeneity that implies a violation of the SC condition. Our analysis highlights several results, each of them representing an anomaly with respect to what is obtained in an optimal income tax model under SC. First of all, a second-best optimum might not preserve the ranking of earned income that prevails under laissez-faire. Second, redistribution via income taxation might be feasible even when the laissez-faire equilibrium is a pooling equilibrium. Third, a second-best optimum might not be unique, in the sense that there might be more than one set of allocations in the (pre-tax income, after-tax income)-space that solve the government’s maximization problem. Fourth, the second-best PF can be disconnected. Fifth, supplementing an optimal nonlinear income tax with an optimal subsidy on work-related expenses may imply that redistribution is achieved through a separating- or pooling equilibrium where both self-selection constraints are binding. A final result that we show is that the labor supply of some agents may be distorted even though no self-selection constraint is (locally) binding in equilibrium.
 The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present our setting and highlight how it implies that the SC condition does not hold. In Sect. 3 we evaluate the properties of the second-best PF and of the allocations that allow implementing the various points on the second-best PF. To simplify the exposition we make the assumption that, for agents who incur a cost for the purchase of a work-related good, the cost is proportional to their labor supply. In Sect. 4 we discuss how our results change when work-related expenses are subsidized by the government, and in Sect. 5 we briefly consider the possibility that job-related expenses vary nonlinearly with hours of work. Finally, Sect. 6 offers concluding remarks.",2

If we think of politics as distributional conflicts of who gets what, when, and how (Lasswell 1936), democratic decision-making procedures frequently divide societies into winners and losers. Majority tyranny arises when winning majorities are fixed, and when there are no checks on the majority’s ability to dominate the minority (Guinier 1994, 4). Hence, the tyranny of the majority can be defined as the permanent exploitation of the minority by the majority in democratic decisions over time.Footnote 1 In this paper, I explore the effects of communication on the occurrence of the tyranny of the majority. From a theoretical perspective, communication cuts both ways. On the one hand, building and maintaining a coalition requires intensive coordination efforts among its members. Communication certainly greatly facilitates the identification of possible coalition partners. Moreover, it enables coalitions to arrange a common voting strategy and agree on a distribution of benefits among its members. On the other hand, a large body of research shows that communication strengthens prosocial orientations within groups (Bicchieri 2002; Ostrom 1998; Sally 1995). As majority domination implies the exclusion of minorities and thus rests on the expression of predominantly egoistic motivations, majority tyranny becomes less likely in the presence of communication when minorities have a voice. Deliberative theory identifies publicity as one of the most important elements of deliberative processes (Thompson 2008, 510). Accordingly, I argue that the effect of communication depends on whether actors communicate in a public or a private arena. My argument follows Goodin (1986) who points out that individuals formulate their preferences in collective deliberations depending on the institutional environment. Certain types of arguments that may be highly effective in private deliberations, simply cannot be articulated in a public arena. Hence, individuals will launder their own preferences and express only prosocial, ethical preferences in public settings and refrain from expressing egoistic arguments. Elster (1986) argues in a similar direction stating that it is almost impossible to make egoistic arguments in public debates. Thus, public discussion tends to promote the common good. In light of this theoretical reasoning, I hypothesize that discussion in public arenas attenuates incentives to permanently exclude minorities from the distribution of benefits whereas private communication promotes the occurrence of the tyranny of the majority. I test my hypothesis in a laboratory experiment where five-member groups have to make distributional decisions using the ‘voting by veto’ [VBV] mechanism developed by Mueller (1978). VBV consists of two stages, where in the first stage, every group member proposes a distribution. Voters’ proposals are complemented with an additional alternative serving as a fallback option in case group members cannot reach a decision. At the beginning of the second stage, a random mechanism determines the order of voting after which group members sequentially eliminate one alternative each. When all group members have vetoed an alternative, a single winning alternative remains. As I show below, VBV inheres both majoritarian as well as egalitarian tendencies. The voting rule thus offers an ideal setting for studying in how far communication affects the occurrence of the tyranny of the majority versus distributionally fair group choices. My experiment consists of three treatments. The No-chat-treatment serves as a baseline where groups interact without the possibility to communicate. In the other two treatments, groups can communicate via a chat function. In the Public-chat-treatment, all chat messages exchanged within the group can be seen by all group members. In the Private-chat-treatment, group members can determine which other group members receive a message. Hence, individuals have the opportunity to exclude other group members from the discussion. The experimental results largely confirm the theoretical expectations. Communication in a public chat leads to more equally distributed proposals and outcomes in comparison to the baseline treatment. The tyranny of the majority, however, only occurs under private communication when individuals exclude other group members from the conversation. The analysis of chat protocols reveals that individuals bar other group members from the discussion when trying to build a coalition that excludes others from the distribution of benefits. When all messages are public, however, fairness arguments dominate.",4

Eggers,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In November, 2018, as the initial deadline for the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (“Brexit”) approached, YouGov conducted a survey in which over 20,000 British respondents were asked to rank three alternatives: remain in the EU (Remain), accept the withdrawal agreement promoted by Prime Minister Theresa May (Deal), or leave the EU without a deal (No Deal). Table 1 shows the estimated proportion of the UK electorate with each possible ordering of the three alternatives.Footnote 1 The poll was highly salient as opponents of Brexit clamored for a second referendum to allow voters to choose among these alternatives.Footnote 2 If voters voted according to the preferences in Table 1, which alternative would have won in a hypothetical Brexit referendum in November 2018? Does the winner depend on the method used (e.g. plurality vs. Borda count)? Which voting method would produce the most favorable result for each alternative? With a bit of computation we can certainly answer these questions using the numbers in Table 1 and present the result in additional tables.Footnote 3 But tabular presentations are often less intuitive than graphical ones, including in the case of elections (Saari 1994; Tufte 2001; Kastellec and Leoni 2007). A good diagram would quickly indicate, in a consistent way for several relevant election methods, not only who wins under a given method but also how close each other candidate was to winning. Beyond representing the outcomes for a particular set of preferences like those in Table 1, a good diagram might also illustrate some of the desirable and undesirable properties of each voting system, as seen in the work of Donald Saari (1994, 2011). The fundamental reason why we need such a diagram is that in systems where voters’ second choices matter (as in e.g. Borda count or instant-runoff) the election outcome depends on more numbers than can be comfortably digested in a table or visualized in a straightforward way. The preferences in Table 1 can be summarized by five numbers,Footnote 4 but humans find it difficult to visualize more than three dimensions (and even to make sense of two-dimensional representations of three dimensions). What we need is a digestible and consistent way to illustrate the results of a wide range of ordinal voting methods. As I discuss in the next section, diagrams exist for visualizing some classes of ordinal methods [most notably Saari (1994)’s triangle for representing positional methods], but as far as I know there is no other diagram that can depict a result under such disparate methods as the Borda count, the Kemeny (Condorcet) method, and instant-runoff voting (IRV) in a consistent way. This paper introduces a consistent approach to diagramming the result of any anonymous single-winner election method in which voters submit ranked preferences (i.e. ordinal voting systems). It can be used not just to analyze a specific result for a given set of ordinal ballots and one voting method but also to compare results across voting methods and analyze some of the properties of these methods. To address the dimensionality problem, the diagram shows which alternative wins as a function of two parameters (the proportion of voters ranking each candidate first) conditional on the voting rule and three or more other parameters (the proportion of each candidate’s supporters who rank each other candidate second). Put differently, the diagram emphasizes how the winner in a given system depends on the row sums of Table 1 as a function of the column proportions within each row. This approach easily accommodates incomplete rankings, which pose a problem for some previous graphical approaches,Footnote 5 and it can be useful in IRV and Condorcet elections with more than three alternatives. The tools for making these diagrams are freely available as an R package.Footnote 6 The diagram has several uses. Most directly, it tells us how the election result would change in a given system if the distribution of voters’ first choices were to shift, holding fixed the pattern of second preferences (as might happen if turnout increased or decreased among the supporters of one of the alternatives); it can also do the opposite, telling us how the result would change if the distribution of voters’ first choices remained fixed but the pattern of second choices shifted. By comparing two diagrams representing different elections under the same voting rule, we can see how a shift in preferences involving both first and second preferences might affect the outcome. By comparing diagrams from two systems for a given preference profile, we can also see how the result would change holding expressed preferences fixed if we moved from one system to another. The diagram can make intuitive some well-known properties of voting systems, such as join-inconsistency or the no-show paradox. Because the diagram summarizes five preference parameters in two dimensions,Footnote 7 it can be viewed not just as a means of analyzing election methods but also as a concise summary of preference profiles.",1

Grech,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"We study the voting power distribution in decision-making bodies facing binary ‘yay-nay’ decisions with a particular emphasis on the effect of the removal of a member. Such situations are ubiquitous—and similarly general will be our methods—but the subject is particularly topical in the context of the European Union (EU), be it due to potential voting right suspensions in the wake of recent infringement proceedings (Poland, Hungary) or due to the exit of one of its largest members [United Kingdom (UK)]. Given its significance, we focus here on the latter. Loosely speaking, voting power is defined as the ability of each individual member (‘player’) of a decision-making body to change the outcome of a vote. Specifically, a posteriori power takes explicit account of players’ ideological positions, to which a priori power applies the principle of insufficient reason. The former concept is sometimes seen as an enhancement of the latter, but, rather, the two just serve different purposes. A priori power is useful for normative assessments of voting rules. A posteriori power, by contrast, is descriptive and constitutes a first step towards estimating practical, ‘actual’, power.Footnote 1 We focus on one of the EU’s main decision-making bodies, viz. the Council of the EU (Council of Ministers, henceforth ‘the Council’). Having a concrete application in mind is crucial from a conceptual vantage point. We shall argue that several existing power indices—most of which previously applied to the Council—are unsuitable as they measure inapplicable or even convoluted notions of power and/or are based on implausible behavioral assumptions. With respect to a priori power, this lets us pick the Banzhaf indexFootnote 2 over the Shapley–Shubik index (1954). As regards a posteriori power, we propose a new index, labelled ‘status quo index’, as we were not able to find a suitable existing index for our application. To illustrate why, we review the classical indices by Owen (1971) and Shapley (1977) and two more recent indices (Passarelli and Barr 2007; Álvarez-Mozos et al. 2013). By introducing the notion of a status quo, our own index essentially simply redefines the notion of default voting underlying the index by Passarelli and Barr (2007). All approaches, including our own, are cast in a unified framework that allows for the incorporation of agenda setting effects (‘political winds’; Shapley (1977)) as well as uncertainty over players’ positions. The latter also enables us to establish a connection with a priori power indices by making the above-mentioned principle of insufficient reason with respect to players’ positions explicit (Proposition 1). Enlargements of the EU and adaptations of the Council’s standardly applied voting rule over the last decades have attracted various scholars to study their effect from an a priori angle [e.g. Laruelle and Widgrén (1998), Felsenthal and Machover (2001b), Leech (2002), Felsenthal Felsenthal and Machover (2004a), Napel and Widgrén (2006)]. We find that each member state’s a priori power increases after Brexit, but significantly more so for very populous countries. When normalized, our results share similarities with recent work by Kóczy (2016), but we are led to different conclusions in view of our conceptual discussion. A posteriori power computations for the Council have been tackled by fewer authors, most prominently perhaps by Widgrén (1995), Passarelli and Barr (2007), Barr and Passarelli (2009), Benati and Marzetti (2013); Mercik and Ramsey (2017) use an approach based on pre-coalitions and represent the only descriptive power study we are aware of that focuses explicitly on Brexit.Footnote 3 Besides the difficulty to select an appropriate power index, the estimation of each member states’ political position poses a serious empirical challenge. While seemingly the most natural starting point, past voting behavior in the Council is difficult to analyze as most published results indicate unanimous acceptance. And even where they do not, such data serves as an indicator of satisfaction rather than power (cf. footnote 3). In the present paper, we rely on data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), which regularly interviews experts across Europe regarding their assessment of political positions of national parties in several policy dimensions. As opposed to macroeconomic or Eurobarometer data, which are often used to compute a posteriori power, this data set is more directly linked to the actors in the Council, i.e. national ministers delegated by their respective country’s government. For the available policy dimensions we find that, overall, less populous member states usually wield no power at all. As for more populous states, France and Germany are typically most powerful, but also Poland exerts considerable power despite its smaller size. The latter’s influence however generally diminishes after Brexit. Thus, as opposed to a priori power, power reversals occur. The UK, Italy and Spain, by contrast, are—both before and after Brexit– less powerful. This is a result of their relatively more extremal positions in the policy areas considered. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces notation and discusses a priori power. Section 3 introduces our proposal, followed by four a posteriori indices from the literature. Section 4 argues why we choose the Banzhaf and status quo index, respectively, for our application.

Clark,Tore Nilssen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Competitive situations are often characterized by the fact that winning breeds winners, making success self-fulfilling. When competition is modelled as a contest, it has long been established that heterogeneity in the participants may lead to outcomes involving low effort provision.Footnote 1 Adding to this the fact that winners may evolve and gain further advantage in subsequent contests can exacerbate this problem. How then should an incentive scheme be organized to ensure that laggards do not simply give up, leaving the spoils to a superior competitor? In this paper, we discuss this question in a contest setting where a principal has a prize fund available and must choose whether to put all of it in a single contest or to spread it out over several contests. We assume a synergy between the contests which reflects the fact that success in a previous contest affects the likelihood of success in the current one. We find that the optimal prize division depends upon contestants’ heterogeneity, in particular on the interplay of their ex-ante heterogeneity and the difference in how they respond to an early win to affect that ex-ante heterogeneity. In a case with two participants, when one contestant’s ex-ante head start is small relative to the other contestant’s ability to use an early win to catch up with and even overtake the rival, the principal should spread the prize fund over more than one contest in order to maximize participants’ total expected efforts. Indeed, our most striking result is that the principal can, in some cases, use the prize division to even out the ex-ante heterogeneity between the contestants, capturing all of their surplus. Contest theorists have been interested in how competitive balance can be improved in situations where contestants do not meet on a level playing field. Several instruments have been considered, such as the form of the contest success function with different types of biases and/or differential taxation of rewards (Mealem and Nitzan 2016), adjusting the prize structure (Sisak 2009), and introducing limits on efforts (Che and Gale 1998). This levelling is needed in order to avoid the discouragement effect where those lagging behind simply give up since this is detrimental to the interests of an effort-maximizing principal (Konrad 2012; Konrad and Kovenock 2009). The stage game that we consider is a complete-information all-pay auction with a head start, which can lead to a laggard giving up if the opponent’s head start is sufficiently large. This head start may reflect for example an incumbency advantage in political competition, a prior investment made by a player, or some technological superiority. When one player has a head-start advantage, he can expend effort at a lower level than the opponent and still win the prize. In their model of a patent race, Fudenberg et al. (1983) show that an arbitrarily small lead will preclude competition as long as the favorite has an advantage at each stage. In order to achieve competition, it is necessary for a laggard to be able to leapfrog the initial leader at some stage in the race.Footnote 2 We utilize this in our two-contest competition, by assuming that the winner of the first contest receives a boost or momentum before the second one. If the player with the ex-ante head start wins the first contest, then he augments this head start before the second one; if the initial laggard wins contest one, then he reduces the head start of the leader, and may even get a head start himself. The momentum created by a win in contest one may be due to the physiological or psychological effects of winning, or due to increased access to material resources. Our model also captures the possibility that a win by the initially favored player may give him a lower head start in the second contest than the first; the win still ensures a head start to the player, but of lower magnitude. This could be caused by fatigue, for example, which has been investigated theoretically by Ryvkin (2011) and experimentally by Angelova et al. (2020). The “ winner effect” has been well documented in biology, with the male of a species experiencing an increase in the testosterone level following a win in a (territorial or survival) contest, while the loser has a reduced level of testosterone (Chase et al. 1994). Hence, the winner is in better physiological shape to compete in the next contest, as documented in male judo competitions by Cohen-Zada et al. (2017) and in male tennis competitions by Page and Coates (2017) and Gauriot and Page (2019). Rather than affecting the physiology of competitors, a successful contestant may gain a psychological boost (Krumer 2013). Batters in baseball perceive the ball as bigger when they have had recent success in hitting, for instance (Witt and Proffitt 2005). The case for the existence of psychological momentum is persuasively made by Iso-Ahola and Dotson (2014), who evaluate previous attempts to identify this phenomenon in sports and other contexts. On the other hand, successful players in some competitions may gain access to material goods that make competing easier. In sales-force management, more successful agents may be given less administrative duties, better access to back-office resources, more training than the less successful, and better territories; see, e.g., Skiera and Albers (1998), Farrell and Hakstian (2001), and Krishnamoorthy et al. (2005). The phenomenon that winning creates winners may be recognized by scientists who compete for research grants. As noted by Gallini and Scotchmer (2002; p. 54): “ [F]uture grants are contingent upon previous success. The linkage between previous success and future funding seems even more specific in the case of the National Science Council” . Those who succeed in obtaining research grants may experience an increase in status, winning a grant to fund current work and build up a competent research team, which again improves their chance of winning further grants. Losing teams must use time and resources in seeking presumably inferior forms of funding; in sum, this gives an advantage in future rounds of competition for scarce research funding. Strumpf (2002) suggests that in political competitions, the winner of a first election round may gain additional media attention and funding from campaign contributors, which helps to build future momentum. Mehlum and Moene (2016) note that incumbency can be a source of advantage in the current situation, and in the future. These can be seen as examples of the Matthew effect, coined by Merton (1968) to describe situations in which the rich get richer or where success breeds success. An initial advantage can be self-amplifying, and such mechanisms are prevalent whether we consider “ economic wealth, political power, prestige, knowledge, or in fact any other scarce or valued resource” (Perc 2014; p. 1). Faced with a contestant with initial advantage, it may seem likely that the laggard will give up. How might the principal divide his prize fund to mitigate this effect? We show that the answer depends on the size of the initial advantage, and how this advantage evolves; there is no guarantee that the initial leader will maintain the advantage in the future. In his extensive review of the Matthew effect, Rigney (Rigney 2010; p. 1) states that “[i]nitial advantage does not always lead to further advantage, and initial disadvantage does not always lead to further disadvantage”. By allowing for the possibility that an initially disadvantaged player can catch up and surpass the initial leader, we show that the principal can incite the contestants to exert so much effort that they dissipate the whole value of the prize. Our modeling choices and analysis are based on two premises which feature prominently in the contest literature: a stage game consisting of a complete-information two-player all-pay auction with a head start, and the principal wishing to maximize the total expected level of effort. Head starts in a single contest have been analyzed by several authors, notably by Konrad (2002), Meirowitz (2008), Kirkegaard (2012), Li and Yu (2012), Hirata (2014), Segev and Sela (2014), Siegel (2014), and Franke et al. (2018). Among these papers, Konrad (2002) and Hirata (2014) discuss two-stage situations where players can take actions in the first stage that create head starts in the second stage, while Li and Yu (2012) and Franke et al. (2018) discuss the principal’s optimal choice of head start in a single contest in order to maximize expected effort. Our framework differs from these approaches: it is not the actions in the first round that determine the head start in the second, rather it is the act of winning, and the boost that this provides. Also, the principal in our model controls the budget division, and not the head start advantage held by a player. While there exist cases where the principal may legitimately give a head start to a contestant, affirmative action being one, there are other cases where granting a head start may not be deemed feasible. One such case is the running of a research contest in which favoritism is difficult. Here, the principal must use the budget division in lieu of a more direct instrument to balance the competition. With two players and a single contest, Li and Yu (2012) show that the optimal head start is given to the player with the lower valuation at an amount equal to the difference between the valuations of the two players. This shifts the stronger player’s equilibrium effort distribution upwards by the amount of the head start, whilst that of the weaker player is unchanged. Hence, the stronger player has an increase in effort that offsets the head start, and this increase accrues to the contest organizer.Footnote 3 The logic behind the result of Li and Yu (2012) points to one of the mechanisms at work in our story: while the principal cannot manipulate the head start directly, he can affect the (continuation) valuations of the players of winning by a judicious division of the prize mass across contests. The principal must seek to balance out the valuations and the head start over the course of the two contests, and the design problem is not trivial. In setting the stage prizes, the principal must be mindful of the fact that the relationship between the head start and the prize in a stage contest will determine whether the players will exert effort, or if one player gives up, as well as the magnitude of efforts. The fact that the principal can directly take actions that lead a player to give up completely is an interesting knife-edge problem that has not previously been examined. The principal must also take account of how the head start will evolve for various outcomes of the first contest. Critical for our results is the relative ability of the initial laggard to turn a win into a head start. The main case that we consider involves each player getting a positive boost from winning the first contest. We find that, when the laggard gains a small head start following a win, the principal’s optimal choice is to spend all the money in the first contest, which in practice means running only that contest. Gaining a small head start does not incentivize the laggard to exert much effort in the first contest, and also the leader can then slack off. If the laggard can gain a sufficiently large head start before contest two, the principal prefers to run two contests. How much surplus he can extract from the players depends on the extent that the initial laggard can turn a win into a head start; we show when expected effort is increasing in this parameter, and when the whole prize fund is dissipated. A further case that we consider is when the initial leader, because of decay, ends up with a head start following a first contest win that is positive, but still smaller than his initial head start. Now it is the case that the principal will always prefer to run two contests, and for a large potential head start for the initial laggard, the previous results go through. When the head starts in the second contest are small, however, the heterogeneity between the players is reduced; since heterogeneity leads to lower expected effort, the principal puts the whole prize fund into the second contest since it is more even. The first contest is fought purely for position. Clark and Nilssen (2018) have looked at win-loss dynamics in a long series of contests with a common stage prize and ex-ante symmetric contestants. Ex-ante symmetry implies that the whole of the rent is dissipated, so that the design problem considered in the current paper does not exist there; rather, they consider situations in which the lagging player will give up, and those in which he will fight intensely to reduce the size of the disadvantage. Clark and Nilssen (2020) consider a similar design problem to this paper, but with a productivity bias instead of a head start.Footnote 4 Some results for full rent dissipation are achieved for competitions longer than two rounds in that paper, since one does not meet the possibility of zero efforts in any stage game; the knife-edge problem is hence not a complicating issue in that paper.Footnote 5 This paper is organized as follows. The model framework is presented in Sect. 2, and the solution and main result in Sect. 3 . We then consider in Sect. 4 how the results are affected when the head start for the initial leader can be reduced after he wins the first contest. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are contained in the “Appendix”.",5

However, it is well established that in many economic environments subjects often have social preferences.Footnote 1 In these environments, agents’ utilities depend not only on their own personal payoff but also on the payoffs of other agents in the society. In this paper, I study the problem of ex-post implementation of deterministic mechanisms in a simple model of social preferences.Footnote 2 I consider environments where each agent holds private information about his personal payoff from allocations and about the extent of his social preferences.Footnote 3 In the first part of the paper, I investigate the implementation of decision rules that depend only on information about the agents’ personal payoffs. I find that the possibility of implementing such decision rules in environments with social preferences heavily depends on the solution concept that is used for the implementation. I first consider Bayesian implementation and reestablish the result of Bierbrauer and Netzer (2016) that for each decision rule that is implementable in the environment where agents are selfish, there exists a mechanism that implements it in a Bayes–Nash equilibrium in every environment with social preferences as well as in the environment where agents are selfish. I then consider ex-post implementation and show that the ex-post implementation of non-trivial decision rules is impossible in environments with social preferences. In the second part of the paper, I consider the ex-post implementation of decision rules that depend both on information about the agents’ personal payoffs and on information about the agents’ social preferences. I present an impossibility result on ex-post implementation in environments where there exists an agent whose utility depends on the payoff of a selfish agent. This result indicates that the difficulty of robust implementation extends beyond decision rules that depend only on the agents’ payoff signals. This paper relates to the existing literature on implementation in models with social preferences and in particular the papers of Bierbrauer and Netzer (2016), Bartling and Netzer (2016), and Bierbrauer et al. (2017). The focus of these papers is on the implementation of decision rules that depend only on agents’ payoff types. They revolve around the notion of social-preference-robust mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are implementable in any setup with social preferences, including the setup where agents are selfish. Such mechanisms ensure the implementability of a decision rule even if there is no common knowledge about the existence and extent of agents’ social preferences. Bartling and Netzer (2016) and Bierbrauer et al. (2017) conduct experiments that show that social-preference-robust mechanisms perform significantly better than mechanisms that are suitable only to the setup where agents are selfish. These findings indicate that this notion of robustness is indeed important. Another important dimension of robustness is the robustness to the distributions of other agents’ payoff signals. A mechanism is payoff-information-robust if it ensures the implementability of the decision rule for any belief and higher-order beliefs of the agents about the payoff types of the other agents, see Bergemann and Morris (2005). The question arises of whether it is possible to construct a mechanism that is robust both in the dimension of the agents’ payoff information and in the dimension of social preferences. Such a mechanism would require that the incentive-compatibility constraints of each agent hold for every realization of payoff signals and for every realization of social preferences. The first result on the impossibility of ex-post implementation implies that it is impossible to construct mechanisms that are robust in both of these dimensions. The construction of the social-preference-robust mechanisms in Bierbrauer and Netzer (2016), Bartling and Netzer (2016), and Bierbrauer et al. (2017) is based on two properties. The first is that under the mechanism one agent’s actions cannot affect the payoff of another agent. This property is referred to in the literature as externality-free.Footnote 4 The second property is that the mechanism is incentive compatible in an environment where agents are selfish. Externality-free and incentive compatibility imply the social-preference-robustness of a mechanism in every model of social preferences in which agents behave selfishly whenever they cannot affect other agents’ payoffs. For example, inequity aversion models, e.g., Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and models of intention-based preferences, e.g, Rabin (1993). In the second part of the proof of the impossibility theorem I show that under mild assumptions on the economic environment, that are satisfied in most of the standard settings of mechanism design, externality-freeness and ex-post incentive compatibility cannot coexist. This result is general and does not depend on the specific model of social preferences. The implication of this result is that in any model of social preferences it would be impossible to construct a mechanism that is social-preference-robust and payoff-information-robust by constructing a mechanism that is both externality-free and ex-post incentive compatible. One economic environment in which the assumptions of this paper do not hold appears in Bierbrauer et al. (2017). They consider a bilateral trade environment where both the buyer and the seller have two types and present mechanisms that are social-preference-robust and payoff-information-robust by constructing mechanisms that are externality-free and ex-post incentive compatible.Footnote 5 They conduct a laboratory experiment that compares participants’ behavior under a mechanism that is both social-preference-robust and payoff-information-robust and under a mechanism that is only payoff-information-robust but not social-preference-robust. They find that the first mechanism performs significantly better than the latter. The fact that the mechanisms they compare are both payoff-information-robust and differ only in their social-preference-robustness enables to account the difference in the participants’ behavior under the different mechanisms to the existence of social preferences.Footnote 6 This paper relates to their work by implying that such an experiment cannot be replicated in most mechanism design environments, where externality-freeness and ex-post incentive compatibility cannot coexist, and that in order to conduct such an experiment one needs to carefully design the economic environment. Bierbrauer and Netzer (2016) consider social-preferences-robust mechanisms that are Bayesian implementable and present an extensive possibility result that is based on the properties of externality-freeness and incentive compatibility. The reason for the difference in the possibility to achieve both externality-freeness and incentive compatibility between Bayesian and ex-post implementation is the following. Externality-freeness means that an agent’s report does not affect the payoffs of other agents. This implies that the other agents’ transfers should eliminate the effect of this agent report on their valuation. In addition, under the requirement of incentive compatibility, these agents’ transfers must also incentivize each of them to report truthfully. Under ex-post implementation, these requirements for an agent’s transfer must be satisfied for every realization of signals. I show that this cannot happen without contradictions. However, under Bayesian implementation, these requirements should only be met in expectation, and then it is possible to construct transfer schemes that satisfy these requirements. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I present the model. In Sect. 3, I discuss the implementation of decision rules that depend only on agents’ payoff signals. I characterize the set of Bayes–Nash implementable decision rules and construct a transfer scheme that implements a decision rule that belongs to this set in every setup with social preferences as well as in the independent private values setup. I present an impossibility result of ex-post implementation. In Sect. 4, I present an impossibility result on the ex-post implementation of decision rules that depend both on agents’ payoff signals and their social preferences. I also discuss the difference between the social preferences model of this paper model and the classical interdependent values model. Section 5 concludes.",1

The equilibrium concept we adopt is an iteratively undominated strategy in the ex-post term, which is a very weak notion. Therefore, the uniqueness requirement is demanding. To achieve the allocation implied by a social choice function, which is contingent on the state, the unaware central planner must require informed players to reveal what they know about the state. Hence, the central planner must construct an appropriate mechanism that incentivizes each player to make the desirable (i.e., truthful) announcements as unique equilibrium behavior. This construction should be generally regarded as a difficult task. To overcome the difficulty, we assume partial ex-post verifiability, that is, after determining an allocation, the central planner can only observe partial information about the state. This observation is verifiable and contractible ex-post. Hence, to resolve the difficulty presented by this uniqueness issue, the central planner makes ex-post monetary transfers with these players. These transfers are contingent not only on players’ announcements, but also on the verifiable information. We thus present the possibility that this partial ex-post verifiability fully solves the unique implementation problem. We assume complete information about the state just before determining an allocation. We further assume incomplete information such that each player observes his (or her) private signal concerning the state earlier than the other players do. We design a dynamic mechanism, such that the central planner requires each player to announce his (or her) private signal at the earlier stage and announce the whole description of the state at the later stage. Based on this dynamic procedure of information acquisition and revelation, we introduce a condition on the state space, which we term full detection. We show that with full detection, an SCF is uniquely implementable via iterative dominance even if the information that can be verified ex-post is very limited, that is, even if the range of the players’ lies that the ex-post verifiable information can directly detect is quite narrow. Full detection requires the ex-post verifiable information to detect only a limited class of players’ lies. However, the elimination of these detected lies can help in turn detect another class of lies. By using this “chain of detection,” we can iteratively detect all possible lies. We show that full detection is a necessary condition for the existence of a direct revelation mechanism in which truth-telling is the unique iteratively undominated strategy for any player who concerns only his (or her) monetary transfer. We then show our main theorem, stating that full detection is generally sufficient for unique implementation via iterative dominance. The dynamic mechanism in our main theorem satisfies various severe restrictions such as boundedness (e.g., Jackson 1992), permission of only tiny monetary transfers off the equilibrium path, and no permission of transfers on the equilibrium path. Importantly, we do not assume either expected utility or quasi-linearity. In fact, we only make basic assumptions on preferences, such that each player’s utility function is continuous in lottery over allocations and is continuous and increasing in monetary transfers. The literature on implementation already establishes that it is generally impossible to uniquely (or fully) implement an SCF in a Nash equilibrium if there is no such verifiable signal.Footnote 1 For instance, Makin-monotonicity is a necessary condition for an SCF to be implementable in Nash equilibrium (e.g., Maskin 1999). However, Maskin-monotonicity is quite a demanding condition for a deterministic SCF. Several works attempt to weaken the requirements of unique implementation to derive the corresponding possibility results. For instance, Matsushima (1988) and Abreu and Sen (1991) show permissive results in the Nash equilibrium by considering stochastic SCFs and stochastic mechanism design, and then requiring not exact but virtual (i.e., approximate) implementability. Abreu and Matsushima (1992a) strengthens these results in virtual implementation by replacing Nash equilibrium with a much weaker solution concept termed iterative dominance, as well as by utilizing only bounded mechanisms (e.g., Abreu-Matsushima mechanisms). Palfrey and Srivastava (1991) replaces Nash equilibrium with a more restrictive solution concept termed weakly undominated Nash equilibrium, and then derived a possibility result in exact implementation. Abreu and Matsushima (1994) strengthens this result by replacing the uniqueness of weakly undominated Nash equilibrium with a more restrictive requirement, that is, the unique survival from the iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Moore and Repullo (1988) derive a possibility result in exact implementation by replacing the Nash equilibrium with a refinement, that is, subgame perfect equilibrium. Matsushima (2008a, b) derive possibility results in exact implementation by considering behavioral aspects of players such as preferences for honesty. Matsushima (2019) is the first work to incorporate ex-post verifiability into unique implementation, showing a very permissive result, such that with full ex-post verifiability, any SCF is uniquely and exactly implementable in iterative dominance ex-post. This is regarded as the most demanding of the solution concepts used in this literature. Matsushima (2019) imposes various severe restrictions such as boundedness, permission of only small transfers off the equilibrium path, and no permission of transfers on the equilibrium path. Moreover, Matsushima (2019) does not assume either expected utility or quasi-linearity. Assuming the availability of ex-post verifiable information is plausible in realistic situations. By conducting a follow-up survey, the central planner can generally obtain a resultant verifiable consequence of an allocation decision. The importance of evaluating past policies afterwards and making use of this evaluation to improve future policy decisions is getting widely acknowledged. Matsushima (2019) aims to enhance incentives for players to coordinate with each other in achieving more desirable policies by utilizing subsequent evaluations as threats. However, the argument in Matsushima (2019) relies on the full verifiability of the state. It is generally unrealistic to assume that the state is fully ex-post verifiable, even if the technology to properly process data will substantially improve in the future. This study aims to extend the permissive result in Matsushima (2019) to the more general case of partial ex-post verifiability. This extension is by no means an easy task: without full verifiability, in a simple majority rule, players can successfully coordinate to communicate the same lie about the unverifiable parts of the state. Hence, we must develop a different mechanism design to detect such lies, and then clarify a condition under which this design method functions. This study proposes a new method for mechanism design and shows that full detection is a sufficient condition to guarantee the same result as in Matsushima (2019), even if we replace full ex-post verifiability with partial ex-post verifiability (full detection). This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model. Section 3 defines iterative dominance and unique implementation. Section 4 introduces full detection. Section 5 argues for the necessity of full detection. Section 6 shows the main theorem, and Sect. 7 concludes.",2

Despite the apparent simplicity of this question, the division of scarce resources is one of the most fundamental problems we face. In any distributional question, scarcity of means and plurality of goals collide, while material self-interest and social concerns might conflict. Recent empirical evidence shows that individuals tend to disagree on how the trade-off between personal income and fairness considerations is best resolved and on what the fairest outcome is. It is often assumed that left-wing voters are relatively egalitarian, while the political right is thought to focus more on efficiency. A disagreement about which qualities make a distribution or outcome desirable can greatly complicate any discussion that impacts the final distribution. If the difference of opinion between the political left and right is driven by fundamentally different views on what is fair, it is not surprising that political debate on issues like redistribution, the welfare system, or the provision of universal health care becomes heated. Finding an acceptable middle ground will require all parties to make concessions with regard to their moral ideals. Knowledge about these ideals can therefore greatly benefit the search for acceptable policies and achievable reform. In this paper, we measure the prevalence of four stylized distributional fairness types and relate them to personal characteristics and political preferences (an additional result in the appendix also relates fairness preference to charitable giving). To do so, we run an incentivized experiment in a large and heterogeneous sample (N = 2890 completed responses) of the German population in the German Internet Panel (GIP). In two tasks, the decision maker selects an allocation of money for two other, anonymous persons. By paying other respondents the chosen amounts, we incentivize decision makers to think about which distribution they consider fair.Footnote 1 We consider four normative criteria (types) suggested in the literature: equality of outcomes (egalitarian), maximizing the minimum (maxi-min), maximizing the total amount of resources (efficiency), and maximizing the highest outcome (maxi-max). The allocations are constructed in such a way that each of the criteria leads to a different choice by a decision maker. Spectator-type moral ideals are of significant importance in the organization of societies. In many political or policy decisions, an individual’s self-interest is not, or only indirectly, involved. Voters are asked to decide on many policy proposals that may never directly affect them, from the availability of birth control to women (for male voters), to a change in tax rates for incomes above their own, to the placement of a large power plant far away from their homes. Still, males, US conservatives, unions, and environmental organizations, respectively, have put up very strong campaigns around these proposals. Clearly these policies matter to voters, even if they are not personally affected by them. In the economic sphere, a spectator’s view plays a vital part when a company or person declares bankruptcy. A impartial third party is brought in to determine a fair way of distributing the (insufficient) assets over the competing claims. Despite the importance of spectator’s judgments, existing empirical evidence focuses mostly on situations where the decision maker has a personal monetary stake in the outcome and thus faces a potential trade-off between morals and self-interest. In this paper we avoid this trade-off completely and focus on spectator ideals directly. If individuals want to express their fairness ideals at a societal level, they can do so by voting for parties or policies that bring outcomes closer to those ideals. The political sphere is a good test case for the abstract, spectator-type fairness ideals, as the link between individual votes and societal outcomes is weak. If fairness ideals shape voting behavior, one would expect that individuals with egalitarian fairness ideals are more likely to support redistributive policies as these reduce inequality. Since these interventions tend to come at a cost, one would expect individuals who put more weight on efficiency are less likely to support such policies. A preference for more (less) redistribution should also increase the tendency of individuals to vote for more left-wing (right-wing) parties since left-wing parties tend to focus more on equality over efficiency than right-wing parties, ceteris paribus. Hence, we also expect these preferences to influence voter behavior after controlling for other relevant factors. Our main findings are that fairness preferences significantly relate to (i) support for government interventions to reduce inequality and (ii) views on tax rates, (iii) voting behavior. Secondary results, presented in the Appendix, show that egalitarian types are also more likely to donate money to charity than all other types. All these results continue to hold after including a battery of controls. Furthermore, we document several empirical facts regarding the distribution of fairness ideals. First, our sample of the German population predominantly and consistently chooses egalitarian allocations. From an economic point of view, these choices are striking: in both choice tasks the egalitarian option is (weakly) Pareto-dominated by at least one other allocation. Second, females are more egalitarian than males across all age groups. Third, males are more efficiency-minded than females. These two results are similar to a recurring finding in the literature on self-involved fairness that females put more weight on other people’s income.Footnote 2 Fourth, left-leaning voters are more likely to be egalitarian, whereas right-leaning voters are relatively more likely to be efficiency-minded. A noteworthy deviation from this trend can be found at the very extremes of the distribution. Individuals who place themselves at the extreme left or extreme right end of the political spectrum are overwhelmingly egalitarian. Fifth, age, education, and earnings all significantly correlate with fairness ideals. Since these are exactly the characteristics which differentiate students from the general public, our study also contributes to the question whether the fairness ideals held by students are similar to those found in the rest of the population as is discussed in Cappelen et al. (2007), Bellemare et al. (2008), Gaertner and Schokkaert (2011), Cappelen et al. (2015) and Fisman et al. (2017) for example. However, many of these studies have been confined to hypothetical settings (Konow 2003), our incentivized spectator design provides complementary results. Finally, maxi-max preferences are empirically irrelevant. Given that randomly clicking individuals would have chosen this option in 25% of the cases, we take this as evidence that individuals make deliberate choices. We proceed as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly discuss existing theoretical and empirical fairness research. Section 3 describes the survey and the experiment. Section 4 depicts the distribution and correlates of fairness views in our sample of the German population. Section 5 shows that fairness measures have predictive power for preferences about government intervention to reduce inequality, the tax rates and voting behavior. Section 6 concludes the article. The results regarding the correlation of fairness preferences and revealed charitable giving can be found in the Appendix.",15

In this paper we present a theory of choice resolutions, which is inspired by the same principle of revealing a hidden attitude, but aims at inferring a different type of knowledge. In fact, the outcome of our analysis consists of an acquired information about a possible ‘decomposability’ of the selection process into simpler—typically more understandable—choices. In real life, the process of choice naturally goes through several steps. Recent theories of bounded rationality provide different modelizations of this phenomenon: see, for instance, the approaches based on choice from menus—as in Dekel et al. (2001), Gul and Pesendorfer (2001)—, sequential rationalization—as in Apesteguía and Ballester (2013), Au and Kawai (2011), García-Sanz and Alcantud (2015), Manzini and Mariotti (2007, (2012), Masatlioglu and Nakajima (2013), Tyson (2013)—, and simultaneous multi-rationalization—as in Cherepanov et al. (2013), Kalai et al. (2002). In a similar, but somehow orthogonal, way, choice resolutions aim at capturing the possibility to understand a possibly complicated choice behavior by deconstructing it in simpler choices at different stages. Although the main use of choice resolutions is for deconstruction purposes—that is, going ‘backward’, starting from an observed choice behavior—, this technique can be also employed in the ‘forward’ direction, that is, to construct a choice out of simpler ones. However, in this paper we shall mostly concentrate on the ‘backward’ interpretation of resolutions, especially because of its relationship to theories of bounded rationality. Our main goal is essentially descriptive, namely to obtain an accurate breakdown of a choice process into simultaneous/sequential stages. To eventually accomplish this ambitious task, here we deal with the simplest version of a decomposition procedure, called ‘one-point resolution’. Nevertheless, we wish to clarify from the outset that this limitation is only apparent: in fact, a complete decomposition of a choice in elementary steps can always be obtained by a sequence of one-point resolutions. The idea of a one-point resolution is to deconstruct/reconstruct a primitive choice behavior using the following ingredients: (1) two disjoint choices, the ‘base’ and the ‘fiber’, defined on smaller ground sets; (2) a selected item in the base set, which is ‘blown-up’ into the fiber choice; and (3) an assumption of independence of the base and the fiber. More formally, we identify a base choice spaceFootnote 1\( (X,c_X)\) and a special item \(x \in X\), and then resolve x into a fiber choice space \((Y,c_Y)\), thus obtaining a larger choice space Here the set Z is formed by substituting the item x by the set Y, whereas the choice \(c_Z\) is a meaningful amalgamation of the choices \(c_X\) and \(c_Y\). The pair \((Z,c_Z)\) is called the one-point resolution of \((X,c_X)\) at x into \((Y,c_Y)\). Figure 1 gives an intuitive representation of such a process: the dotted lines suggest the idea of taking a magnifying glass, and looking at the item x in \((X,c_X)\) as being itself a menu with its own choice structure \((Y,c_Y)\). A one-point resolution  (Carte Blanche) The CEO of a corporation gives full authority to the Vice-President (VP) of the Research and Development (R&D) Department within an allotted budget: the goal is to develop new techniques to acquire market quotas, currently owned by competitors. Thus, all choices on the projects/investments of the R&D Department are made by its VP. In this model, the choices made by the CEO are encoded by \((X,c_X)\), the item x is represented by the investments concerning the R&D Department, and x is resolved into the choices effectively made by the R&D Department, encoded by \((Y,c_Y)\). The operation of one-point resolution naturally extends in two directions:  vertically, by ‘sequentially’ repeating the decomposition process any (possibly infinite) number of times for distinct base and fiber spaces; horizontally, by ‘simultaneously’ resolving several (possibly all) items of the base space into fiber spaces. The combination of vertical/horizontal resolutions yields a resolution tree, whose branches exhibit all delegations of independent tasks of an observed choice behavior.Footnote 2 Applications of resolutions are possible in several scenarios, e.g., corporate structures, investment portfolios, hiring process with limited budget. For instance, consider again the case of a corporation, whose complex organization induces the CEO to partially delegate decision authority to VPs of departments (which, in turn, have their own hierarchical structure). Then detecting the existence of fully autonomous units in the corporation by just looking at its choice behavior on projects may have a high strategic impact in the decision-making process of its competitors. In this context, the next example suggests how resolutions may apply in an ‘unfair’ market competition. (Divide et Impera, alias Decompose and Bribe) Assume a corporation A wants to (re)gain competitiveness over another corporation B. To accomplish this goal at any cost, the CEO of A assembles a team of analysts. By carefully studying the investments of B, this team establishes that the decisions of the R&D Department of B are fully independent of the CEO of B. (For instance, imagine a situation in which all technical choices related to research are too novel and complicated to be judged by the CEO.) As a consequence, the CEO of A contacts the VP of the R&D Department of B, and bribes him to make research and development of B go to a dead end. In a different direction, resolutions are useful for obtaining a compact representation of a choice behavior in terms of simpler choices. The next example illustrates this point. (Gemma’s choice) On Sundays, Gemma and her family have lunch at the same restaurant. Gemma only likes a few dishes, namely pizza (p), chips (c), sea bass (s), and tuna (t). She chooses as follows (selected items are underlined): Thus, for instance, \(p\underline{c}\underline{s}t\) says that Gemma selects sea bass and chips even if pizza and tuna are also available in addition to them. The core of Gemma’s preferences is explained by a linear sequence of strict preferences over menus, namely \(\{c,s\} \succ \{c,t\} \succ \{p\} \succ \{s\} \succ \{t\}\), and everything else follows from it. Despite the simplicity of this choice, one-point resolutions do possess explanatory power also in this case. To illustrate the utility of the resolution model, let f (fish) be a ‘new’ item, and proceed as follows: \((X,c_X)\) is the base choice, where \(X = \{p,c,f\}\), and \(c_X\) is given by \(p\underline{c}\underline{f}\), \(\underline{p}c\), \(\underline{p}f\), \(\underline{c}\underline{f}\,\); f is the base point in X; \((Y,c_Y)\) is the fiber choice, where \(Y = \{s,t\}\), and \(c_Y\) is given by \({\underline{s}}t\). Then the choice (1) can be ‘decomposed’ as follows:Footnote 3 In other words, Gemma’s behavior has two representations, namely (1) and (2): the first is ‘direct’, and explicitly describes her tastes on each available menu; the second is ‘indirect’, and uses two simpler selections to describe her tastes. It is apparent that (2) is a more compact—and, possibly, more effective—description than (1). A first task of this paper is to examine the ‘rationality’ features of the resolution model. Recall that a choice is rationalizable whenever there is a binary relation such that the choice behavior is obtained by the maximization of this relation. Thus, it is natural to ask whether resolutions preserve (back and forth) the axioms of choice consistency that are related to rationalization, such as Samuelson’s (1938) WARP (Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference), Chernoff’s (1954) property \((\alpha )\), and Sen’s (1971) property \((\gamma )\), that is, Question 1: If an axiom of consistency holds for both the base choice and the fiber choice, does it also hold for the resolved choice (forward preservation)? What about the converse (backward preservation)? We show that the answer to the above question is positive—both forward and backward—for most of these properties. In particular, a resolved choice is rationalizable if and only if the base choice and the fiber choice are both rationalizable. However, one-point resolutions do not typically preserve (forward) the rationality features encoded by WARP. In other words, it usually happens that even if the base choice and the fiber choice are both rationalizable by a total preorder (reflexive, transitive, and complete), the transitivity of the revealed preference is lost in passing to the resolved choice. From an algorithmic point of view, resolutions may provide an alternative way to test the rationalizability of a choice. This is linked to the resolvability of a choice, that is, the possibility to understand a given choice as the resolution of two simpler choices. In fact, instead of testing directly that the original choice satisfies the two consistency properties \((\alpha )\) and \((\gamma )\)—which, as it is well-known, characterize rationalizability—, one may first test whether a choice is resolvable, and only then whether properties \((\alpha )\) and \((\gamma )\) hold for these simpler choices. Since the above procedure relies on an algorithm to test the resolvability of a choice, we also ask Question 2: Can we effectively detect whether a choice can be explained as the resolution of two simpler choices? In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to this question, characterizing resolvable choices by the existence of a shrinkable menu: this is a subset of the ground set such that an external observer cannot discern its choice structure from outside the menu itself. For descriptive purposes, in this paper we provide a taxonomy of resolutions for small ground sets, determining (up to isomorphisms) all choices on a three-element set that are resolvable. It turns out that these choices are also rationalizable. This enlightening fact suggests that the two notions of choice rationalizability and choice resolvability may be linked to each other. Thus, we raise a last query: Question 3: Is there any relationship between rationalizability and resolvability? Question 3 may look redundant. Indeed, on the one hand, rationalizability is a ‘global’ property, which reveals an underlying preference structure (in fact, the maximization of a binary relation explains choice behavior). On the other hand, resolvability is a ‘local’ property, which reveals the possibility to deconstruct the primitive choice behavior at a point (in fact, a magnifying glass is applied to an item of the base space). Maybe contrary to expectations, there is a striking connection: in fact, resolvability generalizes WARP. From a methodological point of view, the technical features of our model link it to the literature in mathematics. In fact, the analysis developed in this paper is inspired by that of a topological resolution, originally introduced by Fedorc̆uk, V. V. (1968), and then extensively studied by Watson (1992). This elegant mathematical notion has proven to be very useful in the field of set-theoretic topology, providing a common background for many seemingly different topological spaces. From a similar point of view, our model is also reminiscent of a well-known technique in graph theory: see the pioneering paper of Gallai (1967), as well as the follow-up literature on modular decompositions of graphs and more general structures. Graph decomposition has proven relevant also in economics: see, e.g., Moulin (1986) for a model of voting that employs these types of tools. Furthermore, the notion of composition of binary relations, as given in Bang-Jensen and Gutin (2001, p. 8), is a particular case of choice resolutions. From a different point of view, since we aim at detecting some facts underlying a choice behavior, the topic of this paper is linked to the literature on revealed preferences and bounded rationality. We shall mention several references of this kind along the way. Here we only recall some classical papers on the rationalizability of a choice, namely Samuelson (1938), Chernoff (1954), Arrow (1959), Sen (1971), and Plott (1973): their results will be fundamental in showing that most features of rationality are fully preserved by resolutions. Section 2 defines one-point resolutions and shows its full generality for decomposition purposes (Theorem 1). Section 3 answers Question 1, showing that rationalizability, rationalizability by a preorder, path independence, and rationalizability by two sequential criteria are preserved back and forth by resolutions (Theorems 2, 3, and  4); however, rationalizability by a total preorder is only preserved in special cases (Theorem 5). Section 4 answers Question 2, giving a descriptive characterization of resolutions by means of the notion of shrinkable menu (Theorem 6); it also shows that shrinkability is a generalization of the notion of ‘indiscernibility’ (Theorem 7). Section 5 partially answers Question 3, showing that any nontrivial choice satisfying WARP is resolvable (Theorem 8). Section 6 suggests future directions of research. All proofs are in the Appendix.",10

A TU-game consists of a set of players and a characteristic function that specifies a worth to each coalition of players. A single-valued solution or a value on a class of TU-games assigns a unique payoff vector to every game in this class. Proportionality is an often applied equity principle in allocation problems. The idea of proportionality can be traced at least as far back as Aristotle’s celebrated maxim, “Equals should be treated equally, unequals unequally, in proportion to relevant similarities and differences” from Nicomachean Ethics. With a natural proportionality consideration, the proportional ruleFootnote 1 (Moriarity 1975; Banker 1981) allocates the worth of the grand coalition in proportion to the stand-alone worths of its members. In this paper, we call this the proportional division value, shortly denoted by the PD value, in order to distinguish it from the proportional rule in claims problems, bargaining problems, insurance, law and so on.Footnote 2\(^,\)Footnote 3 Moulin (1987) characterizes the PD value for joint venture games, being a class of TU-games where intermediate coalitions are inessential, in the sense that the worth of every proper subset of the full player set equals the sum of the worths of its stand-alone coalitions. These are the quasi-additive games in Carreras and Owen (2013), where the PD value is discussed by comparing it with the Shapley value (Shapley 1953). Banker (1981) considers the situation that the worth of a coalition is a non-negative strictly increasing function with respect to the sum of the worths of its members. However, for more general TU-games, since the proportionality principle is not obvious, as far as we know, an axiomatic characterization of the PD value is still missing. In this paper, we axiomatize the PD value on the domain of TU-games in which the worths of all singleton coalitions have the same sign. This restrictive class of TU-games is considered in Béal et al. (2018) who also provide many applications. We focus on some intuitive fairness criteria that are widely used in the theory for TU-games, including equal treatment of equals (also known as symmetry), monotonicity, and consistency. First, we introduce a proportionality principle called proportional-balanced treatment, which is a strengthening of Shapley’s symmetry axiom. It states that the payoffs to two players whose contribution to every nonempty coalition not containing them is the same (we call this weak symmetric players), are proportional to their stand-alone worths. It well captures the principles of ‘equal treatment of equals’ and ‘unequal treatment of unequals’. Besner (2019) gives a similar axiom for the proportional Shapley value. Interestingly, proportional-balanced treatment together with efficiency and weak linearity as introduced in Béal et al. (2018), give a family of values that have a formula similar as the family of efficient linear and symmetric values (ELS values for short) introduced in Ruiz et al. (1998), but where the role of equal division is replaced by proportional division. While the Shapley value is the only ELS value that satisfies the dummy player property, we reveal that there is no value belonging to our family that satisfies the dummy player property. Instead, we adopt the dummifying player property introduced in Casajus and Huettner (2014), and obtain a characterization of the PD value. Second, we also provide characterizations of the PD value by applying weaker versions of well-known monotonicity axioms. A monotonicity axiom states that the payoff of a player should not decrease if a TU-game changes in certain ways that are ‘advantageous’ for this player. We introduce three such monotonicity axioms that are a relaxation of three existing axioms, by adding restrictions on the stand-alone worths of the players.Footnote 4 The three existing axioms are coalitional monotonicity due to van den Brink (2007), and coalitional surplus equivalence and coalitional surplus monotonicity, both axioms due to Casajus and Huettner (2014). Not surprisingly, any of our monotonicity axioms together with efficiency and symmetry cannot characterize a unique value. However, replacing symmetry by proportional-balanced treatment and any of our monotonicity axioms, characterizes the PD value. For a variable player set, we provide an axiomatization of the PD value using proportional standardness and the well-known projection consistency due to Funaki and Yamato (2001). Proportional standardness requires to apply proportional division for two-player games, and is used in Ortmann (2000); Khmelnitskaya and Driessen (2003); van den Brink and Funaki (2009) and Huettner (2015). Like other standardness axioms, proportional standardness is rather strong since it sets the payoff distribution for two-player games. Therefore, we conclude with characterizing proportional standardness on the class of two-player games. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides basic definitions and notation. In Sect. 3, we introduce proportional-balanced treatment and provide some results including an axiomatic characterization of the PD value. In Sect. 4, we offer three axiomatic characterizations using some monotonicity axioms. In Sect. 5, we give an axiomatic characterization on variable player sets by employing projection consistency and proportional standardness. In Sect. 6, we characterize proportional standardness for two-player games. Finally, there is an appendix with the proof of Theorem 1 and the independence of the axioms in the characterization results.",7

57.0,1.0,Social Choice and Welfare,10 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-020-01301-y,Small one-dimensional Euclidean preference profiles,July 2021,Jiehua Chen,Sven Grottke,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The one-dimensional Euclidean preference domain (also known as the unidimensional unfolding domain) is a spatial model of structured preferences which originates from economics (Hotelling 1929; Downs 1957), political sciences (Stokes 1963; Brams et al. 2002; Bogomolnaia and Laslier 2007), and psychology (Coombs 1964; Borg et al. 2018). In this domain, the alternatives and the voters are points in a one-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e., on the real line, such that the preference of each voter towards an alternative decreases as the Euclidean distance between them increases. One-dimensional Euclidean preferences are necessarily single-peaked (Black 1948) and single-crossing (Roberts 1977) as proven by Coombs (1964), Doignon and Falmagne (1994), and Chen et al. (2017). The reverse, however, does not hold. In his work, Coombs (1964) provided a sample preference profile with 16 voters and 6 alternatives that is single-peaked and single-crossing, but not one-dimensional Euclidean. This counterexample seems quite large for real world scenarios. For instance, in rank aggregation or winner determination elections, one often either has few alternatives to begin with, or may consolidate by first making a shortlist of only a few alternatives out of many, which will be considered for the final decision. There are also settings where only a few voters are involved, as for instance in a hiring committee or when planning holidays for a family. Hence, a natural question arising in the context of one-dimensional Euclidean preferences is whether for profiles with less than 16 voters or less than 6 alternatives, being single-peaked and single-crossing is sufficient for being one-dimensional Euclidean. In other words, we are interested in the following question: What are the tight upper bounds on the number of alternatives or voters such that profiles within these bounds are one-dimensional Euclidean as long as they are single-peaked and single-crossing? We note that all three restricted preference domains (single-peakedness, single-crossingness, and one-dimensional Euclideanness) can be detected in polynomial time (Doignon and Falmagne 1994). While both, single-peakedness and single-crossingness, admit direct polynomial-time detection algorithms (Doignon and Falmagne 1994; Escoffier et al. 2008; Elkind et al. 2012; Bredereck et al. 2013), detecting one-dimensional Euclideanness is done via a non-trivial but polynomial-time reduction to linear programming (Doignon and Falmagne 1994; Knoblauch 2010; Elkind and Faliszewski 2014). Moreover, while both, single-peakedness and single-crossingness, can be characterized by a small finite set of forbidden subprofiles (Ballester and Haeringer 2011; Bredereck et al. 2013), one-dimensional Euclideanness does not have this finite characterization since Chen et al. (2017) showed that there are infinitely many single-peaked and single-crossing preference profiles which are minimally not one-dimensional Euclidean, i.e., excluding any single voter from each of these profiles makes it one-dimensional Euclidean. We refer to the work of Bredereck et al. (2016) and Elkind et al. (2017) and the literature cited there for further discussion of the single-peaked, the single-crossing, and the one-dimensional Euclidean preference domains. Our contribution. Recently, Chen et al. (2017) provided a single-peaked and single-crossing profile with three voters and six alternatives which is not one-dimensional Euclidean. In this paper, we show that their counterexample is indeed minimal in terms of the number of voters and the number of alternatives. In terms of the number of voters, we show that any two single-peaked preference orders are always one-dimensional Euclidean. One way to achieve this would have been to analyze the linear inequalities induced by the linear programs (LP) for detecting one-dimensional Euclideanness (Doignon and Falmagne 1994; Knoblauch 2010; Elkind and Faliszewski 2014). We chose, however, to provide a direct algorithm that, given a single-peaked preference profile with two voters, constructs a concrete one-dimensional Euclidean embedding (see Algorithm 1). The reason for this choice is three-fold. First, from a social-choice and mathematical point of view, through our approach we not only know that all two-voter single-peaked preference profiles are one-dimensional Euclidean but also know that there are one-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of all such profiles which display a certain uniform structure. Note that if we had chosen to analyze the corresponding linear program and tried to show that it is always feasible, we may not be able to have a visual understanding of what the embeddings look like unless we had used an LP solver to solve the induced linear inequalities. Moreover, the embeddings provided by an LP solver may have looked completely different between different profiles. Second, from an algorithmic point of view, our approach is constructive and does not need any external LP solver. The algorithm is so simple that we can provide a publicly available software for individual checking. Third, from a complexity point of view, our algorithm is faster than the LP-solver approach. For m alternatives, our algorithm runs in \(O(m\cdot \mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {mult}(m))\) time, where \(\mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {mult}(m)\) denotes the running time of the multiplication of two integer numbers of O(m) bits each, while the LP-solver approach would need to check the feasibility of the underlying LP formulation in time \(O(\log ^3(m)\cdot \mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {matrix}(m))\) (van den Brand 2020), where \(\mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {matrix}(m)\) denotes the running time of multiplying an \(m\times m\) dimensional matrix. The multiplication of two integers of O(m) bits can be done in time \(\mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {mult}(m)=O(m\cdot \log (m)\cdot \log (\log (m)))\) (Schönhage and Strassen 1971) while the fastest known algorithm for \(m\times m\)-dimensional matrix multiplication runs in time \(\mathsf {runtime}\text {-}\mathsf {matrix}(m) =O(m^{2.38})\) (Gall 2014). As for the number of alternatives, we use the constraint solver CPLEXFootnote 1 to show that all single-peaked and single-crossing preferences with up to five alternatives are one-dimensional Euclidean (see Theorem 3). The proof for the second result is computer-aided and can be verified online (see Sect. 4). We note that we did not use the approach given by Doignon and Falmagne (1994), Knoblauch (2010), and Elkind and Faliszewski (2014) to first calculate a linear order of the alternatives and the voters that is consistent to a one-dimensional Euclidean embedding. Instead, our CPLEX program is simply a direct translation of the one-dimensional Euclidean constraints on the variables representing the alternatives and the voters (see Definition 3). The reason for this is that the CPLEX solver offers a function of returning the absolute value of the difference of any two variables, so a linear order of the alternatives and the voters is not necessary to formulate the one-dimensional Euclidean constraints in CPLEX. The verification that every computed embedding is indeed one-dimensional Euclidean is done in a straightforward way, namely by going through each voter’ preference order and comparing the distances between the voter’s and alternatives’ embedded positions. Identifying the smallest single-peaked and single-crossing preference profile that is not one-dimensional Euclidean not only helps to better understand what precludes a preference profile from being one-dimensional Euclidean, but can also be seen as a necessary step on the way towards a compact characterization via forbidden, albeit not finitely many, subprofiles. We remark that compact characterization via infinitely many forbidden substructures has been done for mathematical concepts such as interval graphs (Lekkerkerker and Boland 1962) and the consecutive ones property in binary matrices (Tucker 1972). Paper outline. In Sect. 2, we introduce necessary definitions, including single-peaked and single-crossing preferences, and one-dimensional Euclidean preferences. We also discuss some fundamental observations regarding these domain restrictions. In Sect. 3, we formulate our first main result in Theorems 1 and 2. We prove this result by providing a simple and direct algorithm (see Algorithm 1) that constructs a one-dimensional Euclidean embedding for any two preference orders which are single-peaked. We also provide an example to illustrate Algorithm 1 (see Example 3). In Sect. 4, we provide our second main result by describing the computer program that finds all possible preference profiles with up to five alternatives that are both single-peaked and single-crossing, and uses the CPLEX solver publicly available for researchers to provide a one-dimensional Euclidean embedding for each of these profiles (see Theorem 3). Both the source and the embeddings for all produced profiles (including the verification) are available online from https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/nysw13YkUajJpOn and https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/Pk8TZxva48LJt35, respectively.

Quite often, this activity is not only motivated by the egalitarian goal of reducing income disparities among the citizens, but also by the tactical objectives of the political actors competing in the elections. In this paper, we study several determinants of redistributive policies, emphasising in particular the role of political power sharing, inequality concern, and partisanship. In addition, we confront our predictions to the data using a panel of developed and developing democracies. Following recent research on social preferences and redistribution, pioneered by Alesina and Angeletos (2005a, b),Footnote 1 we first modify the canonical model of redistributive politics due to Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) to allow voters to express a concern not just about their own well-being (e.g., disposable income), but also about the well-being of other members of society. This is consistent with data from laboratory experiments and neuro-imaging studies, which show that people are to some extent willing to sacrifice personal gains and share resources with others to mitigate economic inequalities. In our model, the other-regarding concern enter into the voters’ and the parties’ preferences over redistributive policies as a concern with egalitarianism, i.e., a dislike of unequal outcomes per se.Footnote 2 This notion of social preferences matches closely the data used in the empirical part, which suggest consistently with Alesina and Giuliano (2010) that poorer groups of individuals posses a larger disutility from income inequality. It is worth noting that, in contrast with the inequity aversion concept of Fehr and Schmidt (1999), which expresses envy and altruism and is self-centered,Footnote 3 our idea of social preferences is rooted in Arrow’s (1963) tradition. That is, it is based on a “public-value” notion, as is referred to by Corneo and Gruner (2002), in the sense that individuals’ attitude towards income redistribution reflects some ideal or principle of social justice about how resources ought to be distributed in society. Besides introducing inequality concern into the utility function, we also extend the redistribution model of Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) to accommodate a continuum of power sharing rules, ranging from purely proportional representation to winner-take-all. This is motivated by the fact that in modern democracies, politics is not “all or nothing”, but most often it requires consensus and compromise among multiple policymakers (Powell 2000; Franzese 2010; Lijphart 2012). For the results of the paper, the amount of policymaking power shared by fair-minded political actors turns out to be crucial for shaping not only the intensity of electoral competition, but also the equilibrium policy. Following the modelling strategy of Saporiti (2014), Matakos et al. (2015), and Herrera et al. (2016), we represent power sharing in our framework with the help of a contest success function. This function is meant to reflect in a reduced-form the institutions of representation, governance, and policymaking (such as, separation of powers, the electoral system, forms of government, agenda-setting and veto powers, amendment procedures, etc.) that shape the mechanism that transforms the votes of the parties into the decision-making power or “influence” over the implemented policy.Footnote 4 In our case, it specifically determines the post-election power of the political parties as a function of their relative electoral strengths, i.e., in relation to their ratio of votes. The implemented policy is then defined as a compromise between the electoral proposals, each weighted by the party’s corresponding share of policymaking power.Footnote 5 The main results of the paper are as follows. First, we prove that, under fairly general conditions, our redistributive election game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. The proof rests on standard existence results for strategic games with a continuum of pure strategies. To guarantee the strict quasi-concavity of the conditional payoff functions, which are continuous over the strategy space, we impose a sufficient condition that bears similarities with Lindbeck and Weibull’s (1987). To elaborate, in our model each party’s payoff function consists of two terms. The first term captures the concern of the party members with income inequality, and it is strictly concave in the party’s own strategy. The second term expresses the interest of the professional politicians in policymaking power. This term is an increasing transformation of the party’s vote share function, and it does not need to be concave. It depends on the distribution of the partisan biases insight each voter group, the relative individual welfare associated with the redistributive policies of the parties, and the disproportionality with which political power is shared after the election. The condition we establish to ensure equilibrium existence imposes ipso facto two restrictions on the second term of each party’s conditional payoff function. On the one hand, it constraints the disproportionality of power sharing taking into consideration the shape of the vote share function. On the other hand, it demands that the (logarithmic) rate at which the percentage of votes of each party varies as result of changes in the relative welfare of the groups be limited by the overall concavity of the voters’ utility function. This latter part guarantees that the party’s vote share is concave, but it is stronger than Lindbeck and Weibull’s (1987) condition, since inequality concern relates in a non-trivial way the margin vote share associated to each income group with the net transfers received by the other groups. Second, to understand the nature of the pure-strategy equilibrium, we characterize the net transfers to the groups using the first-order conditions of each party’s constrained optimization problem. We show that both parties select the same tax-and-transfer policy, which can be divided into two parts. The first part coincides with the optimal policy of a purely egalitarian party, and it is given by the difference or gap between the population and the group mean initial income. The second part represents the amount of tactical redistribution across income groups carried out for electoral purposes, and it depends on the interplay of three main factors: (i) the (relative) partisan independence of the poor, (ii) parties’ and voters’ inequality concern, and (iii) the electoral rule disproportionality. Third, we derive from our equilibrium characterization a number of testable predictions that guide the empirical work. Among them, our analysis shows that the net transfers to all groups rise with the income gaps. Likewise, the gap between the partisan independence of the poor and the average across all income groups increases the transfers to the poor and reduces income inequality. We also find that inequality concern curbs electoral redistribution and inequality, transferring resources from the middle class and the rich to the poorer segment of society. Interestingly, an effect in the opposite direction on the net group transfers is driven by power sharing disproportionality. With regard to the after-tax income inequality, we prove that the Gini index after redistribution increases as policymaking power gets more concentrated in the majority winning party. The latter as well as the effect of power sharing over the net transfers take place if and only if parties are fair-minded, in which case the intensity of the electoral competition (determined by power sharing) affects parties’ willingness to trade off equity for votes. By contrast, if parties maximize simply the expected vote shares, targeted spending to the swing voter groups is not affected by the power sharing regime. Finally, fourth, we confront the above predictions to the data using an unbalanced panel (depending on data availability) of developed and developing countries.Footnote 6 Our paper adds in that regard to both, the empirical literature on the probabilistic voting model of income redistribution, and the empirical analysis of income inequality under different electoral rules. To start, we build a panel of countries and years based on information provided by the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), from which we get the group transfers, their disposable incomes, and the Gini, and by a series of socio-economic and political datasets, from which we construct the other main variables of the model. To elaborate, we use the European Social Survey to gather information about the extent to which voters consider that it is “important that people are treated equally and have equal opportunities”, which approximates our concept of voters’ inequality concern. This database also informs about the voters’ partisan alignment, which we employ to estimate the partisan independence within the income groups. On the other hand, to measure power sharing, we rely on the index of electoral rule disproportionality due to Taagepera (1986), which fits well with our theoretical concept.Footnote 7 To construct the index, data on the total number of voters and parliamentary seats and the mean electoral district magnitude are obtained from various sources, including the Manifesto Project of Volkens et al. (2015) and Carey and Hix’s (2011) dataset.Footnote 8 We then carry out a series of regressions, accounting for country-specific, time-invariant fixed effects (FE) when the sample size allows, and conducting pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) otherwise. As happens with other studies in the field, the empirical evidence does not validate the well-known Meltzer and Richard’s (1981) hypothesis by which progressive income redistribution is positively linked to the gap between the mean and the median of the pre-tax income distribution. In contrast, and in line with the theoretical results derived in this work, it does offer support for a highly statistically significant association between (i) the net group transfers and the income gaps, at 1% significance level, and under both OLS and FE, and (ii) the after-tax Gini coefficient and the electoral rule disproportionality, at 1% significance and under OLS. Consistent with our theory, the data also show a statistically significant association between the net group transfers and the power sharing index. This is confirmed at 1% significance level for the middle-class and the rich under OLS, and at 5% for the poor group under both OLS and FE. In addition, we find some evidence of a negative and significant (at 10%) association between the Gini and party inequality concern, particularly when controlling for voters’ inequality concern and partisan independence. The net transfers to the poor group are also found under OLS to be empirically associated (at 1% significance) with party inequality concern. However, regressions accounting for voters’ inequality concern and partisan independence do not lend almost any empirical support to their association with the net transfers and the Gini coefficient. Although these results are obtained from relatively smaller datasets, they are in line with other results in the empirical literature on targeted spending, which find weak evidence in validating the swing voter argument. In our case, the results are also consistent with the fact that fair-minded parties engage less on tactical spending. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We set up the model in Sect. 2. The theoretical results are in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the hypotheses to be tested, the data, and the main empirical results. Section 5 concludes the paper discussing the key findings and the related literature. For expositional convenience, Appendix A collects the proofs; and Appendix B displays the countries and the years informing the regressions, and a brief overview of the results under the alternative econometric specifications considered in this work. Finally, the online appendix offers summary statistics, a more detailed exposition of the regressions carried out, and several theoretical extensions.",

For example, in the context of the Paris Agreement, countries take stock of their contributions every  five years and set new target contributions for the next five years. This stock-taking every cycle of five years is equivalent to a round of play in which information over the incremental contributions of the co-players becomes available. The targets for the next cycle of 5 years are non-binging pledges, while the actual contribution efforts are yet to be made during the next round of  five years. Therefore, the setting of the Paris Agreement can be seen as a dynamic game in which contributions are made in increments to reach a threshold of contributions, i.e. the level of emissions that will keep the temperature below the famous two degrees celsius target. This dynamic contribution setting allows players to condition their contributions on the contributions made by other players in the past. This is in contrast to the static setting in which the contributor makes a single contribution decision simultaneously with other players’ contributions. The experimental literature on dynamic contributions games suggests, directly or indirectly, that total contributions in a dynamic setting exceed the contributions in the static one (Duffy et al. 2007). One explanation for this is provided by Schelling (1960), who argues that incremental contributions allow co-players to test each others’ trustworthiness for a small price. This hypothesis has been experimentally tested by Duffy et al. (2007) who find that contributions made dynamically without feedback between the contribution rounds are statistically equal to those made in a dynamic setting with feedback; however, they are significantly higher than those made in a static setting. This finding is puzzling because the dynamic contribution setting without feedback is theoretically equivalent to the static setting and, therefore, the contributions in these settings should not differ from one another. What is, nevertheless, the common feature between the dynamic settings with feedback and the dynamic setting without feedback is the sunk character of the contributions made in previous rounds of play. In the static setting, on the other hand, there is no opportunity to sink contributions. If some contributions are already sunk, a rational decision maker disregards them, such that current contributions are independent of past contributions. This, in turn, leads to more subsequent contributions especially when a target overall contribution is set, as is the case with a threshold public good. Unfortunately, Duffy et al. (2007) only report how individuals condition their contributions on co-players’ past contributions, but not how they condition their contributions on their own past contributions. Therefore, it is not possible to make conclusions regarding individual responses to sunk contributions. In this paper I test whether it is the individual rationality rather than, or in addition to, the conditionality on others’ behavior that explains the higher production of the public good in the dynamic setting compared to the static one.Footnote 1 In particular, I ask if the sunk individual contributions can explain the better performance of the dynamic setting in collecting contributions to goods that are provided only if a threshold is met. For this I set up an experiment in which subjects make contributions over two stages to a threshold public good. The experimental treatments differ with respect to the action space available in the second stage. In one treatment subjects have the option to withdraw the contributions made in the first stage, in part or entirely. This amounts to the possibility of making negative contributions in the second stage and it means that the first-stage contributions are not sunk. In the second experimental treatment subjects cannot withdraw their first-stage contributions and can only make null or strictly positive contributions in the second stage. Hence, the first-stage contributions are sunk. Because the purpose is to test whether the sunk character of the first stage individual contributions induces higher subsequent contributions, equal conditions should be ensured in the first stage. This is achieved by providing subjects with the same information before the first-stage contributions are decided. In particular, in the no-information condition the participants know that the option to withdraw the first-stage contributions occurs with 50% probability and that it is equally likely that they cannot withdraw these contributions in the second stage. As a control I include an information condition in which participants know before making their first-stage contributions whether these can be withdrawn or not in the second stage. Thus, the experimental design keeps the dynamic character of the contribution decisions, which was made responsible for the higher contributions by the previous literature, but it isolates the effect of the sunk or non-sunk character of these contributions. The results show that the second-stage contributions are, indeed, higher when the first-stage contributions are sunk as compared to when they are not sunk, in both informational conditions. Moreover, the difference in the second-stage contributions between the sunk and the non-sunk treatments increases with the amount contributed in the first stage for both informational conditions and more so for the no-information condition. This is evidence that players respond positively to their own sunk contributions. Thus, these results support the hypothesis that the opportunity to sink contributions in the dynamic setting explains, at least partially, its better performance relative to the static one. However, in this experiment I do not find evidence of sunk contributions improving the provision of the public good. In particular, I fail to find statistical evidence that the total group contributions or the project’s success rates differ across treatments. However, this result does not invalidate the fact that individual player’s response to own sunk contributions may explain the better performance of the dynamic setting. Recall that in the setting of this experiment both treatments have a dynamic nature and although the static setting and the no-sunk treatments are theoretically equivalent, there may be behavioral differences which are not the objective of this paper. Finally, contrary to Duffy et al. (2007), I do not find evidence of subjects conditioning their contributions on the previous contributions of their co-players. However, I find that a player’s contribution in the second stage increases in her expectations about her co-players contributions in the same stage. This effect is stronger and statistically significant in the “no information” condition, showing that the beliefs about other players’ contributions substitutes for some of the uncertainty present in this informational condition. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows as follows. The next section discusses the related literature. Section 3 outlines the experimental design, the theoretical predictions and the hypotheses to be tested. In Sect. 4 present the results, using both non-parametric tests and regression analysis. Section 5 concludes and discusses the limitations of the study.",

An ambitious interpretation of deeper fiscal integration involves implementing a common tax and transfer system (see, e.g, Casella 2005; Fuest and Peichl 2012). Nevertheless, shifting tax and transfer authorities to the EU level is not free of classical equity-efficiency considerations. To the best of my knowledge, a normative treatment of the issue in a Mirrleesian framework does not yet exist in the literature. This study simulates three optimal income tax scenarios in a Mirrleesian framework for 24 EU countries and quantifies the implications of implementing these tax scenarios. I use gross hourly earnings data from 2014 wave of the EU Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) in order to calibrate the model. In the benchmark scenario (scenario 1, S1), every country maximizes its own welfare over separate budget constraints. In the case of a European tax and transfer system (scenarios 2 and 3), the social planner maximizes the total welfare in the EU with respect to a common budget constraint. For this scenario, two different possibilities are considered. In scenario 2 (S2), the EU is treated as a single country and, hence, the same tax scheme is applied everywhere. In scenario 3 (S3), the social planner is able to condition the taxes to the country of residence (“tagging”).Footnote 2 The analysis begins by investigating the outcomes at the EU level. I find that both scenarios involving a common tax and transfer system yields welfare improvement compared to the benchmark. On the other hand, more than two-thirds of the agents become worse off. Whereas S2 leads to a contraction in total output up to 2.65%, efficiency implications of S3 are sensitive to the assumption regarding the income effects on labor supply. Specifications with and without income effects produce an expansion by 1.53% and a contraction by 0.62% respectively. As a next step, the implications of three scenarios on the economic outcomes by country are explored. In both S2 and S3, countries exhibiting relatively higher mean in the wage rate distribution (all of the Western and some of the Northern European countries) transfer resources to the other countries and become worse off. Transfers are higher in an S3 scenario. In relative terms, Denmark transfers the most resources in both S2 and S3 (around 13% and 24% of its total gross income respectively). S2 implies higher labor distortions for almost every country, explaining the aggregate decline in total output. In S3, compared to the benchmark, high-mean countries are distorted more and low-mean countries are distorted less. Yet, the social planner is able to extract higher labor effort from high-mean countries when the utility function incorporates income effects. When the utility function does not allow for income effects, higher distortion in high-mean countries directly translates into lower total output. As a result, implication of S3 on aggregate output is dependent on the specific form of the utility function. The national tax schedules are analyzed in order to understand the changes in welfare distributions within individual countries. In low-mean countries, those with the lowest income benefit the most from cross-country transfers of S2 and S3. In countries with a high mean and low standard deviation (e.g., Sweden), distortion and average taxes on the rich rise sharply in S2 compared to the benchmark, making them the worst off in terms of indirect utility. On the other hand, countries with high mean and high standard deviation (e.g., Germany) exhibit higher overall marginal taxes in the benchmark. Therefore, S2 does not lead to a significant shift in the marginal tax rate schedule. In such countries, the poor are the worst off in S2 because they must share the tax revenues with the poor in low-mean countries. In S3, the latter effect dominates and leads to a disproportional decline in the indirect utility of the poor in all high-mean countries. S2 and S3 demonstrates the significant losses that high mean countries have to bear for a European tax and transfer system. In order the limit the extent of the direct losses, I investigate a more restrictive scenario. Social planners of S2 and S3 solve their problem with an additional constraint, that is, linearly aggregated social welfare must not be lower than the benchmark in any country. Together with the new constraint, the social planners ensure that a certain fraction of the individuals in transferring countries is better off as a result of the integrated European tax system. In this scenario, S2 does not yield an improvement in social welfare and, hence, it is not investigated in detail. S3, different than the full optimum, implies lower optimal marginal income taxes for every country. While about half of all Europe is better off and there is sizable output expansion in S3 compared to benchmark, increase in total welfare is restricted to 1%. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the related studies and the contribution of this study. Section 3 formalizes the social planner’s problems in the three scenarios. Section 4 introduces the two specifications used for the utility function. Subsequently, the calibration procedure is explained. The EU-level, country-level and within-country results are presented. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",
57.0,2.0,Social Choice and Welfare,18 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-021-01320-3,Collective decision under ignorance,August 2021,Takashi Hayashi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper studies aggregation of preferences under ignorance, in the sense that everybody knows that the true probability distribution lies in some objective set but knows nothing about which one in it is true or which one in it is more likely to be true. When a policy or collective choice is being considered, the society and its members try to calculate the resulting probability distribution over outcomes. Although certain scientific knowledge and institutional restriction (such as law and contract) allow us to narrow down the range of possible probability distributions, due to lack of complete knowledge, typically we can conclude only that the true probability distribution belongs to some set. Throughout the paper, we call such set a probability possibility set.Footnote 1 The so-called precautionary principle states that in such situation the society should focus on the worst-case scenario and should try to respond to it. It is not obvious, however, what the “worst-case scenario” is at a social level, even when the individuals agree on what the probability possibility set is. Indeed, the individuals may disagree on what the worst-case scenario is. For example, under the current situation of COVID-19, although it is natural that the worst-case scenario for many people is further spread of the virus, it is also natural that the worst-case for other many people is damage to their economic activity and usual life and loss of jobs due to lockdown. We consider the problem of aggregating preferences over probability possibility sets. We adopt two decision models as expression of the precautionary principle, one is the maximin criterion and the other is the \(\alpha \)-maximin criterion, where the latter is a generalization of the former as it allows intermediate degrees of precaution. Thus we consider that individual preferences following the (\(\alpha \)-)maximin criterion are aggregated into a social ranking which satisfies the (\(\alpha \)-)maximin criterion. We point out that requiring the social ranking to satisfy the (\(\alpha \)-)maximin criterion has a conflict with the Pareto axiom, an equally appealing requirement, which states that if everybody ranks one probability possibility set over another so should the society. We show that Pareto implies dictatorship in each case of maximin and \(\alpha \)-maximin. The impossibility result forces us to choose between two options. One is to give up the (\(\alpha \)-)maximin criterion at the social level, the other is to weaken the Pareto axiom. We provide possibility characterization results for each of the options. The Pareto axiom has been criticized when subjective uncertainty is relevant, since double disagreements in beliefs and tastes may lead to spurious unanimity (Mongin 2016; Gilboa et al. 2004). There is no such disagreements in beliefs in our setting, as everybody faces the same probability-possibility set. However, there may be disagreements in supporting beliefs and that makes the Pareto axiom questionable, or at least awkward. Note that this type of disagreement happens also when individuals have a common multiple-prior belief over a state space (Gajdos et al. 2008). To illustrate, consider that there are two individuals, A and B. They face a choice between two policies, one yields a possible set of outcomes \(\{x,y\}\), where we do not know anything about which is one is true or which one is more likely to be true, the other yields a singleton set \(\{z\}\), where we are sure that the outcome is z. Suppose A prefers x over z and z over y, B prefers y over z and z over x. When we apply the precautionary principle to each individual’s preference, both A and B would prefer \(\{z\}\) over \(\{x,y\}\), because for A the worst-case scenario from \(\{x,y\}\) is y and for B the worst-case scenario from \(\{x,y\}\) is x. But then, the society is endorsing two mutually exclusive scenarios when it ranks \(\{z\}\) over \(\{x,y\}\). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the setting and present the main axiom, Pareto. Section 3 presents results in the problem of aggregating maximin preferences.

In some cases, audits are determined based on sophisticated computer algorithms that can detect discrepancies or construct risk profiles based on tax returns. In other cases, tax authorities target taxpayers according to observable characteristics, like their profession or domicile.Footnote 1 Periods of intensive controls are a widely discussed tool for preventing crime (Sherman 1990; Di Tella and Schargrodsky 2003; Kleiman 2009; Eeckhout et al. 2010). Auditing specific categories or groups more intensively may help a tax authority coordinate its efforts for a given period. Those targeted by these policies might increase their compliance temporarily to avoid sanctions. However, they might also feel unjustly treated, e.g., compared to taxpayers in similar categories or other locations who are not inspected with the same intensity. This could lead such policies to backfire, as taxpayers could stop complying once the pressure is reduced or start misbehaving in other contexts, e.g., by not pay other kinds of taxes.Footnote 2 What are the effects of these policies? Do taxpayers become more compliant both while and after they are targeted? We investigate both the dynamic evolution of tax compliance under aggressive audit policies and how these policies affect tax compliance once the pressure on taxpayers is alleviated. In our experiment, taxpayers are asked to contribute repeatedly to a public project that generates indistinct benefits to the group of contributors.Footnote 3 Tax agents are instructed to implement inspections only when the roll of a fair die delivers a certain outcome. This sets a rule they are supposed to follow, deontologically. However, tax agents are free to misreport the outcome and implement as many inspections as they like and force taxpayers to comply. When a tax inspection is implemented, taxpayers are sanctioned with a fine proportional to the amount of taxes evaded. The reward of tax agents is experimentally manipulated and is either fixed (Flat) or proportional to the taxes paid (Contingent). We hypothesize that tax agents will break the rule and try to enforce high compliance with frequent inspections, if their monetary incentives outweigh their lying costs. However, our main focus is on how taxpayers respond to these inspections. Our prediction derived from a standard model is that they should fully comply if they perceive the probability of being inspected to be high enough. Taxpayers, then, go through a phase in which they face a fixed probability of being inspected. This recreates a situation in which pressure is reduced after a period of intensive audits. Fines are non-deterrent, as we want to look at potential spillover effects from the previous phase. More specifically, if taxpayers respond only to monetary incentives or feel that the pressure put on them was unjust, they could start evading to voice their disapproval. Alternatively, taxpayers might internalize the norm of high compliance and continue paying their taxes. We find that, as expected, tax agents tend to violate the rule set by the random device and over-inspect their taxpayers. However, they do so irrespectively of their incentive scheme. Taxpayers who are more frequently inspected display a higher degree of tax compliance. Crucially, compliance stays high also when audits become random, and the expected impact of fines is not large enough to deter evasion, showing a positive spillover effect and no major backfire effect. Interestingly, tax agents can be classified into distinct types based on their auditing strategies. Some of them implement constant inspections, while others adopt more sophisticated strategies that teach taxpayers high compliance. Tax agents following the rule set by the random device never manage to discipline their taxpayers. Our experiment offers a unique test-bed to investigate the effect of aggressive auditing policies on compliance. First, it allows us to track compliance levels precisely. Second, it enables us to get at the causal effects of policies that would be very hard to evaluate with real-world data. Our results suggest that aggressive audit strategies can be used to increase tax compliance and that, once high compliance is reached, tax authorities can release pressure without the fear of a backfire effect. We provide a more extensive discussion of the implications and limitations of our findings in the “Conclusion” (see Sect. 6).",

However, no extant measure of social welfare accommodates all three. The Total Measure accommodates only quantity. The Average Measure accommodates only quality. Prioritarian versions of these measures accommodate equality, but fail to accommodate either quantity or quality. Assuming that all three factors are important, a different kind of measure is thus called for. In this essay I present a new measure (or strictly speaking a class of measures) that accommodates all three factors. The measure conjoins two separate measures of positive and negative social welfare. Each of these, as well as their aggregate, satisfies at least five plausible conditions. In this respect the measure does better than the Total and Average measures, which satisfy only three of these conditions, and their prioritarian modifications, which satisfy only four. The five conditions are:
 –An equivalence condition, according to which two populations that are equivalent in terms of individual welfare are ranked as equal in terms of social welfare. –A dominance condition, according to which a population that dominates another in terms of individual welfare is ranked above the dominated population. –A quality condition, according to which a population with higher average welfare is ranked above a population with lower average welfare, in comparisons between populations with the same total welfare and maximal degree of equality. –A strict monotonicity condition, according to which the addition of an individual with positive welfare results in a higher ranked population, and the addition of an individual with negative welfare results in a lower ranked population. –An equality condition, according to which a population with a higher degree of equality (in a specific sense of “equality”) is ranked above a population with a lower degree of equality, in comparisons between populations with the same total and average welfare. In addition to these five conditions, the conjoint measure also satisfies: –An asymmetry condition, according to which negative individual welfare affects social welfare more than positive individual welfare, when their absolute values are equal. These conditions are individually plausible and mutually consistent, but their joint satisfaction is nevertheless a challenge. The measure consequently has a somewhat complicated form. It will be presented later in this essay, the plan of which is as follows: in the next section I make some necessary assumptions regarding the measurability of individual and social welfare; in the third section I present the conditions concerning quantity, quality and equality; in the fourth section I introduce the measure and explain its design; in the fifth section I address some possible objections, and in the sixth section I make some concluding remarks.

The worth of a coalition S is the number of pairs of gloves that can be formed by the members of S: Players of different type (i.e. owning different types of gloves) are perfectly complementary, whereas players of the same type (i.e. owning the same type of gloves) are perfectly interchangeable and in competition for doing business with players of the other type. Glove games are examples of market games (Shapley and Shubik 1969) where players own nonnegative bundles of goods and the value of a coalition is computed by redistributing the initial endowments of their members such that the sum of the individual (continuous and concave) utilities is maximal. To be more precise, glove games are glove-market games: market games where all utility functions are the same and given by \(u(a)=\min \{a_1,\ldots ,a_m\}\) for every \(a\in {\mathbb{R}}^m_+\). In other words, combinations of 1 unit of every good are valuable and can be sold at a selling price that is normalized to 1. The classes of glove-market games, market games, flow games (Kalai and Zemel 1982), linear production games (Owen 1975) and risk allocation games (Csóka et al. 2009) all coincide with the class of totally balanced games, as argued in Apartsin and Holzman (2003) and Csóka et al. (2009). Glove-market games where each player owns one unit of precisely one good (like in glove games) are called unitary glove-market games in Apartsin and Holzman (2003), T(ype-based)-market games in Brânzei et al. (2007) and ocean games in Rosenmüller and Sudhölter (2002). We will refer to these games as multi-glove games here. Multi-glove games are totally balanced, so core elements exist for the game and all its subgames. However, it is not always possible to choose such core elements in a monotonic way: allocations to players do not decrease if the coalitions to which they belong become larger. In other words multi-glove games do not have to admit a population monotonic allocation scheme (pmas). In Sprumont (1990) it is shown that the four-player glove game with two players owning a left glove and two players a right glove lacks a pmas. In this note we generalize multi-glove games in the sense that players are allowed to own more than one glove but only gloves of the same type. We will refer to these games as weighted multi-glove games. We will show that these games are totally balanced (a result that by the way also directly follows from the fact that the class of weighted multi-glove games fall within the class of glove-market games). We will characterize the class of pmas-admissible weighted multi-glove games and the class of convex or supermodular weighted multi-glove games. Finally, we will provide an explicit expression for the Shapley value of the supermodular and a large part of the pmas-admissible weighted multi-glove games. This note is organized as follows. Some preliminaries and notation are introduced in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we present our main results.",1

The proposal is accepted if it is supported by a number of votes at least equal to a fixed majority threshold. Voters are endowed with different weights, so their vote can be more or less important to approve the proposal. Player’s voting power is its ability to influence the approval or the rejection of the issue and it depends on its possibility of forming winning coalition. Every time that the voter can join a loosing coalition and let it win, it expresses an influence to the vote results, and the greater is the number of such coalitions, the greater is the player’s power. This is the underlying idea behind most voting power indices proposed in the literature, the most famous being the Shapley-Shubik index (1954), and the Banzhaf index (1965). The calculation of both indices requires the enumeration of all coalitions, e.g. all subsets of voters, but they are an exponential numbers and it has been formally proved that this enumeration is NP-complete and #P-complete, Prasad and Kelly (1990). Still, the indices can be calculated efficiently using dynamic programming, Matsui and Matsui (2001), generating functions, Bilbao et al. (2000), or accurately approximated by the multilinear extension, Leech (2003). The standard definition of power indices assumes that all coalitions will form with the same probability, defining what are called the a-priori or unrestricted power indices. In these models no assumption is made about voters’ preferences: This is an assumption that has been often criticized, see for example Garrett and Tsebelis (1999), as there are real applications in which voters’ preferences take a strong role in coalition formation. For example in Western Parliaments coalitions between left-wing and right-wing parties excluding the central ones are hardly seen. Therefore, realistic political analysis should consider that some coalitions are more probable than others and the power definition should be modified accordingly. Researchers have addressed unequal coalitions probability by: (i) Restricting the family of feasible coalitions, Rodriguez-Veiga et al. (2016), for example imposing that some voters always vote in opposite directions, Alonso-Meijide et al. (2015) and Yakuba (2008), or also assuming that voters form a-priori unions before casting their votes, Alonso-Meijide et al. (2009), Amer et al. (2002) and Leech and Leech (2006; ii) Assuming that some coalitions are more probable than others, for example when voters are located in Euclidean political spaces the most likely coalitions are composed of voters that are close to each other, Benati and Vittucci Marzetti (2013), Passarelli and Barr (2007) and Mielcova (2016). One of these models is relevant here: It is the spatial voting game proposed in Pajala and Widgrèn (2004), for which a large set of empirical data has been collected, Thomson et al. (2012; iii) Assuming that voters are embedded in a communication graph, in which the vertices represent voters and the edges represent communication links. In this family of models a coalition is feasible if and only if the coalition induces a connected subgraph. These models have been introduced in Myerson (1977) and applied to voting situations in Alonso-Meijide and Fiestras-Janeiro (2006), Benati et al. (2015), Chessa and Fragnelli (2011), Fernandez et al. (2002), Skibski et al. (2015) and Álvarez Mozos et al. (2013), where they have been called graph restricted games or spectrum games, to emphasize that voters are located on a political spectrum. In this paper, we consider the computation of Banzhaf and Shapley indices for graph restricted voting games, defined to a particular class of graphs that we call line-clique graphs. In these graphs, voters are located on consecutive cliques posed along a line, as if voters were located in a 0–1 political segment and they could share the same political position. The practical interest to these graphs is that they exactly describe the spatial voting game proposed in Pajala and Widgrèn (2004) to model nations’ positions and the bargaining process of the Council of the European Union. This model has been used for empiric political analysis, Badinger et al. (2014), Leinaweaver and Thomson (2014) and Schneider et al. (2010), as, based on this model, an interesting data set of empirical observations is available, Thomson et al. (2012). The paper is structured as follows: In the first part of the paper, after defining power indices and graphs, we discuss the application of #P-completeness theory to the calculation of power indices, Matsui and Matsui (2001) and Prasad and Kelly (1990), outlining that the theory excludes the possibility of algorithms calculating power indices in polynomial time. The technical reason is that an index of power must enumerate and count how many coalitions have a given property, that is, in how many coalitions a player i is a swing voter. Excluding polynomiality means that there is no fast way of counting the number of such coalitions. However, the #P-completeness theory separates counting problems that are #P-complete in the weak sense from problems that are #P-complete in the strong sense, Jerrum et al. (1986) and it has important consequences for the algorithm design. Basically, what separates the two classes is the possibility of using dynamic programming for an exact counting. If a problem is #P-complete in the weak sense, then we can apply dynamic programming principles to devise pseudo-polynomial algorithms (algorithms that are linear with respect to the size of the input data, instead of being log-linear as required by being polynomial), that, even though not fully efficient from a theoretical point of view, they are very fast in practice, see Bilbao et al. (2000) and Uno (2012). Conversely, strong #P-complete problems exclude even the possibility of pseudo-polynomial computation and for those cases, calculating the number of coalitions can be done only through simulations, Castro et al. (2009), Castro et al. (2017) and Benati et al. (2019). Unfortunately, it has been proved in Benati et al. (2015) that indices of graph restricted voting games are strong #P-complete problems. However, in that paper it has also been found that counting coalitions can be weak #P-complete if the graph has a peculiar structure. So, at present some pseudo-polynomial algorithms were proposed for same specific cases: For example, when the graph is a tree, Benati et al. (2015), or has bounded tree-width, see Skibski et al. (2015). A further graph class admitting pseudo-polynomial algorithms is introduced here: the line-clique graphsFootnote 1. In the second part, after having coded the dynamic programming as Fortran/R subroutines, the power indices are applied to the EU negotiations data set described in Thomson et al. (2012). So, power distributions among European countries can be analyzed and different indices compared. We will see that unrestricted indices, that is, indices not considering spatial location, can be empirically interpreted as an average of those graph restricted, as theoretically advanced in Passarelli and Barr (2007). Then, we will see that, when applied to decision processes, graph restricted indices are better predictors of the outcomes of the negotiation processes, perhaps because restricted indices are measuring in a more realistic way the real political forces underlying the bargaining processes.",

Moreover, it has been shown that—apart from guaranteeing impartiality—randomization allows the circumvention of well-known impossibility results that have plagued social choice theory for long (see, e.g., Gibbard 1977; Brandl et al. 2016, 2019b; Hoang 2017; Brandl and Brandt 2020). Two types of randomized voting rules that have been shown to be attractive from an axiomatic point of view are random (serial) dictatorships and maximal lottery (\( ML \)) schemes. While random dictatorships are renowned for being immune to strategic manipulation, \( ML \) schemes satisfy desirable consistency conditions (such as Condorcet-consistency, population-consistency, and composition-consistency) as well as a very strong version of Pareto efficiency. Maximal lotteries were first conceived by Kreweras (1965) and independently proposed and studied in more detail by Fishburn (1984a). The basic idea is to circumvent the Condorcet paradox—which lies at the heart of many impossibility theorems—by introducing the concept of a randomized Condorcet winner whose existence is guaranteed by the minimax theorem. Interestingly, maximal lotteries have been rediscovered several times by economists (Laffond et al. 1993), mathematicians (Fisher and Ryan 1995), political scientists (Felsenthal and Machover 1992), and computer scientists (Rivest and Shen 2010). In particular, Laffond et al. (1993, 1996), Dutta and Laslier (1999), Laslier (2000) and Brandt et al. (2018) have extensively studied the support of maximal lotteries, called the bipartisan set or the essential set.Footnote 1 Felsenthal and Machover (1992) and Rivest and Shen (2010) also discuss whether \( ML \) schemes are suitable for real-world political elections. Rivest and Shen conclude that [the maximal lotteries system] is not only theoretically interesting and optimal, but simple to use in practice; it is probably easier to implement than, say, [instant-runoff voting]. We feel that it can be recommended for practical use. (Rivest and Shen 2010, p. 1) More recently, Peyre (2013) and Hoang (2017) have popularized maximal lotteries in France under the name scrutin de Condorcet randomisé (randomized Condorcet voting system).Footnote 2 An easy-to-use web interface for computing various \( ML \) schemes (including 
 and 
 schemes) is available on the website voting.ml. Other online voting services that use 
 and 
 can be accessed through votation.ovh (in French) and pnyx.dss.in.tum.de, respectively. The literature on maximal lotteries often ignores the fact that there are different variants of maximal lottery schemes, which under certain circumstances may lead to entirely different outcomes (e.g., two lotteries with disjoint support). All these (infinitely many) variants are captured by Fishburn’s original classification of maximal lotteries (Fishburn 1984a). The two main candidates are 
schemes (which only depend on unweighted majority comparisons) and 
schemes (which only depend on weighted majority comparisons). 
 schemes have, for example, been considered by Kreweras (1965), Felsenthal and Machover (1992), Laffond et al. (1993), Fisher and Ryan (1995), Peyre (2013) and Hoang (2017) while 
 schemes have been considered by Dutta and Laslier (1999), Laslier (2000), Rivest and Shen (2010), Aziz et al. (2018), Brandl et al. (2016) and Brandl and Brandt (2020). In this paper, we provide a detailed analytical and experimental comparison of all \( ML \) schemes in terms of economic efficiency, strategic manipulability, and the degree of randomization. Apart from clarifying the differences between \( ML \) schemes, we also aim at improving our understanding of two potential drawbacks of maximal lotteries. First, as already observed by Fishburn (1984a), maximal lotteries may violate monotonicity in the sense that improving an alternative in an individual preference ranking may reduce the probability that this alternative will be chosen. For the special case of three alternatives, Fishburn formally explains this behavior and essentially attributes the paradox to our lack of intuition when arguing about cyclic pairwise majorities. In this paper, we prove that all \( ML \) schemes satisfy a relative version of monotonicity, which further illuminates and alleviates this phenomenon. Secondly, like with any randomized voting procedure, there are persistent reservations whether randomization would be acceptable to the general public. For example, Felsenthal and Machover write that “an inherent special feature of [maximal lotteries] is its extensive and essential reliance on probability in selecting the winner [...] Without sufficient empirical evidence it is impossible to say whether this feature of [maximal lotteries] makes it socially less acceptable than other majoritarian procedures. It is not at all a question of fairness, for nothing could be fairer than the use of lottery as prescribed by [maximal lotteries]. The problem is whether society will accept such an extensive reliance on chance in public decision-making. Different societies may have differing views about this. For example, it is well known that the free men of ancient Athens regarded it as quite acceptable to select holders of public office by lot. Clearly, before [the maximal lotteries system] can be applied in practice, public opinion must first be consulted, and perhaps educated, on this issue.” (Felsenthal and Machover 1992, pp. 268–269) While we cannot give a definitive answer to this question, we ran extensive computer simulations which show that the average degree of randomization of maximal lotteries is surprisingly low. Even under very conservative assumptions about the distribution of preferences and up to 21 alternatives, the average support size of maximal lotteries lies below 4. When there are only 5 alternatives, maximal lotteries do not randomize at all in more than 75% of all considered cases.",1

Comerford,Leonhard K. Lades,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How should social planners allocate scarce resources? Should they subsidize health care? Or invest to protect the environment? Or support the local automobile industry by reducing taxes? Welfare economists often answer such questions with reference to the Kaldor–Hicks criterion which suggests that a policy is efficient and should be implemented if the gainers from the policy could potentially compensate the losers. To quantify utility gains and losses, welfare economists observe choices, reconstruct the underlying preferences from these choices, and use preference satisfaction as the welfare criterion. Using this choice-based approach to calculate utility gains and losses from policies assumes that the utility function that informs individual choices is the same utility function that informs the welfare people obtain from policies that the planner imposes on them. However, this might not always be the case. This paper considers the welfare implications of responsibility utility, which can incentivize people to choose an outcome other than that they would rather have imposed on them. We are not the first to point out that, under certain circumstances, people choose outcomes other than those they would rather receive (e.g., Choshen-Hillel and Yaniv 2011); there is even an old joke on the subject.Footnote 1 The phenomenon has gone relatively unexplored in economics, however. This may be because there is no term in economics that captures the ranking of outcomes that people would rather receive, as distinct from those they would rather choose. We introduce that term: a desirance.Footnote 2 The difference between a desirance and a preference is that a desirance relation is defined over exogenously determined outcomes while a preference relation is defined over outcomes chosen by the agent. For example, someone who indicates that she would rather it rains tomorrow reveals a desirance (not a preference) for rain over dry weather. Systematic discrepancies across desirances and preferences are predicted, for example, in the literatures on signalling, self-signalling, warm glow, social pressure, regret, and delegation as reviewed in Sect. 2.2. We identify one key source of the distinction between desirances and preferences as responsibility utility. Desirances are informed solely by what Loomes and Sugden (1982) call choiceless utility, which they define as “the utility that we would experience from an outcome if it were imposed on us” (Loomes and Sugden 1982, p. 807). As such, it is choiceless utility alone that determines the utility engendered by goods that are exogenously provided, e.g., as gifts, as externalities, or provided by policies. Whereas desirances are informed by choiceless utility alone, preferences are additionally informed by responsibility utility (though responsibility utility may take a value of zero). Responsibility utility is the utility that derives from being responsible for a choice. We argue that responsibility utility and the difference between preferences and desirances have important implications for evaluating the welfare effects of policies. The distinction suggests that, in certain situations that can be identified ex ante, the revealed preference approach to welfare estimation is biased. The reason for this is that choices are partly informed by responsibility utility whereas responsibility utility cannot influence the utility people obtain from being subjected to an outcome, such as a policy. Hence, the relevant measure for evaluating which policy, if imposed on a population, would maximize utility is desirance, and not preference. We discuss the distinction between desirance and preference in detail in Part 1 of the paper and come back to the implications for welfare analysis in Sect. 3.4. In Part 2, we suggest a way to measure choiceless utility and to elicit desirance rankings in practice. We first specify a non-responsibility criterion for the measurement of desirances. This criterion assumes that people cannot obtain responsibility utility from outcomes they are not responsible for. It requires that the subject whose ranking of outcomes is observed must believe that her ranking cannot influence the probability that any particular outcome is provided. We then discuss Subjective Well-Being (SWB) data, such as data on experienced affect and life satisfaction, as a measure for desirance. Unlike choice data from incentive compatible experiments, SWB data can fulfil the non-responsibility criterion and thus be used to calculate choiceless utility net of responsibility utility. This gain in conceptual precision may outweigh errors that result from hypothetical bias, i.e. the difference between answers people give to hypothetical questions compared to answers they give to questions with real consequences. We then suggest anticipated SWB as a generalizable means to elicit desirances and illustrate the use of anticipated SWB in an experiment. We also show that responsibility utility and the difference between preferences and desirances can help organise and explain patterns in the literature. In particular, responsibility utility is one mechanism that can explain systematic discrepancies across anticipated SWB and choice, such as those reported in Benjamin et al. (2012, 2014). We consider how SWB measures might evoke differing levels of responsibility utility than choice procedures, which would cause choice trade-offs to differ from SWB trade-offs. A related contribution is that our framework offers an empirical strategy to test whether responsibility utility explains anomalies and puzzles in the literature. As our experiment in Sect. 3.2 shows, we can use survey questions to recover measures of responsibility utility. In our data, this responsibility utility measure explains the discrepancy in rank order of outcomes across preference and desirance. This finding implies that our approach could be applied generally to test whether responsibility utility explains choice reversals. This empirical exercise could be useful when the goal is to extrapolate predictions and estimates from one specific choice context and apply them to others. The concept of responsibility utility and the distinction between preferences and desirances relate to several literatures that discuss the way economists and other social scientists conceptualise utility. In the political economy literature (e.g., Morton et al. 2019; Robbett and Matthews 2018; Schuessler 2000; Spenkuch 2018), it is argued that “people obtain expressive utility, for example, by confirming pleasing attributes of being generous, cooperative, trusting or trustworthy, or ethical and moral” (Hillman 2010, p. 403). Expressive utility can potentially be delivered by any action—voting (Hillman 2010), responding to a survey (e.g., Bullock et al. 2015), and incentive-compatible market choices (e.g., DellaVigna et al. 2012) are examples. For precision, we coin the term responsibility utility to describe the subset of expressive utility that derives from being responsible for a choice. We separate it from other forms of expressive utility because responsibility utility has particular implications for welfare estimation that other forms of expressive utility do not. Responsibility utility is also a subcomponent of what Frey et al. (2004) term procedural utility—the notion that outcomes deliver differing levels of utility depending on how they come about. The procedure by which the outcome comes about is decisive to responsibility utility: if the outcome is exogenously generated then responsibility utility is strictly zero. Our paper is also related to the distinction between decision utility and experienced utility made by Kahneman et al. (1997). Both approaches imply that the utility that informs choices can differ from the utility that informs welfare. However, in Kahneman et al. (1997) dissociations between choices (decision utility) and welfare (experienced utility) are the result of cognitive biases that lead agents to make decisions that do not maximise welfare (see also Sunstein 2007, 2020; Weimer 2017). Cognitive biases play no role in the current analysis. Responsibility utility can induce rational, fully-informed decision makers to choose outcomes other than those they expect would have maximised their utility had the outcomes been exogenously determined. The remainder of the paper is structured in two parts. Part I reviews prior literature through the lens of our preference/desirance distinction. We present theory (Sect. 2.1) and evidence (Sect. 2.2) that a distinct utility function informs incentive compatible choice than informs a rank ordering over exogenously determined outcomes. Part II investigates which data might recover more accurate measures of the benefits delivered by exogenously determined outcomes. Section 3.1 suggests using SWB data to measure desirances, and Sect. 3.2 presents a short experiment illustrating that it is possible to measure desirances using anticipated SWB measures. Section 3.3 suggests that responsibility utility is one potential explanation for some key results reported in Benjamin et al. (2012, 2014) about differences across choice and anticipated SWB data. Section 3.4 concludes by discussing the policy-implications of our preference/desirance distinction suggesting that sometimes measures of desirances, rather than preferences, should be used in welfare analyses.",

Moreno-Ternero,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a recent paper (Bergantiños and Moreno-Ternero 2020a), we have introduced a formal model to analyze the problem of sharing the revenues from broadcasting sports leagues among participating teams (clubs), based on the audiences they generate. It is a stylized and simple model, yet rich enough to obtain numerous interesting insights. The model’s input is simply a square matrix (A) whose entries (\(a_{ij}\)) indicate the audience of the game the two corresponding teams play, with the convention that the row team (i) plays home and the column team (j) plays away.Footnote 1 The goal is to (axiomatically) derive rules that associate for each matrix an allocation (among participating teams) of the overall audience in the tournament (i.e., the aggregation of all entries in the matrix). In this paper, we uncover the structure of this stylized model further, thanks to the axiomatic approach. Our starting point is the principle of impartiality, with a long tradition in the theory of justice (e.g., Moreno-Ternero and Roemer 2006). The basic formulation of such a principle is typically the axiom of equal treatment of equals. In our setting, this axiom can take two forms, depending on how we define the concept of equals. One says that, to consider two teams as equals, they should generate the same audience each time they play a third team. Another says that, moreover, the (two) games played by those two teams also generate the same audience. We shall refer to both axioms as equal treatment of equals and weak equal treatment of equals, respectively. Depending on the stance one takes with respect to the audience in the games involving each pair of teams, one might consider one or the other axiom more appropriate. To wit, if we consider each pair of teams accountable for the total audience they generate at the two games involving them, equal treatment of equals seems to be the right one. If, instead, teams should be held accountable for the audience generated at their own stadiums, so that \(a_{ij}\ne a_{ji}\) justifies to treat i and j differently, then weak equal treatment of equals seems to be the right one. As the names suggest, equal treatment of equals implies weak equal treatment of equals. We also formalize an axiom that fills the gap between both axioms: pairwise reallocation proofness. This axiom says that a redistribution between the two audiences of the games involving a pair of teams does not affect the amounts obtained by the teams in the pair. We explore the implications of the previous axioms, when combined with some other basic axioms: additivity, maximum aspirations, non-negativity and weak upper bound. The first one, which is standard in axiomatic work and can be traced back to Shapley (1953), says that awards are additive on audiences. The other three formalize reasonable (lower or upper) bounds, which are principles with a long tradition in the literature on fair allocation (e.g., Thomson 2011, 2019). More precisely, maximum aspirations says that no team can receive an amount higher than its claim (i.e., the aggregate audience at all the games in which the team was involved). Non-negativity says that no team receives negative awards. Finally, weak upper bound (which is weaker than the previous two axioms) says that individual awards are bounded above by the aggregate audience obtained at the whole tournament. We show that equal treatment of equals, additivity and maximum aspirations characterize the so-called EC-family of rules, which is made of compromises between two rules that stand out as focal to solve this problem.Footnote 2 They are the so-called equal-split rule, which splits the revenue generated from each game equally among the participating teams, and concede-and-divide, which concedes each team the revenues generated from its fan base and divides equally the residual. Each rule within the EC-family of rules is defined by a parameter that establishes the specific convex combination between the solutions the equal-split rule and concede-and-divide yield (for each problem). The equal-split rule can be seen itself as a convex combination between the so-called uniform rule (another focal rule in this model, which allocates an equal portion of the whole audience to each participating team) and concede-and-divide. We shall refer to the resulting family of rules compromising between the uniform rule and concede-and-divide via convex combinations as the UC-family of rules. Alternatively, one could consider linear (but not necessarily convex) combinations between those rules. And that would give rise to the generalized UC-family. It turns out that if we replace maximum aspirations by non-negativity or weak upper bound then we characterize two other subfamilies of the generalized UC-family of rules. The three characterization results mentioned above can be formulated alternatively upon replacing equal treatment of equals by the pair of axioms made of weak equal treatment of equals and pairwise reallocation proofness. More interestingly, it turns out that replacing the latter by a somewhat similar axiom yields completely different outcomes. More precisely, we consider the axiom stand-alone pair, which states that in situations where only the games involving a pair of teams have a positive audience, the total audience should be allocated to such a pair of teams. The combination of this axiom with additivity, weak equal treatment of equals and any axiom from the group made of maximum aspirations, non-negativity and weak upper bound characterizes a new family of rules. We call them split rules, as they generalize the equal-split rule to allow for unequal (but fixed) splits of the audience of each game between the two playing teams. Somewhat related to the above, we also consider the axiom of homogeneous effect of stand-alone pair.  This axiom says that, in situations where only games played by a pair of teams have a positive audience, the remaining teams obtain a homogeneous amount. To complement the results mentioned above, we characterize the family of rules satisfying homogeneous effect of stand-alone pair, additivity, and weak equal treatment of equals. In such a family, the amount each team receives depends on three numbers: the overall home audience of the team, the overall away audience of the team, and the total audience of the whole tournament. There is a weighted aggregation of these three numbers and the weights are the same for each team. Finally, our axioms of equal treatment of equals can naturally be strengthened to axioms of order preservation. If we do so, we can obtain additional characterization results. To wit, we show that order preservation, additivity and maximum aspirations also characterize the EC-family of rules (thus, being an “inferior” result to the one mentioned above with equal treatment of equals). On the other hand, we show that order preservation, additivity and non-negativity characterize the so-called UE-family of rules, which is made of compromises (in the form of convex combinations) between the uniform rule and the equal-split rule. And order preservation, additivity and weak upper bound characterize the UC-family of rules mentioned above, which is precisely the union of the previous two families. The last three characterization results can also be formulated alternatively upon replacing order preservation by the pair of axioms made of home (or away) order preservation and pairwise reallocation proofness. And replacing the latter by stand-alone pair , we obtain completely different outcomes too. More precisely, the combination of additivity, home (respectively, away) order preservation, stand-alone pair and any of the three bounds axioms, characterizes one half of the family of split rules: those that impose a fixed split of the audience of each game between the two playing teams, but guaranteeing at least (respectively, at most) one half to the local team. We conclude our analysis dismissing the bounds axioms in these last results. That is, we characterize the rules that satisfy additivity, home (or away) order preservation or weak equal treatment of equals , and pairwise reallocation proofness or stand-alone pair. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the model, axioms and rules in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we provide the characterization results. We conclude in Sect. 4. For a smooth passage we defer all proofs to an appendix.",7

However, limitations in the underlying data sources lead to both upward and downward biased estimates of inequality of opportunity (IOp). Both biases are potentially large in emerging countries where the data quality is arguably worse than in industrialized economies. However, it is not clear ex ante which of the two biases prevails and whether IOp estimates rather tend to be downward or upward biased. In this paper, we address this uncertainty by constructing lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) estimates of IOp for twelve emerging economies and compare them to estimates from the conventional approach. EOp distinguishes ethically justifiable (fair) inequalities from unjustifiable (unfair) inequalities using the concepts of circumstances and effort.Footnote 1 Circumstances are defined as all factors that are not under the control of the individual—for instance, the biological sex, the parental background and the birthplace. To the contrary, working hours and educational decisions are under the (partial) control of individuals and are therefore characterized as efforts. Opportunity egalitarians consider inequalities based on exogenous circumstances as unfair, while inequalities resulting from effort exertion are deemed fair sources of inequality (among others Cohen 1989; Arneson 1989). This distinction is not only relevant from a normative perspective but provides important insights for the patterns and drivers of economic development (Marrero and Rodríguez 2013; Peragine et al. 2014; Ferreira et al. 2018; Neidhöfer et al. 2018). For instance, a leveled playing field fosters human capital accumulation by providing incentives for skill acquisition (Mejía and St-Pierre 2008). Furthermore, circumstance-based variation in life outcomes reflects horizontal inequality and segregation, both of which are important drivers of social tensions and conflict (Rohner 2011). What we call the “standard approach” (S) towards IOp estimation in this paper, constructs a counterfactual distribution of life outcomes from a linear prediction using all circumstance information observable by the econometrician. In line with the opportunity-egalitarian doctrine, inequality in this counterfactual distribution is considered “unfair” since it only varies with immutable circumstance characteristics. Due to limitations in the underlying data sources, this conventional method can lead to both upward and downward biased empirical measurements of IOp. First, due to the partial observability of circumstances, standard IOp estimates tend to be downward biased (Balcázar 2015; Hufe et al. 2017). The downward bias may be particularly pronounced in countries that lack household surveys combining information on the outcome of interest with rich information on individual characteristics. Most emerging economies fall into this category. Second, if the ratio between the number of parameters to be estimated and the available degrees of freedom is large, the ensuing noise in the parameter estimates will artificially inflate the measured impact of observed circumstances on individual life outcomes (Brunori et al. 2019b). Emerging economies may again be particularly susceptible to such upward bias in standard IOp estimates since the sample sizes of available household surveys tend to be comparatively small. Ex ante it is unclear which of the two biases prevails for the group of emerging economies. As a consequence, policy makers that rely on standard estimates may over- or underestimate the true degree of IOp and enact policy measures without considering the uncertainty around such estimates (Kanbur and Wagstaff 2016). In this paper, we address the uncertainty around empirical IOp estimates by drawing on longitudinal household surveys from twelve emerging economies which enable us to estimate both LB and UB measures of IOp. First, we calculate LB measures of IOp by estimating the impact of observable circumstances on incomes with a cross-validated lasso procedure. Assessing statistical models by out-of-sample cross-validation disciplines the process of model selection and therefore prevents overfitting the circumstance parameters to the estimation sample. As a consequence, the relevant circumstance parameters are estimated with less noise which in turn cushions upward biases in IOp measures. Second, we leverage the panel dimension of the data to calculate UB estimates based on the individual fixed effect (FE) estimator proposed in Niehues and Peichl (2014). By their most common definition, circumstance characteristics are time-constant but partly unobservable by the econometrician. Individual FEs capture the full set of unobservable circumstances and therefore yield the maximum amount of outcome variation that can be explained by circumstances. However, individual FEs also capture time-constant effort variables and therefore may overstate the extent of unequal opportunities. Hence, they yield an upper bound of the true IOp estimate. Our results can be summarized as follows. In emerging economies the standard approach of estimating inequality of opportunity produces results that closely align with the lower bound. In theory, the restricted data infrastructures of many emerging economies could lead to either upward biased (small sample sizes) or downward biased (little circumstance information) estimates. In practice, the latter concern clearly dominates the former in our sample. With respect to individual (equivalized household) incomes, the average difference between the standard estimate and the lower bound estimate is 5.7 (5.0) percentage points (pp). To the contrary, the average distance between the standard estimate and the upper bound estimate is 22.8 pp (28.5 pp). These results from emerging economies contrast recent evidence for European countries. For example, Brunori et al. (2018) show for a set of European countries that standard estimates may be upward biased by up to 300%. This contrast emphasizes that the particularities of data environments are crucial for an assessment of the relative importance of upward and downward biases. Second, the large distance between the standard estimate and the upper bound estimate in emerging economies emphasizes the concern of providing misleading reference points to policymakers who could use downward-biased estimates of IOp to downplay the moral significance of inequality (Kanbur and Wagstaff 2016). In the absence of data innovations, providing reasonable bounds on inequality of opportunity may be the only way to address such concerns. Our paper is the first to conduct such a bounding exercise for a set of emerging economies with broad geographical coverage and thereby contributes to the growing literature on EOp in these countries.Footnote 2 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we formalize the EOp concept and outline the corresponding estimation strategies for its LB and UB measures. After introducing the data sources in Sect. 3, we present results and robustness analyses for both LB and UB estimates in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.",2

Since we consider jurors who are heterogenous with respect to their ability to determine the true state of Nature (equiprobably A or B, Innocent or Guilty), it turns out that the order in which they vote affects the reliability of the majority verdict. By reliability we simply mean the probability that the majority verdict agrees with the actual state of Nature. We prove that for a jury of size three with any fixed abilities, the voting order with greatest reliability is median ability first, then highest ability, then lowest. Using simulation, we suggest that, for medium-sized juries, the median ability juror should still vote first. Then the abilities should increase, and after the highest ability juror votes, the rest should vote in decreasing order. An intuition for this is that if the highest-ability juror votes first, then herding may reduce the contribution of the others; if he votes last, then the majority verdict may be decided before he even gets to vote. In a model where jurors have private information in the form of a binary signal (A or B), Condorcet showed that for jurors of common ability \(p>1/2\) (probability of a correct signal), or of varying abilities all at least p, the reliability approaches 1 as the jury size increases. Our model is a little more sophisticated than that of Condorcet in two ways: signals and abilities. Condorcet’s voters get a binary signal, for A or for B. Our jurors get a signal s in the interval \([-1,+1]\), with higher signals giving a higher probability of A. The signal \(s=0\) is neutral and useless, as A and B remain equally likely after such a signal. In analogy with Condorcet’s probability p (that the binary signal is correct) our jurors have an ability in the interval [0, 1], which is proportional to the probability of A given a positive signal s, \(0<s\le 1\). An ability of 0 makes that probability 1/2, the same as the a priori probability and hence useless (no ability at all). Jurors of higher ability have, in general, more useful private information. When a juror of given ability comes to vote, he will vote for the alternative, A or B, that he views as more likely, given prior voting and his private signal s. This type of voting, called honest voting, models the jurors as experts who have known abilities by reputation. They wish to vote for the alternative that turns out to be true, assuming Nature is eventually revealed. This would be true if they are making short term predictions (say weather or the economy). This type of voting by experts was introduced by Ottaviani and Sørensen (2001), although they do not employ a majority verdict, which we will discuss in detail in the next section. Overall, the model of signals and abilities used here is the same linear signal model introduced in Alpern and Chen (2017b) in a simpler voting model and is similar in spirit to the discrete signal and ability model of Alpern and Chen (2017a), which is unique in some sense (Alpern et al. 2021). The way in which a juror’s signal and ability affect his judgement of the probability of A is described fully in Sect. 4. Given the above model, we are able to address four questions about the comparative reliability of different voting schemes or voting orders. The main question addressed in this article is the optimal voting order for jurors of different abilities. Putting higher ability jurors first is more likely to have them vote before a majority verdict is established, but also may create negative herding effects. We also consider when sequential honest voting, where jurors can take into account previous voting, is better or worse than simultaneous voting (or secret ballot)as in the Condorcet model. We also answer the question of whether, for fixed average ability, a more heterogeneous or homogeneous jury has higher reliability when voting in the optimal sequential order. Finally, we ask when sequential honest voting is optimal in that it maximizes the reliability of the verdict. If not, the jurors might be incentivized to jointly modify their voting thresholds to produce a better verdict, which could mean possibly voting for the alternative that a juror views as less likely. This might be accomplished by giving all jurors a reward later, if majority verdict turns out to be correct, or perhaps by giving them stock in the company making the decision. Since we are dealing with majority verdicts and, for a single member jury, all the above distinctions are meaningless, we consider a jury of three experts, where we find sharp answers to all of our above questions. We note that while electorates in preference voting are typically large, juries in information voting are typically small, and often of size three, such as refereeing team in tennis or boxing, appellate levels in legal decisions, doctors giving second or third opinions on the necessity of an operation. For juries of size three we are able to answer all of our above questions regarding comparative reliability. This paper is organized as follows. After a literature review in the next section, we present in Sect. 3 some simple results and intuitions under some simplified settings, before formally introducing our model in Sects. 4 and 5. We present our main results in Sects. 6–9, which are summarized as follows:  Optimal order of last two jurors (Theorem 1) For any odd-sized jury, reliability is maximized when the last two jurors vote in decreasing order of ability. Optimal voting order (Theorem 2) For juries of distinct abilities, the unique voting order that maximizes the reliability of the verdict for honest sequential voting is given as follows: the median ability expert should vote first, then the expert of highest ability, and finally the expert of least ability. [This order was suggested by numerical work in Alpern and Chen (2017a).] This is our main result and by far the hardest to prove. See also the introduction of the more general Ascending–Descending Order (ADO) ordering in Sect. 10: The median ability juror votes first, then the voting is in increasing order up to the highest ability. After the highest votes, the remaining jurors vote in decreasing order of ability. Monotonicity of reliability in ability (Theorem 3) Abler juries give more reliable verdicts. Seniority vs. anti-seniority voting orders (Theorem 4) The seniority voting order (decreasing order of ability) has a strictly higher reliability of the verdict than the anti-seniority order (increasing order of ability), unless all jurors have the same ability. Sequential vs. simultaneous voting (Theorem 5) When the abilities of the jurors are sufficiently homogeneous, simultaneous voting has higher reliability than sequential voting. But when the abilities are sufficiently heterogeneous, honest sequential voting (in the optimal order) has higher reliability. (We provide suitable indices of homogeneity and heterogeneity.) Effect of diversity on reliability (Theorem 6) For a jury of fixed average ability, reliability is an increasing function of the heterogeneity index. When is honest sequential voting strategic, that is, (perfectly) optimal? (Theorem 7) When the abilities of the jurors are sufficiently heterogeneous, honest sequential voting in the optimal order is strategic in that it maximizes reliability with respect to any (not just honest) strategy thresholds. While sequentially voting, if each juror also reveals his signal, what is the optimal order? (Theorem 8) The optimal order of sequential deliberation is the seniority order. Note that the proofs of all the aforementioned eight theorems are completely independent except that Theorem 2 is based on Theorem 1. The order in which these later results are presented could have been different. In Sect. 10, we consider majority voting of medium-sized juries and propose an analog of the optimal rank ordering of abilities for three-member juries. We complete our paper by making some concluding remarks in Sect. 11. To see how these results aid an organization that has to make a binary decision, consider that the organization has hired three experts of distinct abilities and wishes to determine the optimal voting mechanism. First, suppose it has no additional funds to incentivize strategic voting, so voting is honest. If the abilities of the fixed set of experts are sufficiently homogeneous, it should keep the voting silent (or simultaneous) by not allowing later voters to know the results of earlier voting (Theorem 5). (This is done for preference voting in US elections, but for different reasons.) If the ability set is sufficiently heterogeneous, then later voters should be told the outcome of earlier votes (Theorem 5) and they should vote in the order given by Theorem 2. We note that other variations are possible, for example, later voters could be told the votes of only some of the earlier voters. If the jury is not fixed, then Theorem 6 suggests that, assuming the cost of an expert juror is increasing in ability, heterogeneous juries might be preferable. Finally, we consider whether it might be advantageous to pay a bonus to each expert for a correct jury (majority) decision, assuming the correctness of the verdict becomes common knowledge in the near future, as with weather predictions. In general, this will be a cost-benefit problem, but Theorem 7 shows that such payments are wasteful if the ability set is sufficiently heterogeneous. For larger juries of odd size \(n=2m+1\), we propose the Ascending–Descending Order (ADO), where the most able \(m+1\) jurors vote first in increasing ability order and then the least able m jurors vote in descending ability order. We already know from Theorem 2 that ADO is optimal for \(n=3\). Using simulation techniques, we establish that the ADO is an excellent heuristic (and possibly optimal) for \(n=5\) and \(n=7\). To conclude the section, we remark that our problem can be viewed as a simple optimization problem faced by a decision maker, who has an unordered set of people to form a jury to help him make a binary decision. He wants to arrange their voting order so as to make the majority decision of the jury as reliable as possible. On the other hand, we can also view our problem more game theoretically as a Stackelberg game or principal agent problem. First, we are given an unordered set of jurors. The Principal, who moves first, selects an order in which they must vote. He wins the game (payoff 1; otherwise payoff 0) if the majority verdict is the true state of Nature. Then the jurors vote openly in the order selected by the Principal. In this sub-game, a juror wins (payoff 1; otherwise payoff 0) if his vote is the same as the true state of Nature. That is, the Principal cares only about the correctness of the verdict, while the jurors care only about the correctness of their own votes. In the sub-game, honest voting is exactly the unique Nash equilibrium. In fact, no juror can improve his expected payoff (probability he votes correctly) by changing from honesty, if the prior voters stick to honest voting. Thus it is stronger than the usual definition of Nash equilibrium.",1

Emel Öztürk,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Libertarianism attributes ethical value to laissez-faire outcomes. Not in the name of efficiency or welfare maximization, but in the name of individual freedom and rights. Proponents of this political philosophy accordingly regard redistributive taxation as inherently injust. Famously, Nozick (1974, p. 169) states that “[t]axation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor. \(\ldots \) taking the earnings of n hours labor is like taking n hours from the person; it is like forcing the person to work n hours for another’s purpose.” Similarly, Rothbard (1973, p. 85) argues that “the entire system of taxation is a form of involuntary servitude. \(\ldots \) [p]art of the essence of slavery, after all, is forced work for someone at little or no pay.”Footnote 1 Disapproval of redistribution is not exclusive to libertarianism. It also figures as a component in the influential statements of liberal egalitarianism by Arneson (1989) and Cohen (1989).Footnote 2 They argue that only inequalities for which individuals cannot be held responsible require redistribution. That is, redistribution ought to end where responsibility begins. As Arneson (1990, p. 176) puts it, “distributive justice does not recommend any intervention by society to correct inequalities that arise through the voluntary choice or fault of those who end up with less, so long as it is proper to hold the individuals responsible for the voluntary choice or faulty behavior that gives rise to the inequalities.” We introduce a “laissez-faire” principle to capture the ethical role for laissez-faire outcomes. To do so, we distinguish between an individual’s “market income” without government intervention and her “disposable income” after government intervention. Consider a social state in which disposable incomes coincide with market incomes. The laissez-faire principle simply says that redistribution that moves disposable incomes away from market incomes (while preserving total income) results in a socially worse social state. We show that the laissez-faire principle, when combined with the Pareto principle, puts strong demands on the social ranking. According to the “weak Pareto” principle, an increase in the disposable income (which we assume to measure utility) of every individual is a social improvement. Our main result says that a social ranking satisfies laissez-faire and weak Pareto only if it maximizes total disposable income (Theorem 1). That is, with the exception of comparisons involving equal total disposable incomes, the social ranking must ignore distributional considerations altogether. The result is striking, as it is counter to treating the relationship between disposable incomes and market incomes as intrinsically important. We further show that there is no social ranking that satisfies the laissez-faire principle and the “Pareto indifference” principle (Theorem 2). We provide a threefold discussion of our results. First, we clarify the relationship of our results with claims in the literature that identify Pareto indifference with a form of welfarism. This clarification is in order, as the laissez-faire principle with its reference to market incomes is clearly non-welfarist. Second, we show that the laissez-faire principle underlies the equal sacrifice principle of taxation. Our results thus allow us to draw conclusions on the extent to which the latter principle can be combined with Paretian considerations. Third, we show that our results bring to light a surprising link between the liberal reward principle, which formalizes the above-mentioned contra-redistributive idea of Arneson (1989) and Cohen (1989), and its rival principle of utilitarian reward. The intimate relationship of the laissez-faire principle with the equal sacrifice and liberal reward principles shows that our results are relevant also beyond the realm of libertarianism. Our results reveal a strong tension between the laissez-faire principle and the Pareto principle. This poses a clear challenge for the important task of incorporating libertarian and liberal egalitarian values into the standard “Paretian” economic framework for social evaluation.",2
58.0,4.0,Social Choice and Welfare,09 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-021-01364-5,The problem of no hands: responsibility voids in collective decisions,May 2022,Hein Duijf,Frederik Van De Putte,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The problem of no hands concerns the existence of so-called responsibility voids in collective decision-making: cases where a group makes a certain decision, yet no individual member of the group can be held responsible for this decision.Footnote 1 In arguments for and against the possibility of such voids, one particular example of collective decision-making plays a central role, viz. the discursive dilemma.Footnote 2 On the one hand, Pettit and others have argued that the decision procedure used in the discursive dilemma is vulnerable to responsibility voids (Copp 2006; Pettit 2007; List and Pettit 2011). On the other hand, Braham and van Hees (2011) argue that, if voting untruthfully is eligible, it is immune to responsibility voids.Footnote 3 In the present paper, we investigate whether such voids can arise even if untruthful voting is eligible. More precisely, we consider a wide class of collective decision procedures that includes the discursive dilemma as a special case and study the conditions under which responsibility voids can arise. Our investigation is important for several reasons. First, criteria-based collective decision procedures play a central role in democratic and legal institutions, and responsibility voids may indicate a flaw in their regulation (Thompson 1980; Bovens 1998).Footnote 4 Second, if it turns out to be difficult or impossible to hold any participant accountable for certain outcomes, then we may need to resort to an irreducible notion of collective responsibility (List and Pettit 2011).Footnote 5 Third, a clear allocation of responsibility for outcomes may incentivize participants to act responsibly and may thereby improve collective decision-making (Weaver 1986).Footnote 6 To explain what is at stake in this paper, let us introduce a particular version of the discursive dilemma. Suppose a committee consisting of three members—A, B, and C—has to decide on whether to invite a candidate for a job interview (for an academic position). To form their collective decision, the committee members do not vote directly on the issue of whether to invite the candidate; rather, they give their opinion as to whether the candidate satisfies three basic criteria: (R) she is a good researcher; (T) she is a good teacher; and (D) she will fulfil her administrative duties. The collective decision procedure is as follows. In the first stage, the committee members independently form their own opinion on each of the criteria and, then, share their opinions. In the second stage, the committee considers the majority opinion on each of the separate criteria and the collective decision is based on the majority opinion: the candidate is invited if and only if for each criterion there is a majority who expressed the opinion that she satisfies that criterion. Consider the scenario in which all but A submit that the candidate is a good researcher, all but B submit that the candidate is a good teacher, and all but C submit that the candidate will fulfil her administrative duties. Hence, the candidate satisfies each criterion according to the majority opinion and, as a result, the committee decides to invite the candidate. This scenario can be represented by the matrix in Table 1. What happens if it turns out that the candidate should not have been invited? In particular, can any of the committee members be held responsible for the decision to invite the candidate? Pettit (2007, p. 197f) defends a negative answer in a case similar to our example and concludes that responsibility voids are possible. However, Braham and van Hees (2011, 2012) argue that responsibility voids do not arise in the discursive dilemma if voting untruthfully is an eligible option. Simply stated, on their conception of responsibility, an individual can be held (co-)responsible for the group’s decision to invite the candidate if there is some other eligible action available to that individual that would have been better for avoiding that decision (Braham and van Hees 2011, 2012, condition AOC). In the particular case of the discursive dilemma, for each committee member, the best way to avoid the decision to invite the candidate is by voting “no” on each of the criteria. Hence, since no committee member does this, if voting untruthfully is eligible, then all committee members can be held responsible for the decision to invite the candidate. Braham and van Hees conclude that “the relevance of these voids pales in the face of the fact that voting in many cases takes place in what is essentially a strategic environment. In such a context, it is eligible to express an opinion other than what one holds” (Braham and van Hees 2011, p. 14). These considerations by Braham and Van Hees trigger three questions about responsibility voids that call for a general and systematic analysis. First, what exactly makes it the case that the discursive dilemma is immune to responsibility voids, under this assumption? Second, are there perhaps other decision procedures that are vulnerable to responsibility voids, even if untruthful voting is allowed? Third, under which conditions is a collective decision procedure vulnerable to responsibility voids? To answer these questions, we propose and specify a conception of individual responsibility that applies to a wide class of scenarios in which a group of agents is to form its decision on the basis of what we call a criteria-based decision procedure. That is, we consider cases where the decision is functionally determined by the group opinion on the criteria, in the sense that as soon as one fixes that group opinion, the group’s decision is also fixed.Footnote 7 In turn, the group opinion on each criterion is fully determined by the individual opinions on that criterion. The discursive dilemma is an example where the criteria-based decision procedure can be described as follows: the group opinion on each criterion is obtained by applying the simple majority rule, and the candidate is invited if and only if according to the group opinion, she satisfies all criteria. Within this setting, we establish three key observations. First, our analysis vindicates the logical possibility of responsibility voids (even if untruthful voting is eligible). Second, it supports the conclusion that the discursive dilemma is immune to such voids (at least, under the assumption that untruthful voting is eligible): there cannot be a responsibility void, irrespective of the votes of the committee members. Third, and more generally, we show that if the underlying decision function of a criteria-based decision procedure is atomistic or, equivalently, monotonic, then that procedure is immune to responsibility voids (Theorem 5).Footnote 8 Each of these observations follows from our central results that concern the characterization of immunity to responsibility voids. That is, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the immunity to responsibility voids, for the class of all criteria-based decision procedures. We characterize such immunity in two conceptually distinct ways.Footnote 9 First, we characterize it in terms of whether and how each criterion contributes to the decision in question (Theorem 3). Second, we characterize immunity in terms of the shape of the set of opinions that do not support the decision, when this set is conceived as a subspace of the entire opinion space (Theorem 4). Both characterizations are insightful in their own way. Moreover, both can be used to establish, in a relatively straightforward way, that atomistic (or monotonic) decision functions guarantee immunity to responsibility voids. Our analysis can be used as a springboard for investigating a number of further topics from the general logic of responsibility voids. To illustrate this point, we will briefly cover two such topics.Footnote 10 First, one may wonder whether the fact that a given collective decision procedure is vulnerable to responsibility voids with respect to a particular decision entails that that procedure is vulnerable to responsibility voids with respect to any possible decision. We show that this entailment does not hold. Second, one can view the problem of no hands as a problem concerning the distribution of responsibility. Responsibility voids concern the case where no individual can be held responsible for a decision, but one may also consider majoritarian responsibility voids: the case where no majority of the group can be held responsible for a given group decision. What is the logical relation between majoritarian responsibility voids and responsibility voids simpliciter? We show that, for criteria-based decision procedures in which the group opinion is obtained by simple majority over the criteria, immunity to majoritarian responsibility voids is equivalent to immunity to responsibility voids simpliciter (Theorem 6). The paper is organised as follows. We start by introducing the class of criteria-based decision procedures (Sect. 2) and specify our conception of responsibility voids in the context of such procedures (Sect. 3). We then show that the discursive dilemma is immune to responsibility voids yet there are other criteria-based decision procedures that are vulnerable to such voids (Sect. 4). In Sect. 5, we provide a characterisation of responsibility and avoidance in virtue of whether and how the criteria may contribute to a given decision. Our central results regarding the characterisation of responsibility voids are presented in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7 we show that if the underlying decision function is atomistic or, equivalently, monotonic, then that procedure is immune to responsibility voids. We discuss two further topics in the general logic of responsibility voids in Sect. 8. In the concluding section, we discuss prospects for future work. All results are proved in the appendix.",

See for instance Boland  (1989) and Karotkin and Paroush (2003), and the references therein, for precise statements, proofs, and extensions of this principle. The doctrinal paradox (a name introduced by Kornhauser (1992)  arises in some situations when a committee or jury has to answer a compound question divided in two subquestions or premises, P and Q. The point of interest is in deciding between the acceptance of both premises \(P\wedge Q\) (P and Q) and the acceptance of the opposite \(\lnot (P\wedge Q)=\lnot P \vee \lnot Q\) (not P or not Q). In view of the Condorcet Jury Theorem, some kind of majority rule seems appropriate for this two-premises problem. However, in some cases, the same set of individual decisions leads to different collective decisions depending on the manner in which the individual opinions are aggregated. Classically, two standard decision procedures are considered in the literature: the conclusion-based and the premise-based procedures (Conc and Prem, respectively, for short). In Conc, each committee member or judge decides on both questions and votes \(P\wedge Q\) or \(\lnot (P\wedge Q)\). Then, simple majority wins. In the Prem procedure, each committee member decides P or \(\lnot P\) first, and then a joint decision about this premise is taken by simple majority. Similarly, each member chooses between Q or \(\lnot Q\), and a joint decision is taken again by simple majority. If P and Q are separately chosen by a (perhaps differently formed) majority, then \(P\wedge Q\) is proclaimed. Otherwise, \(\lnot (P\wedge Q)\) is the conclusion. Procedure Conc is sometimes referred in the literature as the case-by-case rule (Kornhauser 1992; Kornhauser and Sager 1993). In fact, it is a reduction to the one-premise Condorcet case. Procedure Prem is then referred as the issue-by-issue rule. Both procedures look reasonable, but they may give rise to different results, hence the “paradox”. The simplest example is the case of a 3-member committee, when there is one vote for \(P\wedge Q\), one for \(P\wedge \lnot Q\) and one for \(\lnot P\wedge Q\). The Prem rule leads to decide in favour of \(P\wedge Q\), whereas the Conc rule leads to the contrary. In general, if we have a committee with n members, we can summarise their votes as in Table 1, where x, y, z and t are the number of votes received by each of the options \(P\wedge Q\), \(P\wedge \lnot Q\), \(\lnot P\wedge Q\), and \(\lnot P\wedge \lnot Q\) respectively. We will assume throughout the paper that n is an odd number: \(n=2m+1\), \(m\ge 1\). The doctrinal paradox appears when the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: In the sequel Table 1 will be called a voting table, but we will write it simply as a matrix and also as a vector (x, y, z, t), to save space. We now introduce a new decision rule which is also reasonable and, as we will see later, lies in some sense in between of the classical Prem and Conc rules. We call it path-based (Path, for short), and it can be defined as follows: \(P\wedge Q\) is proclaimed if the number of voters that individually conclude \(P\wedge Q\) is greater than those who conclude \(\lnot P\), and greater than those who conclude \(\lnot Q\), separately. That is, in the notation of Table 1, if \(x>z+t\) and \(x>y+t\). Comparing with Prem, only the number of supporters of \(P\wedge Q\) can be used to beat \(\lnot P\), without using the votes for \(P\wedge \lnot Q\), and similarly to beat \(\lnot Q\) without using the votes for \(\lnot P\wedge Q\); it is therefore a stronger requirement to conclude \(P\wedge Q\). Comparing with Conc, in order to conclude \(P\wedge Q\), in Path the votes for \(P\wedge Q\) do not need to beat the sum of all other options, but only those who deny P and those who deny Q, separately, which is a weaker statement. We can justify morally this new rule by saying that supporters of the conclusion \(P\wedge Q\) must form a majority against the detractors of P, no matter its position about Q, and symmetrically for the other premise. It is not our intention to stand for a different “reasonable” rule, but to make it visible that, apart from the two classic rules, some others can be considered. For these specific three rules, we will show that any one of them is the best, depending on the adopted criterion of optimality, drawn from a family of perfectly reasonable criteria. Our goal is to compare the performance of the three decision rules, for different committee sizes and different individual competence of its members. To this end, we define a theoretical framework consisting of a probabilistic model where the competence of a judge is defined as the probability that he/she takes the correct decision about each single premise. It is assumed that a “true state of nature” or “absolute truth” exists, which is one of the four possibilities that combine P, Q and their negations. Our performance criterion is based on the concepts of true and false positive and negative rates and the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) space. They have their origin in the field of electrical engineering and are commonly used in medicine, machine learning and other scientific disciplines (see e.g. Fawcett 2006; Hand and Till 2001). We believe that its application to the doctrinal paradox is completely new, and that it provides an acceptable framework to decide which one of a given set of rules is the best to get the right conclusion. As will be apparent later, our analysis can be applied to any given set of rules, beyond those considered here. We want to stress the fact that we treat conclusion and premises at a different level. We concentrate in assessing different rules in their ability to get the conclusion right; not the premises. This is reflected in the consideration of false positives and false negatives of the conclusion only. We also note, however, that the computation of these false positives and negatives depends directly on the ability of the committee to get the premises right. The problem of a committee assessing the truth or falsity of the three logical clauses P, Q and R, with the constraint \(R\Leftrightarrow P\wedge Q\) is only an instance of the broader situation in which a collective decision is to be built from individual decisions in a community. The theory of judgement aggregation aims at studying and shedding light into these kind of problems. We refer the reader to the surveys (List 2012) and (List and Puppe 2009) for an overview of the field and its recent developments. The doctrinal paradox is correspondingly a particular case of a general impossibility theorem inside that theory (see, e.g. List and Pettit 2002): Under reasonable assumptions, there exist individual logically consistent decisions on P, Q and R that lead to collective inconsistent decisions. Dietrich and List (2007) prove Arrow’s impossibility result on preference aggregation as a corollary of this impossibility in judgement aggregation. See also Camps et al. (2012) for a new approach to the problem of constrained judgement aggregation in a general setting. The concept of decision rule that we introduce in the next section is somewhat narrower than that of aggregation rule in judgement aggregation theory, but sufficient and adapted to our purposes. We do not go further explaining judgement aggregation theory concepts since we focus specifically in the doctrinal paradox with a simple model of behaviour of the committee members. For instance, we disregard strategic behaviour, considered in Dietrich and List (2007), de Clippel and Eliaz (2015), Ahn and Oliveros (2014) and Terzopoulou and Endriss (2019), or the epistemic or behavioural perspective, studied in Bovens and Rabinowicz (2004), Bovens and Rabinowicz (2006), and Bonnefon (2010). We consider that a true state of nature exists (not known, but certain) and that the committee members are seeking this absolute truth (the so called truth-tracking preference, see Bozbay (2019) and the references therein). Sometimes, as in the recent papers (Bozbay 2019; Terzopoulou and Endriss 2019), the state of nature is thought of as a random experiment, with an assumed prior probability distribution on the set of possible states, which in our case is the set \(\{P\wedge Q, \lnot P\wedge Q, P\wedge \lnot Q, \lnot P\wedge \lnot Q\}\). This Bayesian approach is justified in applications where there is indeed a previous experience, independent of the decision to be currently made. We do not assume any prior probability. As a consequence, the negative conclusion \(\lnot (P\wedge Q)\) is in fact composed by three different states of nature, and we use the concepts of classical statistics to state the notion of risk when concluding that \(P\wedge Q\) is false when in fact it is true. Some more notes on the Bayesian approach are pointed out in the discussion section. Judgement Aggregation Theory frequently takes as starting point the concept of agenda, a consistent set of propositions, closed under negation, on which judgements have to be made (List and Puppe 2009; Dietrich 2007; List and Pettit 2002). Moreover the propositions may be linked by logical restrictions. In our case, the agenda is \(\{P,\lnot P,Q,\lnot Q, P\wedge Q, \lnot (P\wedge Q)\}\). In this language, the doctrinal paradox can be stated by saying that the majority rule can be inconsistent, in the sense that if all pairs of formulae in the agenda are decided by a majority rule, then the accepted formulae could be logically inconsistent. The aggregation problem is described in full generality in Nehring and Pivato (2011), starting with the concept of judgement, defined as a mapping from the set of propositions to the doubleton \(\{\text {True}, \text {False}\}\), and that of feasible judgement, a mapping that respects the underlying logical constraints of the propositions. The judgement aggregation problem is then defined as to find a “best” feasible mapping from the voters individual judgements. If the mapping is built by propositionwise majority, a non-feasible mapping may arise. The range of possible voting paradoxes is the set of possible non-feasible mappings. In our case, the only such mapping, assuming the voters respect the underlying logic, is \(P\mapsto \text {True}\), \(Q\mapsto \text {True}\), \((P\wedge Q)\mapsto \text {False}\). The truth-functional judgement aggregation problem is the special case when there is one or more propositions called conclusions, that are functionally determined by the values of other propositions, called premises. This functional dependence is not necessarily of conjunctive type; more complicated relations between them can be in force. In this paper we address the simplest non-trivial problem, in which the conjunction of two premises are equivalent to the conclusion. We review some more literature in the discussion section when presenting possible extensions of the present work. The paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we define and characterise with precision the Prem, Conc and Path decision rules, and explain what we consider to be an admissible rule in the application context we are dealing with. We show that the three rules considered are admissible, and that there exist non-admissible (though not completely irrational) decision rules. The specific model assumptions are given in Sect. 3. Although the doctrinal paradox cannot be avoided, one can speak of the “best rule”, once some theoretical model is defined and some reasonable performance criterion is chosen. Of course, different criteria gives rise to different “best rules”, and this is again unavoidable. The concept of true and false positives and negatives and that of ROC space are introduced in Sect. 4. Translated to our setting, the false positive rate \(\text {FPR}\) will be the probability of accepting \(P\wedge Q\) when it is false, and the false negative rate \(\text {FNR}\) the probability of rejecting \(P\wedge Q\) when it is true. Section 5 contains the main results of the paper and their proofs: Rule Prem is the best in the ROC setting under a symmetric criterion which gives the same weight to FPR and FNR; in case of unequal weights, any one of the three rules can be the best, depending on the relation between the competence parameter and the specific weights. Section 6 contains some numerical computations and figures, showing that all values of interest resulting from the probabilistic model can be explicitly obtained. More than that, the simple hypotheses on the model that we impose in Sect. 3 can be relaxed to a great extent and the explicit computations can still be carried out without difficulty with adequate computing resources. This is explained in more detail in the final discussion in Sect. 7, together with other considerations and open problems. To make the exposition smooth, we postpone most of the technical statements and their proofs to an appendix.",2

A significant part of the lobbying literature (Austen-Smith 1987; Baron 1994) considers interest groups with electoral motives. These groups take the candidates’ positions as given and offer them campaign contributions. These contributions are typically spent by candidates on campaign activities that aim at persuading the constituency to vote for them and, thus, affecting their probability of winning. Another strand of the literature assumes that lobbying occurs after the election. Lobbying takes the form of either monetary contributions offered to the incumbent politician (Krueger 1974; Becker 1983; Lohmann 1995; Bennedsen and Feldmann 2006; Martimort and Semenov 2008) or informational lobbying with exogenous lobbying costs (Potters and van Winden 1992). That is, the relative literature typically considers political influence either before or after the election as separate cases.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, political influence is a continuous activity that does not end once the election is concluded. After the election, and regardless of the winner, the interest groups need to influence the implemented policies. Tripathi et al. (2002) use data from the 1995 Lobby Disclosure Act and find a strong connection between campaign expenditures and lobbying. More specifically, “groups that have both a lobbyist and a PAC [...] account for fully 70% of all interest group expenditures and 86% of all PAC contributions”. In this paper, we jointly consider pre- and post-election political influence and, endogenously, determine the optimal level of the “access” price the politicians charge the interest groups. We model the above situation as a three-stage game with two interest groups and two candidates. At stage zero (pricing stage), the two candidates announce the level of lobbying prices they plan to charge the two groups if they are elected. At the first stage (election stage), each group offers a monetary contribution to its favourite candidate that is used by her in order to grow her electoral support and, then, the election takes place. At the second stage (lobbying stage), the two groups compete exerting lobbying efforts towards the elected candidate to increase their probability of winning the final “prize”. This prize might be the assignment of a project, trade protection or the implementation of the group’s favourite policy. The lobbying prices announced at stage zero can be understood as access prices or the weights a politician is going to put on the lobbying efforts made by the two lobbies when deciding the winner of the final prize (i.e., the lower the price for a group, the greater the weight politicians put on this group’s effort). The first and second stage have the characteristics of a two-stage Tullock contest. The groups compete against each other twice, once before and once after the election takes place. At the lobbying stage (the second stage of the “contest”), the two groups engage in a contest for a given “prize” by exerting costly lobbying efforts.Footnote 2 A unit of lobbying effort by a group can be viewed as an hour spent in the incumbent’s office trying to persuade her about the group’s eligibility for a project assignment or informing her about a relevant policy issue.Footnote 3 At the election stage (the first stage of the “contest”), the two groups compete by offering campaign contributions to their favourite candidate so that they affect the electoral outcome.Footnote 4 This is, like Austen-Smith (1987) and Baron (1994), the groups have an electoral motive, meaning that each group takes as given the candidates’ positions and offers a contribution to its favourite candidate in order to increase her probability of winning the election. The “award” the two groups fight for at the election stage is an endogenously determined (lower) lobbying price at the lobbying stage and, hence, preferential treatment by the candidate in office. The lobbying prices asked by the winning candidate are chosen strategically by the two candidates at the pricing stage (the stage before the contest) and maximise the candidates’ expected utility from lobbying. By announcing the offered lobbying prices, the candidates simultaneously affect both their probability of being elected and their utilities from lobbying if they are elected. Starting from the benchmark case with symmetric candidates, our main result shows that a candidate announces a lower lobbying price for the group that is going to support her at the election. This is, our results support the idea that contributions may buy “access” for lobbying activities such as “preferential treatment” by the incumbent or amplification of the group’s message (Wright 1990). As put by Wright (1990), our results demonstrate that “representatives may ‘hear you better’ [...] when a contribution precedes lobbying”. Thus, we show endogenously that the group supporting the eventual winner of the election is treated favourably compared to the opposite group. In an extension of the benchmark model, we consider the case where the groups have a different valuation of the final prize depending on which politician has won the election. Specifically, we permit a group to value the final prize higher if the elected politician is the one it supported in the election than if she is the one supported by the other group. This way, we provide an exogenous link between a group and its favourite politician. This link can be, for instance, aligned policy preferences between a group and a politician. The analysis of this case shows that, for specific levels of difference in prize valuations, the results of the benchmark case are robust in this case, as well. Specifically, they indicate that if the difference between the groups’ prize valuations is sufficiently small, the politicians announce greater lobbying prices for their supporting groups. The opposite holds when the difference in prize valuations is relatively large. In this case, the politicians may announce a lobbying price for the opposing group lower than the price for the favourite group. Finally, we analyse the case where the winner politician does not commit to the announced prices with certainty. Again, we show that the two politicians announce a lower price for the group supporting them but, now, the results depend on how credible the announced access prices are. In particular, the lower the probability that a winner politician commits to the announced prices, the lower the contributions made by the two groups. The paper contributes to two strands of the literature: lobbying literature and contest theory literature. The concept of price-setter candidates is similar to Austen-Smith (1998) where an incumbent politician commits to the contribution level she requires from groups in order to consider them as potential information providers. After the contributions have been offered, the politician grants access to one of the groups that have contributed and gathers relevant information from it. The main difference between the above study and ours is that in the latter, we consider two politicians who set prices before the election takes place. Therefore, these prices also affect contributions by the groups and, consequently, the election outcome. Moreover, in our model, we allow for different prices for each group as well as for more than one group able to be granted access to the legislator. The paper is also relative to the study of Cotton and Déllis (2016) which analyses how much information a politician should collect from interest groups and of Cotton and Li (2018) which considers a model with a politician who acquires information before interest groups offer money to her in exchange for policy favours. Both models assume informational or monetary lobbying to an incumbent politician. Our model, instead, also incorporates an election game before the lobbying game so that there is uncertainty on who the eventual incumbent is and her election depends on the groups’ contributions. Last, Ellis and Groll (2019) study a model with a policymaker and one lobby focusing on how the politician and lobby’s resource constraints affect lobbying activities. In our study, the engagement of the groups in a two-stage contest, combined with the introduction of a stage before the contest, allows us to consider an environment where political influence begins before an election and continues after it.Footnote 5 There are, also, other studies that model lobbying as a contest. For instance, Epstein and Nitzan (2006) provide micro-foundations for the public-policy contest and illustrate the possible rationalisation of random government behaviour in both all-pay auctions and Tullock contests. Two relevant and more recent studies are Duggan and Gao (2020) and Sasso and Alexander (2020). In the former, lobbying is modelled as a “tug of war” where lobbies make effort to pull a policy outcome in their preferred locations. The latter study considers a two-stage game where at the first stage, politicians commit to a level of concession they are going to give to their favourite group if elected and at the second stage, groups offer campaign contributions and the election takes place. In contrast to the above-mentioned studies, ours involves political influence through both campaign contributions and post-election lobbying.Footnote 6 The endogenous choice of lobbying prices constitutes our main contribution also to the existing literature in contest theoryFootnote 7 and, more particularly, works on multi-stage contests (Gradstein and Konrad 1999; Moldovanu and Sela 2006; Konrad and Kovenock 2009; Fu et al. 2015). For instance, Clark et al. (2018) consider a two-stage contest in which the winner of the first stage faces by assumption a lower cost of effort at the second stage. Not only does our study provide support to this assumption, but also our results differ significantly due to the different assumed objective functions. In contrast to this study, Clark et al. (2018) are concerned about the maximisation of the total effort exerted at the two stages of the contest and they find that the optimal level of the second-stage cost offered by an effort-maximising contest designer should be zero. As a result, the two-stage contest reduces to a one-shot contest since the loser of the first stage does not make any effort at the second stage. The fact that we are concerned about the candidates’ expected utility, rather than the groups’ total effort, makes the two-stage contest meaningful and allows us to determine the optimal utility-maximising level of the second-stage effort cost. Clark et al. (2018), instead, assume that this cost is out of the designer’s control and study the optimal prize distribution between the two stages. In previous work, Clark and Nilssen (2013) also consider a two-stage contest in which they exogenously assume that the greater the effort exerted by a player at the first stage, the lower her effort cost at the second stage. In our model, instead, the levels of lobbying prices (effort cost) are set by the candidates endogenously before the contributions (first-stage effort) are made. Another study close to ours is Beviá and Corchón (2013). It considers a two-period contest in which the second-stage asymmetry between the players depends on the outcome of the first stage. Specifically, each player’s second-stage ability depends on the share of the prize earned in the first period. In our study, first, there is no award for the interest groups at the election stage and, second, only the group that supported the winner of the election benefits at the lobbying stage, regardless of the level of expenditures it made before the election. The rest of the paper goes as follows. In Sect. 2, we formalise the game. In Sect. 3, we analyse the benchmark symmetric game and present the results of the analysis. In Sect. 4, we present some extensions of the model and Sect. 5 concludes the study. All proofs are included in Appendix A.",1

The society attempts to make decisions not only by treating individuals as equally as possible, but also by treating alternatives as equally as possible. In other words, it respects equal treatment (or symmetry) criteria. The numbers of alternatives and individuals are assumed to be both fixed. The preferences of individuals are linear orders over the set of alternatives. We particularly focus on the procedures of outputting alternatives as social outcomes (i.e., social choice correspondences), not on the ones of outputting social rankings of alternatives (i.e., social preference correspondences). A social choice correspondence is a procedure that assigns a nonempty subset of the set of alternatives to every possible profile of individual preferences called a preference profile. One of the most well-known social choice correspondences is the plurality rule, in which individuals vote for their most preferred alternatives. Then, the rule chooses alternatives having the maximal votes,Footnote 1 Although the analyses of social choice correspondences, including those about the plurality rule, have been extensively conducted thus far, they cannot be applied to the most essential situation in which only one alternative must be chosen since such procedures may output two or more alternatives (i.e., there is a possibility of a tie) for a preference profile. Situations requiring choosing a single alternative occur universally, and there is no doubt about the importance of dealing with such situations. To accommodate these, it is appropriate to adopt social choice functionsFootnote 2 which assign a single alternative to every possible preference profile. However, the serious conflict described below between two major equal treatment conditions (i.e., anonymity and neutrality) make the analysis of social choice functions difficult from the perspectiveFootnote 3 of equal treatment criteria. In this paper, we restrict our attention to social choice functions and address the critical problem of the impossibility of achieving full equal treatment resulting from the conflict, with the aiming of achieving some equal treatment. Anonymity and neutrality are the most standard equal treatment conditions. Anonymity, which is a condition for the equal treatment of individuals, requires that a social choice correspondence should be independent of individual names. On the other hand, neutrality, which is a condition for the equal treatment of alternatives, requires that it should be independent of the names of the alternatives. Most studies rely on these conditions as basic axioms for characterizationsFootnote 4 of various social choice correspondences, including the plurality rule. Although anonymity and neutrality play important roles for characterization of social choice correspondences, it is well-known that they are generally incompatibleFootnote 5 on social choice functions. In other words, they are compatible only under a specific condition on the numbers of alternatives and individuals. Concretely, Moulin (1983) showed that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a social choice function that satisfies both anonymity and neutrality is that the number of alternatives cannot be written as the sum of some divisors (other than 1) of the number of individuals. Therefore, given the impossibility result, if we attempt to pursue social choice functions from the perspective of equal treatment criteria, then we must generally give up either anonymity, neutrality, or both. In related research on these lines, Fishburn and Gehrlein (1977) and Nitzan and Paroush (1981) analyzed binary social choice functions satisfying neutrality without imposing anonymity in a binary decision problem, which is a special case of our setting. Campbell and Kelly (2013) and Jeong and Ju (2017) also treated the binary decision problem. Both studies analyzed binary social choice functions satisfying anonymity and some weakenings of neutrality. Recently, Bubboloni and Gori (2021) and Ozkes and Sanver (2021) treated the same setting as ours. Bubboloni and Gori (2021) employed two axioms: one is a weakening of anonymity and the other is a weakening of neutrality. They gave a condition for which those two axioms are compatible. Ozkes and Sanver (2021) analyzed social choice functions satisfying anonymity and a weakening of neutrality. They investigated the existence problem of social choice functions satisfying those conditions. In this paper, we adopt the third option described above to pursue social choice functions from the perspective of equal treatment criteria. That is, we impose neither anonymity nor neutrality. Instead, we introduce a new condition called equal treatment of congruent distributions (ETCD), which is linked to some equal treatment conditions both for individuals and for alternatives, as described below. To explain ETCD, suppose, as with the plurality rule, that individuals vote for their most preferred alternatives according to their preferences. We then focus on the associated distribution of votes under a preference profile. If two given preference profiles share the same shape of the distribution of votes except for the names of alternatives and individuals, then we say that these preference profiles have congruent distributions. ETCD requires that under two preference profiles having congruent distributions, the chosen two alternatives should share the same number of votes. As a basic property, ETCD implies nondictatorship whenever the number of individuals is three or more (Fact 1 in Sect. 3.1). ETCD can be regarded as linked to some equal treatment conditions from two perspectives. The first perspective is related to the situations in which anonymity and neutrality are compatible. Under such situations, it is shown that ETCD is equivalent to anonymity and neutrality whenever the number of alternatives is two (Proposition 1 in Sect. 3.2). Furthermore, it is shown that ETCD is a conditional generalization of anonymity and neutrality whenever the number of alternatives is more than two (Proposition 2 in Sect. 3.2). The second perspective is related to the situations in which anonymity and neutrality are incompatible. Even in such situations, ETCD is available, and it is shown that it implies two equal treatment conditions: anonymity in the number of votes (ANV) and neutrality in the number of votes (NNV) (Proposition 3 in Sect. 3.2). ANV, which is weaker than anonymity, requires that the number of votes for the chosen alternatives should be independent of the names of individuals. On the other hand, NNV, which is weaker than neutrality, requires that the number of votes for the chosen alternatives should be independent of the names of alternatives. ANV and NNV can be interpreted as weak equal treatment conditions for individuals and for alternatives, respectively. These requirements are mild, but natural and intuitive. It is easily checked that ETCD implies both ANV and NNV. Thus, even in the situations such that anonymity and neutrality are incompatible, ETCD can play the role of weak equal treatment conditions both for individuals and for alternatives. Using ETCD, we characterize a class of social choice functions called the class of tie-breaking plurality (TBP) rules, which are social choice functions derived from the plurality rule in a natural way. Specifically, a TBP rule always selects a single alternative among the alternatives having the maximal votes (i.e., it breaks a tie in some manner if there are two or more such alternatives). Formally, a TBP rule is identified with a selection of the plurality rule,Footnote 6 As the main results of the paper, we give two characterizations of the class of TBP rules by ETCD and two types of positive responsiveness conditions called monotonicity and weak monotonicity. Monotonicity requires that if an alternative chosen at a given preference profile becomes most preferred whereas the relative rank of other alternatives remains the same under a new preference of an individual, then the alternative should remain chosen at the new preference profile. On the other hand, weak monotonicityFootnote 7 requires that if an alternative chosen at a given preference profile becomes from second preferred to most preferred, whereas the relative rank of other alternatives remains the same under a new preference of an individual, then the alternative should remain chosen by the new preference profile. Although there are various types of definitions of monotonicity, our monotonicity conditions are mild requirements in the sense that they focus only on an improvement of the rank of an alternative to the top rank. Especially, weak monotonicity is a very weak condition. Our first result (Theorem 1 in Sect. 5) states that the class of TBP rules is characterized by ETCD and monotonicity. Our second result (Theorem 2 in Sect. 5) states that if the number of individuals is sufficiently large, then the class of TBP rules is characterized by ETCD and weak monotonicity. Our research is significant in two ways. The first regards the proposal of a new easy-to-use condition (i.e., ETCD), which implies some natural equal treatment conditions both for individuals and for alternatives. The definition of ETCD is simple, intuitive, and easy to understand. ETCD focuses on the distribution of votes, which is one of the easiest data to handle in a preference profile. It is available without any essential restriction on the numbers of alternatives and individuals. In existing research that tried to avoid conflicts between equal treatments of individuals vs. alternatives, some weakenings of anonymity and/or neutrality were employed. Although it is usually necessary to pay attention to the possibilities of further incompatibilities between such conditions, ETCD can be used without worrying about them. Furthermore, even if a society takes a great interest in treating individuals (resp. alternatives) more equally, it is also possible to make ETCD and anonymity (resp. neutrality) compatible. The second is the characterizations of a natural class of social choice functions (i.e., TBP rules). TBP rules are also simple, intuitive, and easy to understand. Our results support TBP rules from equal treatment criteria and positive responsiveness criteria. Apart from those, it is also argued that TBP rules are supported by efficiency criteria and that they are partially supported by incentive compatibility criteria. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives definitions and notations and reviews the plurality rule. Section 3 describes ETCD. Section 4 defines TBP rules. Section 5 states our characterization results for TBP rules. Section 6 discusses TBP rules and states some open questions. Appendix A shows the independence of axioms. Appendices B and C are devoted to the proofs of our results.",

Some individuals will tend to vote for the same party, or favor the same policies, as their parents or neighbors. This is a reason for strong partisanship and it makes voters less responsive to the efficiency of policies (Bartels 2002; Gerber and Huber 2009).Footnote 1 Another form of conformism is that some voters want to be on the winning side. This is a reason for the ‘bandwagon effect’: voters are more likely to vote for a candidate if they expect this candidate to win (Lee 2011; Panova 2015).Footnote 2 This is why many countries ban opinion surveys in the last days before an election. Herd behavior is a problem for democracies, as it can give rise to crowd manipulation.Footnote 3 Both partisanship and the desire to be on the winning side affect the reelection chances of an elected politician. As a consequence, conformism in its different guises can affect the decisions a politician takes during her mandate. Allowing elected politicians to run for a second mandate is an incentive mechanism: It should push them to serve voters’ needs in order to be reelected—in contrast to public servants and judges whose term is independent from their decisions (Maskin and Tirole 2004). One drawback is that politicians may pander to cater to some voters’ needs or tastes, by selecting policies that a large part of the electorate likes. A broader definition of ‘pandering’ includes any inefficient behavior taken by incumbents in order to get reelected, from inadequate policy choices to inefficient policy persistence (Majumdar and Mukand 2004; Panova 2015). Conformism can induce pandering because conformist voters may (inaccurately) believe some policy to be superior, leading politicians to enact this policy to improve their reelection odds (Ashworth et al. 2010a). We study a different context, whereby conformism consists in a desire to be on the wining side. This conformism is not directly associated to any policy preference. Yet, together with partisanship by some voters, it can indirectly determine whether an incumbent will take inefficient decisions. The impact of conformism on social welfare is not trivial, and can be positive. The link between conformism and policy efficiency that we study is indirect. It can exist even if voters’ beliefs are accurate and unaffected by conformism. It arises because of the signaling properties of policy choices. Some policies are a better match than others to fine circumstances that are unknown (at the time of the election) to voters. These circumstances correlate with the type of competencies, political program and values, that will best match future circumstances. The incumbent’s characteristics may be more or less fitted to these circumstances. For instance, a left-wing incumbent may obtain better results than her right-wing opponent in a crisis context where social measures are needed; The reverse may hold in a context of economic expansion where laisser-faire can favor firms innovation. As in Falk and Zimmermann (2017) or Tajika (2021), policy consistency can also signal higher ability: The incumbent may thus inefficiently persist (Ashworth et al. 2010b) in failing policies. Some moves on the international scene can be more likely to succeed, in a complex geopolitical context, if the incumbent has political support from a particular subset of foreign governments. The optimal moves depend on a complex match between the incumbent’s personal and political characteristics, and the current diplomatic context, which is not well known to voters. Which diplomatic move is optimal can correlate with the chances of reaching beneficial agreements in a future mandate. In that case, a weak negotiator may inefficiently engage in strong moves in order to hide her worse perspectives to domestic voters. “Pandering” in our model consists in choosing a policy that is not appropriate to the context, in order to hide information on the state of the world. Voters conformism is totally independent from the policies’ intrinsic quality; Yet the desire from voters to be on the winning side, associated with unbalanced partisanship, modifies the electoral benefits of choosing inefficient policies. Despite the widespread concerns that conformity allows for manipulation, the desire to vote for the winner can have a beneficial impact on social welfare. This is because it can foster the choice of efficient policies, despite their signaling features. This beneficial impact arises only if there exists an incumbency advantage. Such an advantage exists when the incumbent benefits from more votes, ceteris paribus, than her opponent would have had with the same platform. Incumbency advantage is well documentedFootnote 4 and appears to be a critical determinant of success in reelections.Footnote 5 Conformism amplifies the incumbency advantage, thereby lessening the impact of signaling. It determines which equilibria can arise. Our framework The incumbentFootnote 6 cares not only about choosing the right policies but also about the ‘rents’ derived from being in power. She has private and full information on the decision that maximizes welfare. The appropriate decision is correlated with her ability to generate welfare in the future. For this reason, she may want to distort her choice before running for a second mandate (we provide an illustration based on the 2020 US Presidential elections below). There are three types of voters: the incumbent’s partisans, the opponent’s partisans, and the independent voters, who are conformists (Bartels 2000). Although using a single representative independent voter is a standard assumption in the theoretical literature (Canes-Wrone et al. 2001), partisans form a large share of voters (Swank 1995; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1996, 1997; Bartels 2000, 2002; Brader and Tucker 2009; Klar 2014; Helland and Sørensen 2015). While partisans are passive players by definition, separating voters into these categories allows us to model the advantage that arises from the existence of a larger proportion of partisans for the incumbent. We refer to this advantage as the ‘incumbency advantage’ and it turns out to be essential in explaining the impact of conformism in our setup. When the incumbent benefits from an incumbency advantage, voting for the opponent comes with a higher risk of not being on the winning side. This is costly to conformist voters. This effect plays in favor of the incumbent as if the opponent’s capabilities were lower than they really are. This ‘conformism advantage’ is at the core of the results we obtain. We show that conformism affects social welfare through several channels, even though this conformism is fully independent from policies. Conformism advantage reduces reelection pressure, and lessens the cost of choosing a policy that reveals ‘bad news’ about oneself. We study the conditions under which two polar pure strategy Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBE) exist: In the socially efficient equilibrium (shortened to S), the incumbent selects the policy that best promotes the social interest; In the pooling, pandering equilibrium (shortened to P), the incumbent selects a policy that will be interpreted by voters as ‘good news’ on her capabilities, irrespective of her private information on its appropriateness. Voters’ desire to be on the winning side turns out to make pandering less likely. Its total impact on social welfare depends on the exact configuration considered: More conformism improves the efficiency of policy choices (which also improves voters’ information at the time of the election). But it has the drawback of leading to re-electing the incumbent too often. The fact that the incumbent cares for social welfare even when not in power (she is ‘altruistic’), is not necessarily welfare-improving. She then internalizes her impact on candidate selection (that is: the impact of her choices on the probability of being re-elected when the opponent would be better able to raise welfare). More conformism increases the risk of inadequate candidate selection but improves the incentives to select efficient policies. The two effects can run contrary to one another, making the conditions for a separating equilibrium more difficult to meet. An illustration—The 2020 US elections The campaign of incumbent Donald Trump for the 2020 US presidential election might be interpreted in the light of the mechanism we model. Trump systematically minimized the importance of the COVID-19 epidemic, despite evidence from scientists and hospitals. He asserted the primacy of individual freedom over distancing measures—which can be seen as traditional pandering to an electorate that values freedom of movement. But he also persisted in other decisions that denied the severity of the crisis (e.g., maintaining campaign meetings despite contagion risks and a fast rise in number of cases, not wearing a mask in public until July 2020...) Such decisions were ways of denying his own incorrect initial assessment of the crisis. This mistake could indeed cast doubts on his abilities. This could be an example of inefficient persistence for signaling reasons (a special case of our model). In addition, the severity of the crisis also correlated to the type of qualities and of policies that were going to be most appropriate in the near future. A more severe crisis required a leader willing to follow medical experts and to intervene more in the individual and economic arenas. Both requirements favored Trump’s opponent, Bidden.Footnote 7 Beliefs about the severity of the Covid epidemic, and its time horizon, diverge according to political orientation (Pew Research Center 2020). And the divergence became more polarized during the campaign, as it was emphasized by candidates (despite converging medical information).Footnote 8 Trump continuously insisted on his high chances of winning thanks to his strong partisan support.Footnote 9 This communication emphasizing his incumbency advantage could have had as an objective to trigger a conformist reaction from undecided voters. Although this strategy was not sufficient to obtain re-election, it fits well the situation and strategies we model. Conformism. Conformism is when an individual in a group displays a certain behavior because it is what the individual has witnessed most frequently in others (Claidière and Whiten 2012), as shown in the pioneering experiments in Asch (1951). The desire to conform makes people want to belong to the majority. Conformity motivations can be informational, i.e., arise from desire to form an accurate interpretation of reality and behave correctly. Or they can be normative, i.e., based on the goal of obtaining social approval from others (Deutsch and Gerard 1955; Cialdini and Goldstein 2004).Footnote 10 Inefficient signaling via policies. Panova (2015) studies how policy persistence and the bandwagon effect can arise from signaling effects. In her model some voters are informed and others are not. Due to their awareness of their limited memory, voters interpret signals about policies as complementing their limited recall, which lends these policies more weight. While in Panova (2015), the conformism arises from limited information and causes policy persistence, in our (very different) setup the reverse effect can arise: When voters’ desire to win is strong, voting for the incumbent becomes more attractive, and this can eliminate inefficient persistence of failing policies. Our modeling of policies incorporates as a special case a setting similar to Dur (2001), in which repealing an implemented policy is a bad signal to uninformed voters about an incumbent’s policy competence. The incumbent may choose to always to continue her policy, even if it is a failure. Majumdar and Mukand (2004) study the related issue of policy experimentation by an incumbent. The latter may inefficiently select which policies to experiment, and may inefficiently persist; Policy persistence can arise to signal confidence in future adequacy despite publicly observable failure (because failure at the time of the election can be due to random circumstances). Contrary to our set-up, voters in Dur (2001) and Majumdar and Mukand (2004) have common interests and are treated as a single representative independent voter. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 defines the equilibria and the impact of conformism on an independent voter’s choice. Section 4 analyzes how conformism affects the equilibria. Section 5 studies the overall impact of conformism on social welfare and Sect. 6 provides results for the special case of a partly altruistic incumbent.",

This endogeneity is highlighted in models that consider conflict over a policy parameter such as the tax rate on capital (as in Alesina and Rodrik 1994), the inflation rate (as in Huffman 1997; Albanesi 2007; Dolmas et al 2000), or the policy on social security (such as Tabellini 2000). Conflict over the policies arises due to the presence of inequality, which in turn influences economic outcomes through a desire for redistribution. Another strand within this literature focuses on policies that are the key to the process of development, such as those enabling the adoption of modern technologies. In this literature, conflict arises as some agents have vested interests in existing technologies, and suffer economic losses when new technologies are adopted (as in Krusell and Rios-Rull 1996; Acemoglu and Robinson 2000), or losses in political power (as in Acemoglu and Robinson 2002). Common to the above-mentioned papers is the fact that political conflict arises over a single dimension of policy, such as tax rates, social security, or technology adoption. In this paper, however, we recognize the possibility of conflict arising due to the presence of several competing mechanisms of redistribution and growth on the menu of choice of agents in an economy. Each agent or group of agents is impacted differently, depending on the mechanism in question. For example, these expenditures can be purely redistributive, such as food stamps directly given to the poor, or have redistributive elements such as a public education system which can benefit poor as well as rich individuals. This can lead to conflict over the instrument of policy that is used for redistribution and development. The existence of such trade-offs is further substantiated by several studies in the empirical political economy literature; see, for example, Busemeyer et al (2018) and Bursztyn (2016) in the context of educational policy and Reeves et al (2014) in the context of health policy. Similar politico-economic influences impact not only on environmental policies, but also on the adoption and diffusion of technologies directed at alleviating environmental problems such as pollution and climate change (Dasgupta et al 2017). Furthermore, there are several institutional arrangements of collective decision making that may be used to resolve these types of conflicts, which could also lead to different outcomes for an economy (Fumagalli and Narciso 2012; Persson and Tabellini 2001; Besley and Case 2003). Parallel to this literature, which takes a positive approach, one may also view outcomes arising due to policies from the lens of normative social choice theory. As discussed in Sen (2017) this literature uses “social welfare functions” which are constructs that aggregate individual welfare using social norms such as egalitarianism, utilitarianism, economic freedom, or capabilities. Applications of this approach occur in the form of policy evaluation as well as implementation, either through the development of indicators that track the aggregate wellbeing of an economy, or through welfare-based cost-benefit analyses that inform the development of social policies (Kakwani et al 2016). The focus of this paper is on technology and how the above-mentioned influences on redistributive policy interact to affect technology adoption, inequality and growth. We suggest that other redistributive alternatives compete with reform aimed at facilitating technology adoption and the trade-offs between these choices can lead to different transitional paths to development and the diffusion of technologies. The mechanism of collective choice also impacts on such transitional dynamics, providing a potential explanation for the different rates of technology adoption in the world economy. To this end, we construct an overlapping-generations economy with inequality in wealth, in which intra-generational redistribution can be achieved through two instruments of policy. One instrument is a direct mechanism of redistribution, achieving it through a lump-sum transfer, which is funded via a linear tax on the wealth/resources of agents. The second instrument is aimed at cost-reducing institutional development that facilitates technology adoption in the presence of risk and uncertainty. This expenditure must also be financed through the taxation system. Conflict arises over the proportion of tax revenues that may be allocated to each of these instruments. The choice of this proportion is then examined under three different mechanisms of collective decision making. In the first scenario, this proportion is determined through a majority voting process. This scenario is then compared with two other approaches, which, in addition to presenting alternative ways of collective decision making, can serve as normative benchmarks for evaluating the positive political economy implications of the voting model. In the second setting we have a “planned economy” whereby the government in any period chooses this proportion to maximize a ‘Benthamite’ social welfare function, which is the sum of expected lifetime utilities of all agents born in that period. The third setting involves another planned economy in which a government chooses the proportion devoted to institutional development by maximizing a ‘Rawlsian’ ‘maximin’ social welfare function; this entails maximizing the utility of the worst-off agent in the generation born in that period.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 In part, the motivation for considering the above-mentioned paradigms of social choice stems from two strands of empirical literature, one which examines the link between democracy and development, and another which examines the link between redistribution and development. In both strands of literature, the evidence on the link in question is inconclusive.Footnote 3 This is understandable given the wide spectrum of institutional settings and social norms observed in world economies, which renders the measurement of concepts such as ‘democracy’ and ‘redistribution’ a challenging task. The paradigms we consider give us a frame of reference or lens to interpret the literature. For example, the voting model captures a perfectly functioning or idealized notion of a ‘democracy’ while the two planned economies are stylized, idealized versions of real world planned economies with different objectives. World economies may arguably be interpreted as falling “in-between” pairs of these stylized settings in terms of their process of collective decision making and the social norms that inform them. For example, one can have a democracy with an emphasis on social planning, and socialist economies with a decentralized, market based economic policies.Footnote 4 See, also, Agranov and Palfrey (2015), page 46, for a discussion of this point. The inconclusive nature of the redistribution-and-growth discussion also justifies considering political economy underpinnings stemming from conflict over competing mechanisms of redistribution. Furthermore, this is a more realistic context in which barriers to technology adoption can arise. For example, historically there are relatively few instances in which technological change has been blocked by economic agents (Acemoglu and Robinson 2000). However, as inferred from the voluminous redistribution-and-growth literature, and policy debates in various countries, trade-offs between different mechanisms of redistribution arise frequently in the context of economic reform. While there are typically many forms of redistributive expenditures that can be made with a government’s revenue, a simple starting point conceptualizing this idea is the case of two competing mechanisms. We therefore consider two types of mechanisms, one which is a direct transfer of resources from the rich to the poor, and another which is indirect, such as revenue spent on institutional development. The latter mechanism eventually achieves redistribution and growth via a reduction of costs incurred in adopting high-return technologies associated with risk. In a dynamic context, both these mechanisms impact on growth, which leads to further redistribution given a larger “size of cake” to be divided among economic agents in subsequent periods of development. To characterize the idea of technology adoption in our model, we consider two technologies, and both are characterized by risk. However, the second technology offers alleviation of risk at a fixed cost. We interpret this cost as the expense associated with entering a financial intermediary system whereby the pooling of risks allows for a form of insurance in the event an unfavourable shock. Alternatively, and more generally, this could be a “cost of doing business” in an environment with poorly developed institutions. The presence of uncertainty in our model adds another, previously unexplored yet relevant dimension in the political economy literature on technology adoption. There are, for example, several empirical studies that emphasize the presence of risk and uncertainty as a barrier to technological change. See, for example, Dercon and Christiaensen (2011). However, the theoretical literature has devoted limited attention to this issue, particularly in a political economy context. While there are a large number of models that focus on uncertainty and technology adoption in the context of a microeconomic framework (see the survey of Hoppe (2002)) the macroeconomic literature has typically focussed on other barriers to technology adoption, such as institutional or skill-specific fixed costs (Greenwood and Yorukoglu 1997; Parente and Prescott 1994) or politico-economic barriers that arise in the absence of uncertainty (Krusell and Rios-Rull 1996; Acemoglu and Robinson 2000; Desmet and Parente 2014). While the broader implication of institutional barriers is still applicable, our framework puts an additional layer to this interpretation, suggesting that poor institutional development adds to the risk associated with technological adoption. The results of our model, both analytical and numerical, show that uncertainty interacts with the political economy aspects in interesting ways. We have “uncertainty driven growth” like in Oikawa (2010), although the mechanism of our paper is different. Essentially, uncertainty interacts with the political economy mechanism by creating a desire for redistribution in the form of institutional development. Institutional development, in turn, facilitates the reduction of costs associated with risky technology adoption. In all settings considered we find uncertainty facilitates faster adoption as well as diffusion of technologies. We interpret ‘diffusion’ to have occurred at the point where institutional development has taken place to the extent that no further redistributive revenues are allocated to it, and the economy has converged to the sustained, balanced growth path. Preferences in our model are not single-peaked, so we are not able to invoke the median voter theorem in its classic form, as discussed in Black (1948) and Downs (1957). However, we analytically derive the optimal plans of the agents, in addition to establishing that, under certain reasonable conditions, the median voter will be pivotal. This enables us to fully characterize the political equilibrium and dynamics of the economy in the case of our baseline model— i.e., the model in which collective choice is through a majority vote. We further explore the features of our model using numerical analysis, which illustrates that while long run outcomes such as inequality and growth are identical in all settings, there are some striking differences in the transitional dynamics and the timing of convergence to the balanced growth path. Typically, the “best” outcomes occur in the democracy, in the sense that technology diffusion and transition to the balanced growth path is at least as fast as or faster than the planned economies, with average long run wealth levels being at least as high or higher than in planned economies. Transitional inequality in the democracy, however, is at least as high, or higher than in the case of the Benthamite economy. Interestingly, the ‘egalitarian’ Rawlsian framework produces the highest transitional inequality and the slowest adoption and diffusion of technology, leading to the slowest transition to the balanced growth path. The intuition for this seemingly paradoxical result is as follows. In the initial stages of transition, preferences of most agents are in favour of redistribution in the form of the direct lump-sum transfer, since a large proportion of the agents are poor and unable to access the better technology regardless of the redistribution that takes place. The Rawlsian economy typically favours the poorest agent, even when the distribution shifts over time and the majority prefer redistribution via the institutional development expenditure. This slows down the adoption and diffusion process, since wealth levels of richer agents are rising relatively slowly, the “size of the cake” to be redistributed is smaller. This means redistribution on the transition path in the Rawlsian economy is lower than that of the democracy, in which the median agent’s preference is pivotal. The Benthamite economy, on the other hand, either favours the median agent or the richer agents, given its preference for redistribution that maximizes the sum of utilities of agents. This can translate into either lower or equal average wealth levels relative to the democracy. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the framework and presents analytical results. Section 3 presents a numerical illustration of the theory discussed in the previous section and provides additional insights on issues beyond the scope of theoretical analysis. Section 4 concludes, and proofs of results from Sect. 2 are presented in the Appendix.",1

For instance, the agents’ set of admissible preferences contains only orders of a certain type. In the vast majority, these domain restrictions are considered the same for all agents. Indeed, there are many cases where this symmetric approach is appealing. There are also situations where agents can be modelled asymmetrically. This paper is one of the very few where the sets of admissible preferences per agent may differ. We presume that per agent over all his admissible preferences some parts are constant. These parts as well as the actual preferences on these parts may differ per agent. Actually, this part of the agents’ preference is known in advance and therefore referred to as the a priori information. We determine the a priori information that is needed to allow for non-dictatorial, unanimous and strategy-proof choice rules. For an agent i, let partial order \(P^{i}\) represent those pairs which are constant over all the admissible preferences of this agent i. This information on that agent may for instance stem from religious backgrounds, strong political engagement, cultural heritage, (internet) behavior in the past, or because the agent has indicated so beforehand. Agent i’s set of admissible preferences consists of all preferences extending this a priori information Pi to a weakly complete linear order. Note that this information may range from a weakly complete partial order to an empty set. In the former case, the preference of the agent is known in which case his set of admissible preferences is a singleton consisting of precisely this weakly complete partial order. In the latter case the set of admissible preferences equals the set of all linear orders. We analyze precisely which a priori information leads to domains of preference profiles allowing for unanimous, strategy-proof and non-dictatorial choice rules. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such a priori information are based on the union of all the partial orders \( P^{i}\), i.e. \(P^{*}=\bigcup \limits _{i\in N}P^{i}.\) Of particular interest is its set of undominated alternativesFootnote 1. Roughly speaking, in this framework a priori information leads to a domain of profiles allowing for unanimous, strategy-proof and non-(image-)dictatorial choice rules, if there are at most two such undominated alternatives on which, for at least two agents the preference is not fixed. As unanimity has no bite on dominated alternatives, in such cases voting between these two possibly undominated alternatives yields a strategy-proof, non-image-dictatorial, and unanimous choice rule. But whether the above condition describes all the situations allowing for such choice rules, is less straightforward. Theorem 1 states that the range of such choice functions consists of precisely two alternatives. As every undominated alternative is in the range of a unanimous choice rule, Theorem 1 implies that there are at most two undominated alternatives. To avoid image-dictatorship now, at least two agents should be able to order these two alternatives freely. To the best of the authors knowledge Storcken (1985) is the only study on similar domain restrictions. That paper determines those domains based on a priori information allowing for (Arrow-like) welfare functions, which are Pareto-optimal, non-dictatorial, positively associated, and pairwise anonymous. Roughly speaking such domains admit such welfare functions precisely when there is a partial order, say \(\overline{P},\) contained, in \( P^{*}\) such that at every profile the outcome of the welfare function is a linear extension of this partial order \(\overline{P}\). Here, at each profile this extension is determined as follows. For alternatives x and y , such that \((x,y)\notin \overline{P}\) and \((y,x)\notin \overline{P}\) the collective ordering is determined by voting based on thresholds. That is, x is preferred to y if the number of agents in favor of x against y exceeds a given threshold which is depending on the pair (x, y). These thresholds satisfy certain conditions to guarantee completeness, anti-symmetry and transitivity. In addition, \(\overline{P}\) has to satisfy certain conditions to guarantee non-dictatorship for certain (degenerated cases) as well as pairwise anonymity for cases where some agents can freely order three alternatives. Now consider cases where the following three are satisfied: (i) All these conditions related to \(\overline{P}\) as meant above, (ii) there are precisely two undominated alternatives with respect to \(\overline{P},\) and (iii) for at least two agents those preferences between these two alternatives are not fixed. For those cases there exist such welfare functions as well as there exist unanimous, strategy-proof, and non-image-dictatorial choice rules. Moreover, it is not hard to see that every such welfare function relates to such a choice rule in the following way. The best collectively ordered alternative at the welfare function is the chosen alternative at the choice rule. Besides this relation, the results are independent from each other. In case of welfare functions, the non-dictatorship may be achieved via the collective preference tails. For instance, in case there is one unique undominated alternative, say x, in all the \(P^{i}\), then the conditions of Storcken (1985) may still be satisfied. This means that in such a case the domain allows for such welfare functions. As, however, x is ordered best by every agent at every preference a unanimous choice rule in this case chooses x at every profile. Therefore, in that case the choice rule is a constant rule at which all agents are (image)-dictators. On the other hand, pairwise anonymity imposes conditions on the tails of \( P^{*},\) which are immaterial for the results deduced here. Example 3 is based on this. It discusses a domain based on a priori information that allows for unanimous, strategy-proof, and non-image-dictatorial choice rules. It does not allow for Pareto-optimal, non-dictatorial, positively associated, and pairwise anonymous welfare functions. This example shows that the results discussed here are not a logical consequence of those of Storcken (1985). Further, as discussed in more detail in the discussion of Sect. 6, Theorem 1 entails a novel impossibility theorem on restricted domains. There have been many studies on domain restrictions (See e.g. Gaertner (2002)). Some studies look at the situations where restricting the domain leads to impossibility results. These studies intend to strengthen the impossibility result (without being far from complete), see for instance Sanver (2009), Aswal et al. (2003) or Sato (2010). While, other studies discuss domain restrictions allowing for non-dictatorial, unanimous and strategy-proof choice rules. Well known is the restriction to single peaked preferences starting with Black (1948) and developed further by Moulin (1980), which leads to domains for anonymous and strategy-proof choice rules based on majority decisions. However, as previously mentioned, our approach differs from a vast majority of previous such studies because our domain restrictions are not uniform over all agents. The paper is organized as follows. Besides some basic concepts on preferences, Sect. 2 discusses partial orders, social choice functions and its properties. Section 3 is on the betweenness relation of linear orders. We show that every linear order that is between two admissible ones is also admissible. Sect. 4 is on that the range of unanimous, strategy-proof and non-image-dictatorial choice rules. We prove that in the present framework this range consists of precisely two alternatives. In Sect. 5, we discuss which a priori information leads to domains of preference profiles allowing for such choice rules.

Besides direct policies such as social expenditures, more indirect redistributive tools like regulating the provision of goods and services also result in a redistribution of welfare across society. How do governments choose the combination of redistributive policies? A study of the trade-off between direct and indirect redistribution carries two key challenges. First, the analysis should incorporate the notion that the well-being of the poor largely depends on regulated goods and services.Footnote 1 As a result, inequality and poverty play different roles in determining the composition of redistribution. On the one hand, inequality creates incentives to increase social expenditures when higher-income citizens bear the burden. On the other hand, a high poverty rate offers a political reward for subsidizing regulated services that are essential in the consumption bundle of the poor.Footnote 2,Footnote 3 In this paper, we propose a theoretical characterisation of the preferences of the poor that captures these ideas and provides a neat mechanism whereby poverty affects both regulation and social expenditures. The second challenge is to provide robust empirical evidence on the effect of inequality on redistribution that accounts for changes in poverty. The difficulty arises because, even when conceptually different, poverty and inequality are highly correlated in practice. We then propose an estimation strategy that tests the claim that poverty is an omitted variable that empirical specifications should include. We support this claim using a panel dataset that exploits changes in inequality and poverty during the Great Recession. The literature on redistribution in democracies rests to a great extent on the political incentives that income inequality creates. On one side, seminal works state that in a progressive or proportional tax system, the wider is the income distribution, the higher are the electoral incentives to increase public expenditures and taxation (Meltzer and Richard 1981; Persson and Tabellini 1994; Alesina and Rodrik 1994). On the other side, there is also a literature claiming that heterogeneous beliefs towards inequality (Benabou and Tirole 2006; Alesina and Angeletos 2005), and other-regarding preferences (Galasso 2003; Dhami and Al-Nowaihi 2010a, b; Alesina et al. 2012; Epper et al. 2020) break, or even reverse, the positive relationship between income inequality and direct redistribution. We contribute to the literature by recognizing that governments have access not only to direct but also to indirect redistributive policies. Thus poverty affects the relationship between inequality and direct redistribution. For example, an increase in poverty may counteract the positive effect of inequality on social expenditures, shifting the redistribution towards indirect policies. In this way, our paper contributes with a new explanation for the frequent mismatch between the empirical evidenceFootnote 4 and the implications of the pioneering literature on inequality and redistribution in democracies. Recent work builds on heterogeneous societies to propose alternative explanations for this discrepancy. For instance, the way differences in experienced income inequality affect the preferences for redistribution (Roth and Wohlfart 2018), the effect of immigration on natives’ attitude towards redistribution (Alesina et al. 2019), how campaign contributions create political incentives in favour of the rich (Campante 2011), and other insights within the framework of behavioural economics (Luebker 2014). Our theory disentangles the effects of poverty and inequality on the trade-off between direct and indirect redistribution within a simple model of representative democracy (Besley and Coate 1997a; Osborne and Slivinski 1996) with two types of policies. The indirect policy is the price of a regulated good; for example, the tariff of a public utility. The direct policy is a universal income transfer. The consolidated costs of the government redistribution are subject to the budget constraint imposed by the revenues collected from a linear income tax.Footnote 5 In this article, we highlight the attribute of poverty that best explains redistribution. For the poor, regulated goods and services are essential. We capture this idea, assuming quasilinear preferences such that, when income is low enough, the consumption of the regulated good increases with income. Thus, our model defines the poor and the poverty line through consumption behaviour, and this characterisation drives our theoretical results. One of these results is that the trade-off between direct and indirect redistribution depends on the income threshold that divides the rich and the poor, and the swing voters within each of these groups. The relevance of both the poverty line and the multiple decisive voters becomes clear when considering a population comprising only non-poor citizens. If so, the median income is the only swing voter, and therefore income inequality drives the composition of the redistribution. Regulation and income transfers work as substitutes that satisfy the same end, i.e. they respond to the incentives that inequality creates.Footnote 6 Instead, our model allows for the policy to affect the rich and the poor in different ways. As a result, it changes the characteristics of the distribution of citizens that are critical as follows. When the proportion of poor citizens is large, the model provides conditions for smaller income transfers and more redistribution through regulation. This outcome suggests it is politically efficient for governments in poor societies to offer less generous direct benefits with universal access along with high indirect benefits like low tariffs of public utilities. Further, the relationship between redistribution and inequality depends crucially on poverty, possibly to the extent where the effect of inequality on policies goes in opposite directions depending on the size of the poverty rate. As an example of our results, Proposition 2 supports that an increase in inequality leads to smaller income transfers when poverty is high, and larger income transfers when poverty is low. Does the evidence support these results? We test the effects of inequality and poverty on redistribution using data on taxes and expenditures from Spanish municipalities from 2006 to 2015. Examining municipalities instead of countries helps reduce the unobserved heterogeneity that comes from institutional differences and other country-level unobserved characteristics. Still, we face a major identification challenge posed by reverse causality. Changes in the income distribution trigger changes in public policy components, and also changes in public policy affect the income distribution (Martínez-Vázquez et al. 2012; Smeeding 2006; Keane and Prasad 2002; Aaberge et al. 2019). We tackle endogeneity by exploiting the heterogeneous exposure of municipalities to the Great Recession. We show that municipalities with a larger share of individuals in their early careers were more exposed to the Great Recession. Besides, the recession has affected female and male workers differently (De la Rica and Rebollo-Sanz 2017; Bonhomme and Hospido 2013). Municipalities with higher shares of females in the population experienced lower income inequality growth.Footnote 7 When instrumenting with these demographics, we find that inequality increases the share of social expenditures in the budget of municipalities while poverty decreases it. We find a similar pattern when testing the regulation of transport, albeit with results that go in the opposite direction. Poverty increases indirect redistribution while inequality decreases it. As we proxy poverty as the population’s proportion with income below 60% of the median, the relevance of these results relies on how well the variation of this measure of poverty, and the instruments, captures the variation in the consumption-poverty rate we propose in our theoretical model. We cannot directly corroborate this, but we do show that omitting poverty biases the coefficients, even to the point of reversing the signs of the estimates. Our empirical exercise shows that, accounting for poverty, high inequality provides incentives to engage in direct redistribution through social expenditures. In this way, we contribute to the large body of empirical work that proposes different identification strategies for the relationship between income inequality and redistributive policies (for example, Ramcharan 2010; Lupu and Pontusson 2011; Boustan et al. 2013; Karadja et al. 2017). The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out the model, describes the preferences of poor citizens and builds the budget constraint of the government. Section 3 develops a benchmark without poor citizens. Section 4 explores a general environment where society comprises distinct groups of citizens based on their consumption behaviour. This section provides empirical evidence of the effects of poverty and inequality on the composition of government redistribution. It contains the major results of the paper. Section 5 concludes and opens further research questions. Appendix A describes the data and provides robustness checks. The Online Appendix contains all the theoretical proofs.",

Since its formalization as the cake-cutting problem (Steinhaus 1948), this research question has inspired a large interdisciplinary research for finding mechanisms that produce fair allocations without giving agents incentives to misrepresent their preferences over the cake. Unfortunately, besides some restricted preference domains, this research has so far produced mainly negative results, showing a strong tension between fairness and incentive properties (see section 2). Nevertheless, recent results in applied mechanism design have shown that, even if mechanisms can be manipulated in theory, they are not always manipulated in practice. Some manipulations are more likely to be observed than others, particularly those which are salient or require less computation. Based on this observation, Troyan and Morrill (2019) have proposed a weaker version of strategy-proofness for direct mechanisms, called not obvious manipulability (NOM). They define a manipulation as obvious if it yields a higher utility than truth-telling in either the best- or worst-case scenarios. A mechanism is NOM if it admits no obvious manipulation. Their notion of NOM is a compelling one, since it does not require prior beliefs about other agents’ types, and compares mechanisms only based on two scenarios which are particularly salient and which require less cognitive effort to compute. They show that NOM accurately predicts the level of manipulability that different mechanisms experience in practice in school choice and auctions. In this paper, we provide a natural extension of NOM to indirect mechanisms, and show that the stark conflict between fairness and truth-telling in cake-cutting disappears if we weaken strategy-proofness to NOM. In particular, NOM is compatible with the strong fairness property of proportionality, which guarantees each agent 1/n of the cake. Both properties are satisfied by an adaptation of the moving knife mechanism (Dubins and Spanier 1961), in which all agents cut the cake simultaneously and the agent with the smallest cut receives all the cake to the left of his cut and leaves. This procedure is also procedurally fair and easy to implement in practice. NOM is violated by most other classical proportional mechanisms, even by the original Dubins–Spanier procedure, which shows that theoretically equivalent mechanisms may have different incentive properties for agents whose capability to assess the outcomes of manipulations is bounded.",

A specific social choice correspondence—for instance, a particular political election system—may have been adopted since it has some properties that are regarded as attractive, but these properties may be lost if agents behave strategically—do not vote according to their true preferences. Thus, agents should be provided with incentives in order to reach a truthful alternative, that is, an alternative assigned by the social choice correspondence to the true preference profile. This leads to the classical question of implementation, which dates back to Hurwicz (1972) and Maskin (1999): given a social choice correspondence, is there a game form such that for every preference profile the equilibrium outcomes of the resulting game coincide with the outcomes of the social choice correspondence? Here, ‘equilibrium’ may refer to Nash equilibrium or to other equilibrium concepts, for instance strong equilibrium. Game forms in the literature used for implementing social choice correspondences can be quite complicated. Typically, they may ask agents to report complete preference profiles, and they often use integers or similar devices as part of strategies in order to endow single agents or coalitions—depending on the equilibrium concept—with sufficient possibilities to deviate, thus avoiding equilibria with outcomes that are not contained in the set assigned by the social choice correspondence. Although in the complete information context—also assumed in the present paper—agents are supposed to know all preferences, it is a demanding task for them to report complete preference profiles, and this is also not what one would ask from them in practical applications. A similar observation holds for other common ingredients of strategies, such as reporting an integer or an alternative. Indeed, the complexity of the message space or space of strategies is an issue that has gathered much attention in the literature (see already Mount and Reiter 1974). Saijo (1988) considers implementation where agents are ordered, and only report their own preference and the preference of the next agent, besides an alternative and an integer. Tatamitani (2001) further reduces this to reporting only one’s own preference, plus an outcome and an integer. Recently, Koray and Yildiz (2018) consider implementation via rights structures, based on an idea by Sertel (2001), which also avoids the use of integer devices. For a survey on the basics of implementation see Jackson (2001). In the present paper we restrict our attention to direct game forms which are single-valued selections (social choice functions) from the social choice correspondence under consideration. This means, simply, that the strategy space of each agent consists of the set of all preferences—agents do not report complete profiles, integers, or any similar or other information—and the social choice function selects (at every preference profile) from the social choice correspondence to be implemented. We consider full implementation in Nash equilibrium: the set of Nash equilibrium alternatives coincides with the set of alternatives assigned by the social choice correspondence. We do not require truthful implementation, that is, we do not require that reporting the true preferences is always a Nash equilibrium, as in Dasgupta et al. (1979). Our main motivation for studying this case is twofold. First, considering that a social choice correspondence in vigor in a group or society is usually regarded as appropriate or desirable by its members, choosing according to a selection from it seems to be natural, both for simplicity and in order to convince agents to accept the game form (the rules of the game). In other words, since the direct mechanism used for implementing the social choice correspondence is associated with a selection from it, the mechanism carries the same ‘spirit’ as that of the correspondence.Footnote 1 Several papers have discussed the advantages of direct game forms. For example, Hammond (1996) shows that such game forms, in which individual strategies are direct reports of their preferences, are implicit in Sen’s model of rights (Sen 1970). Second, but related, it seems to be an obvious and natural question to establish which social choice correspondences can be implemented this way, i.e., by a direct game form selecting from the correspondence. One could call this kind of implementation ‘natural’, but this word already has different meanings in this context (e.g., Saijo et al. 1996). Therefore, we use the term ‘self-implementation’. Also this expression, however, is not entirely new. Abdou and Keiding (1991, Sect. 6.1) informally suggest the term for partial implementation of a social choice correspondence by a selection from it. If this implementation is in strong equilibrium, then it coincides with exact and strong consistency as first studied in Peleg (1978). See also Remark 4.2.7 in Peleg (2002), where the term self-implementation is used with the same meaning as in Abdou and Keiding (1991). As mentioned, we will focus attention on self-implementation in Nash equilibrium.Footnote 2 Moreover, we consider only social choice correspondences which are unanimous and anonymous, and only anonymous selections (social choice functions). Under these restrictions our results are as follows. Let the ‘top correspondence’ TC assign to each preference profile all alternatives that occur at top for at least one agent, and let the ‘Pareto correspondence’ PC assign all Pareto optimal alternatives. Then every anonymous and unanimous Nash self-implementable social choice correspondence contains TC and is contained in PC.Footnote 3Footnote 4Footnote 5 If there are exactly two alternatives, then TC and PC of course coincide; and we show that TC is Nash self-implementable if and only if the number of agents is not equal to 2, 3, 4, or 6; moreover, we describe all implementing selections (Theorem 3.3). If there are exactly two agents, then no anonymous and unanimous social choice correspondence is Nash self-implementable. These results, both for two alternatives and for two agents, can also be derived from results of Hurwicz and Schmeidler (1978), but we provide self-contained proofs. If there are three agents and three alternatives then only TC is Nash self-implementable. If there are at least three agents and at least four alternatives, then any correspondence containing TC plus the intersection of PC with a fixed set of alternatives is Nash self-implementable; if this fixed set is empty then we obtain TC, and if this fixed set is the set of all alternatives then we obtain PC—it is an open question if there are still other social choice correspondences in between TC and PC that are Nash self-implementable. The remaining case is the case with three alternatives and at least four agents: then TC is Nash self-implementable but it is an open question whether TC is uniquely Nash self-implementable. To the best of our knowledge, this concept of Nash self-implementation has not been explicitly studied in the literature, although some of our results can be derived from existing results, for instance the two-agent or two-alternatives case mentioned above. Nevertheless, as mentioned the proofs below are self-contained. Also, the social choice correspondences prominent in this paper have occurred frequently in the literature, for instance the Pareto Correspondence only recently in Mukherjee et al. (2019). Throughout the paper we assume that the domain of preferences is the collection of all linear orders, i.e., strict preferences, but we show in Sect. 6 that our results can easily be extended to preference domains containing also weak preferences—the main difference is that in that case self-implementable correspondences may include weakly Pareto optimal alternatives. See Sect. 6.4 for details. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the main definitions and a few basic results. Section 3 deals with the two agents or two alternatives cases. The case with at least four alternatives is presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 treats the three alternatives case. Section 6 concludes with a summary and further discussion.",

They consider the multi-object allocation problem with monetary transfers where each agent obtains at most one object (unit-demand). A (consumption) bundle is a pair of object and payment. Each agent has a continuous preference relation over bundles satisfying the possibility of compensation and money monotonicity. Preferences are called classical if they satisfies object desirability. The classical domain is the class of all classical preferences The extended domain is the class of preferences which satisfies all properties but not object desirability. An (allocation) mechanism, or simply mechanism chooses, for each preference profile, the object each agent receives and how much each agent pays. We focus on the following four properties of mechanisms. A mechanism is desirable if it satisfies those properties. (i) Individual rationality requires that each agent’s bundle is at least as good as receiving nothing with no payment. Without this condition, agents does not participate the mechanism voluntarily. (ii) Non-wastefulness means that no agent prefers his own bundle to unassigned object with no payment. This condition is the property of weak efficiency. (iii) Equal treatment of equals requires that if there are two agents with same preferences, then their bundles are indifferent for their preferences. This is a weak condition of fairness. (iv) Strategy-proofness is the incentive compatible condition, which means that no agent has incentive to misreport his preference. In multi-object allocation problem, for each preference profile, Walrasian equilibrium exists (Alkan and Gale 1990), and Demange and Gale (1985) show that the set of Walrasian prices has a lattice structure; that is, there is the minimum price Walrasian equilibrium for each preference profile. The minimum price Walrasian mechanism is desirable (Demange and Gale 1985), and it satisfies efficiency and no subsidy (no-negative monetary transfer). A subdomain of the classical domain is rich if for each object, there is a preference in the subdomain which demands only the object for some price and demands no object for some other price.Footnote 1 Kazumura et al. (2020b) illustrate that various domains including the quasi-linear domain are rich, and show that in the case where the number of agents is greater than the number of objects, the minimum price Walrasian mechanism is the unique ex-post revenue maximizing mechanism among the desirable mechanisms satisfying no subsidy on a classical rich domain; moreover, the mechanism is also the unique ex-post revenue maximizing mechanism among the desirable mechanisms satisfying no bankruptcy on a domain including positive income effect preferences. We extend their results to a general case of an arbitrary number of agents and objects and on the subset of extended domain. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and basic concepts, and checks the properties of minimum price Walrasian mechanisms. Our results are in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides proofs. Section 5 concludes.",

Hammond,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Consider a society with a non-empty finite set N of individuals i.Footnote 1 Let X be a domain of at least three social states, and \(\mathscr {R}(X)\) the set of all logically possible (complete and transitive) social weak preference orderings R on X. For each \(R \in \mathscr {R}(X)\), let P and I denote the corresponding strict preference and indifference relations. Let \(\mathbb {R}^N\) denote the Euclidean space that consists of the Cartesian product of \(\# N\) copies of the real line \(\mathbb {R}\). A utility function profile \(\mathbf {u}^N\) is a mapping \(X \ni x \mapsto \mathbf {u}^N (x) \in \mathbb {R}^N\). Let \(\mathscr {U}^N\) denote the set of all utility function profiles on X. Following Sen (1970; 1977), a social welfare functional (or SWFL) f on a domain \(\mathscr {D} \subseteq \mathscr {U}^N\) is a mapping \(\mathscr {D} \ni \mathbf {u}^N \mapsto f( \mathbf {u}^N ) \in \mathscr {R}(X)\) that determines a (complete and transitive) social preference ordering \(R = f( \mathbf {u}^N )\) for each utility function profile in \(\mathscr {D}\). With some slight abuse of notation, we let \(R( \mathbf {u}^N )\), \(P( \mathbf {u}^N )\) and \(I( \mathbf {u}^N )\) denote respectively the weak preference, strict preference, and indifference relations associated with \(f( \mathbf {u}^N )\). Given any non-empty subset \(A \subset X\), say that:  two utility function profiles \(\mathbf {u}^N, { \tilde{\mathbf{u}}}^N \in \mathscr {U}^N\) are equal on A just in case one has \(\mathbf {u}^N (x) = \tilde{\mathbf {u}}^N (x)\) for all \(x \in A\); two social preference orderings R and \(\tilde{R}\) on X are equal on A just in case, for all \(y, z \in A\), one has \(y \ R \ z \Longleftrightarrow y \ \tilde{R} \ z\). The main part of this paper considers social welfare functionals f which satisfy at least the first two of the following three axioms:  : The domain \(\mathscr {D}\) of f is the whole of \(\mathscr {U}^N\). : Given any non-empty subset \(A \subset X\), if the two utility function profiles \(\mathbf {u}^N, { \tilde{\mathbf{u}}}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) are equal on A, then the two associated social orderings \(f( \mathbf {u}^N ), f( { \tilde{\mathbf{u}}}^N ) \in \mathscr {R}(X)\) are also equal on A. : In case \(y, z \in X\) and \(\mathbf {u}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) satisfy \(\mathbf {u}^N (y) = \mathbf {u}^N (z)\), the associated social indifference relation satisfies \(y \ I( \mathbf {u}^N ) \ z\). An important result in social choice theory with interpersonal comparisons is the “strong neutrality” or “welfarism” result due to D’Aspremont and Gevers (1977) and Sen (1977, p. 1553). This states that, when f satisfies all three conditions (U), (I), and (P\(^0\)), then there exists a (complete and transitive) social welfare ordering \(R^*\) on \(\mathbb {R}^N\) with the property that \(y \ R \ z \iff \mathbf {u}^N (y) \ R^* \ \mathbf {u}^N (z)\). This plays a prominent role among the results appearing in the surveys by Sen (1984), Blackorby et al. (1984), D’Aspremont (1985), Mongin and d’Aspremont (1998), and Bossert and Weymark (2004). Both Sen (1977) and d’Aspremont (D’Aspremont (1985), p. 34) provide complete proofs.Footnote 2 While the Pareto indifference axiom (P\(^0\)) is appealing, the impossibility theorem in Arrow (1963) is the most prominent of many results that replace it with the following alternative:  : In case the two social states \(y, z \in X\) and the utility function profile \(\mathbf {u}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) satisfy \(\mathbf {u}^N (y) \gg \mathbf {u}^N (z)\), the associated strict preference relation \(P( \mathbf {u}^N )\) on X satisfies \(y \ P( \mathbf {u}^N ) \ z\).Footnote 3  Specifically, under the assumption that individuals’ utility functions are ordinally non-comparable, Arrow’s impossibility theorem states that (U), (I) and (P) together imply a dictatorship. To develop a theory general enough to cover this important case, Roberts (1980, p. 427) specifies an additional condition that can be restated as follows:Footnote 4 : For all utility function profiles \(\mathbf {u}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) and all vectors \(\varvec{\epsilon }\in \mathbb {R}^N\) with \(\varvec{\epsilon }\gg \mathbf {0}\), there exists a utility function profile \(\mathbf {u}^N _{ \varvec{\epsilon }} \in \mathscr {D}\) satisfying \(\varvec{\epsilon }\gg \mathbf {u}^N (x) - \mathbf {u}^N _{ \varvec{\epsilon }} (x) \gg \mathbf {0}\) for all social states \(x \in X\) with the property that \(f( \mathbf {u}^N ) = f( \mathbf {u}^N _{ \varvec{\epsilon }} )\). Then Roberts (1980, p. 428) claims the following: Claim Suppose that the SWFL \(\mathscr {D} \ni \mathbf {u}^N \mapsto f( \mathbf {u}^N ) \in \mathscr {R}(X)\) satisfies (U), (I), (P), and (WC). Then there exists a continuous function \(\mathbb {R}^N \ni \mathbf{w} \mapsto W( \mathbf{w}) \in \mathbb {R}\), strictly increasing with an increase in all its arguments, with the property that for all utility function profiles \(\mathbf {u}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) and all social states \(y, z \in X\) one has This claim has come to be known as Roberts’ “weak neutrality” or “weak welfarism” theorem.Footnote 5 In many of the surveys mentioned above, it was cited as an alternative to the strong neutrality result of D’Aspremont and Gevers (1977) and Sen (1977, p. 1553). The unpublished results by Le Breton (1987) and by Bordes and Le Breton (1987) investigating Roberts’ theorem for restricted economic domains have since been amalgamated with related results that appear in Bordes et al. (2005). Condition (WC), however, is too weak for the claim to hold. To show this, Section 2 provides a counter example which even satisfies the following familiar condition:  : In case the two social states \(y, z \in X\) and the utility function profile \(\mathbf {u}^N \in \mathscr {D}\) satisfy \(\mathbf {u}^N (y) \geqq \mathbf {u}^N (z)\), the associated social preferences satisfy \(y \ R( \mathbf {u}^N ) \ z\), with \(y \ P( \mathbf {u}^N ) \ z\) unless \(\mathbf {u}^N (y) = \mathbf {u}^N (z)\). The same example shows the error in Roberts’ attempt to prove his intermediate Lemma 6. Then Section 3 uses a modified form of the alternative “shift invariance” condition due to Roberts (1983, p. 74) himself in order to prove the crucial Lemma 6 in Roberts (1980). This establishes that a slight alteration to Claim 1 makes it valid.",

In a social choice process, even if the best social choices are not available, there may be social choices that are acceptable as a possible outcome. Von Neumann and Morgenstern refer to sets of such acceptable social states as “standards of behavior”. The notion of stable set formalizes the idea of a standard of behavior of a social economy. While the authors describe this economy as a game of n participants with imputation-based payoffs, they also refer to a more general framework for their stable sets. This more general framework constitutes a theory of social phenomena based on the effective preferences between the various states of society (see Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1947, Sects. 4.4.3 and 4.6). The core is contained in each Von Neumann–Morgenstern stable set. The theory of stable sets has a significant flaw in that it can be empty in the case of odd cycles. For example, if X is a collection of three social states x, y, z and R is a preference structure on X so that xRyRzRx, then for this preference structure there are no stable sets. More generally, if \(X=\{x_{_1},...,x_{_n}\}\) is a collection of social states with n odd and R is a preference structure on X, then X has no stable sets if there is a unique cycle \(x_{_1}R x_{_2}Rx_{_3}R,...,x_{_n}Rx_{_1}\) (see Van Deemen 2013, Theorem 4.11). To avoid this particular problem, Van Deemen introduced the notion of the generalized stable set which for finite sets of alternatives is able to produce a solution for every possible cyclic dominance relation. In this note, we prove that a feasible set X endowed with a dominance relation R has a characterization of the generalized stable set with respect to R if a compact topology \(\tau\) on X exists such that R is upper tc-semicontinuous. This is done in a general framework for which dominance relation refers to an arbitrary binary relation defined on a set of alternatives that is not necessarily finite. Since any topology on a finite set X is compact and any dominance relation R is upper tc-semicontinuous (any subset of X is open), the results of this paper generalize corresponding results given by Van Deemen (1991).",
