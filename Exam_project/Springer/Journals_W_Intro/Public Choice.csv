Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While Bill did his undergraduate work at Harvard, graduating in 1954, it was at Chicago where he studied until 1957 before moving to RAND that his intellectual orientation took shape. Chicago at this time was strongly personified by Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger, recognizing that numerous other notable personages were also present. Yet among figures strongly associated with Chicago-style economics during the 1950s, Frank Knight had retired in 1955 and George Stigler did not arrive until 1958. Bill’s instantiation of Chicago-style economics throughout the corpus of his work can be traced directly to Friedman and Harberger. It was with Harberger that Bill wrote his doctoral dissertation on the demand for alcoholic beverages, having warmed up for the task by writing a Master’s thesis on the demand for cigarettes. Niskanen embraced two traits common to Friedman and Harberger: (1) a belief that the theory of competitive equilibrium provides a good analytical window through which to view the world and (2) good economic models should be simple and parsimonious and yet have rich empirical content. These qualities exemplified Chicago-style economics during Bill’s time there and stood in stark contrast to economics as practiced in most other places, where imperfect competition and market failure predominated. The simple and parsimonious character of economic models played out against a background of robustly competitive markets is evidenced crisply in Friedman (1962), which was compiled from class notes several students took during the 1950s. The belief that actual markets are best captured by the theory of competition and not by models of monopoly or imperfect competition is the central theme of Harberger (1954), which argued that the loss from monopoly was only one-tenth of one percent of GDP. While he wasn’t at Chicago during Bill’s time there, George Stigler (1949) likewise expressed that Chicago theme in debunking monopolistic competition and asserting the superiority of the competitive model. In the same vein, Warren Nutter (1951), another Chicago product, argued that enterprise monopoly was vanishingly small in the United States over the 1899–1939 period. Niskanen’s conceptual framework was centered on competitive markets as both useful for its simplicity and as descriptively accurate. Yet Bill wanted to bring government into this analytical framework, as, of course, did Harberger. The common vehicle for doing this at the time was welfare economics. To this day welfare economics is oriented around the so-called two theorems. The first theorem states that competitive allocations are Pareto efficient. The second theorem states that selections among competitive allocations can be made in non-distortive fashion through lump sum taxes and transfers. The two theorems together have provided a recipe for governmental intervention for most welfare theorists. By claiming that reality is always and invariably imperfectly competitive, market allocations are never Pareto efficient. Hence, there will always exist in principle some intervention that can secure Pareto efficiency even if life is not so simple in practice. Welfare economics was thus mostly viewed as a systematic framework for advocating progressivist principles of state direction of economic activity by articulating the ubiquitous presence of market failure. In several works, Harberger stood athwart this use of welfare economics, and with this alternative tack summarized in Harberger (1971). There is nothing of which I am aware in Niskanen’s body of work that is contrary to Harberger’s claim that welfare economics should be based on a postulate of competitive equilibrium. In the hands of market failure theorists, the second theorem provided the vehicle by which those theorists could claim societal improvement for their proposals. These efforts envisioned economic policy as being in the hands of an elite few who could be counted upon to do the right thing as established by their formulations of welfare economics. Niskanen took the nascent public choice theorizing and converted the second theorem from offering normative guidance to some benevolent despot into a positive statement of actual political processes. As typically presented by people who work with welfare economics, the selection among possible competitive equilibriums is the province of rational thought among economic philosophers regarding principles of justice and equity. Bill recognized the multiplicity of possible societal equilibriums but he most certainly did not regard reasoned and disinterested discussion among philosophical types as the situs where one equilibrium allocation replaces another. In this respect Bill was surely closer to Pareto (1935) in regarding such formulations as ideological cover for the realities of the use of power. No one has ever claimed to want to hold political power to do harm; even Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin claimed they were seeking to do good work in the world. Vincent Ostrom (1996) notes that the use of power is a Faustian bargain where people use instruments of evil in what they claim is the service of the good. The historical record shows numerous tradeoffs of good and evil, and Niskanen (2003) was one effort to illuminate this tradeoff across regimes. In contributing mightily to the public choice revolution, Niskanen recognized that the world runs more on intense desires than on pleasant thoughts. Pareto recognized that good ideology could get people to support programs they would oppose if they were to think the matter through. But most people had neither the time nor the inclination to do that. Among other things, there would be no direct return from any such effort. Dispersing the ideological fog spread by political candidates and associated interest groups is a task of great public significance, the performance of which requires some posture of independence and detachment.

Is fiscal policy affected by upcoming elections? If so, do election-motivated fiscal policies enhance the probability of re-election of the incumbent? As to the first issue: several recent studies suggest that political budget cycles occur, but there is disagreement about the circumstances making election-motivated budget deficits more likely. For instance, opinions differ as to whether political budget cycles are more likely in ‘young’ democracies compared to ‘established’ democracies (Persson and Tabellini 2002; Shi and Svensson 2006; Brender and Drazen 2005). It is quite surprising that the second issue has hardly been researched. Brender and Drazen (2008) do not find evidence that election-motivated budget deficits enhance the chances of re-election of the incumbent. In fact, they even report that these deficits reduce the probability that an incumbent is re-elected as voters punish politicians who create deficits.Footnote 1
 Our analysis is based on data for 65 democratic countries over the period 1975 to 2005. To estimate the impact of election-induced fiscal policy on the incumbent’s support we use a two-step approach. In the first step, we estimate whether elections affect the government’s budget balance and government spending. Most recent studies on election-motivated fiscal policy at the national level use panel models for a large sample of countries, pooling the data. However, in view of the heterogeneity of the countries included in those studies, it is questionable whether the data can be pooled (Pesaran et al. 1996). According to Pesaran et al. (1999), neglecting parameter heterogeneity in a pooled panel estimation procedure can produce inconsistent and misleading estimates of the long-run coefficients. Tests of heterogeneity indicate that our data cannot be pooled. We therefore use a semi-pooled model suggested by Hsiao et al. (1999). In this model, the political budget cycle (PBC) effect varies across countries, while the other control variables are restricted to be homogenous. Employing an election variable that takes the timing of the election in the course of the year into account as suggested by Franzese (2000), we find that fiscal policy in most—but not all—countries in our sample is hardly affected by upcoming elections. The countries for which we find a significant political budget cycle are very diverse. They include ‘young’ democracies but also ‘established’ democracies. In the second step of our analysis, we examine for countries with election-motivated fiscal policy, whether this PBC increases electoral support for the incumbent. In contrast to Brender and Drazen (2008), we take into account that many countries have coalition governments (Hanusch 2012). We therefore focus on votes received by political parties participating in the government. We conclude that government spending has a significant positive (but fairly small) effect on the electoral support for the parties in government. We also find an indirect positive effect of election-motivated fiscal policy through its impact on economic growth. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses in more detail how our contribution is related to previous studies of political budget cycles and economic voting. Section 3 shows our results for the influence of elections on fiscal policy, while Sect. 4 presents our estimates of the relationship between political budget cycles and election outcomes.

Do institutions affect income and productivity or only official income and official productivity?,January 2014,Axel Dreher,Pierre-Guillaume Méon,Friedrich Schneider,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The consensus that institutions are a key determinant of economic development has led international organizations to devote a great deal of attention and resources to improving the institutional frameworks of developing countries. Various conventions have accordingly been set up, such as the 1998 UN resolution or the OECD’s (1999) “Convention on combating bribery.” The political consensus is indeed backed by a parallel consensus based on results from a decade of empirical research. Spurred by the seminal papers of Mauro (1995) or Knack and Keefer (1995), this line of research has repeatedly concluded that ailing institutions are associated with lower GDP per capita growth. Later studies, such as Hall and Jones (1999) and Acemoglu et al. (2001), extended this finding to the level of per capita income. Furthermore, Hall and Jones (1999) and Olson et al. (2000) observed that the bulk of the relationship between institutions and income runs through the impact of institutions on total factor productivity. Although these consonant observations have drawn a consistent picture of the relationship between institutions and development, they all share a common drawback that may turn out to be crucial in the context of developing economies in particular: they use official output figures. The problem here is that most official output figures neglect a sizeable share of economic activity which takes place in the informal sector and, therefore, remains unrecorded in official statistics, namely the shadow economy. According to Schneider (2005a, 2005b, 2007), the shadow economy amounted to 39 % of economic activity in developing countries, on average, and up to 40 % in transition countries in 2002–2003. These figures consequently call for caution in interpreting empirical results emphasizing the negative impact of defective institutions on income. They emphasize that official income decreases when, for instance, corruption increases or the rule of law deteriorates, but do not guarantee that the same holds true for total income, defined as the sum of official and unofficial income. Previous research moreover suggests that the shadow economy flourishes in countries laden with defective institutions, thus acting as a substitute for the official economy. In Johnson et al.’s (1997) model, for instance, corruption increases the size of the shadow economy because it can be seen as a form of taxation and regulation, which drives entrepreneurs underground. Hindriks et al. (1999), on the other hand, argue that the shadow economy is a complement to corruption. In their view, taxpayers can collude with corrupt inspectors so that the latter underreport the tax liability of the taxpayer in exchange for a bribe. According to the empirical results in Dreher and Schneider (2010), better institutions reduce the size of the shadow economy. Similarly, Johnson et al. (1998a) observed that a one point increase in Transparency International’s corruption index would imply a 5.1 point decrease in the share of the shadow economy.Footnote 1
 To summarize, good institutions seem to increase official output, while at the same time reducing unofficial output. One may accordingly contend that the observed correlation between institutions and income may be less substantial than it first seems and result only from a drop in recorded output. In other words, production might not disappear, but only go underground, which is a special case of Hirschman’s (1970) exit option, as Schneider and Enste (2000) argue. Even if this substitution from official to shadow production was imperfect, the negative impact of bad institutions on overall income would be dampened. This intuition is consistent with Johnson et al. (1998b), who report that the relationship between corruption and growth becomes insignificant once the shadow economy is added as an explanatory variable. At any rate, a systematic investigation of the relationship between institutions and total income, as opposed to official income, is warranted. This is precisely the aim of this paper. To foreshadow our main results, we confirm the positive impact of institutional quality on official output and total factor productivity, and its negative impact on the size of the underground economy, reported in the previous literature. However, once output is corrected for the shadow economy, the relationship between institutions and output becomes weaker. The impact of institutions on total (“corrected”) factor productivity even becomes insignificant. Our line of reasoning is based on the following steps. In the next section, we recall the theoretical impact of institutional quality on the shadow economy, output, and productivity. In Sect. 3, we correct official output figures for the shadow economy and compare the distribution of per capita income using both raw and corrected figures. We then probe deeper into the impact of the shadow economy on output by performing a development accounting analysis, following Hall and Jones (1999) and Caselli (2005). Here, differences in income are broken down into differences in factor endowments and total factor productivity. Section 4 uses this decomposition to determine the channels through which institutions affect per capita income. We thus check whether institutions are still significantly correlated with per capita output and total factor productivity once correcting for the size of the shadow economy. The final section concludes.",25

Deacon,Darren Filson,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Those of us who knew Tom Borcherding well will never forget him—he was one of a kind and his personality was large enough to fill a ballroom. Tom was a world class raconteur and wit. His correspondence was extensive, penetrating, wide ranging in the knowledge it could marshal on any topic, and never boring. Tom’s style as a teacher was energetic, even bombastic, and always witty and erudite. He taught the topics that interested him intellectually and generally chose not to dwell on the details of technique and the fine points of models.Footnote 1 These traits made his courses memorable to students because the ideas presented, though often straightforward, were novel and had staying power. A good student did not need to struggle to understand them and the entertainment value was high. As a mentor, Tom was thoughtful, generous with his time, and encouraging. He could provide useful advice on everything—including teaching, research, writing, refereeing, editing, advising, dealing with administrators, and so on. Much of the best advice Tom provided for students and colleagues alike cannot be translated for polite company without losing the deep and lasting impression it makes on young scholars. Tom was a true scholar. He seemingly read everything and somehow managed to retain most of what he learned. He could keep ideas well organized and could call them up to make a point or to illuminate a way forward on a problem from an unfamiliar context. Pursuing ideas that stimulated his personal intellectual curiosity often meant applying economic reasoning outside the standard realms of markets and commodities. Tom was a pioneer in developing the field of public choice, the application of economic reasoning to understand collective decision making processes and the behavior of governments.",

If, for example, a terrorist group possesses the indicators of a group that will disintegrate internally, then the government is better advised to direct its limited counterterrorism resources to more resilient groups (Jones and Libicki 2008). Terrorist groups that are vulnerable from within can splinter from internal dissension among its members, competition with rival groups, reduced popular support, or limited resource supplies. The accumulation of nearly 40 years of terrorist event data, which often identify the perpetrating terrorist group, permits researchers to track empirically the campaigns of terrorist groups. Based on RAND (2012) terrorist event data for 1970–2006 and other information, Jones and Libicki (2008) distinguished active terrorist groups from those that concluded operations for one of the following reasons: defeat by military or police, splintering from within, joining the political process, or achieving one or more goals (i.e., victory). When observations on terrorist groups’ campaigns are combined with data on these groups’ characteristics (e.g., sizes, ideologies, and goals), tactics, and base-country features, we can ascertain the determinants behind various endings for terrorist groups. Most previous studies of terrorist groups’ demises have not investigated the determinants of specific types of endings (e.g., Blomberg et al. 2010; Gaibulloev and Sandler 2013; Phillips 2013); rather, these earlier studies examined the factors behind terrorist groups stopping operations for any reason. This presumes that the same factors are behind the various endings of terrorist groups, which is clearly not true since the determinants of military annihilation are likely different than those behind a group joining the political process. In a pioneering study, Blomberg et al. (2010) applied survival analysis to identify some factors that resulted in a three-year hiatus in attacks by terrorist groups. A follow-up study by Blomberg et al. (2011) identified factors behind terrorist groups’ failure, based on the conclusion of terrorist operations, not just a hiatus in attacks. This is a desirable extension because terrorist groups may engage in a cease-fire or else suspend operations for one or more years. Subsequently, Gaibulloev and Sandler (2013) relied on RAND event data to study factors behind terrorist groups’ failures for 60 % more terrorist groups than analyzed in the Blomberg et al. (2011) article. These three studies did not, however, identify the specific determinants of the various types of endings for terrorist groups. Cronin (2006), however, analyzed some interesting case studies for specific terrorist groups’ endings, but did not present a survival analysis. Carter (2012) is the first article to apply a competing-risk analysis to identify some determinants that resulted in either internal dissolution or external defeat for terrorist groups.Footnote 1 The focus of his survival analysis was the influence of state sponsorship. Carter (2012) uncovered some evidence that state sponsorship hastened groups’ failures when this sponsorship took the form of providing a safe haven. Our paper also investigates why terrorist groups end in alternative ways, but without a focus on state sponsorship. Unlike Carter (2012), we divide groups’ internal dissolution into two competing risks—splintering and joining the political process—since we view these risks as depending on vastly different considerations. Splintering indicates within group failure to pursue a common goal, while joining the political process suggests group unity in seeking goals by legitimate means. Additionally, we focus on base-country, rather than target-country, characteristics, because we believe that the survival of terrorist groups and the way in which they end is more geared to where the groups take refuge, draw their support, and deploy their defenses than where they dispatch their operatives to attack (Basuchoudhary and Shughart 2010). In contrast to previous competing risk studies, the current study assembles a richer set of independent variables that account for the terrorist groups’ competitive environment, their tactics (e.g., intensity and diversity of attacks), and environmental factors (e.g., the presence of multiple bases and geographical considerations). The primary purpose of our paper is the implementation of discrete-time duration models to estimate the underlying determinants of specific kinds of terrorist groups’ endings.Footnote 2 During each year, an active terrorist group is at risk of alternative endings, i.e., being defeated by force, splintering from within, or joining the political process. We combine terrorist groups that achieve victory with those that enter the political process, since both types of terrorist groups have joined the established political order. Using multinomial logit regressions, we estimate the hazard probability for a sample of 586 terrorist groups that may have concluded operations in one of these three ways. Terrorist groups that do not succumb to one of these three risks remain active throughout the 1970–2007 sample period. A secondary purpose of our study is to ascertain the determinants of the demises of terrorist groups that formed during two subperiods—1970–1989 and 1990–2007. This division of time allows us to ascertain whether overall risk factors for terrorist groups differ between the earlier period when leftist and nationalist/separatist terrorists dominated and the later period when religious fundamentalist terrorists dominated (Hoffman 2006; Rapoport 2004). Our analysis is rich in findings. Larger memberships make terrorist groups resilient to any of the alternative ways of ending, but have the greatest marginal impact on internal splintering. Relative to religious fundamentalists, terrorist groups formed around three other ideologies—nationalist/separatist (henceforth, nationalist), left wing, and right wing—are more likely to join the political process or achieve victory. This is especially true of nationalist terrorist groups, which supports the findings of Brathwaite (2013), who examined a much smaller number of terrorist groups. Terrorist groups with broadly defined goals, such as empire, regime change, or social revolution, are less inclined to join the political process.Footnote 3 This is also true of terrorist groups seeking territorial change. In addition, terrorist groups with multiple home bases are less apt to end by force or splintering. Large base-country population reduces the risk that terrorist groups will splinter or join the political process. Base-country elevation and jungles limit terrorist groups’ risk of a military defeat, presumably because the terrorist groups can better hide (also see Abadie 2006). In the second exercise, we find numerous differences between the causes of demise for terrorist groups that formed before and after 1990. Relative to religious fundamentalist terrorist groups, the three other kinds of terrorist groups are more likely to end when the groups started before 1990. Terrorist groups seeking empire, regime change, or social revolution are less apt to end if they formed before 1990. Moreover, terrorist groups that want territorial change are more resilient to failure. For terrorist groups that began before 1990, we find that more terrorist attacks per million persons make the group more prone to failure. More attack diversity displayed by the terrorist group is more conducive to survival before 1990, but not after the beginning of 1990. Terrorist group competition within the base country increases survival prospects for terrorist groups forming after, but not before, 1990. Other findings are highlighted in the results section (Sect. 5).",39

We investigate the possible interaction effects that the extent of property rights protection and separation of powers in a political system have on economic growth. Using analysis of panel data from more than 100 countries over the period 1970–2010 we find that the growth effects of property rights increase when political power is divided among more veto players. When distinguishing between institutional veto players (political institutions) and partisan veto players (fractionalization among political parties), we further find that the growth effects of property rights are driven mainly by checks on the chief executive (in bicameral systems) and primarily found in countries with large stocks of democratic capital.

Munger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Aside from natural disasters like tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes, the greatest catastrophes of human history have been institutional failures for which government, or the state, carries the basic responsibility. We call these “government failures.” Government failures are more frequent, and frankly more fundamental, than the “market failure” problems on which many economists focus. Government failure has an intuitive meaning. For example, World War I and Mao’s Great Leap Forward both were government failures, because their consequences were (predictably) perverse, but were initiated by governments anyway, leading to enormous destruction and loss of life.Footnote 1 Our standard of failure, then, is not just whether state action achieves its object, but also whether that object is consistent with justifications of political authority that rest on solving problems of collective action. More simply, government may fail to do things it should do, or government may do things it should not do. This approach differs from the subordinate treatment government failure receives in most contemporary economics. That treatment begins with a theory of perfect markets, follows with a theory of market failures, and follows that with conjectures about actions government might take to resolve the market failure. By that reasoning, government failure occurs when state interventions exacerbate, or simply fail to resolve, a market failure. Such a focus on markets is not wholly misplaced, of course. Price systems can and do play an important role in coordinating economic activity, and in improving human well-being. They sometimes fail in a way that is captured accurately by the theory of market failure.Footnote 2 But whether markets succeed or fail, they operate in a larger context of institutional rules that are set up and enforced by government. Markets may fail because governments interfere too much, regulate too little, or act badly, distorting the processes of production and exchange. Public discourse sometimes touches market failures and government failures construed more broadly. In our view, such discussions often posit a false dichotomy—more government versus more markets—in ways that are influenced superficially by ideology and political values. For example, little agreement has emerged about whether the recent financial crisis (2007–2009) was a government failure or a market failure. In our view, it was a system failure, with elements of both. But if our claim that government defines the rules under which markets operate is valid, then the government failure is causally prior. The real question is not whether we need more or less regulation, but how the rules of the game should be structured in terms of incentives, property rights, and constraints. The underlying problem is that government must be strong enough to maintain order, and to pass and then enforce laws and property rights systems that encourage coordination and solutions to collective action problems.Footnote 3 Governments that fail are generally both too big, and too small, at the same time. By doing too much, attention and resources are spread too thinly across too many activities. But then regulations or policies that should serve important functions receive too little enforcement emphasis. Perhaps worst of all, other regulations created out of momentary political alignments or reactions to emergencies—regulations that have long outlived their original purpose—survive because citizens or industries have become dependent on the protection of artificial rents. For these reasons, our approach begins with the simplest realistic choice setting. We will assume that a “dictator”—a unitary actor with well-defined objectives for solving collective problems—is in charge of the state. We then evaluate outcomes using the Pareto criterion, which anchors our approach in the grand tradition of competitive equilibrium theory (CET) in economics. CET is a theory of market success, and a benchmark for comparison. There is, as far as we know, no analogous theory of government success to use as a benchmark. But allowing a dictator to strive to limit outcomes to Pareto optima, and then to allow the selection among Pareto optima using side payments or compensation allows an (idealized) metric that identifies government failures with considerable analytic precision. Our “dictator” is an analytic device used to solve three different problems: incentives, information, and capacity. As a consequence, dictators are variously assumed to be (respectively) benevolent, omniscient, or omnipotent. 
Benevolence means that the goals are social as well as individual well-being, and in this paper, we will use the Pareto standard--with compensation--to define benevolence. Policies that fail to achieve this result are then government failures. We will posit the existence of a benchmark we will call the “Optimal Pareto Optimum” (OPO) and assume that achieving the OPO is the dictator’s objective.Footnote 4
 
Omniscience is another matter. In our view, no one person—benevolent or not—could possibly have all the relevant knowledge about values, demand, and supply, to maximize welfare. One version of this question is the famous “socialist calculation debate,” settled for many people by Hayek’s (1945) equally famous argument that only markets can provide a robust discovery process to aggregate dispersed knowledge. This may be true, and in fact that could be a reason why a benevolent dictator might choose to use markets as a practical (though imperfect) substitute for omniscience or synoptic knowledge. But it is not necessary to argue that markets can solve the problem to assert that a dictator cannot solve the problem, at least not alone. No central authority could be omniscient, so even a benevolent dictator must choose among institutional arrangements as a means of eliciting and aggregating information (Hayek 1945, Myerson 1979). 
Omnipotence is as problematic as omniscience. In a large and complex society, even a benevolent dictator needs the help of agents in implementing Pareto optimal policies. But it is fatally unrealistic to think that her benevolent policies will be carried out as intended. Some agents may be corrupt, or shirk because they are lazy or do not share the benevolent leader’s goals, or may redirect their energies toward rent-seeking—all likely sources of government failure. It is useful to pause to consider what now might be called “The Tullock Objection,” or the assumption that people in the public sector (elected officials, bureaucrats, interest groups, voters, and so on) are motivated by anything other than self-interest.Footnote 5 In simple terms, there is no such thing as a “benevolent dictator.” Buchanan started this “objection” when he (re)discovered Knut Wicksell in the University of Chicago’s Harper Library in 1947. Buchanan read German, and when he found “A New Principle of Just Taxation” he said that he felt as if “the scales had fallen from my eyes” (Buchanan 2001). Wicksell (1896, p. 82 emphasis added) said: [W]ith very few exceptions, the whole theory of [public finance] still rests on the now outdated political philosophy of absolutism. The theory now seems to have retained the assumptions of its infancy…when absolute power ruled most of Europe… Even the most recent manuals on the science of public finance frequently leave the impression of enlightened and benevolent despotism… Public choice has developed this insight, particularly in the work of Gordon Tullock, by relying on the assumption of behavioral symmetry, meaning that elected officials and bureaucrats are no worse, but no better, than private citizens, because they are no different. Public officials are no more benevolent than anyone else, and therefore the idea of a central authority that seeks single-mindedly to advance the public interest is fanciful.Footnote 6
 Nonetheless, we adopt the convention of a benevolent dictator. One reason is that the assumption remains common, more than a century after Wicksell’s objections and 50 years since attempts at refutation by development of the Public Choice literature. The central reason is not that we think that the benevolent dictator approach is useful or verisimilous. Instead, assuming a benevolent dictator allows us to finesse the problems of collective choice that plague any group endeavor, as those are not our main focus. To put it another way, even if the patently absurd assumption of a benevolent dictator is granted, the failures of government we catalog all still occur, and are in fact unavoidable. The “Pareto criterion” allows the comparison of different social states of the world based on the evaluations of individuals. The difficulty in selecting “good” policies is both ethical and practical; the Pareto criterion gives primacy to individual judgments about what is better or worse, and asks if there are some moves on which we can all agree. Pareto improvements are based on a comparison between two alternatives, the status quo Q and a feasible new social state S. We say S is “Pareto superior” to Q if everyone in the society prefers S to Q (strong form) or if at least one person prefers S to Q and no one prefers Q to S (weak form). Pareto optimality is based on a comparison between a status quo Q and any other alternative S. We say Q is “Pareto optimal” if there exists no feasible S that is a Pareto improvement over Q Pareto comparisons have three key elements, and a provisoFootnote 7: 
Autonomy: The process defers to the individual’s subjective judgments about better or worse. If the individual believes herself to be better off, she is, and in the absence of other compelling facts that belief is given deference.Footnote 8 So no one has to answer “why” or give reasons. Instead, the utility function of the individual is the judge. In practical terms, autonomy requires actual consent to proposals that are believed to “improve” the welfare of the individual. 
Unanimity: The Pareto criterion is a means of obtaining consent to public or collective decisions. The strong form requires that all people in the society agree that they are better off. The weak form requires only that no one is worse off, in line with Mill’s “Harm Principle” (Mill 2002). 
Compensation: Pareto comparisons suffer from the weakness that no one must be harmed. But many comparisons create total benefits far larger than the relatively small costs they create. This suggests augmenting Pareto comparisons with side payments or compensation. Importantly, this suggests a means of adjudication among Pareto optima, because some Pareto optima are “better” (create more total value) than others. That is, if the benefits to choosing S (for the gainers) are large enough to create a surplus value that allows the compensation of those who prefer Q (who would, in effect, “lose” by moving from Q to S), unanimity can still be achieved. The gainers compensate the losers, and the result is a Pareto improvement, because (after the compensation is paid) everyone prefers S to Q. This “compensation-augmented Pareto comparison” suggests the existence of at least one “Optimal Pareto Optimum” or OPO. The OPO is that Pareto optimum compared to which no Pareto improvement is possible, even allowing compensation (and assuming, because of the actions of the benevolent dictator, no hold-up or other strategic bargaining tactics.)Footnote 9
 
Proviso: There is an obvious, and potentially crippling, tension between autonomy and compensation.Footnote 10 As we will see there are objections to the notion that someone else can accurately gauge what a citizen values and how that trades off for compensation. Further, there are bargaining problems because the citizen might be better off but hoping to “hold up” the process by refusing to give actual consent. Thus, there are at least three problems: (a) information; (b) incommensurability; and (c) hold-up. Each of these problems might legitimately prevent agreement. But we are only going to consider the information problem, and investigate the extent to which different mechanisms are effective “discovery processes.” That is, we will assume that all (relevant) issues are commensurable, making compensation possible, and we will assume that people are cooperative and willing to accept a proposed solution (if it is in fact better from their perspective) even if strategic hold-up might give them an even better outcome. The reason for this proviso is obvious, we hope: even if these (significant) simplifications are allowed, governments still fail. Without these simplifications, failure can be systemic and catastrophic. We apply this apparatus to the problem of government failure in three steps. The first step is explained in Sect. 2: substantive government failure, or the failure to solve basic problems of organization and credible commitment. In these instances, which we examine in the first major section of the paper, we consider problems of organizing a functional system of governance, to make credible commitments to control debt or the temptation to debase the currency, and to control rent-seeking. All of these problems, if unsolved, leave the society at an outcome that is not Pareto optimal. In practical terms, this means that at least one feasible alternative exists that could make every member of the society better off, and yet the change is not made.Footnote 11
 This is precisely the logic of the Hobbesian “war of all against all” (Hobbes 2012). In the absence of any order, no investment, property, or law is worthwhile. Everyone in the society would be better off agreeing to some system that offers governance, predictability, and freedom from coercion by outsiders or other citizens, so we look at the “absence of order.” If the state cannot impose predictable rule of law without corruption, then state activities are diverted from securing order and producing basic public goods to lining the pockets of officials, so we look at “transaction costs” such as corruption, agency, and rent-seeking. If the society secures a foundational and workable consensus on the substance of governance—a “constitution”—then the problem of escaping Hobbes’ “state of nature” is solved, and some Pareto optimum is selected. The failure to reach a Pareto optimum is therefore how we define substantive government failure.Footnote 12
 The problem of procedure is quite different. Procedure is the problem of choosing the “best” from among a set of Pareto optima. As Hardin (1990) argued, this step requires justifying the procedures to be used by an actual polity. To gain analytic purchase on this problem, we employ a simplifying procedure: imagine that only two Pareto optima are on the table, one of which is better than the other under the “potential Pareto with compensation” comparison. That is, allowing for cardinal utilities and side payments, one of the two Pareto optima being considered is better than the other. We investigate whether any of five general categories of procedures—voting, interest group pluralism, pricing-exchange processes, bargaining, or cost-benefit analysis—can be expected consistently to select the correct answer.Footnote 13 It is important to note that we do not consider this decision context to be realistic; quite the contrary. Our goal is to assume away the Arrovian problems of social choice (by having only two alternatives) and problems of ethics, ideology, and political intransigence (by having cardinal utilities, considering only compensable issues selected by purely rational agents, and allowing side payments). What we find is that even in these artificially favorable circumstances all five categories of procedures fail to select the OPO. In Sect. 4, we consider some extensions and possibilities for the elaboration of government failures under more realistic assumptions about human behavior. These observations are necessarily more suggestive than dispositive, because work in psychology and behavioral economics has only begun to illuminate the problems of decisions and collective action and the limits of even the best procedures to produce the desired outcomes.",40

6A parable often attributed to Gordon Tullock is the story of the “Roman Emperor.” Here we use the version told by Boettke et al. (2007): The tale of the Roman Emperor, often invoked by Gordon Tullock, summarizes the problem of pre-public choice political economy well. According to this tale a Roman Emperor is asked to judge a singing contest between two contestants. Upon hearing the first contestant sing, the Emperor awards the prize to the second singer under the assumption that she clearly cannot be any worse than the first. But the Emperor’s assumption is quite possibly off the mark; the second singer could in fact be much worse. This parable highlights the proposition that imperfect markets do not necessarily justify government intervention. The consequences of this methodological demand for behavioral symmetry were therefore damaging to the government-as-corrective conclusion of the previous generation of public economists, and augmented the unintended consequences critique of government intervention. First sentence, second paragraph under 4.4 Loss aversion/endowment effects
 This effect, called “the endowment effect” (Kahneman et al. 1990; Kahneman 2011, pp. 189–199) has been found to explain a wide variety of apparently “irrational” choices and behaviors, in different contexts.

164.0,1.0,Public Choice,26 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-015-0264-9,Sabotage in contests: a survey,July 2015,Subhasish M. Chowdhury,Oliver Gürtler,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Sabotage is ubiquitous in everyday life. A very early mention of sabotage was by Kautilya, the Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya (the first King of the Maurya Kingdom in ancient India) in 400 BC. The Cambridge Dictionary defines sabotage as “to damage or destroy equipment, weapons or buildings in order to prevent the success of an enemy or competitor”. In the context of labor economics, Lazear (1989, p. 563) defines sabotage as ”any (costly) actions that one worker takes that adversely affect the output of another”. Although the concept of sabotage is quite familiar, the day-to-day definitions and understandings of sabotage vary across contexts, places, and times. In the industrial organization literature, sabotage is connected with the act of “raising rival’s cost” (Salop and Scheffman 1983). The early literature on labor issues considers sabotage to be the intentional use of low efficiency by laborers in response to low wages offered (Pouget 1912).Footnote 1 In each of these cases, individuals use strategies intended to damage someone else’s success rather than improving their own. Sabotage has a similar connotation in contests. A deliberate and costly act by one contestant to damage the performance of another in a contest is, in general, termed sabotage. In this study we review the economics literature on sabotage from the perspective of contests. Formally, contests are situations in which participants expend costly resources to win a valuable prize and, irrespective of the outcome, all of the resources expended are lost. Examples of such situations include sports, lobbying, job interviews, promotion tournaments, research funding applications, legal disputes, war, patent races, and advertising. In each of these circumstances, contestants have the opportunity to expend resources to improve their own probability of winning the prize. Often, they also have the opportunity to expend resources to reduce another contestant’s probability of winning the same prize. Following a major part of the literature, we term the resources expended to increase one’s own probability of winning as “effort”, and those expended to reduce rivals’ probability of winning as “sabotage”. Because the participants’ winning probabilities always sum to 1, sabotage indirectly improves one’s likelihood of winning the prize.Footnote 2 However, this type of behavior often violates social norms and is illegal and costly—making sabotage an expensive strategy. Despite this, such behavior is widespread, as the following examples indicate: The steady decline of Microsoft since 2000 under CEO Steve Ballmer is attributed partly to the new employee review system introduced by him (Oremus 2013). In this system, employees are evaluated relative to each other, top performers receive bonuses and promotions whereas those at the bottom often have to fear for their jobs. The review system encourages employees to do almost everything they can to improve their ranking relative to their peers. For instance, a Microsoft engineer reported that “people responsible for features will openly sabotage other people’s efforts”. Sabotage was undertaken subtly by withholding information from colleagues to ensure that they did not get ahead in the rankings. Businesspeople often resort to costly strategies to damage competitors’ business. Friedman (1998, p. 577) describes one such business malpractice that occurred in the 1890s. John H. Patterson, the owner of the National Cash Register Company, used a special type of a counterproductive salesman. They were not required to promote their own product; instead, their job was to follow the salesmen of rival firms from shop to shop and to convince the customers to cancel any order that had just been placed. In this way, the market remained open for Patterson to sell his own cash registers in the near future. In many marketing campaigns, firms stress their rivals’ weak points. One such example is Progresso’s famous advertisements, which highlighted that its rival Campbell’s offered 95 soups containing monosodium glutamate (MSG). This led to a 4–5 % decline in Campbell’s US soup sales (Lubin 2011). Sabotage is common also in political campaigns in which the opponents are discredited and often denigrated. In the 1997 general election cycle, the UK’s Conservative Party broadcast an advertisement with a picture of the Labor Party leader Tony Blair, replacing his eyes in the picture with demonic ones. Political imprisonment can be seen as an extreme form of such sabotage in political contests. As an example, consider Aung San Suu Kyi, who was placed under house arrest in 1990 when her National League for Democracy received 59 % of the votes in the Burmese general election. Stealing crucial information from a political or commercial rival is also not uncommon. One such example is the set of events that led to the “Watergate scandal” in 1972. US President Nixon and the Committee for the Re-Election of the President designed a plan that involved, among other illegal activities, breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex to collect information that could be used against the Democratic Party in the election. “Scorched earth” is a famous strategy in warfare and corporate takeover battles. In warfare, it involves troops burning any land, crops, or trees as they retreat so there are no supplies available to the advancing enemy army. In corporate takeover battles, the strategy describes actions that a firm undertakes to make the proposed takeover unattractive to the acquiring firm, such as liquidating its valuable and desirable assets and assuming new debt obligations. Female satin bowerbirds view bowers, i.e., decorated nests, as indicators of male quality in mate choice. As a consequence, male satin bowerbirds often destroy the bowers of other males to gain an advantage in sexual competition (Borgia 1985). All of these examples, although in a variety of different contexts, convey essentially the same message. However, because these examples often resemble other seemingly similar contest-driven behavior, it is important to distinguish acts of sabotage from such behavior as “punishment” (Abbink et al. 2010), “nastiness” (Zizzo and Oswald 2001; Abbink and Sadrieh 2009), “risk taking” (Genakos and Pagliero 2012), and “cheating” (Preston and Szymanski 2003). The main difference is that sabotage is conducted to damage others and is driven by material benefits for the saboteur. When an agent punishes someone else, this typically happens either because the person being punished is not following an objective norm or because the agent is motivated by fairness issues. Unlike sabotage, the punishment oftentimes is not executed in expectation of a material benefit for the punisher. It is to be noted, however, that when a norm is subjective, a powerful agent may distort the norm in his or her own favor, making punishment and sabotage indistinguishable. This is what happened when the military junta in power “punished” Suu Kyi with imprisonment. However, in the end, it was an act of sabotage. Agents who indulge in nastiness—as in the joy of destruction (Abbink and Sadrieh 2009) or in money-burning (Zizzo and Oswald 2001) games—may execute strategies similar to those of a saboteur. However, although there might be intrinsic motivation for being nasty, employing that strategy does not necessarily produce a material benefit for the agent. Instead, sabotage behavior is motivated by the expected material benefit arising from raising the incremental probability of winning. Similarly, an agent’s risky behavior may or may not involve other agents, especially competitors. Although engaging in sabotage itself may be risky, to use sabotage there needs to be a victim of sabotage, which is not a pre-condition for risky behavior. The distinction from cheating, however, is not that clear. Oftentimes, an agent involved in cheating does so to illegally distort his own performance in a contest. A sabotaging agent tries (legally or illegally) to damage the performance of his rivals. Preston and Szymanski (2003) analyzed several forms of cheating in sports and mention that those cheating activities, such as taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, doping racehorses, and intentional poor performance in a basketball game, are not sabotage. There are, however, other cheating acts that are inseparable from the act of sabotage. When an agent illegally damages the opponent, it becomes both cheating and sabotage. One such example comes from boxing. In a 1962 heavyweight title fight, it is claimed that Sonny Liston applied a banned substance to the surface of his gloves that caused irritation to the eyes of the opponent Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay). Use of such an illegal substance was cheating, but because it hindered Ali’s performance, it also was an act of sabotage.Footnote 3
 Because sabotage is common, important, and different from other similar acts, research has continuously investigated the means and consequences of sabotage. However, there is no comprehensive survey of existing studies. Partial reviews of sabotage behavior, as parts of longer reviews, are provided by (Konrad 2009, Chapter 5.3), on the theoretical literature, and by (Dechenaux et al. 2012, Chapter 6.1), on the experimental literature. In addition, Amegashie (2015) recently provided a brief overview of sabotage in rent-seeking contests. In this study, we thoroughly review the economics literature of sabotage in contests, both in theoretical and applied terms. We cover the economics literature but do not consider literature from other areas of research, such as organizational behavior or political science, even though they might be related in terms of broader appeal. The remainder of this survey is arranged as follows. In the next section, we provide a general specification of contests without sabotage and then introduce sabotage into this framework. Next, we discuss the consequences and welfare effects of agents engaging in sabotage, for the contest organizer and for third parties. Saboteurs may be discouraged in two main ways: reducing the benefits of sabotage or increasing its costs. We discuss these issues in detail and introduce examples. We conclude by pointing out possible research contributions that are yet to be made.",83

After its creation, new knowledge can have vast social benefits because of its non-rivalness. However, the extent to which these benefits are gained as well as the incentive required for the initial investment both depend on the level of excludability. There are several known solutions for providing incentives for innovation, such as intellectual property rights (IPRs), research prizes, R&D cooperation, and government subsidies, although none of these is without its problems. Using a game-theoretic model of a discrete public good provision, the present study aims to determine the socially optimal level of excludability for purely non-rival knowledge. The main result obtained by the model is that IPR and R&D cooperation should be considered as complementary rather than as alternative policy measures and that efficient provision of knowledge commons can be achieved through the combination of voluntary cooperation and imperfect property rights. On the backdrop of this article are the past changes in antitrust and IPR policies. Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, both the USA and Europe became increasingly worried about the Japanese competition, and one of the main policy responses to this was to make antitrust exemptions for R&D cooperation between firms. For example, the 1984 US National Cooperative Research Act and its amended version in 1993 marked a significant departure from the earlier policy, which was relatively hostile towards any form of inter-firm cooperation (Hart 2001). On the other hand, the same two decades saw important reforms in the US patent system, which strengthened patent protection and extended its scope (Gallini 2002). The proposed transcontinental trade agreements of the present day would imply a further step towards global IPR policy, while at the same time the current IPR regimes in the US and elsewhere are facing increasing criticism (e.g., Tabarrok 2002; Shapiro 2008; Boldrin and Levine 2013). Recently, several studies questioning the need for (strong) IPRs have emerged. For example, Choi (1998) and Krasteva (2014) show that stronger IPRs do not always benefit the innovator. In the former, an intermediate IPR strength drives the innovator to accommodate the first entrant, whereas weaker IPRs lead to a waiting game between potential entrants, which can be more profitable to the innovator. In the latter, R&D investment is maximized for an intermediate protection level, since some imitation also benefits the innovator in the form of expected damage payments. Furthermore, Bessen and Maskin (2009) show that in the context of sequential innovation the society and even innovators may be better off without IPRs. This outcome arises because, while imitation reduces the profit from current discovery, it raises the probability of subsequent innovations and hence future profits. The results obtained in this article similarly support imperfect IPRs. In the case of non-cooperative investments alone, it turns out that the optimal level is a complex function of the specific costs and benefits even in our stylized model, which suggests that optimal IPR policy alone requires too much knowledge on behalf of the policymakers. Furthermore, it is shown that pure excludability creates an outcome that is equally inefficient as pure non-excludability. This is due to the duplication of effort induced by the higher monopoly rents of excludable knowledge. Thus, there is a clear danger if policymakers are lobbied for stronger IPR protection. There is a notable disjoint in the existing literature, however. On the one hand, R&D cooperation has not been considered in the context of optimal IPRs. On the other hand, while the social benefits of R&D cooperation have been studied in the industrial organization literature (e.g., d’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1988; Baumol 2001), voluntary participation and the effect of IPRs on these incentives have not been considered there. The game-theoretic public good approach of the current paper brings these aspects together and shows how R&D cooperation and partial excludability through imperfect IPRs act together to provide optimal innovation incentives. While Dixit and Olson (2000) demonstrate that the absence of transaction costs alone does not induce much voluntary public good provision, our model shows that a range of excludability exists within which voluntary R&D cooperation can both attract the optimal contributions as well as deter excessive duplication of effort. Recognizing the benefits of and allowing for cooperation decreases the margin for error in IPR policy. Therefore, R&D cooperation and IPRs should be considered as complementary rather than as separate and alternative policy measures. While favoring the combination of strong IPRs and tough antitrust policies, this policy complementarity has been similarly highlighted by Spulber (2013). The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the underlying problem in knowledge investments and describes the main characteristics of the model. In Sect. 3, we analyze the socially optimal level of excludability in the absence of cooperation. We present the optimal level of excludability as a function of the benefits and costs of R&D investment as well as showing that the two extremes are equally inefficient in terms of social welfare. In Sect. 4, we introduce the possibility of R&D cooperation into the model. The main result demonstrates that the socially optimal level of excludability becomes an interval that again depends on the cost and benefits of the particular knowledge investment in question. It is shown that this complementarity between IPR and R&D cooperation also holds when there is uncertainty in the outcome of the research project and some degree of duplication is optimal. The last section summarizes our results and discusses their policy implications.",

Most democratic countries have a voluntary voting system; it is, however, debatable whether voting should be mandatory (Lijphart 1997). Compulsory voting is in place in 34 countries, and despite a recent growing literature, still little is known about the effects of this controversial voting system: whether it affects election outcomes and how it changes the electorate’s political views. In this paper, we address this last question and provide estimates of the causal effect of compulsory voting on individuals’ degree of political polarization and political preferences. The evidence is based on the Brazil’s unique dual-voting system. Individuals between 16 and 18 years of age are entitled to vote, while those older than 18 are by law required to vote.Footnote 1 We use data from a self-collected survey among young adults exposed to either system, conducted just after the 2010 presidential election in Brazil. We quantify the reduced form of the effect of voting participation by adopting a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) framework and looking at differences around the age of 18. Our estimates show how political preferences change in the transition from a voluntary to a compulsory voting system. We provide strong statistical evidence for these effects, thus contributing to the open debate among academics and the public regarding the consequences of a forced democracy (Krasa and Polborn 2009; Krishna and Morgan 2011; Borgers 2004; Ghosal and Lockwood 2009). More generally, our findings add to the understanding of the effects of voting participation on political preferences. The requirement of having to vote may affect citizens’ level of political interest and, consequently, consumption of information and political preferences (Gerber et al. 2010). In this case, initiatives that encourage voting participation may in fact affect the citizenry’s political orientations and contribute to polarization. In voting models that assume a cost-benefit calculus (Downs 1957; Coate and Conlin 2004; Degan 2006), political engagement and preferences are often assumed to be exogenous and determinants of electoral participation. In this paper, we test the opposite causal channel: whether these parameters respond to an exogenous change in voting turnout. The identification of causal effects of turnout participation is challenging, giving that unobservables, such as intrinsic political interest, determine both voter turnout rates and other political outcomes. The literature adopts several approaches to identify these impacts. These approaches rely on field experiments that induce voting participation (León 2015; Gerber et al. 2010; Loewen et al. 2008). Other studies exploit changes in voting costs to identify the determinants and consequences of turnout (León 2015; Funk 2010). Gomez et al. (2007) and Hansford and Gomez (2010) examine variations in weather conditions on Election Day to establish a causal relationship between voting participation and election results at the US county level. They find that bad weather leads to lower turnout and helps Republicans to gain votes. Hansford and Gomez (2010) use an IV approach, explaining US presidential candidates’ vote shares with turnout that is instrumented by Election Day rainfall. They predict that a 4 % change in turnout leads to a change in the Democrat Party’s vote share at the national level of around one percentage point. These large effects suggest that increases in voting participation can result in different election results. Godefroy and Henry (2013) use a similar strategy and data from French municipalities to uncover the relationship between turnout and implemented post-election policies. Hodler et al. (2015) examine the consequences of the introduction of voting via post in Switzerland, which resulted in increases in turnout. They find that this policy led to a change in electorate composition and to a reduction in government welfare expenditures. This paper investigates the relationship between voting participation and political preferences at the individual level and in the context of the compulsory voting legislation. Similarly to this paper, León (2015) quantifies the effects of a lessening of penalties related to voting abstention in Peru, where voting is compulsory. In a field experiment, he provided information about the change in the penalties and found significantly lower voter turnouts as a result of that intervention. However, he did not detect changes in individuals’ preferences for specific policies. Another part of the literature exploits variation in individuals’ voting age eligibility to identify the relationship between voting participation and political preferences. Mullainathan and Washington (2009) find that individuals eligible to vote (20–21 year olds) who are affiliated with the same party as the president evaluate him as two times better than non-eligible individuals (18–19 year olds) with the same party affiliation do 2 years after the election. Focusing on a field experiment, Gerber et al. (2010) find that unaffiliated registered voters strengthened their party identity after receiving the information that they need to register with a party to vote in a US primary election. Using an RD framework and exploring voting-age restrictions in the United States, Meredith (2009) finds that voting eligibility increases individuals’ future chances of party registration in California. These studies illustrate only part of the voting effects. It is plausible that the opportunity to vote affects only those who are willing to participate in elections. The estimated voting effects reported in this paper are more compelling and unanticipated, as they are based on exposure to a compulsory voting system, affecting those who choose to abstain during elections. Our estimated effects of the transition from a voluntary to a compulsory voting system are also important, because they contribute to the literature on the evaluation of voting systems. A large number body of studies is focused on predicting election outcomes under full turnout,Footnote 2 arguably the most important consequence of the compulsory voting legislation. Citrin et al. (2003) and Brunell and DiNardo (2004) predict the ballot choices of non-voters based on the choice of voters with similar demographics, and they then forecast election results under full participation. A key problem in extrapolating these results, for understanding the impacts of compulsory voting legislation, is that none of the literature considers a potential change in preferences owing to compulsory voting. The data used in this paper are ideal for shedding light on this issue. They also provide empirical validation for a key assumption—that ideological preferences are fixed—in voting models that investigate welfare implications of voting systems (Krasa and Polborn 2009; Krishna and Morgan 2011; Borgers 2004; Ghosal and Lockwood 2009).Footnote 3,
Footnote 4
 We find that, when passing from a voluntary to a compulsory voting system, individuals become 2–4 percentage points (pps) more likely to self-declare themselves as extremely left-wing oriented and become 5–8 pps more likely to align with a specific party (PSDB- Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira). We do not find evidence that these effects are related to individuals’ information gains or increases in their senses of political civism. Considering that our identification strategy relies on a comparison of individuals who are almost identical in age (and presumably indistinguishable by politicians), it is also unlikely that the results are driven by political parties targeting young voters in their campaigns. In addition, we find that individuals change their minds about the characteristics they find to be important in an ideal candidate. Perhaps surprisingly, “charisma” becomes at least twice more likely to be cited as the most important characteristic in an ideal politician with the transition from voluntary to a compulsory voting system. This suggests that changes in political orientations might to some extent be explained by internal thought processes triggered by the obligation to vote. Individuals might think more about the election and re-evaluate their assessments of candidates’ characteristics, political parties and their stands on policy issues. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide an overview of Brazilian politics. In Sect. 3, we explain the data and the method, and we present the results in Sect. 4. We discuss and conclude in Sect. 5.",15

How can individual’s preferences be mapped into political outcomes that are broadly acceptable to the constituents who must comply with collective choices? This is a longstanding question in the history of democratic thought, and two avenues have been discerned ever since: democratic decision-making through “representative” and through “direct” processes. Historically, the focus was on representative governance. Montesquieu (2005, p. 14 et seq.), for one, wrote: The people, in whom the supreme power resides, ought to have the management of everything within their reach: what exceeds their abilities must be conducted by their ministers. […] The people are extremely well qualified for choosing those whom they are to entrust with part of their authority. […] But are they capable of conducting an intricate affair, of seizing and improving the opportunity and critical moment of action? No; this surpasses their abilities. 
With the upsurge of what is perceived by many as a loss of confidence in the institutions of representative government, direct democracy increasingly has been seen as a preferable option for collective decision-making in recent decades: “Tensions have grown in most Western nations between the existing processes of representative democracy and calls by reformists for a more participatory style of democratic government” (Dalton et al. 2001, p. 141). Recent years have witnessed a “spread of direct democracy” in many democratic polities (Scarrow 2001; Matsusaka 2005; Donovan and Karp 2006). A case in point is the effort of the European Union, one of the largest democratic political systems in the world, to curtail its alleged democratic deficit (Karp et al. 2003) by introducing large-scale referendums (Auer 2005). However, the question arises whether voters see direct-democratic decisions as more acceptable than decisions achieved through representative procedures. For one thing, it has been shown that traditional systems of democratic representation may actually lead to a “party paradox” (Towfigh 2015). On the one hand, as Montesquieu suggests, because private individuals may not possess the time or have the incentives necessary to become well-informed regarding the full range of political problems (Downs 1957), they delegate this task to representatives—political parties and their candidates. Party labels serve as cognitive heuristics that help the electorate make meaningful decisions and choose policy positions on novel issues (Arceneaux 2008; Druckman 2001; Zaller 1992). Parties thus fulfill an indispensable intermediary function by reducing voters’ costs of information and aggregating political packages for them (Ashworth and Bueno de Mesquita 2008; Jones and Hudson 1998; Müller 2000; Nisbett and Ross 1992). From this perspective, representation by political parties is functional because it facilitates specialization and the division of labor. As voters are unable to invest sufficient resources in gathering and processing political information, deciding which party offers is closest to one’s ideal point in policy space position seems more efficient. On the other hand, this system of intermediaries has also been recognized as producing severe biases in the representation of voters’ preferences, among them the opportunistic political business cycle (Nordhaus 1975; Petring 2010), corruption (Heidenheimer and Johnston 2002), other rent-seeking behavior (McCormick and Tollison 1979), and a lack of choice due to platform convergence (Bernhardt et al. 2009). These weaknesses may affect citizens’ satisfaction with the political system and lessen political participation (Scarrow 1999) or even lead to disenchantment with political parties (Klein 2005; Clarke and Stewart 1998). This paradox of representation may reduce the acceptance of political decisions by the electorate and contribute to the overall disillusion with democracy (Towfigh 2015). The final verdict on the benefits of direct democracy is still out, and the literature is divided on the merits of direct-democratic procedures over conventional forms of representative democracy. Proponents argue that the former may stimulate voters’ political interest by forcing them to think about the contents of a political decision and may educate voters as political citizens (Benz and Stutzer 2004; Smith 2002). Hence, direct democracy may lead to more active participation (Schuck and de Vreese 2011; Tolbert and Smith 2005) and a better representation of voters’ preferences. The mere threat of a referendum may also discipline the representatives and induce them to align with the electorate more closely (Hajnal et al. 2002; Matsusaka and McCarty 2001). However, recent cross-country evidence on this issue offers rather sobering insights (Voigt and Blume 2015). Frequent ballots may lead to voter fatigue and thus reduce, rather than increase, electoral participation and decision quality (Bowler et al. 1992; Freitag and Stadelmann-Steffen 2010). Biases in the mapping of citizen’s preferences into political outcomes may materialize because well-organized interest groups can initiate referendums by buying the initially required number of signatures (for a discussion, see Lupia and Matsusaka 2004; Hasen 2000). In addition, ballot decisions may, under certain circumstances, suppress minorities in favor of the majority (Gerber 1996; Vatter and Danaci 2010; Hajnal et al. 2002, for a nuanced empirical study). In other words, the quality of political decisions may decline because direct-democratic procedures are prone to distortions by specific subgroups of the electorate. Moreover, only little evidence exists on how the acceptance of a political decision depends on its procedural details. The present study investigates how acceptance differs between situations in which a political decision results from a direct-democratic mechanism, a political party, or an expert panel. Our empirical results are based on an online survey experiment conducted before the March 2011 state-level election in Rhineland-Palatinate, one of the 16 German federal states (Länder). We employed a 3 × 5 × 2 factorial design to test for differential acceptance rates of political decisions, varying the decision-making mechanism, the issue scenario, and a positive versus negative framing of the decision problem. Our results show that the acceptance of decisions does not vary per se between the decision-making mechanisms, but if voters’ core interests are at stake, they prefer more immediate control over such decisions. Therefore, we argue that political parties rightly assume their role of lowering transaction costs of voters for everyday decision-making, but they do less well in terms of acceptance of political decisions that are close to the voters’ hearts. In the following section, we will develop our research questions based on the existing literature. Thereafter, the data collection and methodology are explained in detail before our results are presented. Finally, our paper concludes with a discussion of our results and the broader implications of our findings, suggesting avenues for future research.",19

This hypothesis essentially means that, in a Nash equilibrium of voluntary public good provision, the rich (better endowed) agents make larger contributions to the public good than the poor agents so that the rich agents, in a certain sense, are “exploited” in the strategic context of the contribution game. However, Sandler (2015, pp. 206–209) remarked that the hypothesis can be expected to hold only under specific circumstances, i.e., if the agents behave according to the strategic Nash assumption and possess identical preferences. While maintaining the Nash assumption, we show that besides the original “exploitation of the rich by the poor” other kinds of “exploitation” are possible: i.e., of the contributors with a high preference for the public good by those with a low preference; of the contributors with high private co-benefits from their public good contributions by those with low private co-benefits; and of the contributors with greater productivity in providing the public good by those with lower productivity. Our expanded analysis of exploitation provides a more complete picture of the determinants of burden sharing with respect to voluntary public good provision. Even though differences in preferences (see Andreoni 1988) or public good productivities (see Buchholz and Konrad 1994; Ihori 1996) have been considered in the literature, these approaches have not been associated explicitly with Olson’s exploitation hypothesis. After describing the framework of the analysis in Sect. 2, we consider the three variants of the exploitation maxim under quite general assumptions in Sect. 3. In particular, we provide a short novel proof of the classical exploitation hypothesis and its two variants. In Sect. 4, we illustrate the three versions of the exploitation hypothesis through examples based on Cobb–Douglas preferences and, in particular, show how the underlying mechanisms may oppose each other. In Sect. 5, we conclude by suggesting some empirical applications of our theoretical results.",9

Rablen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Decision-making within international organizations is sometimes made by voting bodies that comprise a proper subset of the membership (a “council”). The pre-eminent such council, and the primary motivator of this paper, is the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the only international body with the power to authorize the use of armed force. At any one time, the UNSC contains only 15 members from a total United Nations (UN) membership of 193. Two further councils operating within the UN are the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). ECOSOC (54 members) is responsible for coordinating the work of 14 UN specialized agencies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, while the UNHRC (47 members) is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world. Councils also operate within many of the UN’s specialized agencies, some examples being the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (35 members), the Council of the International Maritime Organization (40 members), and the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (34 members).Footnote 1
 In this paper we develop a simple and sober theoretical framework for analyzing democratic equitability in councils and present an application to the UNSC. Existing studies of equity in international voting bodies are predicated on an idealized two-stage democratic decision-making process—first, each member state holds a national vote; second, a delegate from each member state votes in the international body according to the outcome of the national vote. International voting bodies that have been analyzed in this framework include the Council of the European Union (e.g., Felsenthal and Machover 2001, 2004, 2007; Laruelle and Widgrén 1998; Leech 2002a); the UN General Assembly (Manno 1966; Newcombe et al. 1971; Dixon 1983), the IMF Executive Board (Leech 2002b; Leech and Leech 2013; Rapkin and Strand 2006), and the World Bank Executive Boards (Leech and Leech 2005).Footnote 2 The UNSC is notably absent from this list. What lies behind this lacuna? When international decision-making is by a council, the conventional democratic decision-making process described above cannot be applied directly for at least two reasons. First, in a council, only a subset of country delegates gets to participate in the international vote. Second, this subset is not usually constant over time. We account for these factors in a new class of voting game we term a council voting game (CVG). In a CVG a body comprising all members—an “assembly”—assigns (by election or otherwise) a subset of its members to a “council”. As the council’s membership must be allowed to change through time we cannot take it to be a primitive, thus distinguishing a CVG from the classical “simple voting game” of Shapley (1962). In a CVG the set of council members instead originates endogenously as a function of four primitive elements, (A, N, R, P), where A is the set of members of the assembly; R is a regional partition on A (the UN membership is partitioned into five regions, for instance); N is a partition of seats on the council between regions, and P is a stochastic process that determines the probability with which each member of A is assigned to the council. To analyze equitable representation, we embed a CVG within a democratic decision-making process. In the conventional two-stage process employed in the literature, the first (national) vote is held under a simple majority rule, with a binary set of voting possibilities {for, against}, and a dichotomous outcome space {mandate to vote “for”, mandate to vote “against”}. In the second (international) stage, countries vote “for” or “against” according to their national mandates and the outcome space is {pass, fail}. We generalize this process in three ways. First, we posit a tripartite process in which a national vote occurs in the first stage, countries are assigned randomly to the council in the second stage, and the council votes in the final stage. Second, we allow for the first stage to be a regional (rather than national) vote to study a notion of equity at the level of regions, distinct from equity at the level of countries. Last, in order to represent the distinct role of abstention in councils such as the UNSC faithfully, we generalize the set of voting possibilities and outcomes in the national and international votes, and we generalize the decision rule beyond simple majority rule.Footnote 3
 Our basic normative notion of democratic equity—the equalization of expected voting power (EVP) criterion—requires that every citizen have the same voting power (in expectation) over outcomes in the council, before the assignment of countries to the council is known.Footnote 4 This concept of equity, therefore, reflects both a country’s voting rights when serving as a council member, and how often it is a council member. We distinguish between equity at the country and region levels: the country-level equity concept presupposes that, when a member of the council, countries represent only their own citizens, whereas the region-level concept presupposes that, when a council member, countries act as representatives of their region as a whole. We also develop flavors of the EVP criterion under different a priori assumptions regarding intra-regional preference correlation. Interestingly, our country and region equity concepts are not, in general, mutually compatible: a CVG that is equitable if council members represent only themselves (as opposed to their regions) will necessarily fail to achieve equitable regional representation, and the reverse also is true. We characterize democratic equitability under each of our equity concepts. Under the assumption of random voting, we show that our country equity concept is satisfied when a citizen’s expected absolute voting power in the council (before the assignment of countries to the council is known) is inversely proportional to their absolute voting power in the national ballot. Regional equity under random voting requires that a citizen’s absolute voting power in the council (when each region votes as a bloc) is inversely proportional to their absolute voting power in the regional ballot. With respect to applications, our paper is the first we are aware of to present a quantitative assessment against formal equity concepts of the equitability of the UNSC for both individual countries and regions. As we discuss in more detail in Sect. 3, the UNSC is witnessing a protracted reform debate that centers on national and regional representation (see, e.g., Franck 2003). At the regional level, reformers argue that Africa and Asia have too little power, and that a north–south imbalance exists. At the national level, countries such as Germany and Japan—who are eligible only for Non-Permanent Member (NPM) status on the UNSC—claim to be severely underrepresented, and the permanent members (PMs)—who each wield an individual veto—are argued to have too much representation. Our modeling of the UNSC utilizes a specification of the democratic decision-making process in which the vote in the first stage is under an extension of the well-known majority threshold rule to allow for three voting possibilities, {for, abstain, against}, and three possible outcomes, {mandate to vote for, no mandate, mandate to vote against}. Specifically, a threshold proportion of the eligible voters must vote for (against) a motion for a country to have a mandate to vote for (against) a motion in the council. Abstention in the council is identified with instances wherein a country fails to obtain a mandate for voting either for or against a motion in the national vote. We prove an extension of Penrose’s (1946) square-root law for the case in which the majority threshold is set at one-third of eligible voters. Our findings give detailed insights into the UNSC reform debate. Our main notion of country equity shows that the permanent members (PMs) are heavily overrepresented: the United Kingdom is the most heavily overrepresented PM with over 21 times its equitable level of expected voting power, while China is the least heavily overrepresented PM with around 3.8 times its equitable level of expected voting power. Our equity concepts do not, however, preclude some countries holding a right of veto. The very smallest countries in terms of population suffer from very significant underrepresentation—Dominica, for instance, is estimated to receive just 0.8 % of its equitable voting power. Our regional equity concept shows that Africa is the most underrepresented region with only around one-third of its equitable voting power, while Eastern Europe is the most overrepresented with just over double its equitable representation. These findings suggest a case for a reallocation of the seats given to each region, and our notion of country equity is prescriptive in this regard. The plan of the rest of paper is as follows: Sect. 2 develops a theoretical framework for the analysis of democratic equity in councils; Sect. 3 presents an application of the theory to the UNSC; and Sect. 4 concludes. All proofs are located in the Appendix.",5

From a modern perspective ostracism may sound as a bizarre practice and a harsh punishment that violates individual rights. According to the Athenian Constitution of Aristotle (22.1–4), ostracism was enacted as a precaution against men in powerful positions to defend the demos from potential tyrants. Even though the ancient biographer Plutarch considered it as motivated by envy against prominent citizens (see, for example, Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Aristides, 7.2), it put a stop to earlier violent political contests, after which the winning side typically exiled the losing side and confiscated its property. Ostracism was a potent weapon to eliminate leading individuals, at least temporarily, but it was deployed sparingly, used ten times in the period 507–416 with no ostracisms taking place after that date, although the procedure was not removed from the statutes. Ancient history scholarship has highlighted that ostracism accomplished several things: not only could it defend democracy, but it also provided a powerful mechanism for resolving intra–elite conflicts peacefully, while simultaneously ascertaining the supremacy of the demos over elites; it also broke policy impasses. It was an important fixture of the institutional landscape of ancient Athens. Yet, contrary to other elements of the Athenian democracy, there is no formal analysis of its characteristics in the contemporary collective choice literature. The present paper aims to fill this gap by looking at the use of ostracism through the lens of rational choice theory, thereby adding to political economy research on historical societiesFootnote 2 and to the rational choice literature on non-traditional legal institutions (see, for example, Becker and Stigler 1974; Leeson 2007; Leeson and Coyne 2012). It focuses on two issues. First, considering Cleisthenes, the constitutional writer of the law of ostracism as a rational self–interested actor, the paper inquires into why he introduced ostracism as a method of resolving contests for political power among rival elites, instead of continuing the previous norm of violent conflict and mass exile. Second, it explores the equilibrium outcome of ostracism as a two-stage voting process wherein the decisive voter of the first stage may differ from that of the second. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the historical background of the introduction of ostracism and the procedures followed when applied; it then reviews the ten attested ostracisms and surveys various modern interpretations of ostracism. Section 3 examines ostracism as the utility maximising choice of the constitution’s writer at the time of its introduction. Section 4 presents a two-stage game theoretic model of ostracism and discusses the intuition gained by studying its equilibrium. It attributes the moderate application of the procedure to the utility maximising choice of the decisive voter of the first stage rather than appealing to any normative or ideological principles. Section 5 concludes.",13

He was a great sports fan as well as a great sports analyst. For many years, he continued to play pickup basketball with graduate students. When I was a graduate student, I played basketball regularly with Bob, and when I came back a decade later as I was deciding to move back to George Mason University, I went and played ball with Bob over at the field house. I hadn’t played full court basketball in 10 years, but that day I did—it wasn’t pretty for me as I struggled to keep up. But our team stayed on the court through the lunch hour, and Bob still had his touch from range. Anyone who played basketball with Bob can tell you about his shooting prowess, but I want to point out something else about Bob on the court that I think reflects the way he did economics as well. Bob passed and picked away creating space for others to make their moves, and after he set a pick, he looked to get a pick for himself to get free for a shot. If you cut to the basket, he would hit you with the pass. He played the game correctly by always having his head up and looking for an opportunity for the team to score. The way he played basketball was simply a metaphor for the way he engaged in economic scholarship. Tollison operationalized public choice theory in the modern economics literature. He always had his head up, and he surveyed the field of economics and political economy the way a point guard sees the court. He used the great theoretical talents of Buchanan, Tullock and others by translating their insights into testable propositions, which he then examined with the tools of basic economic reasoning and statistical analysis. He passed off these insights to his students freely, and set them up beautifully so it was easy for them to “score” publications. And, when the time was right, he would take his own shot and hit the big game winner. He did this so often and so effortlessly that it is sometimes forgotten the number of game winners he actually hit in his career. In this short tribute I want to highlight what I consider to be three of Bob’s biggest game winners. In Sect. 2, I will talk about Bob’s contributions to the analysis of the rent-seeking society. Section 3 will discuss Bob’s contributions to the political economy of reforming the rent-seeking society. Section 4 will move to Bob’s contribution to the study of sports as the “school of rules.” Section 5 will conclude by stressing Bob’s role in translating wisdoms and insights into scientific propositions and how, in his role as a mentor and editor, his contributions were fundamental for the development of public choice analysis in the economics profession.",

Congleton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Robert Tollison was a remarkably productive man, combining careers as scholar, public servant, mentor, and economic consultant in a manner that he made look easy. He was nearly always informal, relaxed, and easygoing. Together with his modesty, this made his accomplishments easy to overlook. In this short memorial piece, I provide a brief overview of his contributions to social science, which were substantial and mutlidimensional. As a first step, it is useful to reflect on Tollison’s scholarly output. His curriculum vitae lists 13 books, 22 edited collections, and seven editions of a two-volume principles of economics textbook. It lists 240 papers in economic journals, 43 notes in similar journals, and 177 book chapters. About 20 of his papers and notes appear in the top-five general interest journals in economics.Footnote 1 The breadth of his research is extraordinary, spanning public choice, public finance, industrial organization, law and economics, history of economic thought, the economics of religion, the economics of sports, and also includes pieces on language, animal rights, coauthorship, and polygamy. To be fair to his coauthors, of which I am one, nearly all his papers are coauthored, which contributed to the breadth and depth of his research program. Nonetheless, even divided by two, Tollison’s body of work is among the largest in economics.Footnote 2
 The breadth and depth of Tollison’s research resembles that of the major figures of the first generation of public choice scholars, who might be regarded as his role models: James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock and Mancur Olson. His model of man and general approach most closely resembles that of Gordon Tullock, but he focused on different research questions and included statistical results as well as insightful theories and historical narratives. If the impact of Tollison’s body of work is somewhat less than that of the Virginia school’s founders, it is not because it was less ambitious, creative, or well placed. There are two possible explanations. First, working in the shadow of Buchanan and Tullock caused his work to attract less attention. The founders were a very tough act to follow. Second, a good deal of his research is “politically incorrect,” in that it directly challenged conventional, noneconomic explanations of various phenomena in politics, economics, sports and religion. The next section provides a short overview of Tollison’s main contributions to public choice research, which include his methodological commitment to narrow self-interest models of man and to providing statistical evidence that supported the many novel implications of that characterization of human interests. The section on Tollison’s scholarship is followed by a few personal reflections on Bob the man and colleague.",

Crain,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"How does an idea—however harebrained—get transformed from a conversation across bathroom stalls onto the pages of an academic journal? Some ideas are weak and some are strong; at the stall talk stage this judgment is not obvious. When Tollison heard a new idea he always erred on the side of boyish enthusiasm. He made ideas fun, even serious subjects like constitutions, religion, or war. He made it seem like your idea was one of the most interesting he had ever heard. He had a way of making students and colleagues feel guilty for not following through. Rule #1: never let loose of an idea; assume that it is novel, interesting, and worthy of investigation. Tollison enjoyed discussing ideas up to a point. Ideas not written down, however, added little value if any at all. He once proposed to title a paper “Money Talks, Bulls**t Walks” (asterisks added). This is not a title one normally sees in academic journals. It reflects a disdain for economists and academics whose output mainly was talk, which he called “gab-enomics.” He lost patience with “gabfests.” “You should write that up.” His students and colleagues can hear those words even now. Many Tollison imitators have adopted that imperative sentence. Few of us can replicate his conviction. He meant it. Tollison liked the physical act of writing. He wrote like he was painting or playing an instrument, broad shoulders owning the desk, changing pen colors at a bridge or a chorus. His drafts on yellow legal pads are a glyph-like script that require practice to decipher. Robert Tollison’s work ethic is legendary. His days started early. He seemed to wake up while writing. He did not care much for conversation before unloading an explosion of words (glyphs) onto yellow paper. These work habits he shared with his mentor James M. Buchanan, except that Buchanan mostly typed. It surely was part of their mutual attraction for a half-century. Few were close to Tollison professionally who had not passed a work ethic screen. Lots of folks work hard. Something much more fundamental stands behind Robert’s Rule #3. It is the principle that a lack of self-discipline is the main barrier to knowledge creation. The discipline to write and keep writing is more important than academic pedigrees, brains, or anything else. Rule #3 offers a positive and hopeful message: anyone can engage in the knowledge creating society. The late William L. Breit once joked that he received a white paper from Tollison which had so many names on it that he thought it was a petition. Tollison did not think teamwork was a joke. He was an Alchian and Demsetz (1972) firm on steroids. He worked best with others. Many others. We tallied 524 Tollison co-authors between 1968 and 2009 (Crain and Crain 2010). Many of these were serial co-authors on multiple papers with Tollison, and the count increased after the analysis. Robert B. Ekelund, Jr., co-author of 15 books with Tollison, reports that another co-authored book is forthcoming. Rule #4 is that team production through co-authorship often facilitates productivity and competitive advantages in knowledge creation. The analysis in our 2010 paper finds that an additional co-author increased Tollison’s annual output of publications per co-author by 10%. When roadblocks inevitably occur or enthusiasm lags, bring on a co-author with a solution. Tollison’s calling to co-author was in part social. He relished bouncing around ideas with co-authors, in person or on the phone—preferably between 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM, and not during an ACC basketball game. (The late Charles K. Rowley had a habit of calling Tollison in the middle of Saturday games.) He found mischievous joy in surprising co-authors with a turn of phrase, new metrics, metaphors, and titles. Tollison loved metaphors. In the production of knowledge, he let journal editors and book publishers decide if an idea was good enough. He was influenced very little by what others in the profession thought. Negative comments rolled off his back easily as he forged ahead. Tollison was a fiercely competitive person. Critical feedback from rivals in the profession carried a potential conflict of interest. He was dismissive of critics who argued that quality and not quantity was paramount. Rule #5 champions a market-based approach to knowledge creation. Tollison typically distributed white papers for comments at the same time he submitted them to journals or book publishers. He rarely waited for feedback before submitting a paper formally. He paid attention to and appreciated feedback on his manuscripts, but he rarely would make revisions without some hint of interest from a journal editor. Rule #6 follows from a high rate of time preference. In the 20th Century, this usually meant a 1 day turnaround, unless the university’s mail room accommodated an afternoon pick up. Related to Rule #6, if an editor rejected a paper, Tollison would seldom make revisions. Rather, he would submit it to another journal as quickly as possible. He would not dwell on criticisms or consider revisions until he received a revise and resubmit offer from an editor. Tollison had his favorite journals and publishing houses. He routinely and optimistically started with these, sometimes successfully. His articles and books cracked all the top economics journals and presses. A corollary to Rule #8 is never under-sell a paper. Journal and book manuscript rejections are never easy to swallow, but Tollison never gave up on finding a home for a completed paper. He saw a large degree of randomness in the submission process—the luck of the draw in getting a sympathetic referee. Related to Rules #5 and #6, he assumed that referees might be rivals—unfavorable referee reports might be entry barriers, rather than quality controls.",

Dougan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"My introduction to Bob was as a student in the discussion section he led as a graduate teaching assistant for Principles of Macroeconomics (sic!). Our class met on Friday afternoons, but was well-attended despite that because of Bob’s classroom charisma. While I confess that I cannot recall his thoughts on the consumption function or price-level determination, I remember vividly his discussion of a theory of labor value called “inherent worth,” which at that time was being proposed as the morally correct standard for determining the wages of blue-collar workers on campus—although, perhaps tellingly, not the salaries of the faculty or administrators. Bob walked into class with a copy of the student newspaper, in which the issue was given extensive and impassioned coverage, and led us gently through the arguments on offer. He posed the key questions: What is inherent in humans? What are the meanings of “worth”? How might such a policy be implemented, and what are its likely consequences? But he left it to us to struggle to find sensible answers. In the span of only 50 min Bob had changed forever the way we would instinctively approach any policy issue. To generations of students Bob was inspirational. His ability to inspire graduate students can be inferred from the many influential papers he wrote with them, as well as from the many other outstanding papers they wrote on their own in subjects he had taught them. It could also be observed more directly in forums such as the workshop in public economics at Clemson, where time and again Bob showed an enviable ability to be both demanding and encouraging as students’ research projects developed from vague ideas to convincing tests of well-specified hypotheses grounded in solid economic theory. During his years at Clemson I learned that Bob was as inspirational to our undergraduates as he had been to me decades earlier. Bob was a campus legend whose classes always were full, particularly his course in public choice. Every student I ever encountered who had taken that class said the same thing: It was a transformative experience. Bob could explain deep and subtle points clearly, without oversimplifying them. He had a completely justified trust in his ability to teach anyone, without talking down to them. These skills are easy to observe and to describe, but their scarcity suggests that they are difficult to acquire. Bob showed that great achievements in research need not preclude greatness in the classroom.",

I just missed having Bob as a colleague, or rather boss, since he directed the Bureau of Economics, a job taken over by Dr. Wendy Gram by the time I arrived. But people still talked about him, not always fondly given his views and the goals of many professional bureaucrats. Later, in 1990, when I had moved from University of Texas to the University of North Carolina, I was able to visit George Mason, Bob’s home from 1984 through 1998, whenever I drove up to work with my frequent co-author Kevin Grier. One of the key institutions of the Economics Department at that time was the noon pick-up basketball game. I was no better at basketball than I was at discussing academic papers, but Bob was more tolerant of error on the court. To his credit (and as pointed out by Peter Boettke 2016), Bob himself didn’t make that many mistakes; in Pete’s words, “He had an amazingly accurate three-point shot.” One of the impressive things about Bob’s management style, when he was Director of the Center for Study of Public Choice (1984–1998), was his efficiency. He made fun of his own laziness (and almost everything else), but if you paid attention you noticed that things ran well. The programs of the Center all worked, the seminars were well attended and a sense of shared purpose was evident. You can say that that was because Buchanan, Tullock, Wagner, and the other luminaries of the Center all drove and supported those norms, and that’s certainly true. But I have learned—as a long-time administrator myself—that if an organization runs well the person directing it is fostering those good norms and helping them function in ways that may not be obvious. Bob’s restless energy was almost infinite, and he could have a conversation, watch television or do a crossword puzzle, and work on writing a (again, nearly always coauthored) paper, all at the same time. Bob’s loyalty to those on his team was legendary. He had a team mentality, and always wanted to share, as long as he was on the team, too. Bob was as proud of an assist as a score, though any time he was open he would put the ball up. But his loyalty extended to organizations, such as the books and journals he edited and the academic societies in which he participated. For me, this loyalty provided one of the key “assists” in my academic life. In 1996, I was trying hard to get a job at Duke University. Like many universities that see themselves (perhaps rightly) as exclusive, Duke had questions about my academic prominence and potential. But at the 1996 Public Choice meetings in Houston, Texas, Bob announced that I would follow him as President of the Society. To be fair, the constitution of the Public Choice Society was pretty simple: each outgoing president chooses his or her successor. The president is welcome to solicit advice, but does not need consent, from the membership of the Society or the Executive Board of former presidents, which serves as a kind of governing body. Bob felt that I deserved a chance to work on organizing the Society along more modern lines (his main goal was to have, for the first time, an on-line presence, with a web page, on-line paper submissions, and web-based registration for the meetings). He thought I could do that, and he felt that I had shown proper respect for the traditions of the “Virginia School” approach to Public Choice. So, over the (in many ways justified; I was an Associate Professor!) objections from other members and deserving candidates, I was named president. At the reception that year, one angry member demanded, “How could someone like you get power in this organization?” (As far as I know, the 1996 meetings were the last time that worthy attended.) I’d like to think my presidency, and subsequent events, have vindicated Bob’s choice. We developed a web site, and an on-line version of the program, and a process for registering through the web site. But those later events, including my offer of a tenured position at Duke, all were partly a consequence of Bob’s choice, and Bob’s fierce loyalty. My career path would be completely different if it were not for Bob’s intervention and trust, and I owe him a great deal for that.",

Sauer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"I met Bob Tollison for the first time at the 1989 meetings of the Southern Economic Association in Orlando, Florida. I will always remember the moment. I was a young assistant professor at the time, and had read several of Bob’s papers in graduate school. Tollison was the Duncan Black Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University. It was a great night for me, as I had never been in the company of so many outstanding economists. As I was introduced to Tollison, he told me in his soft but steady voice, “It’s nice to meet you. I read your recent paper in the JPE (Sauer 1988). It’s a very good paper.” Cigars were lit and liquor flowed that night, but I was already on cloud nine. Thirteen years later he became my colleague in the Department of Economics at Clemson. Not long thereafter I was appointed as his “boss-man.” “Hey boss-man!” was his standard way of greeting me, even after I stepped down as department chair last year. He had kind words for me then, too, expressing a sincere appreciation that made the hassle of being chair worthwhile. Bob himself was no hassle at all. Affable and knowledgeable, kind but witty, it is hard to imagine a better colleague. Tollison was the ultimate WYSIWYG chaired professor, the J. Wilson Newman Professor of Managerial Economics in his last years at Clemson. A man of routine, he arrived early for work each day before classes began. His door was always open and his desk often was clear, with the exception of a daily crossword puzzle, or two. Bob was an aficionado of crossword puzzles, but he was happy to drop that mental exercise and give you his full attention when you walked in. I helped him to navigate the various university IT systems that are now foisted on us old-timers, with some success. But he was way ahead of me in one regard. In the age of email, I marveled at his empty inbox and vowed to achieve some semblance of that myself. He didn’t let small things clutter his mind. Bob was the favorite professor of many Clemson students, including two of my kids. There was always a waiting list to get into his undergraduate course in Public Choice, and he mentored students seeking to do research on sports or public choice. Several of these papers were published in an edition of this journal stemming from the Festschrift we held for Bob on the occasion of his 65th birthday (Shughart 2010). He advised scores of graduate students on their theses and dissertations: his final Ph.D. student received his doctorate last May, only months before his passing. He was a regular at the weekly departmental seminar and Public Economics workshops, occupying the same seat each time. He often had more knowledge of key facts surrounding an issue than the presenters themselves, and let everyone as well as the speaker in on that fact in his unpretentious manner. Bob was (singularly) the department’s social committee, seemingly in perpetuity. He and his wife Anna were our go-to hosts when Nobel Laureates and other dignitaries came to town; they always carried the occasion off with grace and class. They say that time flies when you are having fun, and we had loads of fun indeed. Sirrine Hall, the department’s campus home, is not the same without him.",

Rablen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The United Nations (UN) is the foremost international body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council (UNSC) is its most powerful organ, with the authority to make legally binding resolutions to fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and security. To that end, it can suspend economic and diplomatic relations between countries, impose blockades, and authorize the use of armed force. Our study appraises possible reforms to the UNSC’s collective choice processes. Since its beginnings in 1946, the UNSC has undergone reform only once: in 1963, the UN General Assembly (UNGA)—which includes delegates from all UN member countries—voted to expand the UNSC from 11 to 15 members (UNGA 1963).Footnote 1 Momentum for a second round of reform can be traced to 1993, when an Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) was established to explore proposals for UNSC reform.Footnote 2 This Working Group, now often dubbed the “Never-ending Working Group”, has entered its 24th consecutive year of deliberations. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first formal quantitative study of the equity and efficiency properties of a wide range of proposals that are under consideration by world leaders, having been put forward by a variety of actors within the UN. We apply new formal equity measures developed in Gould and Rablen (2016) to understand the effects of eight “structural reforms” contained within these proposals, as well as the separate effects of expanding the UNSC membership. A key aspect of the implementation is a computer simulation of UNSC membership under each structural reform. Under the present arrangements, the 15 UNSC members comprise five Permanent Members (PMs)—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States—that are ever-present and wield a veto on all non-procedural matters. The remaining ten members are elected Non-Permanent Members (NPMs), who serve time-limited 2-year terms. The ten NPM seats are divided between five regional caucusing groups: one country from Eastern Europe (EE); two countries from each of the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), the Latin America and Caribbean Group (GRULAC—el Grupo Latinoamericano y Caribeño) and Asia; and three countries from Africa.Footnote 3
 Two distinct sets of criticisms are widely levelled against these arrangements: one relating to the efficiency with which they allow the UNSC to respond to its member’s preferences, and another relating to the degree to which they achieve democratic equity in the allocation of power.Footnote 4
 On efficiency grounds, critics argue that the UNSC is too often impotent, not least because a preference against a resolution by a single PM can override a preference for the resolution by all remaining members. For instance, the UNSC is presently under criticism for its inability to respond decisively to the conflict in Syria. The UNSC also has appeared slow to react to earlier conflicts, notably the 1994 genocide in Rwanda (Barnett 2002). This lack of efficiency has sometimes led countries to bypass the UNSC in favor of alternative multilateral action, which is observed in the ongoing Syrian conflict and in previous conflicts. For instance, in 1999 NATO undertook military action in Kosovo, and in 2003 the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, on both occasions lacking a UNSC mandate. On democratic equity grounds, it is widely acknowledged that the UNSC needs to be seen as fair and legitimate in order to effectively fulfill its mandate (Frey and Stutzer 2006; Stutzer and Frey 2006; Marchetti 2008; Cowling et al. 2010). Critics (e.g., Russett et al. 1996; Hammer 2002; Schwartzberg 2003; Annan 2005; Blum 2005) raise two distinct sets of issues, one relating to equity at the country level, and the other relating to equity at the level of regions. Assessing these claims, the study of Gould and Rablen (2016) finds that, at the level of countries, the conjunction of preferential voting power when a member of the UNSC and the right to be ever-present gives the PMs substantially too much representation. There is thus a need to dilute the representation of the PMs. At the level of regions, the authors also uncover significant levels of inequity—Asia and Africa are both substantially underrepresented, while EE and the WEOG are both heavily overrepresented. This implies a broader representational imbalance between North (EE and the WEOG) and South (Africa, Asia and the GRULAC). We appraise eight proposed reforms to the UNSC’s rules (“structural” reforms) that appear within 11 recent reform proposals. We then analyze separately the impact of expanding the membership of the UNSC above the current 15 members through the addition of new NPM seats. We find disappointing results for the structural reforms considered: only one of the eight improve upon the status quo in both the equity and efficiency dimensions, one leaves efficiency unchanged and improves equity, five leave efficiency unchanged but worsen equity, and one strictly worsens both equity and efficiency. Enlarging the UNSC’s membership does permit an improvement in equity, but is no panacea, for it comes at the price of worsened efficiency. Moreover, the equity gains from expansion display diminishing returns, while the costs in terms of lost efficiency display increasing returns. Of the 11 reform proposals we consider (which typically bundle one or more structural reforms with some degree of membership expansion), we again find that only one is superior to the status quo in both the equity and efficiency dimensions. We show that a simple dominance criterion ranks all but three of the 11 reform proposals (by this criterion the remaining eight reforms may be disregarded). The most promising structural reform we consider is to require two PMs to vote against a resolution for a veto to be effective. This reform improves both equity and efficiency, but, like any proposal for reform of the UNSC, faces severe political constraints. Overall, we fail to see that any of the reform proposals presently under consideration will (or should) break the reform impasse. Earlier quantitative studies of UNSC reform include Volacu (2015), Hosli et al. (2011), Strand and Rapkin (2011), O’Neill (1996) and Kerby and Gøberler (1996). In the absence of a formal theoretical framework for measuring equity in such bodies, or for addressing issues relating to region- and country-specific notions of equity, these studies describe the implications of different reforms for the voting power of a PM relative to a NPM, often focusing on the ratio of these quantities. As equity in the UNSC is a function of how often countries gain membership as well as the voting rights they exercise when a member, however, approaches that focus on only one of these dimensions give only a partial view. This point is of particular relevance as several of the reforms we shall consider vary only the probabilities of UN membership, leaving voting rights unchanged. In capturing both of these dimensions, the theoretical framework of Gould and Rablen (2016) permits, for the first time, a formal quantitative assessment of the equitability of UNSC reforms for both individual countries and regions, and of how equity interacts with efficiency. As in Gould and Rablen (2016), we allow for countries to abstain in UNSC voting. In contrast, the studies cited above, and many precursors in the literature (e.g., Shapley and Shubik 1954; Straffin 1983, 1993), model the UNSC’s decision rule as permitting members to vote for or against a resolution only. As discussed in Felsenthal and Machover (1997) and Freixas and Zwicker (2003), however, the UNSC’s decision rule cannot be faithfully represented in this way. The difficulty is that the UN Charter states that decisions over non-procedural matters are made by an affirmative vote of nine or more UNSC members, including the concurring votes of the PMs. A “concurring” vote has come to be understood, in practice, as either an affirmative vote or an abstention (see, e.g., Blum 2005, p. 636), so a negative vote by a PM is distinct from an abstention. When ignoring the distinct role of abstention, a PM is calculated to be ten times as powerful as a NPM under the Banzhaf index of voting power, whereas, when properly accounting for abstention, a PM is only around twice as powerful. Last, in analyzing reform of the UNSC, this paper contributes to a wider literature that uses measures of a priori voting power to appraise reform options for international voting bodies. Examples include Felsenthal and Machover (2001, 2004, 2007) and Leech (2002a), who analyze reform of the Council of the European Union; Manno (1966), Newcombe et al. (1971) and Dixon (1983), who analyze reform of the UNGA; and Leech (2002b), Leech and Leech (2013) and Rapkin and Strand (2006), who analyze reform of the IMF’s Executive Board. The plan of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 sets out the theoretical framework; Sect. 3 outlines the structural reforms we consider, and their associated reform proposals; Sect. 4 details the simulation analysis; Sect. 5 presents the results; and Sect. 6 concludes.",6

It assumes that public officials maximize personal utility, and that they strive for office in light of that opportunity. There is also substantial experimental support (for an overview see Druckman et al. 2011). Public choice theory has also been interested in the exercise of public power by bureaucrats (see only Niskanen 1971; Tullock 1965), and by regulators in particular (e.g. Appelbaum and Katz 1987; Kohli and Singh 1999; McCormick and Tollison 2012; Peltzman 1976; Shughart and Thomas 2015; Shughart 2008; Shughart and Thomas 2017; Stigler 1971). In this paper, we make an experimental contribution to this literature, testing one of the cornerstones of regulatory politics. Many legal orders constrain regulatory agencies. Agencies may impose only an upper limit on price, and they may do so only at defined intervals of time. In our experiment, we test whether, from a behavioral perspective, such price cap regulation has a downside that one overlooks when assuming that regulators hold standard preferences. Specifically we wonder whether forcing regulators to decide under imperfect information, and preventing them from correcting their decisions if they turn out unwise, makes them overly cautious. When price cap regulation was invented, many observers thought that it was an ingenious solution to a thorny normative problem (Vogelsang 2002). If firms hold a monopoly, or at least a dominant position that is unlikely to erode—because the conditions for a natural monopoly are fulfilled, for instance—firms use their entrepreneurial skills to exploit consumers. As a consequence, some form of regulatory intervention is hard to avoid. Yet, for many reasons, government is a poor entrepreneur (Milgrom and Roberts 1992; for an early statement see von Hayek 1945; Zenger et al. 2011). Seemingly, price cap regulation cuts the Gordian knot. While the cap is in place, firms benefit from regulatory certainty. Under the umbrella of the current cap, they can engage in innovation and cut costs to their own benefit. They may be certain that the regulator will not deprive them of the benefit from their innovation by reducing the cap. Yet, a firm’s profit is not only a function of its own entrepreneurial activity. Exogenous influences, like shifts in demand, changes in the cost of raw materials, macroeconomic policy fluctuations, or legislative intervention that is unrelated to the regulated industry likewise can affect profitability. If the price cap is fixed by law, the regulator must (at least partly) respond to environmental changes behind a veil of ignorance. If the environment develops more favorably than expected, firms can gain rents. But if the environment develops less favorably than expected, firms may be forced to incur a loss, or may even have to exit the market. Regulators might be overly sensitive to this risk. Price cap regulation also deprives regulators of opportunities for learning. They may have misread the evidence in the first place; they may have underestimated or overestimated the reaction of the firm to their intervention; they may not try out interventions at an affordable cost for the firm and welfare. Knowing that they cannot fine-tune their intervention may also make regulators overly cautious. In the field, regulators have indeed been believed to be overly generous (Shughart 2008). Yet, observers have been tempted to explain generosity with regulatory capture: powerful firms have found ways to impose their will on regulators, to the detriment of society (Dal Bó 2006; Laffont and Tirole 1993; Stigler 1971). Firms may even team up with regulators in the interest of closing markets (Holcombe and Holcombe 1986). Regulation may also be an instrument to prevent the efficient relocation of an industry (Yandle 1983). One might also explain such findings with superior knowledge of firms that leaves them an information rent. Our experiment rules out all these explanations. In particular, we exclude any negotiations between the regulator and the firm and, a fortiori, corrupt side-payments. The experiment isolates a potential additional source of distortion: the excessive hesitation of regulators in the face of uncertainty about market conditions. In the field, this concern would be difficult, if not impossible, to study (for attempts at estimating the cost of regulation using field data see e.g. Posner 1975; Stigler and Friedland 1962; also see the surveys by Jordan 1972; Shughart and Thomas 2015). One cannot hold the volatility of the environment constant, nor the degree by which regulators are informed about this volatility. In the field, we could only compare industries before and after the introduction of price cap regulation. Moreover, such industries are not randomly selected. Frequently the set-up of an independent regulatory agency even coincides with the introduction of price cap regulation. In that case, even the comparison at the time before and after regulatory change is meaningless (Shughart 2008). In the interest of making the effect visible and, more importantly even, of having a chance to randomize and thereby cleanly to identify the effect, we go to the lab. In the lab, we can also exclude confounds by defining a perfectly homogeneous product, the quality of which is fully observed by the regulator. For this choice of method, we have to pay the usual price. While randomization guarantees internal validity, lab experiments always have limited external validity. One has to extrapolate from an artificially clean situation to a much more complex real-world context. Moreover, as is standard in the experimental literature, in our experiment regulators and firms are represented by students. In the field, obviously, both are heavily institutionalized and historically embedded corporate actors (Engel 2010). Arguably students have no professional experience in either trading or regulating. Yet, all of these qualifications also hold for the hundreds of lab experiments on competition (for an overview see the meta-study by Engel 2015). We nonetheless readily acknowledge the many limitations inevitably inherent in our method. We induce preferences. The only incentive given to firms is to maximize profit. We thus abstract from competing goals of management. Likewise, our regulators are induced to maximize welfare. They have no monetary incentive for any competing goal, like supporting government in the next election. Neither do we confine the regulators’ normative goal to consumer welfare, as one school of antitrust advocates. We treat firms and regulators as unitary actors. We thus abstract from the entire economic, legal, and political debate on corporate governance. We do not distinguish either between the legislator, government and regulatory agencies. We thus abstract from the microstructure of the political system. Most importantly, in the interest of isolating the behavioral effect of different information about volatility in the regulatory environment, we deliberately remove the expected advantage of price cap regulation that carries most weight in the policy debate: innovation. If our hypothesis holds true and regulators are overly generous, policy makers face a tradeoff: successful innovation has the potential to increase welfare; but if caps are systematically too generous, the welfare loss from monopoly power may be larger than expected. Given these limitations inherent in our set-up, we do not mean to make a recommendation about the overall desirability of price-cap regulation. All we want to contribute to the debate is evidence on one concern: price-cap regulation forces the regulator to fix a cap for an extended period of time despite uncertainty about the development of decision-relevant factors during the regulatory period. In our experiment, participants are randomly assigned the roles of a firm and a regulator. They stay together in the same group of two for the entire experiment. The firm holds a monopoly. The regulator has the power to impose a price cap. The firm earns her profit. The regulator earns a fraction of welfare. We first play the game one-shot. After a surprise restart, we repeat the game for announced 10 periods. Participants know that demand will change once during this phase. The firm learns demand every period, and may adjust her price. In the Baseline, the regulator has the same option. In the Upfront and Signal treatments, the regulator must intervene before she knows actual demand. In the Signal treatment, she receives a noisy signal. In the repeated game, this signal is true demand when introducing the cap, but the regulator does not know when and in which ways demand will change over the next 10 periods. After the end of the second part of the experiment, we have another surprise restart, keeping the original pairs of principal and agent in place. Again, within 10 periods one shock occurs, leading to another draw from the lottery of business opportunities. In the third phase, we expose regulators to the opposite of the regime they had been in before. If they were in the Upfront or in the Signal regime, they now are in the Baseline. If they were in the Baseline, they now are either in the Signal or in the Upfront regime. By this manipulation, we investigate the effects of regulatory reform. Qualitatively, standard theory is supported. The point predictions assuming standard preferences significantly explain the choices of regulators and firms. However, prices are considerably higher and consumer rent is considerably lower than predicted by theory. This is chiefly due to the fact that regulators set overly generous caps. Interestingly, caps are also too high if regulators are completely informed. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we relate our paper to the literature. In Sect. 3, we present the design of the experiment and develop hypotheses. Section 4 is the results section. Section 5 concludes with discussion.",3

They analyze a complete information setting wherein two groups of individuals, each preferring one of two alternatives, simultaneously choose between abstaining or voting for their preferred alternative. Voting is costly and the winner is decided by simple majority rule. Despite the simplicity of this pivotal-voter game, when solving for its equilibria technical difficulties and multiplicity issues arise. PR provide a partial characterization of these equilibria, some conjectures, and the analysis of two special cases.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, though PR’s work has been proven to be highly influential in recent decades, a complete characterization of the equilibria of their original game is still missing. The work of Nöldeke and Peña (2016)—henceforth, NP—uses Bernstein polynomials to characterize the equilibria under symmetric group sizes and symmetric probabilities of voting across groups.Footnote 2 In contrast, we allow the two groups of voters to be of different sizes and the voters in each group to vote with asymmetric probabilities, as initially proposed by PR. An equilibrium is a pair of voting probabilities that the individuals in each group follow such that no individual has a profitable deviation. NP confirm PR’s conjectures about “Totally Mixed” equilibria (i.e., equilibria at which all individuals vote with the same probability \(p\in (0,1)\)) in the symmetric setting, namely, that individuals face a cost-of-voting threshold with the following three properties. Below the threshold, no “Totally Mixed” equilibrium exists; at the threshold, a unique “Totally Mixed” equilibrium requires that everyone votes with a probability 0.5; and above the threshold, there exist exactly two “Totally Mixed” equilibria, one at which everyone votes with a probability less than 0.5 and one at which everyone votes with probability greater than 0.5. In the present paper, the two groups are assumed to differ in size. The main result is that for sufficiently low costs of voting, there is a unique “Partially Mixed” equilibrium where the individuals in the minority (i.e., the smaller group) vote with probability 1 and the individuals in the majority (i.e., the bigger group) vote with a probability \(p\in (0,1)\), which decreases in the size of the majority and increases in the size of the minority as well as in the cost of voting. This “Partially Mixed” equilibrium resembles the equilibrium of the pivotal-voter model with private information on the cost of voting—see Taylor and Yildirim (2010)—where members of the minority vote with a strictly greater probability than those of the majority do. This result is often called the “underdog effect.”Footnote 3 Thus, in the “Partially Mixed” equilibrium, on the one hand, the minority has a higher individual probability of voting, but, on the other hand, it is composed of fewer members. We shed light on that tradeoff by providing sufficient conditions for the minority’s preferred alternative to be more likely to win than that of the majority. The characterization of this equibrium as well as the equilibria of this model in general are of particular interest to experimental studies of voter turnout, since the theoretical predictions of the model have been tested against behavior observed in the lab. See, for instance, experimental work based on the PR model in Schram and Sonnemans (1996) and Palfrey and Pogorelskiy (forthcoming). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe PR’s original voter participation game. In Sect. 3 we analyze the equilibria, examining whether they entail pure strategies played by the individuals belonging to both groups (Sect. 3), one group only (Sect. 4), or no group (Sect. 5). Section 6 concludes.",4

In the absence of a well-functioning financial system, an economy will not reach its full potential. The development of a financial system, however, may be constrained by a number of factors. In the present study we focus on corruption as one such factor. Corruption is a form of rent seeking (Lambsdorff 2002; Rose-Ackerman 1999).Footnote 1 More specifically, corruption is “a special means by which private parties may seek to pursue their interests in the competition for preferential treatment. Just like other forms of rent-seeking, corruption represents a way to escape the invisible hand of the market and influence policies to one’s own advantage” (Lambsdorff 2002, p. 104). Rent seeking “is designed to describe behavior in an institutional setting where the individual efforts to maximize social value generate social waste rather than social surplus” (Buchanan 1980, p. 4). In the present study, we investigate whether corruption throws sand into or greases the wheels of financial sector development. Under the ‘sand the wheels’ hypothesis, corruption can be costly for economic activity (Mauro 1995; Rose-Ackerman 1999). In countries with weak institutions, private sector banks may not play a large role in the financial sector or, alternatively, may be crowded out by the government sector. This view is supported by La Porta et al. (2002), who found that government ownership of banks was more extensive in countries with interventionist, inefficient governments and those with weak institutions. Under such circumstances, government ownership of banks would imply that it is in a position to regulate finance and influence the allocation of funds to buy votes, receive bribes, receive insider information or influence supervision. That implication is supported by La Porta et al. (2002), who found that more extensive government ownership of banks was associated with greater political influence on lending. The government is in a position to channel funds to projects that are of political interest or influence private banks through excessive regulation, thus reducing economic efficiency (La Porta et al. 2002; Shleifer and Vishny 1994). Corruption can be costly for economic activity because corruption exhibits increasing returns to scale (Murphy et al. 1993). In other words, in highly corrupt societies, rent-seeking activities become more attractive than productive activities, causing the former to increase at a faster rate than output. Corruption thus leads to a redistribution of resources to rent seekers, with no corresponding benefits to the rest of society. Redistribution, in turn, causes credit to be channelled away from investors with the most productive investment opportunities to those with political connections. Thus, by distorting the allocation of resources, corruption can act as a disincentive to both investing and saving. Such disincentives can undermine the financial system’s decision-making processes by creating problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. To the degree that corruption encourages moral hazard and conflicts of interest, banks will lend to high-risk borrowers (Barth et al. 2004), causing the volume of non-performing loans to rise. Additionally, the uncertainty in financial contract enforcement, asymmetric information, lack of transparency and unclear property rights that a corrupt environment generates, can reduce financial sector efficiency by increasing transaction costs and widening the spread between lending and borrowing rates of interest. The highly restrictive environment under which corrupt regimes operate can further magnify problems associated with secrecy, lack of transparency and accountability because regulatory bodies fail to monitor financial activities. The lack of transparency diminishes the credibility of a financial system, reducing investor confidence and increasing market volatility (Williams and Beare 2003). Greater market volatility, in turn, reduces the incentive to save and invest. Under such conditions, state ownership of banks can lead to resource misallocations that are damaging to financial sector development. Therefore, if corruption exacerbates the adverse effects of regulation and state ownership, financial sector development will be lower in the presence of corruption. That is, corruption would ‘sand the wheels’ of financial sector development. The alternative view is that corruption ‘greases the wheels’ of economic activity. That would only hold true, however, in a second-best scenario, where governance structures are weak. According to the ‘grease the wheels’ literature, corruption can speed up economic activity under circumstances of weak governance structures and ineffective policy (Aidt 2009; Méon and Sekkat 2005). According to that hypothesis, if an inefficient bureaucrat is paid a bribe, the process of obtaining licences and permits could be speeded-up (Shleifer and Vishny 1993). Thus, if corruption acts as an ‘escape hatch’ in the presence of weak institutions, financial sector development will be more advanced in the presence of high levels of corruption; in other words, it would ‘grease the wheels’ of financial sector development. According to Leff (1964, p. 11), “Corruption provides the insurance that if the government decides to steam full speed in the wrong direction, all will not be lost.” Another efficiency enhancing argument in favor of corruption is that corruption avoids administrative delays acting as regulatory “speed money” (Bardhan 1997). Corruption also can improve financial sector efficiency by creating competition for limited government resources, leading to more efficient provision of financial services than would otherwise occur (Aidt 2003; Lambsdorff 2002). Therefore, in countries with weak institutions, corruption can have a positive effect on financial sector development by facilitating financial contract enforcement and permitting the circumvention of restrictive rules. Thus, if this alternative hypothesis holds, then the effect of corruption on financial sector activity would be conditional on governance structures (Méon and Sekkat 2005; Aidt 2009). Under such circumstances, extensive regulations and the state ownership of banks can in fact lead to financial sector development by speeding up administrative delays and helping avoid regulatory restrictions. Most studies show that corruption slows down economic activity. The social waste associated with rent seeking has been highlighted by Tullock (1967). According to Tullock (1967), even if transfers themselves do not result in a welfare cost, a large volume of real resources could be invested in making or preventing such transfers, which impose a large cost on society as a whole. Arguing along the same lines, Mauro (1995) observes that what is beneficial for the individual may be harmful for society as a whole. When a bribe is offered to an official, for example, although it benefits an individual favor-seeker, the exchange could lead to delay and excessive regulation until the bribe is paid, slowing down economic activity in general. Such an outcome is supported by Kaufmann and Wei (1999), who also conclude that even if an individual firm finds it optimal to bribe in a corrupt environment, it is not optimal for society as a whole. Tirole (1996) shows in an overlapping generation model that corruption can be passed on from one cohort to another. Even if corruption helps to ‘grease the wheels’ of economic activity in the short term, in the long term it provides incentives for the continuation of such practices. Aidt et al. (2008) and Aidt (2009) refer to the dangers of stating that corruption can be efficient when corrupt practices are created in the first place. Thus, according to them, despite efficiency enhancing arguments in favor of corruption, corruption moves us into a second-best world. It is therefore important to understand how corruption affects financial sector development in order to formulate policies to deal with it. Following from the theoretical arguments, we investigate whether corruption sands or greases the wheels of financial sector activity. We test for this in different ways which include: using dummy variables to capture different levels of corruption and interaction terms to ask if financial sector performance is conditional on governance structures. We explore a variety of empirical methods, including fixed effects estimation to account for country-level, time-invariant unobservable influences on financial sector development, and system GMM estimation to correct for any potential endogeneity bias. Given the uncertainty and likely errors in empirical measures of corruption, the robustness of the results is tested using two different corruption datasets: the Transparency International (TI) and the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG 2014) datasets. A number of variables measuring financial sector size and quality are drawn from the existing literature. They include the ratio of M2 to GDP, the ratio of liquid liabilities to GDP, the ratio of domestic private-sector credit availability to GDP, the interest rate spread and non-performing loans (as in King and Levine 1993; Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic 1996; Levine and Zervos 1998, among others). The study covers 106 countries over the 1996–2012 period. The rest of this study is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a short literature review of empirical studies. Section 3 presents the data, the model and estimation methodology. Section 4 discusses the empirical results and Section 5 concludes.",39

In addition, most EU member states use the method to allocate seats in the European Parliament elections (Poptcheva 2016). Jefferson–D’Hondt method’s bias in favor of larger parties is well known (see, e.g., Humphreys 1911; Huntington 1921, 1928, 1931; Morse et al. 1948; Rae 1967; Taagepera and Laakso 1980; Lijphart 1990; Benoit 2000; Balinski and Young 2001; Marshall et al. 2002; Pukelsheim 2014, 2017). Its magnitude has been estimated by, among others, Sainte-Laguë (1910), Pólya (1918a, b, 1919a, b), Schuster et al. (2003), Drton and Schwingenschlögl (2005), Pukelsheim (2014), and Janson (2014). However, though earlier research focused on a single-district scenario, the majority of countries employing the Jefferson–D’Hondt method allocate seats within each of their multiple electoral districts separately. In those countries, the political effects of the advantage provided by the Jefferson–D’Hondt method to larger parties can be assessed only on a national scale.Footnote 5 The Jefferson–D’Hondt method requires the vote shares of all parties in all districts to be known in order to obtain nationwide seat allocation results, and therefore cannot be applied if district-level results are unavailable, as in the case of national polls, or nonexistent, as in the case of counterfactuals. In this article, we propose a new formula for estimating those results solely from the nationwide electoral results and two fixed parameters: assembly size and the number of electoral districts. The estimated number of seats for the i-th party (\(s_{i}\)) is given by the “pot and ladle” formula: where \(p_{i}\) is the share of votes cast for that party (normalized after removing non-relevant parties), \(s\) is the total number of seats, \(c\) is the number of districts, and \(n\) is the number of “relevant” parties (see Sect. 2.2; note that it is a function of the vector of national vote shares and not an independent parameter). The formula is exact if the three underlying assumptions discussed also in Sect. 2.2 are fully satisfied, and it provides an approximation if they are satisfied only approximately, as is usually the case in real-life elections. We can think of the formula in terms of a potluck metaphor. First, all relevant parties receive their proportional shares, \(p_{i} s\). Each party also provides an identical contribution to the common bounty pot (\(c/2\), or half a seat per district). Then the pot is divided among the parties with the size of the bounty being proportional to each party’s ladle, namely its renormalized vote share (\(p_{i}\)).Footnote 6 Thus, small parties are disadvantaged, since they contribute more than they get back from the pot, while large parties receive a bonus. The formula makes clear that the size of the bonus depends not only on the size of the ladle, but also on the size of the bounty pot (\(cn/2\)). That is, in fact, the basic mechanism the formula reveals: the bonus created by the Jefferson–D’Hondt system is a function of both the number of districts and of the number of parties. We illustrate the working of the formula with the results of the most recent Polish general election (Table 1), showing how the bonus helped the winning party in attaining the majority. Scholars traditionally have thought of electoral systems in terms of seat shares\(\left( {q_{i} \text{ := }s_{i} /s} \right)\), which are more suitable for international comparisons. The seat share formula, obtained by transforming the “pot and ladle” formula above, is more conveniently expressed in terms of the mean district magnitude \((m\text{ := }s/c)\):Footnote 7 The difference between the seat share and the vote share is the bias for the i-th party (\(\Delta_{i} \text{ := }q_{i} - p_{i}\)), given by the following seat bias formula: Since the sign of the bias is determined by the difference between the party’s vote share and the mean vote share (\(1/n\)), it is evident that a party gains or loses from the Jefferson–D’Hondt method depending on its vote share being above or below the mean. The system is neutral (i.e., \(\Delta_{i} = 0\)) only towards those parties for which \(p_{i} = 1/n\). We discuss the mathematical background of the formula in a separate article (Flis et al. 2019). In the present article, we focus on the formula’s empirical accuracy and on its applications. The first application is primarily predictive. The Jefferson–D’Hondt method requires that district-level results be known, and as all divisor methods can be sensitive to small variations in vote shares, those results have to be known exactly. By contrast, our formula provides a surprisingly good prediction of the nationwide seat allocation (with accuracy within 1.5% of the national seat total for more than 94.2% of parties in the nine countries for which data are analyzed), while requiring that only aggregate party vote shares be known. Hence, it can be used to model seat allocation accurately on the basis of opinion polls, exit polls and preliminary election results, when aggregate vote shares usually are all that is known.Footnote 8 Second, because the “pot and ladle” formula does not depend on the precise vote shares of other parties, it can be used to model the effects of vote swings, political strategies (e.g., party consolidation or fragmentation) and electoral engineering (such as changing the number of districts or introducing statutory thresholds) on particular or hypothetical parties without involving complicated models of voter preference distributions. Third, by providing a functional form of the relation between seats and votes, the formula explains the magnitude of the seat bias in terms of two explanatory variables: the number of relevant parties and the district magnitude. Such dependence cannot easily be seen when the Jefferson–D’Hondt apportionment algorithm is stated in its original form. While an empirical connection between the seat bias and the district magnitude has been recognized before, this article provides a firm theoretical basis for its existence. Fourth, the model can also be applied to detect gerrymandering in electoral systems employing the Jefferson–D’Hondt method. In fact, it generalizes and extends the McGhee-Stephanopoulos efficiency gap test (McGhee 2014; Stephanopoulos and McGhee 2015), currently one of the most prominent methods for detecting gerrymandering in two-party first-past-the-post (FPTP) systems, in three aspects: it allows for relaxation of a restrictive assumption that voter turnout is equal across all districts and it permits the test to be extended to multiparty systems, as well as to systems with multimember districts. In Sect. 2, we discuss the basic features and assumptions of the proposed formula and demonstrate how it fits into the earlier relevant literature. In Sect. 3, we analyze actual election data from nine European countries to demonstrate that the formula provides reasonably accurate estimates of actual seat allocations and, moreover, is quite robust to minor violations of the assumptions. In Sect. 4 we discuss how the formula can be applied to analyze electoral coalitions, spoiler effects, and electoral engineering. In Sect. 5 we briefly discuss future research directions, such as the formula’s application in detecting gerrymandering, and potential further corrective adjustments.",8

The demands for democracy in those countries made some observers declare Huntington’s (1996) argument on the incompatibility of Islam and democracy to be dead. Others dusted off Lipset’s (1959) classic modernization argument, pointing to high education levels and a large middle class in Tunisia, but voicing scepticism regarding prospects of democracy in poor Yemen and oil-producing Libya. But how much do we actually know about the determinants of democratization and democratic survival? Two decades before the Arab Spring, numerous long-lived autocracies were challenged in Sub-Saharan Africa and electoral democracies emerged (Bratton and van de Walle 1997). However, African countries were, according to prevalent political science theories, unlikely to democratize, with low incomes, resource-based economies, deep ethnic cleavages, and problematic colonial histories. Discrepancies between theoretical expectations and empirical events are not too surprising when considering the empirical literature on democracy. While consensus exists on some empirical relationships, studies often find weak or conflicting results despite plausible theoretical claims. For instance, several studies—using different model specifications, samples, and measures of democracy—yield divergent conclusions on whether income enhances democratization (Przeworski et al. 2000; Boix and Stokes 2003; Boix 2011). A key issue in the empirical literature on democracy is that theories often are tested without controlling for major alternative explanations (Gassebner et al. 2013). That problem is amplified by disagreements on how to measure democracy and that some determinants may have stable effects across time, whereas others operate only in specific time periods. With so many open questions concerning appropriate control variables, democracy measurement, and time period, it is critical to examine systematically how robust the results are across different specifications. Assessing robustness is not only important for literatures with mixed results, but also when consensus emerges. For the latter, verifications of findings and investigations of their boundaries and assumptions are crucial for scholars and policy-makers alike. In this paper, we build on the designs of Sala-i-Martin (1997) and Hegre and Sambanis (2006) to study the sensitivities of 67 proposed determinants of democracy. We estimate 2.7 million dynamic logit regressions on 171 countries with time series extending from 1960 to 2015. With this approach, we mainly make an empirical contribution to the theoretically rich literature on democratization. Yet, we also highlight how our analysis can have important theoretical implications for key debates. The study most closely related to ours is the extreme bounds analysis (EBA) by Gassebner et al. (2013), exploring 59 determinants of democratization and democratic survival using data from 1976 to 2002 for 165 countries.Footnote 1 Yet, our analysis is different from theirs in several important respects. What is most important, in addition to varying the control variable set, we gauge sensitivity using four prominent operationalizations of democracy and four different time periods. Our study also differs in its assessment and interpretation of results. In addition to investigating aggregate robustness across specifications, we scrutinize the problem of omitted variable bias–and the converse issue of post-treatment bias—by considering “facilitating” and “fatal” controls. When entered into the specifications, facilitating controls increase coefficient size and turn otherwise non-significant predictors statistically significant. In contrast, fatal controls attenuate coefficients and make otherwise significant predictors turn insignificant. By using this approach, we systematically can investigate how the inclusion or exclusion of theoretically motivated controls affect our empirical conclusions (Plümper and Traunmüller 2016). Furthermore, in order to reduce concerns about unobserved country-specific confounding, in an extension we use the approach from Mundlak (1978) to estimate between- and within-country effects. In addition to discussing the results of the sensitivity analysis as a whole, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by focusing on two high-profile debates, namely on (1) income and democratization/democratic survival (Przeworski et al. 2000; Boix and Stokes 2003) and (2) Islam and democratization (Huntington 1996; Hariri 2015). Our investigation provides important empirical insights with implications for theory development. First, many specifications yield no clear relationship between income and democratization. However, that non-finding is sensitive to the choice of democracy measure, the time period under study, and controlling for natural resources and industrialization, which we consider to be plausible facilitating controls. Moreover, the association between income and democratization is stronger when we consider within-country rather than between-country variation, using the Mundlak approach. Second, our results indicate that the strong relationship between income and democratic stability is to a large extent driven by between-country variation. In other words, while it is not clear that democratic countries become more stable as they grow richer, more well-to-do democracies are more stable than poor ones. Third, the aggregate results indicate that Islam impedes democratization, but we show that the relationship is sensitive to controlling for natural resources, education and level of democracy in the neighborhood (fatal controls). More generally, our results reveal far more robust determinants of democratization than of democratic survival. To mention a few robust results, democratic neighborhood and the global proportion of democracies positively influence democratization, while resource-rich regimes and countries with majoritarian systems are less likely to democratize. As Gassebner et al. (2013) do, we find that short-term economic growth is negatively related to democratization, but only for two of four democracy measures. Moreover, that negative relationship is stronger during the Cold War period and vanishes afterwards. Furthermore, political protests are associated with democratization. For democratic survival, the only truly robust factor—aside from income level—is a state bureaucracy that is law-abiding. In addition to those key results, we provide a template for democracy researchers to assess sensitivity in a comprehensive manner. The setup of our supplementary material reduces the threshold for researchers wanting systematically to assess sensitivity pertaining to control variable selection, sample time series, and democracy measurement. Yet, we caution against expectations that ours is a fully automated approach to drawing robust inferences—we are the first to acknowledge that our approach is a complement to, and not a substitute for, theory development and carefully constructed designs. We assess the relevance of control variable strategies in order to account for biases stemming from observable confounders, in addition to democracy measurement and sample time series. We also expand parts of the analysis to address country-specific characteristics and post-treatment bias. However, particular sources of bias remain, and researchers should keep them in mind when interpreting our results. Even with the extensive and carefully selected sets of control variables and our efforts to address unobserved country-specific unobservables, countries may still differ on other unobservable factors that affect regime type and several of our covariates. Reverse causality, namely that our covariates are affected by regime type or recent regime change is another potential source of bias. In other words, even the sets of robust correlations established in this paper need to be scrutinized further in terms of unobserved confounding and reverse causality before they can be accepted as estimates of causal effects. Unfortunately, addressing reverse causality by employing alternative designs such as instrumental variable (IV) regressions or (natural) experiments is beyond the scope of this study. With those caveats in mind, we remind that we are, in fact, dealing with several key sources of bias and uncertainty that turn out to substantially affect results across a wide variety of proposed determinants of democracy. In the following, we summarize the determinants of democracy briefly. Thereafter, we introduce the methodology, data and discuss limitations, before presenting the results.",11

Supreme values define lexicographically preferred objectives that are considered by believers to be absolutely true (Bernholz 2004). Adherents of such preferences seek to accomplish the first-ranked one by all possible means. That includes sacrificing the lives of others, in addition to their own. To support his thesis, Bernholz (2017) provides various examples of ideologies based on supreme values that have existed over the centuries, including national socialism in Germany, communism in Russia, and—what is most important for this paper—various organizations resting significantly upon fusions of political and religious authorities. An intriguing question relates to the extent to which the goals prioritized by supreme values can be achieved in a peaceful manner. One option is to reform the ideology in question so that less expansionary aims are laid down and consequently fewer demands are placed on believers. This can be driven either by the economic inefficiencies resulting from a given ideology, in which case the ideology will be undermined on economic grounds, or by a military threat from an opposing ideology (Bernholz 1995). In some instances, however, especially in cases involving religious beliefs, such revisions of ideology may not be feasible. That is because some values brook no compromise. An alternative strategy therefore would be to find means of achieving non-negotiable aims in ways that do not rely on force but are based on peaceful missionary work (Bernholz 2006). The latter option is the focus of this paper. We propose that one way in which religious movements can try to peacefully promote goals identified by their supreme values is to interpret them in a way that imposes on believers pro-social behavior (dedication to common good, charity, participation in social life) as a desirable action and rejects as unacceptable all forms of violence. Achieving such a result requires abandoning the rule that the end justifies the means. Put differently, that interpretation of supreme values assumes that good behavior (enabling achievement of supreme objectives) needs to be distinguished from bad behavior (undermining the accomplishing of those objectives). When believers have separable preferences over their behaviors, such an interpretation of supreme values should have transformative effects on people’s decisions and social relations. In particular, when confronted with the choice of whether or not to engage in activities promoting the common good, a believer will always take on those tasks regardless of the other choices he or she makes. That behavioral transformation, in turn, will be consistent with promoting supreme values in a peaceful manner by encouraging believers to contribute to the common good. Our argument builds on the Roman Catholic Church’s growing emphasis (especially in the twentieth century) on the active participation of laypersons in the Church’s mission of salvation. While the duty of every individual to proclaim the Gospel has been of key importance for Christians since the very beginning of Christianity, renewed and stronger emphasis was placed on the role of the lay faithful in the Church’s apostolate during the Second Vatican Council, which went beyond previous interpretations of the laypeople’s responsibilities. What is most important, given our focus, the Council explicitly affirmed that seeking the Kingdom of God requires that the lay faithful live the Christian life always in service to individuals and society, rejecting all that denies and compromises peace.Footnote 1 Such interpretation of the lay faithful’s obligations identifies pro-social behavior as desirable action and invites all Christians to achieve the Church’s supreme objective through civic engagement. Using data on Poland, we find that laypersons strive to fulfil that instruction: in municipalities that display stronger attachment to the Church (as measured by participation in Holy Communion and church attendance), we observe higher levels of civic engagement as measured by the number of non-governmental organizations NGOs.",5

Public expenditure is procyclical if it increases as national income increases and declines as national income declines. While circumstances exist in which procyclical expenditure can maximize a community’s welfare (Lane 2003), such circumstances are very specific and extremely unlikely (Halland and Bleaney 2011).Footnote 1 The growing consensus is that systematic changes in political pressures over the economic cycle are determinants of procyclical public expenditure. Lane and Tornell (1996) and Tornell and Lane (1999) refer to “voracity effects”. When “voracity effects” operate, political pressures to increase public spending are more intense in economic upturns than in economic downturns. In this paper, the first objective is to explore the question why are political pressures for increased public spending more intense in economic upturns? If income effects are positive, spending pressures are likely to strengthen as income increases, but when “voracity effects” operate additional factors must be considered. The proposition to be considered in Sect. 2 is that systematic changes in voter awareness (of fiscal policy) are relevant when explaining changes in the intensities of political pressures for more government spending. Empirical studies have indicated that donor governments’ provision of foreign aid is procyclical. Dabla-Norris et al. (2015) report that foreign aid flows are influenced positively by the output gap between the donor country and recipient countries. Gravier-Rymaszewska (2012) explored the effects of macroeconomic shocks on the supply of foreign aid from donor countries, reporting evidence that aid budgets fall when own revenues fall. By comparison, in this paper, the second objective is to test the proposition that systematic changes in voter awareness over the economic cycle influence changes in the intensity of political pressure (for more foreign aid) and the cyclicality of that budget item. In Sect. 2 the first question is whether it is possible to call on the public choice literature to predict systematic differences in voters’ awareness over time. Can we conclude that marked differences exist in voter awareness in “good times” and in “bad”? In economic upturns, voters are more likely to underestimate the effects of increases in taxation (Dell’Anno and Dollery 2014; Dell’Anno and Mourao 2011; Dollery and Worthington 2006; Oates 1988). In economic upturns, government revenue is increasing. New taxes need not be introduced, nor existing tax rates raised, to accommodate pressure for more public spending. Consequently, vote-maximizing governments have wider discretion to increase government expenditure. Governments find it easier to accommodate lobby groups knowing that voters are not aware of the tax implications of lobbying (Downs 1957). Governments also are able to exercise discretion in pursuing their own ideological goals if discretion means that their preferred spending on some programs exceeds the median voter’s preferred spending. When income is increasing and when the tax implications are not apparent, voters are sanguine about public expenditure. In economic downturns (as in any social crisis), the evidence is that voters are far more aware of government spending. Peacock and Wiseman (1961, p. xxiv) refer to the inspection effect. When a social crisis (e.g., a recession) is underway, voters may question whether the government has spent sufficiently on domestic government programs (e.g., healthcare, education). Given the foregoing dichotomy, the intention herein is to focus on the impact of changes in voter awareness of public spending (1) in upturns and (2) in downturns. The cyclicality of expenditure over the full economic cycle will reflect different experiences when the economy is expanding or contracting. In that way, the paper is the first (to our knowledge) to employ a methodology that focuses separately on different cyclicalities (in upturns and in downturns) to explain the overall cyclicality of expenditure. The paper is also the first to consider the likelihood that vote-maximizing governments respond strategically to “fiscal illusion” in economic upturns. To date, the literature on “fiscal illusion” in economic upturns has focused on its impact on the level of aggregate public expenditure. Here, the proposition is that, as vote-maximizing governments benefit from a systematic reduction in voter awareness, they are likely strategically to time increases in potentially “unpopular” expenditures during economic upturns. Does evidence exist of that strategy (if governments are under pressure to accommodate lobby groups to increase public expenditure beyond the preference of the median voter)?Footnote 2 Testable predictions are presented in Sect. 2 of the paper. Later sections present the data and empirical model employed to test the predictions. The intention is to test each of the predictions separately, but a further (and more demanding) question is whether the overall pattern of cyclicality (across budgets) is consistent with the pattern of cyclicality predicted in Sect. 2. While the paper focuses on the cyclicality of government spending, it also sheds insight on the broader issue of governance. How are governments likely to respond to evidence of greater or lesser “fiscal illusion”? How are they likely to respond in “good” times and in “bad”?",5

Unfortunately, his interdisciplinary, systemic approach and the Austro-Hungarian convergence on the socialist calculation debate are not explored sufficiently by public choice scholars or by political scientists and economists more generally. Leeson (2008, p. 3) already has underlined that “the close connection between the substance and development of several of Kornai’s ideas and those of Mises and Hayek are virtually unnoted.”Footnote 1 The present special issue tries to fill the gaps. In doing so, we start by asking: What is the specific contribution of the eminent economist Janos Kornai to our discipline? The present special issue demonstrates that no unique answer to that question is possible. However, despite the diversity of responses, they all converge on one point: Kornai contributes to our understanding of the consequences of an allegedly ‘omnipresent’ state. Historically speaking, such a politico-economic regime appeared in consequence of the last century’s two world wars, in which whole societies were mobilized to serve the state (Vahabi et al. 2020). War socialism was the basis of what later transformed into Soviet-type economies, essentially total mobilization of society’s resources during peacetime. As Lange (1958, p. 3) suggested, I think that, essentially, it [socialism] can be described as a sui-generis war economy. Such methods of war economy are not peculiar to socialism because they are also used in capitalist countries in war time. They were developed in the first and second World War. In capitalist countries similar methods were used during the war, namely, concentration of all resources on one basic purpose, which was the production of war material. 
Kornai (1992, pp. 11–12) described the socialist system as state control of the economy under the undivided power of the Communist Party. Other common labels were “actually existing socialism”, “centrally administered economy”, “centrally planned economy”, “command economy”, “state socialism”, and “Soviet-type system”. Many socialists do not consider that type of regime to be ‘true socialism’ as conceived by Karl Marx, but an ideal model of socialism never has been at the center of Kornai’s investigations. His main interest always has been the analysis of reality as it is and as it evolves. Kornai focuses on how socialism worked in practice. For Kornai, a social scientist should in the first place be a good observer. His Ph.D. thesis (Kornai 1957/1994) on Overcentralization in Economic Administration (translated into English a year after its publication) provides a salient application of his positive analytical tools. The book offered a systematic analysis of the Hungarian socialist enterprise in light industry (see Gregory 2019) instead of the more common doctrinal references to the “economic laws or tendencies” of an ideal type of socialist system. Over more than half a century, Kornai documented different aspects of the socialist system and its dynamics: its over-centralization, bureaucratic mode of coordination, sellers’ markets, semi-passivity of monetary policy, soft budget constraints and its related nominal and real inefficiencies (known as the Kornai effect), investment shortfalls, slack and urgency in fulfilling top-down plans. All of those concepts revealed the normal state of a socialist system as a shortage economy (Kornai 1980). Kornai contrasts a shortage economy to a surplus economy, depicting the latter as the normal state of capitalist system (Kornai 2013). In his eyes, economic systems are characterized by specific and chronic disequilibria (Kornai 1971). In that sense, his recommended methodology in comparative analysis of economic systems is to avoid Harold Demsetz’s (1969) ‘Nirvana fallacy’, i.e., comparisons of the reality of one economic system with an ideal type of another. “Marx after Kornai” is the title of Amartya Sen’s (2020) excellent contribution to this special issue. The title in itself goes beyond a paper: it is a call for a completely new research program involving rereading Marx in light of Kornai’s positive analysis of the whole socialist experience in Soviet-type economies. Sen aptly chooses Marx to understand Kornai better. Kornai may or may not agree what Sen sees as his commonalities and diverging points with Marx (see the exchange between Kornai and Sen on Marx in this issue), but Kornai has named Marx more than once as one of the four thinkers who influenced him the most. The other three were Hayek, Schumpeter and Tinbergen (Kornai 1972, p. ix). Later on, he replaced Tinbergen with Keynes as the fourth influential author on his own work (see Kornai 1992, p. xx, 2009, p. 982). It is hard to validate Keynes’s influence on Kornai. Although Kornai is one of the proponents of a disequilibrium school depicting capitalist system as a ‘surplus economy’, he does not accept the Keynesian notion of ‘aggregate demand’ (see Andreff 2020) and rejects shortage as a form of ‘repressed inflation’ (Kornai 1980, 1985b). In fact, Kornai’s filial relationship with the disequilibrium school is based on his adherence to the Marshallian equilibrium concept, which is consistent with a narrow range of disequilibria around a normal value (see Vahabi 1998, 2018). But Kornai’s version of disequilibrium is not related directly to the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand, explaining why all other strands of the disequilibrium school diverge from Kornai (see Laffont 1985). Furthermore, Kornai’s analysis of chronic unemployment in capitalist labor markets also is inspired primarily by Marx’s ‘reserve army of labor’ (Kornai 1980), and not by Keynes’s distinction between voluntary and involuntary unemployment. The influence of Schumpeter on Kornai’s theoretical framework is not extensive. It is clear that Kornai (2013) has mobilized Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ to underline the importance of innovation in capitalist systems and its absence from socialist systems. His line of argument has been developed by Huang and Xu (1999a, b), Xu et al. (2020). A few references to Schumpeter’s theory of entrepreneurial activities and their search for super-profits (conflated with rent seeking) in his recent works (Kornai 2016b) are not sufficient to grasp how Schumpeter influenced Kornai’s original theorizing. It is noteworthy that Kornai (2009, p. 981) traces back the origins of creative destruction to Marx and Engels rather than to Schumpeter. The influence of the last two monumental figures, namely Marx and Hayek, on Kornai’s thought is undeniable. Marx, however, has an even more significant place in Kornai’s personal and professional career: “If forced to name those who have influenced me most, I mention the names of Schumpeter, Keynes, and Hayek, but first on the list comes the name of Karl Marx” (Kornai 2009, p. 892). Kornai’s relationship with Marx not only was academic or analytical, but a matter of faith. He became a Marxist not because of his vast knowledge of Marx’s work, but because of his position as a Jew during the Second World War, when his father and brother were assassinated by German Fascists (Kornai 2006). He broke with Marx on the basis of ethical considerations, particularly when he became aware in 1956 that senior colleagues and old Communists had been arrested and tortured without committing any crime. Kornai’s (2020) own contribution to this special issue titled “1956 in Hungary: as I saw it then and as I see it now” provides a historical document about that revolution explaining the reasons Kornai abandoned Marxism and the Hungarian Communist Party. Loss of faith explains in part Kornai’s anti-Marxist position. However, the theoretical argument lying behind that stance is what Kornai calls Marx’s ‘intellectual responsibility’ for the historical reality of the socialist system. According to Kornai, the Soviet Union and other communist countries implemented two basic tenets of Marx’s line of thinking, namely the transformation of private property into state property and the replacement of markets by central planning, bureaucratic coordination and the command economy.Footnote 2 A third explanation is Marx’s treating ‘formal’, ‘bourgeois’ democracy, parliamentarianism, and legality as ‘illusory’. Based on those three considerations, Kornai argues that Marx bears ‘intellectual responsibility’ for realized socialist systems. Despite Kornai’s anti-Marxist position, he acknowledges Marx’s strong influence on his thought. The first major link between Kornai and Marx is the ‘system paradigm’: the view that does not isolate sections or coherent parts of society, namely the political, cultural and economic spheres, but focuses on the whole that emerges from the parts. That perspective has two implications for Kornai. First, he is a fervent advocate of interdisciplinary studies; he himself acts simultaneously as an economist, a political scientist, a sociologist, and a historian. In brief, he follows Marx as a comprehensive social scientist. The second implication is Marx’s influence on Kornai’s concept of ‘great systems’ (Vahabi 2018). Interpreting Marx, Kornai (1992) set out to clarify what is meant by a ‘great’ system. He summed up three major characteristics of any economic system: (1) political structure and related dominant political ideology; (2) property relationships; and (3) coordination mechanisms (the relative weights of market, bureaucratic, ethical, or other types of coordination mechanisms). In his recent paper on the system paradigm, Kornai (2016a, p. 549) acknowledges that what he calls a ‘great system’ is related to the neo-Marxist concept of social formation. He considers socialism to be a system or a constellation of the parts of an organic order with specific self-reproducing regularities. System coherence does not exclude disequilibrium, contradictions and dilemmas. The second major influence of Marx on Kornai’s ‘system paradigm’ is ‘contradictions and dilemmas’ (Kornai 1985a). According to Kornai, any economic system contains specific conflicts or contradictions. For example, the same process that guarantees full employment generates both shortages of labor and unemployment. The same mechanisms that ensure rapid economic growth in the short run (‘rush’ in Kornai’s 1972 terminology) will lead in the long term to shortages, frictions in adjusting labor supply to demand and, ultimately, impediments to growth. Those contradictions or conflicts do not arise from the faults of a particular manager, bad planning or a bad style of work: “The cause lies deeper than those, in the power structure of society and the form of ownership and institutional system in it” (Kornai 1985a, p. 3). ‘Dilemmas’ refer to the absence of a unique ‘optimal solution’ to contradictions. If you choose one thing, it will be good from a certain point of view, but from another it will be bad. If reality involves contradictions, a decision-maker inevitably must face dilemma. Kornai grasped much better the irreformability of the socialist system in the light of system-specific contradictions and dilemmas. In a second book on ‘contradictions and dilemmas’ (Kornai 1990a), Kornai revisited the Hungarian reform process in the 1980s without sharing the naïve vision of reformers who wished to combine the best of socialist ‘equity’ with the best of capitalist ‘efficiency’, as if institutional reform is like shopping in a supermarket and choosing the best items from each shelf. Market socialism built on a combination of preponderant state property and market coordination, which was emblematic of naïve reformers’ wishful thinking (Kornai 1986). As I have argued (Vahabi 2019), Kornai’s intellectual contribution was to formulate a revolutionary discourse emphasizing the sterility of socialist half-measures, cosmetic changes, and reform packages. His conclusion rested on two foundations: (1) the unity or what Kornai calls the ‘coherence’ of socialism as a system, and (2) rejection of market socialism as hopelessly confused. Accordingly, reforms would at best introduce inconsistencies, without solving socialism’s chronic problems. Moreover, the inconsistences of the half-measures would erode socialist systems, inevitably leading to revolution. Kornai was inspired by Marx in formulating the first underlining tenet of a revolutionary perspective for transforming the socialist system and by Hayek regarding the second one. We will review Kornai’s relationship with Hayek below. But to summarize Kornai’s complex relationships with Marx, it can be said at the cost of simplification that despite his anti-Marxism Kornai paradoxically continued to be a ‘Marxist’ in calling for the transformation of the socialist system. Hayek influenced Kornai’s thought in two major ways: understanding (1) market processes by critiquing market socialism and (2) the relationship between the market process and private property. That is not to suggest that Kornai has become an Austrian economist or that he copied Hayek. He formulated original theses on both issues, but his convergence with Austrian economics is undeniable. Kornai cannot be pigeonholed into any school of thought. Borrowing Engles’s ironical expression, Kornai (2009, p. 982) suggests that the elements of his thinking mingle in an ‘eclectic beggar’s soup’. One of the major elements of that eclectic soup is the Austro-Hungarian convergence on the socialist calculation debate (Vahabi 1995). In fact, Kornai’s concept of ‘soft budget constraint’ was a kind of ‘rediscovery’ of the Mises-Hayek position (Streissler 1991, p. 197) regarding the passivity of money under socialism and its inefficiency consequences, known as Kornai’s ‘double effects’ (real and monetary inefficiencies) (Vahabi 2001, pp. 171–176). It was through a critical appraisal of market socialism that Kornai reproached the purely Hayekian vision of market process and sided with Mises-Hayek (see Andreff 2020; Boettke and Candela 2020; Vahabi 2019). Kornai (1971) had rejected Walrasian general equilibrium as the basic model of Lange’s vision of market socialism. Interestingly, while mainstream economics never has accepted Kornai’s anti-equilibrium, his concept of soft budget constraint mobilized by the World Bank, the IMF and many other international institutions was integrated partially by game theorists into models of asymmetric information and credible commitments (Kornai et al. 2003). Kornai’s critical assessment of market socialism was not limited to Lange’s interpretation.Footnote 3 He broadened the scope of criticism to market socialism as a reform project in different countries based on a combination of preponderant state property and market coordination, especially in Hungary (the New Economic Mechanism implemented on January 1, 1968), Czechoslovakia (Ota Sik’s ‘socialism with human face’), Gorbatchev’s Perestroika and Chinese market socialism. The second convergence was on the issue of property rights, particularly the strong links between market coordination and private property. Kornai (1990b) formulated an ‘affinity thesis’, according to which the bureaucratic mode of coordination has a natural affinity for (strong linkage with) state property, while market coordination has a natural affinity for private property. By contrast, the linkage between ‘market coordination’ and state property is weak, meaning that one cannot rely on the market as a neutral instrument underpinning state property or socialism (see Mihályi and Szelényi 2020). Comparing Marx’s influence with Hayek’s on Kornai thought, it seems that Kornai was influenced by the former on the need for a revolutionary perspective on transforming the socialist system, while his vision of a capitalist system (notably the market process and private property) was inspired by Hayek. Considering Kornai’s original contributions as well as his two major sources of inspiration, Kornai’s thought cannot be pigeonholed into mainstream economics. However, his eclectic soup fed a whole generation of Marxist and non-Marxist economists in Hungary and the Eastern bloc about the main ideas, methods and assumptions of modern general equilibrium theory (GET). Those economists learned about GET through Kornai’s works. In that sense, Kornai largely served mainstream economics by forging a link between Eastern and Western economic thought. More recently, Kornai described his position in the following terms: “Nowadays, I like to characterize myself as having one foot in and one foot out of the mainstream” (Kornai 2006, p. 195). Although anti-equilibrium raises a direct challenge to mainstream economics, Kornai (1971, p. 4) is not wrong to say that he nevertheless had one foot in the orthodoxy: “I consider myself a mathematical economist; thus[,] my critical remarks come not from ‘outside’ but from’inside’ the circle. These remarks, therefore, may be regarded in many cases as self-criticism as well as criticism. It is my conviction that the further progress of economic theory will depend, if not exclusively, at least significantly, on the advances made in the field of mathematical economics. It is in this area that I hope my work can make a contribution.” Kornai’s contribution is immense and both mainstream and critical approaches would need him to enrich the way they understand the economic world.",5

Whereas in Economics of Shortage, he mentioned paternalism as the source of soft budget constraints, in his later, more complete contribution (written under conditions of freedom) The Socialist System: The Political Economy of Communism, he mentioned communist party rule as the source and pillar of the socialist economic system and its phenomena. When discussing the success of Chinese economic reforms, especially in comparison with the less spectacular economic reforms that took place in Central and Eastern Europe, Kornai emphasized the fundamental role of freedom and democracy that was absent in China despite the growth miracle.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, he never discussed why China did not become a democracy. Furthermore, the experience of China (but also Vietnam, Singapore or even Thailand) appears to challenge modernization theory (Lipset 1959; Przeworski and Limongi 1997) according to which countries tend to become, or remain, democracies as they develop economically. To put that puzzle in a perspective, we note that, according to Freedom House (1999), no single liberal democracy with universal suffrage existed in the world in 1900. By 2000, 120 of the world’s 192 nations were liberal democracies. Recent developments tend to suggest that it is far from clear whether worldwide convergence towards democracy will continue. Autocratic tendencies have appeared in democratic countries such as Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland, to name a few.Footnote 2 A key question is whether China, the biggest country in the world with miraculous growth over the last four decades, will evolve towards democracy. So far, to put it mildly, little evidence points in that direction. Reasons thus can be found for being skeptical that countries should all become democratic as they develop economically. Could modernization theories have overlooked slow-moving forces such as culture that may facilitate or hamper transition to democracy? Strikingly, although culture often is considered a bedrock of many social and economic processes, the role of culture in democratization largely has been ignored until now. In this paper, we present a simple formal model of democratization that includes the individualistic-collectivist dimension of culture. A key difference between those cultural types is that a collectivist culture creates stronger pressure towards conformity and stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation. We show that, starting from an initial situation of autocracy, a collectivist society is less likely to adopt a democratic regime than an individualistic society, irrespective of whether a collectivist culture may be more effective in overcoming collective action problems. In our model, collectivist societies often end up in equilibrium having a “good” autocracy, i.e., an autocracy that does not act in a predatory way toward its citizens because good autocracies tend not to be overthrown by collectivist societies, unlike those of individualistic societies. That outcome occurs because of the stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation in collectivist societies. Furthermore, if political institutions can influence culture over time, our central prediction continues to hold: collectivist societies are less likely to end up with democracy. Note that those results do not follow automatically from a congruence between individualistic values and democracy. Countries with individualistic cultures must still overcome collective action problems to transition from autocracy to democracy, which is a non-trivial barrier. Indeed, we do observe countries with relatively high individualism scores and low democracy scores (e.g., Morocco). Yet, a striking result of our model is that even if one assumes that the collective action problem is much more acute in individualistic societies, such societies are still more likely to end up with democracy over time than collectivist societies. We test the predictions of the model empirically, using the well-known Hofstede measure of individualism-collectivism. We find a strong and robust effect of individualism on average polity scores between 1980 and 2010. A one standard deviation increase in the individualism score is associated with as much as a four-point increase in polity scores, a large magnitude. That result holds even when we control for all of the variables that have been used in the literature on democratization, including measures of economic development. We also document evidence that countries with collectivist cultures experience autocratic breakdowns more frequently, suggesting less collective action failure in collectivist cultures. We do find strong evidence that in collectivist cultures, conditional on autocratic breakdown, transition to autocracy is more likely while in individualistic cultures, transition to democracy is more likely. While the main result is tested using the well-known polity data, those last results are tested using the new data on autocracies and autocratic transitions assembled by Geddes et al. (2014). Interestingly, other cultural variables, such as trust or other cultural dimensions constructed by Hofstede (2001)—power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, long-term orientation—do not have a significant or a robust effect on average polity scores, whereas the effect of individualism is very robust. Because two-way causality may exist between democracy and culture, we apply instrumental variables to study the effect of culture on democratization. The first instrumental variable is a measure of historical pathogen prevalence. That variable has been argued (see, e.g., Fincher et al. 2008; Murray and Schaller 2010) to have a direct effect on the choice of collectivist culture as stronger pathogen prevalence created better survival prospects for communities that adopted more collectivist values, imposing stronger limits on individualistic behavior, being less open to foreigners and placing strong emphasis on tradition and stability of social norms. The second instrumental variable is a measure of genetic distance between countries based on differences in cross-sectional frequencies of blood types. That instrument is adopted as a proxy for vertical cultural transmission from parents to children. Since the genetic pool evolves relatively slowly and it is unlikely that neutral genetic markers (e.g., blood types) changed since the industrial revolution, one can use genetic distance in terms of such markers to instrument cultural differences.Footnote 3 Because of the pitfalls related to cross-country regressions, we must be careful in interpreting the instrumental variable regression results as causal. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with culture playing an important role in transitions from autocracy to democracy as well as in transitions from autocracy to autocracy.",35

Socioeconomic systems, he argued, cannot be constructed from randomly or scientifically selected pieces, similar to customers in a supermarket, who are free to put into their shopping trolley whatever they find on the shelves. Structures like socialismFootnote 1 or capitalism are not made of separate building blocks fixed together with screws or mortar. Their interrelatedness is like a genetic program of procreation. All newborn cats are similar to each other, whether small or big. In the same way, all socialist (or capitalist) systems are somewhat similar to each other. In several later works, Kornai formulated the same idea as the “affinity thesis”,Footnote 2 according to which the bureaucratic model of coordination has a natural affinity for (strong linkage to) state-owned property, while market coordination has a natural affinity for private property. By contrast, the linkage between market coordination and state property is weak, meaning that one cannot use the market as a neutral instrument to promote state ownership.Footnote 3 The objective of the present paper, based partly on our new book (Szelenyi and Mihályi 2020b), is to further advance Kornai’s affinity thesis on the example of China, about which Kornai himself has published quite extensively and spoken often in interviews since 2014. Kornai’s initial position was that China was a capitalist dictatorship. The Communist Party was communist only in its name, he asserted; it was more nationalist or Confucian.Footnote 4 In the present paper, by contrast, we shall elaborate on Kornai’s more recent position (Kornai 2014, 2019a). China between 1978 and 2013 resembled non-electoral, authoritarian capitalist regimes like Russia, Iran, or the Gulf monarchies. Elections are held, but the political rulers manipulate the electoral system in many ways, so the outcome is not competitive. It is always the incumbent ruler who wins. Present-day China, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, is increasingly returning to communist, dictatorial practices. The regime retains and even extends governmental interference into markets and private property (which was substantial even in the earlier phases of the reform).Footnote 5 In the light of Kornai’s supermarket metaphor, such a system may become unsustainable. Whether it is untenable or not remains to be seen. Only history will tell, but Kornai’s theory predicts eventual failure. At the time of submitting the final manuscript of the present essay (May 2020), when the entire world is occupied with the fight against the coronavirus, such a “categorization game” is very relevant for the interpretation of President Xi’s “people’s war against the epidemic with the most comprehensive and rigorous measures”.Footnote 6",10
187.0,1.0,Public Choice,15 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00877-y,Is there a demand for autocracies in Europe? Comparing the attitudes of Hungarian and Italian university students toward liberal democratic values inspired by János Kornai,April 2021,Miklós Rosta,László Tóth,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Across Central and Eastern Europe, a new political system is emerging and becoming stabilized. It has variously been labeled as a hybrid regime (Bogaards 2009), an illiberal democracy (Zakaria 1997), competitive authoritarianism (Levitsky and Way 2010) and autocracy (Kornai 2016). Such transformations have been observed in Hungary (Ádám 2019; Kornai 2015, 2016) and other Central and Eastern European countries (Kapidžić 2020; Sata and Karolewski 2020), and similar tendencies have gained momentum even in Western Europe (Bernhard and Kriesi 2019). Kornai (2000) suggests that to understand such social transformations, we should focus on institutions—both formal and informal—and on the incentives of social actors. By employing Kornai’s approach, we aim to develop a deeper understanding of why autocracies have emerged and stabilized in Central and Eastern Europe while liberal democracies and the institutions that safeguard them have remained stable in other areas of the European Union. We contend that the incentives for individuals to act collectively, such as voting in elections or choosing a bundle of policy proposals, are strongly connected to the personal values that one accepts and defends. In line with Kornai's (2016) work, we define such newly developed autocracies as political systems in which multiparty elections are held regularly but are not necessarily fully free and certainly not fair. In autocracies, the main liberal rights (political and civic rights, horizontal accountability, and an electoral regime) are eliminated by those in power. Autocrats attack liberal democratic values to develop a system in which they can maintain power indefinitely.Footnote 1 Populism is a prevalent feature of autocracies (Rodrik 2018; Wintrobe 2018). In our approach, we focus on one of the points from Schmitter's (2019, p. 77) composite definition, which conceives of populism as a strategy of opportunistic leaders: “The core of that strategy is ‘opportunism’—the search for issues and appeals that are either ‘transversal’ (i.e., cut across those articulated by existing parties) or ‘nascent’ (i.e., are ignored or under-stated by existing parties)”. Populism falls into one of two general categories, right-wing or left-wing populism, based on the types of messages it sends to the electorate. Accordingly, we define right-wing populism as a strategy that cleaves society on cultural and ethnic grounds and left-wing populism as a strategy that cleaves society on economic grounds (Halmai 2019; Huber and Schimpf 2017; Mudde 2007; Rodrik 2018). The typical policy recommendations of each type of populism can be deduced from opportunistic behavior aimed at maximizing power, which is the ultimate goal of all populists. Both types are antagonistic to one or more values of liberal democracy (Zanotti and Rama 2020), which are considered by Kornai (2018) to be protected values.Footnote 2 Protected values are those by which citizens abide even when they would benefit from abandoning them; citizens will not accept any kind of trade-off regarding such values (Baron and Spranca 1997). Our hypothesis is the following: If the majority of Hungarian voters had adopted the same value system that Kornai does, in which liberal democratic values are a “top priority” (Kornai 2018, p. 62), then an “illiberal turn” (Rupnik 2012) could have not happened, since Hungarians would have rejected alternatives that diverge from those values. Wintrobe's (2018) model is a suitable theoretical starting point for our research since he shows how an autocracy can emerge from a liberal democratic political system.Footnote 3 He identifies three ways in which liberal democracy becomes self-enforcing: (1) strong democratic norms; (2) constitutional protections, regular elections and relative income equality; and (3) widespread social commitment to liberal democratic values. Looking at the recent trends in Central and Eastern Europe, the first two mechanisms have not been sufficient safeguards for liberal democracy. If the values of the people diverge from liberal democratic principles, then a democratically elected leader may offer policy proposals that are closer to the preferences of the majority, such as proposing the political repression of a specific disliked group. Such a process goes on to maximize the leader’s power. However, if the loyalty of the citizens shrinks when repression rises, then a strongman has no chance to build a full-fledged dictatorship. Nevertheless, if the power gained through such repression is greater than the loss in loyalty, then a stable autocracy can emerge. The turning point depends on society’s values regarding liberal democracy. It is a realistic assumption that a strongman who creates an autocracy is a populist leader, offering right-wing and/or left-wing values to voters. Whether his policies are characteristically left-wing or right-wing is determined by the values of the voters, which the strongman uses to indulge them opportunistically. To maximize her power, an autocratic leader formulates a mixture of policies based on left- and rightwing populist ideas (Ivaldi and Mazzoleni 2020). Contrary to Wintrobe (2018), we believe that most leaders who build up autocracies propose both cultural and economic populist policies to maximize their power, focusing only on what resonates in the hearts and minds of voters.",2

188.0,1.0,Public Choice,23 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-020-00797-3,Do fiscal rules constrain political budget cycles?,July 2021,Bram Gootjes,Jakob de Haan,Richard Jong-A-Pin,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The political budget cycle (PBC) literature focuses on election cycles in government spending, taxation and budget deficits. Early PBC models were based on the premise that incumbents manipulate fiscal policy in order to secure reelection and predicted that governments adopt expansionary fiscal policies before Election Day (Nordhaus 1975). More recent PBC models emphasize the role of temporary informational asymmetries regarding politicians’ competencies in explaining electoral cycles in fiscal policy. In those models, signaling competency is the driving force behind the PBC (see, for example, Shi and Svensson 2006).Footnote 1 Although the evidence is mixed, several studies report evidence for election effects in fiscal policy.Footnote 2 Recent research no longer assumes that all governments will behave in the same way, but asks under what circumstances a PBC is more likely to occur (de Haan and Klomp 2013). The more private benefits politicians gain when in power (i.e., larger rents from remaining in public office), the stronger are their incentives to influence voters’ perceptions prior to an election. Incumbents’ ability to manipulate government finances is shaped by a number of different constraints on their behavior.Footnote 3 Recently, Veiga et al. (2017) examined circumstances under which fiscal manipulation may occur, differentiating between several factors affecting the incentives of the incumbent to behave opportunistically, factors affecting the capacity of the opportunistic policies to yield additional votes,Footnote 4 and characteristics of political institutions, such as proportional versus majoritarian electoral rules. They find that the degree of media freedom is the most important conditioning factor for PBCs. When media freedom is weak, the electoral effect on budget deficits is strong. However, Veiga et al. (2017) do not consider whether fiscal rules, i.e., long-lasting constraints on fiscal policy in the form of numerical limits on budgetary aggregates (Schaechter et al. 2012), condition PBCs. It is likely that incumbents constrained by such rules will have a more difficult time increasing spending or cutting taxes before elections. As Alt and Rose (2007, p. 862) in their analysis of fiscal rules in US states write, “we should observe larger cycles in states without fiscal rules than in those with rules if these rules are effective in limiting politicians’ ability to run deficits and thus manipulate the timing of spending for electoral purposes.” And that indeed is what they find. In explaining the result, Alt and Rose refer to the signal-extraction problem faced by financial markets, i.e., how to discern the true state of affairs from the available information. Lowry and Alt (2001) argue that balanced budget requirements allow bond market participants to solve precisely such a signal-extraction problem, thereby making it easier for imperfectly informed bond market investors to distinguish between political officials who choose to comply with balanced budgets and those who do not. Alt and Rose (2007, p. 863) argue that “if politicians in states with no-carry rules run consecutive deficits, investors interpret their behavior as opportunism and respond sharply.” Fiscal rules therefore may narrow the government’s room for fiscal maneuvering, thereby limiting the incumbent’s capacity to behave opportunistically. On the other hand, strict fiscal rules may encourage incumbents to circumvent the rules, making use of creative accounting practices (Milesi-Ferretti 2004). Some evidence supports that view. For instance, focusing on member states of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Alt et al. (2014) report that governments running excessive budget deficits resort to ‘gimmickry’ instead of abiding by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), thereby (at least temporarily) avoiding policies that may be unpopular electorally.Footnote 5 By now, an extensive literature exists on fiscal rules, both covering factors driving their adoption and their consequences. For instance, using a large cross-section of countries, Altunbas and Thornton (2017) examine the economic, institutional and political characteristics of countries affecting the likelihood that a numerical rule will be adopted as part of a fiscal strategy to limit the level of public debt. As to their consequences, fiscal rules have been found to reduce macroeconomic volatility (Fatas and Mihov 2006), diminish the procyclicality of fiscal policy (Bergman and Hutchison 2015), reduce public debt (Azzimonti et al. 2016), lower budget deficits (Caselli and Reynaud 2019) and reduce the probability of experiencing sovereign debt crises (Asatryan et al. 2018).Footnote 6 Thus far, the question of whether fiscal rules affect the existence of election cycles in fiscal policy has received only scant attention in a cross-country context. Footnote 7 The only study of which we are aware is by Ademmer and Dreher (2016), who conclude that fiscal institutions only help to limit the sizes of PBCs in weak media environments. Their study, however, is confined to European Union (EU) countries. Using data for 77 (advanced and developing) democracies over the 1984–2015 period and the IMF’s database of fiscal rules (Schaechter et al. 2012), we ask whether fiscal rules prevent incumbent governments from using fiscal policy for reelection purposes. We do so by investigating the effect of the interaction between (the strength of) fiscal rules and the proximity of elections on the government budget balance. Our results suggest that strong fiscal rules constrain PBCs. That result potentially could be driven by EU member states because those countries adopted more stringent fiscal rules in the wake of the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis reveals that strong fiscal rules also limit opportunistic behavior during elections in non-EU countries. Other sensitivity analyses show that our results are remarkably robust against including media freedom and the level of government debt as explanatory variables. Furthermore, we find that fiscal rules have substantial effects in, amongst others, countries with fewer veto players, left-wing governments, established democracies, and more globalized economies. In addition, the effect of fiscal rules on PBCs seems to be stronger after the global financial crisis, reflecting post-crisis expansion in the number of countries adopting such rules. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data on which we rely, while Sect. 3 outlines our methodology and Sect. 4 presents the main results. Section 5 offers a robustness analysis; Sect. 6 concludes.",25

Walentek,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The world’s largest economy—the United States of America—has turned towards protectionist trade policies since Donald Trump took office as president (Ikenberry 2017; Irwin 2017; Norrlof 2018). By 2017, the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), put Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations on ice, and started to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which subsequently became the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs of between 20 and 50% on solar panels and washing machines, while tariffs on aluminum and steel imports were raised to 10% and 25%, respectively. In addition, President Trump repeatedly has announced an imminent increase of import tariffs on cars to 25%. Besides those general measures, China and the United States have engaged in a trade war, in which they repeatedly have raised import tariffs against one another. In January 2020, the two parties signed a preliminary agreement to moderate their dispute (the so-called Phase One Trade Agreement),Footnote 1 but currently (mid-February 2020), the different tariffs and counter-tariffs remain to be in place. Much of public choice literature concentrates on the domestic politics behind external trade policies and treats countries’ policymaking largely as independent of international politics. Based on the well-known argument that trade liberalization generally is welfare increasing, many scholars propose that protectionist measures result from rent-seeking by concentrated and well-organized interests (Damania et al. 2004; Lake and Linask 2015; Pecorino 1997; Aidt 1997). Principally concentrating on the trade policies of the United States, the literature further explores how factors like the rules of electoral competition (Baldwin and Magee 2000; DeVault 2013; Wagner and Plouffe 2019), political ideologies (Hoffman 2009; Nollen and Iglarsh 1990) or economic sensitivities (Arce et al. 2008; Nollen and Iglarsh 1990) determine the chances of protectionist interests’ success. In contrast, the diffusion literature has shown convincingly that countries do not choose their trade policies independently, but that they observe and influence each other. As a result, policies like trade liberalization can diffuse throughout the international system. Globalization and an open trading order have at least partly been a consequence of such a successful diffusion of liberal trade policies during the 1990s and 2000s (Meseguer 2009; Pitlik 2007; Simmons and Elkins 2004). Nowadays, the important question for the global trading order is whether protectionist trade policies can gain momentum similar to that of trade liberalization during the 1990s and 2000s. If that is the case, we could witness a new wave of protectionism that might shatter globalization at its core. In the following, we develop an evolutionary game theory model, demonstrating that global trade liberalization is not a stable equilibrium, and that it may indeed be followed by a wave of defection and protectionism. Our model of global trade cooperation necessarily abstracts from the domestic politics behind trade measures; consequently, it cannot explain why a country chooses a specific trade policy at a certain point in time. However, our model shall explain how such trade policies can survive and influence the global trading order within an international system wherein countries influence each other at least to some degree. Thus, we do not intend to offer an alternative to existing public choice models of domestic policymaking, but we aim to complement the debate by focusing on the global dynamics of international trade liberalization and protectionism. To analyze the stability of global trade cooperation against defectionist and protectionist trade policies, the article proceeds in five steps. First, we discuss the challenges of applying evolutionary game theory models from biology to issues of international politics. Second, we build an evolutionary game theory model of global trade cooperation that takes the economic asymmetries between countries into account and understands the evolutionary process as a diffusion of successful trade policies within the population of countries. Third, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different strategies in our model and present the results of computer simulations of it. Fourth, we discuss the limitations of our model and sketch issues for further research. Finally, the conclusion summarizes our findings. Within an additional online appendix, we present some robustness checks, which demonstrate that changes in the assumptions of our model do not change the results of the simulations in an unpredictable way.",6

Schulze,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Suicide missions are deadlier and make more news than ‘regular’ terror attacks; they allow attacking hard and more valuable targets as no escape route has to be planned (Berman and Latin 2005, 2008)—in short, they spread terror more effectively than any other form of terror. Yet, suicide missions demand the ultimate sacrifice from the attacker. What kinds of people engage in suicide missions? No consensus has emerged in the literature on the determinants of suicide missions.Footnote 1 Four explanations can be identified. The first approach investigates suicide terrorists’ potential personality disorders or social marginalization, the second focuses on the societal conditions that are conducive to suicide terror, such as oppression and humiliation by an external force, coupled with strong within-group solidarity. The third explanation posits that suicide terrorists are rational actors and models the conditions under which suicide may be an individually rational strategy, while the fourth explanation seeks to identify situations in which terrorist groups adopt suicide missions as a strategy for achieving their goals (more in Sect. 2 below). Except for the first line of investigation, the literature does not ask whether suicide terrorists are different from other radical militants; the first strand of (mostly psychological) literature has not arrived at consensus.Footnote 2 In particular, it remains moot whether or not suicide bombers are marginalized socially. The question we thus ask in the context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is: are suicide terrorists different from other, non-suicide militants in any observable way? The relevant reference group in our context is not the Palestinian population at large, which may feel grievances, anger and opposition to Israel’s statehood, but does not engage in terrorism; rather it is the set of individuals who likewise have been radicalized and who have joined an Islamist organization, thus fulfilling all of the criteria the literature identifies for suicide terrorists, but did not engage in suicide attacks. What makes suicide terrorists different from those who choose to be militants facing high risks of being killed, but still prefer to live? We rely on a dataset comprising 1596 deceased militants affiliated with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), 209 of whom are suicide terrorists, and investigate the extent to which observable characteristics differ between the subgroups of suicide and non-suicide militants. We compare a range of socioeconomic variables, such as education, age, economic status, marital status, and area of residence, finding significant differences. In particular, suicide terrorists are better educated and younger than non-suicide militants, and they are much less often married or have children; they are less likely to be unemployed and they are not more often poor than ‘regular’ militants. Moreover, while distinct differences emerge between Hamas and PIJ militants, the socioeconomic profiles of suicide terrorists are very similar for the two groups. Our paper speaks to the small literature on the socioeconomic characteristics of terrorists. Krueger and Malečkova (2003) analyze a sample of 129 deceased Hezbollah fighters and find that they are less likely to be poor and more likely to have been enrolled in secondary school than the pool from which they were drawn. Berrebi (2007) uses a sample of deceased Hamas and PIJ fighters, as we do; however, his sample size is 335, of whom 66 are suicide terrorists. Like Krueger and Malečkova, Berrebi reports that all terrorists as well as suicide terrorists are better educated and better off than the population at large (also in the respective age cohorts). Benmelech and Berrebi (2007) assemble a dataset of 148 Palestinian suicide terrorists and show that they too are better educated than the population at large. They also show that better educated and older suicide terrorists are assigned to attack harder targets and are more successful in killing people than others. None of those articles, however, explore the differences between suicide terrorists and other militants. Our contribution also is related to the political-economic literature on suicide terror, which focuses mainly on the strategic use of suicide attacks in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict (Pape 2003, 2005; Bloom 2004, 2005; Piazza 2008, 2018). Berman and Latin (2005, 2008) find that suicide terrorists attack hard targets and they argue that the club-goods’ model predicts that terror organizations providing social services and other club goods are particularly well-suited for organizing suicide attacks because they can prevent defection more effectively.Footnote 3 Basuchoudhary and Razzolini (2018) demonstrate how culture matters for keeping terror groups together. Piazza (2018) shows that suicide attacks are staged more often against hard targets, are more successful than other strategies and that foreign occupation as such is not the driver of suicide attacks. Filote et al. (2016) investigate whether religious cleavages give rise to more suicide attacks and find no evidence for that hypothesis. Lastly, Bemelech et al. (2012) find that suicide attacks in bad economic times are carried out by better educated, more mature, and more experienced terrorists, which may indicate that economic opportunity costs may matter even when considering the decision whether or not to participate in a suicide mission. To the extent that the literature has analyzed the characteristics of suicide terrorists, it has compared suicide terrorists exclusively to the population at large, in some specifications also corrected for different age and gender profiles. Such a comparison implicitly assumes that the relevant decision is between engaging in suicide missions and not engaging in terrorists’ causes at all. We argue that that choice is not the only and possibly not the most relevant alternative. Militants contemplating suicide missions already have been radicalized, are devout believers and are willing to fight—the obvious alternative would be to join the organization as ‘regular’, non-suicide militants. (Some suicide terrorists—mostly from Gaza—join suicide missions only after they have become ‘regular’ militants. For them, the obvious alternative would be to continue as a ‘regular’ militant). Which members of that group embark on suicide missions? That is the concern of the present paper and the novelty of our analysis. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we survey the relevant literature on suicide terrorism; next we present our dataset on deceased PIJ and Hamas militants, Sect. 4 presents the empirical model and the main results. Section 5 reports several robustness checks and some extensions. Section 6 concludes.",3

A major received answer to that question invokes the election’s outcome. Briefly put, the instrumental account of voting stipulates that rational voters cast their votes in order to render the election’s expected outcome as preferable as possible. Such instrumental analysis of voting has been employed successfully to explain a number of observed patterns, for instance concerning the expected number of parties in a given political system (Duverger 1959). However, the account also has some shortcomings. In particular, as Downs (1957) observed, it cannot satisfactorily answer why voters would participate in large scale elections at all.Footnote 1 A second framework fills that lacuna. Often, voting behavior is not guided by the election’s possible outcome. Rather, we may choose a certain option because we judge it ethically correct, attractive, fair, in line with our general political convictions, or simply to cohere with our values and preferences. In short, in the perspective of expressive voting, utility is derived directly from the act of expressing one’s preferences, rather than from any considerations about possible outcomes (Brams and Fishburn 1978, 2007; Brennan and Lomasky 1993). In the present paper, we explore some consequences of the expressive take on voting, mainly in relation to the phenomenon of abstentions. Within expressive voting, abstentions are not explained by the cost of voting. Rather, abstentions occur if an empty ballot is the best available expression of a voter’s preferences. We compare three voting systems, plurality rule, approval voting, and range voting, with respect to their propensity for creating high voter turnout. In what follows, we will build a formal model of expressive voting, within which we assume that voters’ preferences range over an agenda of issues. Parties then will be evaluated by their attitudes towards the different agenda items. A similar, topic-based perspective on voting has been assumed in two recent papers by Aragones et al. (2011) and Dean and Parikh (2011). Within our discussion, we make explicit how those frameworks fit within the current approach. The first of them, the paper by Aragones et al. (2011), is related to our theme of voter participation. It addresses the propensities for various voting systems to promote high turnouts among expressive voters. We are sympathetic to their general approach and adopt a similar underlying framework. However, we raise various criticisms of their conceptualization of approval voting and the resulting comparison of voting systems. Responding to that criticism, we offer an alternative conceptualization of approval voting and then use it to compare expected voter participation within different voting systems. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce our general model of expressive voting over an agenda consisting of various items. In Sect. 3, we then present Aragones et al. (2011)’s analysis of approval voting, before raising a criticism of that framework in Sect. 4. We then proceed to introduce our own conceptualization of voters’ behavior under three voting methods, plurality, approval and range voting (Sect. 5), and compare them with respect to expected voter turnouts (Sect. 6). All proofs and calculations are provided in the “Appendix”.",

Both preconditions are present in the case of natural disasters. Natural disasters may increase victims’ propensity to bribe public officials, as Hunt (2007) shows for Peruvian households.Footnote 1 Furthermore, taxpayer-financed disaster relief payments represent monetary windfalls (e.g., Leeson and Sobel 2008) that give groups and individuals opportunities to compete for shares of them, most likely resulting in more rent-seeking behavior and corruption (Brollo et al. 2013). In addition, natural disasters typically create emergency situations that generate a climate of non-accountability and moral hazard. “Crisis” enables bureaucrats and officials to engage in acts of corruption (Klitgaard 1988). Recent empirical research supplies evidence for the disaster-corruption relationship in the United States (Leeson and Sobel 2008), Vietnam (Nguyen 2017) and flood events in Bulgaria (Nikolova and Marinov 2017). The international analyses of Yamamura (2014), Escaleras and Register (2016), and Rahman et al. (2017) provide additional confirmation of those results for many countries. Droughts are underrepresented in the emerging strand of the relevant literature, although evidence exists that related research efforts could be fruitful. Acemoglu et al. (2018) provide a notable example illustrating how droughts challenge good governance, identifying a severe drought at the end of the nineteenth century as the critical juncture resulting in the rise of the Sicilian Mafia. Triggering social conflict between the socialist movement and landowners, that drought led to long-lasting negative impacts on state capacity in the affected region. Viewing corruption as a force antagonistic to good governance, anecdotal evidence of misused and distorted drought relief payments exists worldwide. In a historical survey of public drought policies in northeastern Brazil, Campos (2015) notes that the misuse of public resources has accompanied drought relief programs since the late eighteenth century. A prominent example of diverted disaster aid took place in 1974 during a severe drought in Mali. At that time, enormous sums of drought relief were misappropriated to erect villas for the ruling elite, while nearly 300,000 nomads were left destitute (Hope 2016). An important factor justifying an analysis of the effects of drought on corruption is the unique and complex characteristics of such hydrometeorological disasters. In particular, droughts differ from other natural disasters, such as floods, tropical cyclones and earthquakes, along three primary dimensions. First, as droughts generally arise as rainfall deficiencies caused by natural climate variability (Wilhite 2000), they are not confined to specific areas such as floodplains, coastal regions, storm tracks or fault zones (Svoboda and Fuchs 2017). Although they typically occur in more arid locations (Seager et al. 2007; Dai 2011), they are prevalent throughout the world (Carrao et al. 2016). Consequently, droughts usually affect considerably wider geographical areas than other hazardous events, meaning that a drought-induced threat of corruption could span a broad region. Second, the effects of drought related to water availability normally accumulate over a considerable time span and may linger for long periods after precipitation returns to normal levels. The effects of drought thus contrast starkly with the typically sudden onset and relatively short duration of other hazard types (Wilhite et al. 2014). Therefore, its economic, social and environmental impacts, and hence the disaster-related reasons for corruption, typically become more salient the longer a drought persists. Third, droughts mainly cause non-structural damage, e.g., crop or forest failures. Compared with structural damage such as destroyed buildings or communication lines, the negative effects of a drought are far more difficult to survey and quantify (Wilhite 2000). Therefore, it is much more difficult to monitor their alleviation, creating considerable opportunities for corrupt activities. Another aspect substantiating the relationship between droughts and corruption is that fact that the water sector is prone to corruption to begin with, especially in situations of scarce water availability (TPI 2008). Droughts raise the risk of corruption, particularly in the operation of channel irrigation systems. Irrigation research often informs technical solutions for irrigation systems, which are characterized by numerous manipulation possibilities under the guise of precise water allocation. However, such manipulation options translate into corruption opportunities (Rijsberman 2008; Wade 1982) Officials responsible for operating the gates may be bribed or request side payments for additional or prolonged opening, especially when farmers experience drought-related water shortages (Rijsberman 2008). For some regions of the world, the threat of drought-induced corruption is expected to become more prevalent in the future owing to changing climatic conditions. Although recent assessments of projected droughts differ substantially depending on the drought definition applied and the projection model, some consensus exists that drought duration and intensity tend to increase in southern Africa, central and southern Europe including the Mediterranean region, central North America, Central America and Mexico, and northeastern Brazil (Seneviratne et al. 2012). Against that background, we investigate whether droughts influence public sector corruption within a unified estimation approach on an unbalanced panel of 120 countries from 1985 to 2013. To analyze potential long-term consequences, we estimate the cumulative effects of droughts on corruption over long time horizons of up to 20 years. In order to avoid an over-controlling problem (Dell et al. 2014), we estimate a two-way fixed-effects model with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation (HAC)-corrected standard errors. Because droughts often extend over large geographic areas, we further correct our estimated standard errors for spatial autocorrelation. Our estimation results rely on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a truly exogenous drought index based on precipitation deficiencies. We show that high levels of drought exposure are followed by corresponding increases in public sector corruption. The effect holds true for subsamples of both developing and developed countries, although the timing and intensity may vary. After conducting a variety of stability tests, we find initial evidence for possible transmission paths of drought-induced corruption. The paper is organized as follows. The second section provides a review of the related literature. The third section explains the estimation strategy, and Sect. 4 describes the data used in our analysis. In Sect. 5, we present our estimation results and test their stability. In addition, we offer initial evidence on the transmission paths of drought-induced corruption. Lastly, Sect. 6 summarizes and concludes the paper.",6

Populist parties are on the rise in western democracies. Several studies provide some support for the view (expressed by Fukuyama quoted above) that economic globalization is one of the most important causes—but the evidence is not conclusive. For example, Swank and Betz (2003) studied 16 European countries from 1981 to 1998, and documented a positive association between economic openness and votes for right-wing populist parties where social spending is low, but a negative association where social spending is high. More recently, Autor et al. (2020) showed show that congressional districts exposed to larger increases in import penetration disproportionately removed moderate representatives from office, replacing them with more extreme candidates. Dippel et al. (2015) showed that trade integration with China and Eastern Europe increases support for extreme-right parties in Germany, identifying changes in manufacturing employment as a mechanism. Similar results for 15 Western European countries were presented by Colantone and Stanig (2018b), who showed that Chinese import shocks have strengthened support for nationalist and isolationist parties. In a related paper, the same authors (Colantone and Stanig 2018a) also showed that support for the Leave option in the Brexit referendum was larger in regions “hit harder” by economic globalization. It is not obvious, however, that results driven by Chinese import shocks can be generalized to a positive association between country level (economic) globalization and votes for populist parties. Commenting on Autor et al. (2020), Krugman (2016) noted that effects identified in the United States estimated for sectors with import-competing industries are unlikely to generalize even to the entire US economy. Chinese imports may well have raised wages and created employment elsewhere in the US economy, with potentially mitigating political consequences. In any case, globalization is a multidimensional process, and economic globalization entails more than trade with China. When discussing the evidence that globalization breeds populism, another factor worth mentioning is publication bias (Stanley 2005; Auspurg and Hinz 2011), such that studies finding insignificant effects of globalization on any outcome are less likely to be published. If researchers anticipate publication bias, any field of scholarship is likely to suffer from production bias, in the sense that papers reporting statistically significant findings are more likely to be written, completed and submitted (what Rosenthal (1979) called the file drawer problem). Both mechanisms suggest that previously published findings may give a biased view of how globalization and populism are associated. This paper relies on a newly released compilation of election results since 1980 for populist parties in 33 European countries (Heinö 2016) and the newly updated KOF index of globalization (Gygli et al. 2019) to examine the association between different types of globalization and votes for populist parties over the 1980–2017 period. If the commonplace judgment alluded to by Fukuyama is correct, the causal effects identified in previous research should generalize to a positive cross-country association between economic globalization and votes for populist parties. As we shall see, however, that is not the case. The absence of a country-level association between globalization and populism is robust to a large array of variations in methodologies and in the measurement of both globalization and populism. The paper proceeds by discussing in Sect. 2 the definition and measurement of populism, while Sect. 3 introduces the reader to some of the frequently mentioned theoretical reasons that globalization might reinforce populism. Section 4 describes the data and presents the empirical analysis, including several robustness tests (full regression output from those tests is available in an online appendix or from the authors). Section 5 concludes the paper.",17

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a downward spiral of financial institutions in desperate need of refinancing to avoid the same scenario. Policymakers responded, and in October 2008 drafted the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that would over the next year provide liquidity to distressed financial institutions. Total government spending under TARP was $372 billion (2.55% of US GDP). At the same time, in 2008 and 2009, lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions of TARP recipients increased significantly. Conventional wisdom would suggest a connection between TARP funds and lobbying and donations. The literature that links lobbying to the distribution of TARP funds (e.g.,  Duchin and Sosyura 2012; Igan, Mishra and Tressel 2012; Blau et al. 2013; Calomiris and Khan 2015; Blau 2017), mostly using some type of multivariate analysis, finds that more lobbying effort increased the probability of bailouts. Those conclusions, however, could be misleading because they are not robust to endogeneity issues like self-selection or omitted variable bias. None of the studies claim to have confirmed a causal relationship, meaning that any conclusion about a relationship between bailouts and political influence requires further scrutiny. Fortunately, that episode of US history provides an opportunity for a compelling research design that is able to address endogeneity issues and estimate the causal effect of political connections on the distribution of TARP funds, at least among its politically connected recipients. As the crisis was unfolding and politicians needed to make a succession of quick decisions on how to deal with the ostensibly illiquid banking system, the United States was in the midst of a national political campaign for the next president and seats in the new 111th Congress. That context, having a federal election right in the middle of the biggest banking panic since the 1930s, allows me to exploit close electoral races as sources of as-good-as-random assignment of politicians connected to TARP recipients, and helps answer the main question of interest, namely, did political connections matter in the distribution of TARP funds?
 Actual (black) and counterfactual (gray) inflation-adjusted lobbying spending of financial firms (y-values in millions of dollars). Counterfactual lobbying is the estimated size of lobbying expenditures had it not been for the crisis. It is estimated using simple exponential smoothing, according to Eq. 1 described in Sect. 4. The difference between actual and counterfactual lobbying in 2008 and 2009 is what is defined to be abnormal lobbying. The straight vertical line denotes the start of the bailout allocation process (October 28, 2008) Total number of financial services firms lobbying, peaking in 2009. The straight vertical line denotes the start of the bailout allocation process (October 28, 2008) Consider Figs. 1 and 2, showing a peak in industry lobbying and the number of financial firms that lobbied during the distribution of TARP funds in 2008 and 2009. The figures reveal that the upward trend of lobbying started several years before the crisis, raising doubt about the potential causal mechanism of 2008 and 2009 lobbying on bailout allocations suggested by conventional wisdom. Furthermore, large within-industry variation is obvious. Some firms lobbied and contributed to political campaigns more than others, some had stronger political connections, but some also were much more exposed to risk to begin with. Saying that firms lobbying more got more money from bailouts does not determine whether political connections actually caused better bailout deals. A large number of potential confounders could have affected the distribution of TARP funds, but had nothing to do with political connections, lobbying, or campaign financing. Therefore, any research that seeks to uncover the true causal implication underlying the possible relationship must solve two basic methodological problems. First, a self-selection problem—firms are more likely to lobby and donate to campaigns if they expect successful outcomes and a return of favor from the politician. Second, omitted variable bias may arise. The driver of the variation that increased lobbying spending and the likelihood of getting a bailout simultaneously could be banks’ risk exposures. Riskier firms lobby and donate more because they are more prone to risk, implying they also will have a greater chance of getting bailout funds. Exposure to risk, not political spending, thus could be the main explanation for bailout allocations.
 The central motivation of the present study is to eliminate all such potential alternative explanations and at the same time mitigate concerns about all other endogeneity issues affecting the relationship. Accordingly, the paper delivers two important contributions to the literature. First, it captures three potential sources of political influence. It examines the impact of financial firms that either lobbied the government in 2008 and 2009, made campaign donations in the 2008 election cycle, or whose upper-management executives held high-level positions in government at least five years prior to the crisis. All three types of political influence need to be accounted for in order to measure the full effect of political connections on the allocation decisions of the US Treasury and Congress, and to see whether those connections swayed more funds towards better-connected firms. Second, in order to verify the causal effect of political connections on bailout allocations and resolve the aforementioned endogeneity issues, I apply two methodological approaches based on natural experiment designs: a regression discontinuity (RD) approach and an instrumental variables (IV) approach. I look at the allocation of bailout funds to firms whose connected politicians lose a very close election (decided within a 1% margin of victory). Both empirical approaches draw randomization from the assumption that in such close races a random element such as luck is most likely to have tipped the outcome, meaning that bare winners and losers—and firms attached to them—are supposed to be statistically interchangeable. The sample consists only of firms that received TARP funds, separated into connected and unconnected firms, meaning that all of the estimated effects necessarily are local treatment effects. The general research question is whether political connections result in larger bailout packages for firms that received TARP funds. The RD and IV analyses are more specific. They restrict the sample to connected firms whose politicians won narrow elections. The RD estimation finds that a connected politician’s close electoral victory increased the bailout allocation for that politician’s connected firm by around 13%, on average. The IV approach adopts an instrument that is a variation of the RD version: instead of connected firms per politician, I look at the number of connected politicians winning close elections for each firm. The estimated effect is then the impact of one additional connected politician who won a close election on the size of bailout received. The IV approach finds that firms with more connected politicians who won closely contested elections received more TARP funds (the effect is a 19% increase in TARP funds for a one-standard-deviation increase, which is about 12 more connected politicians winning close elections). These are two different effects, but they both suggest a similar conclusion: being politically connected clearly made a difference in the allocation of TARP funds among those financial institutions who received them. The paper therefore is the first to examine political connections in the context of the 2008–2009 bailouts using close elections in order to draw stronger causal inference claims about their relationship. It differs from the existing literature in two other aspects. Studies looking into the relationship at hand typically examine all firms that were eligible to receive TARP funds, whereas the present paper focuses only on a narrow sample of statistically interchangeable recipients, comparing firms based on the electoral successes of their connected politicians. Finally, prior studies typically focus only on lobbying activities and, to a lesser extent, campaign spending as measures of political influence. This paper expands the definition of political influence to include three different forms of political connections: lobbying effort, campaign contributions, and direct personal connections between financial institution executives and legislators. That expanded definition enables me to capture more accurately different elements and patterns of political influence and to examine a wider implication of political connections on government funding allocations. The study thus aims to provide a blueprint for further research on political influence and the distribution of government funding, particularly during times of high-stress events or serious economic hardships. For example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments offered financial assistance to firms as ways of helping them survive the shock. A researcher looking to examine a potential impact of political connections on the allocation of such funds needs to find a good source of exogenous variation to test such a hypothesis. Any country that held elections during the allocation process would be a good place to start. The next section describes the context of the US financial crisis and the TARP allocation process. To understand the process fully, I relied on information from interviews with former employees of the Office of the Special Inspector General for the TARP, the US House Oversight Subcommittee on TARP, and the US Treasury. Section 3 describes the sources of data and defines all variables. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategies adopted to examine the relationship of interest and presents the results. The final section concludes by discussing the validity of the results obtained by two different methods.",4

190.0,1.0,Public Choice,22 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00918-6,Emergencies: on the misuse of government powers,January 2022,Christian Bjørnskov,Stefan Voigt,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Today, nine out of 10 national constitutions contain explicit emergency provisions. Declaring a state of emergency usually has two implications: (1) a shift in the balance of powers away from both the legislative and the judicial branches of government toward the executive branch; and (2) a reduction in citizens’ civil and political rights. Between 1985 and 2016, at least 137 countries declared a state of emergency (SOE) at least once. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 alone, 99 governments declared SOEs (Bjørnskov & Voigt, 2021). Although emergency provisions are common, it is amazing how little we know about the effectiveness of emergency constitutions. This paper is a first attempt to analyze their effectiveness. For simplicity, we refer to all constitutional provisions dealing with any type of emergency as a country’s ‘emergency constitution’. Our analysis is confined to the effectiveness of emergency constitutions enacted to deal with natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts or pandemics. We do so because natural disasters truly are exogenous events, yet their direct consequences and side effects depend on governmental policies and reactions. We ask whether differences found in various emergency constitutions have discernible effects on the number of people killed as a direct consequence of a natural disaster. Because individual rights are likely to suffer under an SOE, we also ask whether the maintenance of individual rights, policies and democracy differ based on the specific wordings of emergency constitutions. We are here concerned with the functionality of emergency constitutions: do certain aspects of emergency constitutions work as officially intended, in the sense that fewer people are killed in disasters? Or is a tradeoff evident in the sense that some constitutional provisions are associated with efficient disaster relief but simultaneously with a deterioration in the extent to which individual rights are being protected? The worst SOE scenario is that the chief executive is not only unable to minimize the loss of life in the wake of a natural disaster, but effectively curtails individual rights. Although such a possibility might appear unlikely, numerous examples attest to such an outcome being a real possibility. For example, when a hurricane battered the Dominican Republic in 1931, Rafael Trujillo not only declared martial law and imposed “emergency taxes” on all citizens, but he also exploited the natural disaster to turn his regime into one of the longest-lasting dictatorships in the history of Central America (Crassweller, 1966). Trujillo is far from unique; any number of Latin American presidents used emergency provisions in comparable ways. For example, Wright (2014) counts 292 decrees issued under SOEs by the presidents of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru between 2000 and 2010. The behavior of governments during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a plethora of examples of misused emergency provisions. Censoring freedom of expression is probably the most frequently reported misuse of power; beyond that several countries prorogued their legislative assemblies (e.g., Mauritius, Thailand and Serbia). Other countries suspended court operations (e.g., Bangladesh and Nigeria). When legislatures, judiciaries, or both, are prevented from monitoring the executive branch, the separation and balance of powers is threatened. In a few countries, military forces were marshalled to enforce governmental decrees (e.g., Iran, Malaysia and Denmark).Footnote 1 The perspective of political economy may help us make sense of such behavior, as disasters might allow self-serving governments to expand their powers.Footnote 2 Rather than exercising the additional powers granted to them under an SOE to save lives, the powers are taken advantage of to censor criticism. In one of the very few studies that examine the effects of emergency constitutions, Davenport (1996) asks if political repression exercised by a government can be predicted by the explicit mentioning of either martial law or SOE in a country’s constitution. He finds that the existence of what we term an ‘emergency constitution’ significantly lowers a government’s willingness to resort to political repression, thereby constraining governments even when they are under domestic pressure. Keith and Poe (2004) build on Davenport’s (1996) analysis and focus on how domestic turmoil impacts respect for physical integrity, i.e. basic human﻿, rights. Contrary to Davenport (1996), they find that emergency provisions imposing tighter constraints on the executive branch are associated with more human rights’ abuses. Despite those contradictory findings, Bjørnskov and Voigt (2020) report evidence that the specific details of an emergency constitution do influence governmental reactions to threats. We extend the scant literature in several ways. Davenport (1996) is interested only in whether an emergency constitution exists; we also are interested in whether it is implemented in actual practice. While his focus is on political repression, we consider other variables, such as the rule of law and democracy. Our analysis covers the post-Cold War era, beginning in 1990 and ending in 2011; our results are based on up to 1511 observations covering up to 122 countries. Because we focus on SOEs instigated by natural disasters, and because one purpose of an emergency constitution is to empower the chief executive to save human lives, we explore whether the varying details of emergency constitutions are correlated systematically with the number of people who are killed by a natural disaster. We control for the severity of the disaster by taking the number of people affected explicitly into account. We find that the more benefits an executive enjoys after having declared an SOE, the larger is the number of people killed. Furthermore, we find that basic human rights are likely to suffer more the easier it is for governments to declare an SOE, and that the effect is more pronounced the more serious is the disaster. Finally, autocracies (of any type) are significantly more likely to curtail empowerment rights (i.e., freedoms of movement, speech, religion and political participation) than parliamentary democracies. An interesting correlation exists between our empirical findings and the results of a recent study that examines the relationship between violations of democratic principles during the COVID-19 pandemic and a country’s public health performance. Maerz et al. (2020, p. 11) find that “pandemic-driven violations of democratic standards in the name of human life are unjustified and lack empirical merit.” Section 2 lays a foundation for the issue at hand and proposes two hypotheses dealing with the possible effects of declaring an SOE, one focusing on constraining the direct effects of natural disasters, the other dealing with potential human rights’ repercussions.

Investment has been found to be influenced by a host of fundamental economic variables such as tax rates (Djankov et al., 2010), tax complexity (Lawless, 2013), exchange rates (Froot & Stein, 1991; Udomkerdmongkol et al., 2009), market potential (Head & Mayer, 2004), and other spatial considerations (Blonigen et al., 2007). However, noneconomic factors also matter for investment decisions. For example, both Guiso et al (2008) and Georgarakos and Pasini (2011) find that low levels of trust are negatively associated with stock market participation. Relatedly, Dearmon and Grier (2011) show at the macro level that trust is important for human and physical capital accumulation. Following the seminal study of Wei (2000), many scholars have shown that corruption and metrics of institutional quality attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) (Bénassy-Quéré et al., 2007; Daude & Stein, 2007). Micro level evidence supports the same conclusion by finding that individuals having experience living with corrupt leaders tend to invest less (Beekman et al., 2013, 2014). Both the experience effect and the perception effect found in FDI studies can operate by generating an expectation that a given level of investment will yield a smaller return than it would in the absence of corruption, either through an “extra tax effect” or more generally through a fear of rent-seeking behaviour. The well-documented negative association between corruption and trust (Banerjee, 2016a; Gillanders & Neselevska, 2018; Seligson, 2002; Uslaner, 2004), combined with the above-mentioned results linking trust and investment, provides another mechanism through which corruption could disincentive economic activity. However, another mechanism that could explain, at least in part, the observed negative relationship between corruption and economic activity is the notion that people consider corruption to be distasteful per se. If economic agents incur a significant mental cost or disutility from (passive or active) engagement in corruption, then we would expect, all else equal, that the possibility of corruption will deter people from pursuing economically profitable activities. Our main contribution is to test that hypothesis. This paper asks if the distasteful nature of corruption reduces the extent to which people are willing to engage in transactions in which corruption is present. Our novel experimental design allows us to disentangle the effect of the simple presence of a cost from the effect of it being corrupt as opposed to honest. In our control treatment, investment is costless. Relative to that scenario, a treatment in which “public officials” could embezzle from invested funds was no more of a disincentive to investment than a treatment in which a computer levied administrative costs, although both cost treatments generated significant and sizable disincentives to investment. We therefore conclude that corruption was seen by our participants as just another cost of doing business. The multi-faceted links outlined above between levels of investment, welfare, trust and corruption further motivate the need for an experimental approach to studying the causal effect of corruption on investment behavior. Thus, we add value to the existing literature by showing that in our experimental setup, corruption, like any cost of doing business, causes investment to be lower. Our design also allows us to add to our understanding of how information about costly unethical behavior can change expectations, norms and behaviours. In particular, our exploration of the issue sheds light on how agents in a corrupt environment use information and the weights they assign to hard data as opposed to opinion. While a signal based on the subjective expectations of others has no statistically significant effect, we report some evidence suggesting that providing information on corruption experiences gleaned from earlier treatments actually increases investment. That information could influence investment decisions by changing investors’ expectations regarding the extent of embezzlement. We do not find any evidence to support that mechanism and suggest that the information on how people actually behave changes the descriptive norm and facilitates investment even in the face of corruption. Finally, we contribute to the experimental literature on corruption in general by |introducing a design wherein the amounts embezzled has a direct bearing on the returns to investment. Prior designs in the experimental corruption literature largely have focused on bribery and have aimed to identify the deterrent effect of monitoring and punishment suggested in the theoretical work of Becker (1968) (e.g., Abbink et al., 2002). Our finding of a no distaste effect reinforces the conclusion that deterrence policies based on monitoring and punishment are needed to curb corruption. We conducted the experiment in Kenya, as that country generally is perceived to be corrupt in a global sense but ranks only slightly below the average for sub-Saharan Africa according to Transparency International’s 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. The Kenyan venue allows us to conduct our experiment in a typical context in which corruption is salient. Moreover, Kenya is home to a renowned facility for behavioral and experimental economics. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We first present the hypotheses that motivated our experiment. We then outline our experimental design and describe the characteristics of our participants before presenting our results and discussing their limitations and implications.",2

Pension reforms, especially in the first pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financed public pillar of pension schemes, therefore will be unavoidable, but need to be backed by public acceptance and, ultimately, democratic support. Arguably, such support is stronger when pension reforms appear acceptable along two dimensions. First, the reforms need to balance the interests of the involved living, and possibly also yet unborn, generations, i.e., after a reform the pension system must still be seen as broadly inter-generationally fair.Footnote 1 Second, public pension systems usually are considered to be part of the broader public tax-transfer mechanism. Although controversial, the public and many politicians expect public pension systems to also redistribute intra-generationally, i.e., between different types of households of the same generation. Our paper aims at providing new insights into the second type of redistribution, i.e., the relevance of intra-generational redistribution and the effects that even minor parametric reforms might have on it. More specifically, intra-generational redistribution refers to situations in which pension policies, e.g., through child-rearing benefits, induce a more equal distribution of pension benefits than the distribution of previous own contributions to the pension system. We contribute to the existing literature in a threefold manner. First, we develop a novel global measure for intra-generational redistribution in PAYG pension schemes wherein redistribution results from specific pension policies applying to the acquisition of pension entitlements during work life.Footnote 2 Our index, which is reminiscent of the Suits index for tax progression (Suits, 1977), describes the actual policy design at any given point in time and can accentuate the effects of policy changes. It relates work-life contributions to the pension scheme and the resulting benefit entitlements to a benchmark, which rests on the ratio of two hypothetical benefit distributions resulting from idealized pension systems, one with flat benefits and one with earnings-proportional benefits. Second, we resolve several theoretical and empirical shortcomings of existing measures of intra-generational redistribution. Third, we apply our index to micro-level data from the German public pension system (Gesetzliche Rentenversicherung, GRV) and a recent reform of the childcare benefit provision in order to highlight the resulting and substantial effects. Our paper starts from the presumption that for rational individuals and voters, the evaluation of pension policies (which may affect intra-generational redistribution) depends on how these policies change the rate of return on their contributions to the PAYG pension system. Here, the link between one’s own contributions and benefits and whether it is more or less direct matters most. Let us consider two polar cases. In the first case of a Bismarckian pension system (cf. Casamatta et al., 2000a, 2000b; Cremer & Pestieau, 2003), benefits are earnings-related with full proportionality between earnings (and thus earnings-related contributions) during work life and paid-out pension benefits after retirement. The other polar case assumes no link at all between earnings and benefits, which typically is achieved by having flat benefits for each member of the pension scheme, regardless of one’s personal contributions or income tax payments (pension schemes of this type—so-called Beveridgean pension systems—often are tax-financed).Footnote 3 Most real-world pension schemes are somewhere in between those extremes. That is because of the observation that the majority of voters prefer some redistribution among members of the same generation even in traditional Bismarckian pension schemes. Table 1 provides an overview of non-earnings-related benefits in the German public pension system,Footnote 4 which was introduced by Reich Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1889 as the prototype Bismarckian pension system with a fully proportional earnings-benefit link. That link has weakened over time because of, among other things, benefits based on time spent child-rearing, when mothers receive benefits as if they were working, although they do not. Benefits of that type play a significant role in today’s German pension system. Previous studies (Börsch-Supan & Reil-Held, 2001; Krieger & Traub, 2008, 2011, 2013; Lefèbvre, 2007; Lefèbvre & Pestieau, 2006; OECD, 2013; Stöwhase, 2016) have proposed theoretical measures of intra-generational redistribution that—in one way or the other—make use of the idea of quantifying the share of non-earnings-related benefits in total benefits. However, those measures are difficult to apply empirically because of their restrictive assumptions.Footnote 5 Our novel measure of intra-generational redistribution in pension systems works in a similar direction but avoids the problems of existing measures. It does so by relating work-life pension contributions and benefit entitlements to a benchmark that rests on the ratio of idealized Beveridgean and Bismarckian benefit distributions. The construction of our measure follows broadly the construction of Lorenz curves and the Gini coefficient and resembles measures of inequality in tax systems, such as the Suits index (Suits, 1977). The method leads to a more general representation of intra-generational redistribution than do existing measures, which also facilitates empirical applications. This allows us to make use of a rich dataset on individual earnings histories of approximately 100,000 individual Germans, who progressed to retirement in 2007–2015, and to measure intra-generational redistribution in the GRV and test the robustness of our measure. To preview our main empirical findings, a recent reform of the childcare benefit provision, which became effective in 2014 and introduced additional benefits for a subgroup of German mothers, caused our index value to jump up for women, but not for men. Our findings suggest that the GRV fulfills the ideal of a Bismarckian pension system without intra-generational redistribution for men, while women benefit substantially from intra-generational redistribution. Our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses existing measures of intra-generational redistribution and their limitations. Furthermore, we derive our index in this section. The following Sect. 3 presents the empirical application of our index to the German pension system using micro-data on German retirees. Section 4 concludes.",1

Ensuing debates have often concentrated on the question of how much government intervention is necessary to guarantee sustainable exploitation, when formal property rights are not well defined, and cannot easily be created or monitored (Pigou 2013). As Demsetz (1974) argues, property rights will be created endogenously by the actual users when the benefits of developing and enforcing them exceed the costs, with or without the participation of government. Examples of extralegal governance are numerous and well documented in the relevant literature for a very diverse array of human activities (Radford 1945; Acheson 1988; Ostrom 1990; Benson 2006; Leeson 2007; Powell and Stringham 2009; Stewart 2009; Skarbek 2014). Following studies by Nazer (2004), Kaffine (2009), and Mixon (2014), this paper argues that the sport of surfing is an excellent application for studying open access resources in the context of formally absent property rights and little to no state intervention. Given the way that waves are ridden by surfers, the sport is best enjoyed with one rider on one wave. As rideable waves are in limited supply, though, it essentially converts surf breaks into a common pool resource problem that breeds substantial potential for (violent) conflict. Recently, the continuous growth of surfing has crowded many breaking waves, increasing the possibility for interactions of individuals in the water, but also making them much more anonymous and prone to rivalry (de Alessi 2009; Ponting and O’Brien 2015). One way to deal with the common pool problem of wave assignment, is the quite well-known phenomenon of surf localism. Essentially, localism is the territorial behavior of resident (or habitual) surfers over surf breaks (Usher and Gómez 2016), oftentimes through intimidation, the threat of violence, or sometimes the actual use of force against persons or property. For the purpose of this paper, territoriality excludes potential competitors from a common pool resource, wherein only group members are permitted access to entire breaks, or certain sections of it. Numerous examples of such exclusionary surf localism exist across the world, for example the infamous Lunada Bay in Palos Verdes Estates of Southern CaliforniaFootnote 1, Tamarin Bay on the island of Mauritius, or Rodiles in Northern Spain. The idea of shared wave ownership by certain groups might seem far fetched to non-surfers, but it is an ongoing source of friction in the sport, which also is subject to constant evolution. For instance, during the recent Covid-19 crisis, local surfers enforced municipal movement restrictions often, because they served their interests in reducing crowd pressure at local breaks.Footnote 2 An alternative way of accommodating crowds in the water is the surfer’s code, which sets informal rules and self-enforced regulations to avoid conflict in the water. The basics of the code are known by all regular surfers (Nazer 2004), consisting of a simple set of rules that assign wave priority, paddling paths to avoid collision, and condemn drop-ins when waves already have been rightfully claimed.Footnote 3 Taking turns and respecting local surf communities likewise are important extended aspects of the code, whereby local surfers automatically are favored by greater knowledge of wave conditions. If the rules are respected, the bottleneck problem of wave assignment can be managed quite efficiently, even when crowds are substantial (Nazer 2004). Ideally, organized local surfers can act as enforcers of universal surfing etiquette and that happens sometimes (Beaumont and Brown 2016). Unlike the exclusionary localism descibed above, the arrangement does permit visiting surfers to access other breaks, as long as rules are followed. Still, once local surfers overcome the barriers to group formation (Mixon 2018), they remain prone to falling prey to the logic of any state-like institution, namely effectively organizing violence creates incentives to practice predatory behavior towards non-organized individuals or groups (Skarbek 2016; Benson 2020). Following Smith (2002), the question of exercising strong localism or the surfer’s code to manage crowds thus is, one of exclusion versus collective rule-following. According to Boettke et al. (2015), spontaneously emerging institutions that exclude or govern ultimately reflect the preferences of local actors. Those preferences vary quite substantially across different cultures, though (Hofstede 2011). In that context, especially social trust (Putnam et al. 1993; Sønderskov 2011) and the tightness of cultural norms (Gelfand et al. 2006, 2011) have been identified as central elements that determine compliance or defection from informal rules. Alternatively, formalized and well-working legal systems theoretically could take on that role, potentially even crowding-in civic behavior over the long-run (Berggren and Jordahl 2006; Herreros and Criado 2008). As such, the functioning of institutions, either formal or informal, therefore should influence substantially how surf spots are governed by their users, determining whether exclusion actually is practiced by locals or not. A series of related studies by Kaffine (2009); Mixon (2014); Mixon and Caudill (2018); Mixon and Sankaran (2019) already have inquired empirically into the determinants of surf localism. Still, in neither case has the role of institutions that facilitate cooperation and conformity with norms, either formal or informal, been incorporated to date. The present paper does so, accounting explicitly for the fact that different property rights’ regimes reflect the relative costs and benefits of their creation (Demsetz 1974), but also the cultural preferences of those who enforce them in one way or another (Ostrom 1990). In doing so, the paper contributes to several strains of literature: First, it is related to recent studies of the relationship of customary law and state enforced law. Following Gutmann and Voigt (2020), given the importance of informal law in many societies, it is striking how little scholars actually know about its compatibility with the rule of law. The governance of surf breaks can be considered as a very good example of that relationship. Second, Powell and Stringham (2009) highlight how governments in many developing countries often are missing in action when it comes to protecting property rights. Still, many societies have found workable solutions to the ensuing problems; such decentralized, spontaneously emerging orders frequently may be more viable than externally funded state-building projects (Powell and Stringham 2009; Börzel and Risse 2016). The present paper studies how social order is established and how formal and informal rules contribute thereto. Third, the increase in surf tourism to many developing countries often sparks local conflicts over surf breaks that carry substantial potential for resort to violence (Nazer 2004; Ponting and O’Brien 2015; Usher and Gómez 2016). Uncovering the institutional foundations that undermine the viability of governing surf breaks in an efficient manner therefore also may make a substantive contribution to the successful resolution of such conflicts, facilitating sustainable exploitation of local breaks as a resource for surf tourism. By collecting and analyzing data from 750 surfing venues scattered over 10 different countries and some 29 regions on the European Atlantic coast, this study reports evidence that regional social trust reduces the probability of violent exclusion in an open access setting with scarce resources, while formal legal systems largely are irrelevant. The findings indicate further that the tightness-looseness axis of cultural norms interacts with resource quality to a substantial degree, while the relevance of social trust in preventing exclusionary localism increases with more resource scarcity. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews briefly the relevant literature on culture, institutions, and property rights, as well as related studies on surf localism. Section 3 describes the data and the different control variables. Section 4 describes the estimation procedures employed and comments on the empirical results, while Sect. 5 concludes.",3

For instance, Matteo Renzi was defeated in a referendum to amend some Italian constitutional provisions in December 2016. Moreover, the coalition of Italy's far-right populist party, led by Matteo Salvini, achieved a clear victory in the European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019 by obtaining more than 34% of the Italian vote. Although Norbert Hofer's nationalist/populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPOe) was defeated in the second round of Austria's presidential election, the FPOe has become a significant actor in Austrian politics, since its 46.7% vote share was its best national electoral performance to date. In France, despite its defeat in the May 2017 presidential election and loss to Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party (NRP) defeated President Emmanuel Macron's party coalition decisively in the May 2019 EP elections. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats (SD) also made significant gains in the 2018 general election, attracting approximately 18% of the Swedish vote. In Hungary, the nationalist Fidesz party led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán obtained nearly 53% of the votes in the EP elections in May 2019. Similarly, left-wing political populism has risen, e.g., the Syriza Party in Greece. Such electoral events show that populist attitudes in the EU have surfaced across the political spectrum. Because of those developments, this paper aims to understand the determinants of populist voting behavior in EU countries, as measured by the electoral shares of total populist, right-wing populist, and left-wing populist votes. Our panel dataset covers 24 EU countries from 1980 to 2020. Particular attention is paid to economic uncertainty, which is measured by the new World Uncertainty Index (WUI). Economic interests are assumed to be the leading driver of political preferences (Alesina & La Ferrara, 2005). Thus, various empirical studies have examined how economic conditions affect political views and voting behavior. Moreover, in the last decade, the literature has begun incorporating various economic uncertainty shocks (e.g., being unemployed or a significant decline in public revenues) to study voting behavior, likely owing to the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC). In traditional political economy theory, voters who have been adversely affected by economic downturns should demand more social protection and a significant increase in income redistribution (Rodrik, 2018a). However, the events discussed above suggest a significant increase in support for populist parties. According to Moffitt (2016) and Mudde and Kaltwasser (2017), populism is a political ""style"" rather than a set of policy proposals. Populist politicians claim to represent the ""true people"" against ""corrupt elites"" and to adhere to the concept of the ""will of the people"" rather than the ""will of the voters"". In other words, populists refer to ""the people"" as singular. That definition implies not only that anti-immigration policy proposals are populist but also that populism has a broader appeal. Additionally, populists tend to favor the more active implementation of simple majority rule, and liberal institutions are viewed as being obstacles to the will of the people. Rodrik (2018a, 2020) also defines populism as a political viewpoint claiming to represent the ""people's common interests."" For right-wing populists, those common interests include opposition to minorities and foreigners, while for left-wing populists, they include opposition to the interests of financial elites. Pastor and Veronesi (2021) define populism as a ""nationalist,"" ""anti-immigrant,"" and ""anti-elite"" political ideology based on voters' optimal responses to rising income inequality.Footnote 1 The definitions above imply that economic uncertainty shocks may help explain populist party voting. The existing literature suggests that major macroeconomic events, financial crises (e.g., the Great Depression of the 1930s and first half of the 1940s and the 2008–2009 GFC), and globalization shocks significantly influence people’s views on political parties and their voting behavior (Bartels, 2014; Kriesi et al., 2008). Theoretically, economic downturns promote populist voting.Footnote 2 The 2008–2009 GFC and the 2010–2011 European debt crisis (EDC) resulted in job losses and significant drops in pensions, subsidies, and transfer payments (Eichengreen, 2018). Economic downturns also trigger social controversy because voters believe that the ruling elites responsible for the crises are not suffering the consequences. Populist politicians argue that financial sector managers and corporate shareowners profit during prosperous times, while taxpayers finance bailouts for crisis-related losses. The GFC also strengthened support for the popular view that ruling elites protect their interests during such crises, while losses are borne by the ""common people"" (Rodrik, 2021). For example, Funke et al. (2016) relied on data from 1870 to 2014 to investigate the political consequences of economic crises. The authors found that economic crises typically lead to stronger political support for extreme right-wing parties. The effects of economic crises on right-wing populism were more significant empirically in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries during the post-2008–2009 GFC than in other countries, especially Western European ones. Various scholars have studied the effects of macroeconomic shocks on voting behavior.Footnote 3 However, economic downturns often are identified by entering simple dummy variables (pre-crisis versus post-crisis analysis) or regression-based event studies. For example, Golder (2016) argues that voters will turn against elites and limit the rights and benefits of immigrants and minorities ""due to the economic slowdown and rising household debts."" Our paper distinguishes economic uncertainty from the economic scarcity, grievances, and crises discussed by Golder (2016). We also control for several factors associated with the latter (economic growth, transfer payments, and unemployment); our measure of economic uncertainty remains the driver of populist voting. Another contribution of our study is that we consider a new uncertainty index, the WUI, which measures economic uncertainty across countries over time rather than confining it to a single event. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first in the literature to examine the impact of economic uncertainty on populist voting behavior across the EU. In doing so, we rely on multiple econometric estimation techniques, namely, fixed-effects, bias-corrected least squares dummy variable (LSDVC) estimator and instrumental variable (IV) estimations, to address potential endogeneity and reverse causality issues. We also enter various controls to address omitted variable bias. Finally, we run various robustness checks, e.g., excluding outliers. All of our analyses show that economic uncertainty increases populist voting behavior in EU countries. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical approaches and previous contributions to studying the effects of economic uncertainty on voting behavior. Section 3 explains the estimation procedures, empirical models, and data. Section 4 reports the empirical findings. Section 5 discusses the results of the robustness checks as well as some anecdotal evidence. Section 6 concludes the paper.",10

Shughart II,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The field of law and economics arguably was launched at the University of Chicago when Professor Aaron Director began insisting that his students study the organizations of specific industries and the business practices adopted by the firms within them “through the lens of price theory” (Posner, 1979, p. 928). Although Director himself did not publish his ideas very often (see, e.g., Director & Levi, 1956), he laid the foundations of the (“old”) Chicago School approach to antitrust policy that was carried forward in the work of eminent scholars such as George Stigler, Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner. Director’s “new learning” (Goldschmid et al., 1977) challenged the then-prevailing structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm, which saw rigid links between industry structure (the number and size distribution of the firms within it), conduct (business strategies and tactics), and performance (prices, profitability and their consequences for consumers’ welfare). That system of belief about industrial organization implied that monopoly and market power are ubiquitous, leading inexorably to outcomes inconsistent with the economists’ textbook model of “perfect” (or “pure”) competition (Demsetz, 1977). The divergence between theory and actual business practices led to the identification of myriad instances of “market failure”, justifying governmental intervention in the forms of corrective public regulation and antitrust law enforcement to restore or preserve competitive conditions. It was the Chicago School’s signal contribution to show that much of the behavior condemned by the law enforcement agencies and the courts prior to the 1980s as anticompetitive and, hence, meriting the imposition of criminal or civil penalties on law violators, was in fact consistent with the operations of vigorously competitive markets. The shift was most seismic in the theory and legal treatment of mergers of companies at successive stages of the supply chain and other so-called vertical restraints of trade (tie-in sales, commodity bundling, exclusive dealing, exclusive territories, minimum and maximum resale prices).Footnote 1 Chicago’s scholars and their intellectual progeny caused the law enforcement agencies and the courts eventually to begin treating many such business practices as subject to a rule of reason, thereby requiring careful analysis case by case, rather than holding them to be illegal per se and demanding little or no evidence of their actual competitive effects.Footnote 2 But the Chicago School had (and has) a blind spot (McChesney, 1991; McChesney & Shughart, 1995; Shughart, 1995).Footnote 3 In pioneering the theory of economic regulation (Stigler, 1971; Peltzman, 1976), which in turn relied heavily on the logic of collective action (Olson, 1965), Chicagoans explained why and how public regulatory agencies frequently are “captured” by the very firms and industries they are created to superintend. The antitrust laws and their enforcers nevertheless continue to be studied as if vague concepts of the “public’s interest” or the “general welfare” guide governmental interventions into private market exchanges.Footnote 4 Students of antitrust processes routinely fall victim to the “nirvana fallacy” (Demsetz, 1969), judging outcomes in messy real-world markets with unattainable hypothetical ideals. The standard interpretation of the purposes and effects of antitrust is wrong-headed, perhaps intellectually dishonest. A competitive marketplace is something of a pure (nonrival and nonexcludable) public good that delivers broad social benefits in the form of efficient resource allocation, i.e., prices aligned with production costs. Public-choice reasoning suggests that the interests of the public and private parties involved in the law enforcement process are much more parochial. Adopting that perspective demands, as a first principle, “closing the behavioral system” (Buchanan, 1972), that is, dropping the artless  assumption that actors in the public sector are motivated to advance the interests of others (the “public interest”) rather than advancing their own narrower goals. Commentators expressing unwarranted faith in the capacities of antitrust law enforcers to distinguish monopolizing from competitive behavior and, hence, to generate social welfare gains net of administrative and enforcement costs, studiously ignore the constellations of special interests that always and everywhere shape public policy outcomes. Political pressures frequently are marshaled by individuals or groups perceiving opportunities to exploit antitrust processes strategically, not to promote competition, but to subvert it (Baumol & Ordover, 1985). “Science”, including economic science, is filtered through—and deformed by—political and legal procedures before it finds effect in legislatures, bureaucracies, or courtrooms. In what follows, I review the antitrust-relevant public choice literature (Sect. 2) and then summarize empirical applications of it (Sect. 3). Section 4 concludes.",

Economists in the public choice tradition historically regard with suspicion attempts to rely on government to redistribute income or wealth. In particular, public choice theory argues that governmental attempts at redistribution likely are to be in service of special interest groups, rather than promoting the general welfare by adopting targeted reductions in poverty or inequality. Tullock (1983a, pp. 173–178) argues that “[A] great many programs purport to be aimed at helping the poor, but actually are aimed at helping someone else—someone who is politically more influential…. [B]asically, the modern redistributive state transfers money back and forth within the middle class on the basis of the power of political organization and public misinformation.” Despite such justified suspicion, governments around the world are successful at achieving significant reductions in inequality through tax and transfer systems. Figure 1 plots Gini coefficients for market income (pre-tax and transfer) and disposable income (post-tax and transfer) for 25 OECD countries: every single observation lies below the 45-degree line, suggesting that at least some redistribution does more than “move money back and forth between the middle class”. Disposable income inequality versus market income inequality. Notes Data from OECD Income Distribution Database. “Market Income Inequality” reports the pre-tax and transfer Gini coefficient. “Disposable Income Inequality” reports the post-tax and transfer Gini coefficient The question for the public choice theorist thus becomes, how much of the current pattern of income redistribution is effective—insofar as it reduces poverty or inequality in a targeted fashion in line with its purported justification—and how much represents benefits granted to special interest groups? To answer that question I propose two alternative versions of a “Tullock index” for assessing the effectiveness of redistribution. In the spirit of Atkinson’s (1970) inequality index,Footnote 1 the Tullock index is constructed with reference to either (A) the maximum inequality reduction attainable with current transfer spending, or (B) the minimum transfer spending necessary to achieve current post-transfer inequality. Deviations from either of those ideals represent ineffectiveness in the transfer system, insofar as its purported justification is an egalitarian one. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) microdata from 1988 to 2014, I construct annual estimates of the Tullock Index at the national level for the United States. Over that period, the Tullock Index is increasing, suggesting that redistribution has become less effective at reducing inequality. At the state level, results from simple panel fixed-effects models suggest that—for a given level of transfer spending—ineffective redistribution (as measured by the Tullock index) is associated with a higher poverty rate, a lower employment-population ratio, and reduced total employment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the myriad reasons for redistribution offered in the literature and compares them to the political economy theory of equilibrium redistribution offered by Tullock (1981). Section 3 introduces the data, discusses the construction of the Tullock index, and examines trends at the national level. Section 4 presents results from state-level panel data models. Section 5 concludes.",1
191.0,1.0,Public Choice,10 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-022-00958-6,Rewarding conservative politicians? Evidence from voting on same-sex marriage,April 2022,Björn Kauder,Niklas Potrafke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Voters both reward and punish politicians. They observe, for example, macroeconomic outcomes, such as economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and hold politicians responsible for that performance: when the economy is doing well (high economic growth, low unemployment and inflation), voters tend to reward politicians and return incumbents in office (on theories and empirical evidence of economic voting see, e.g., Nannestad & Paldam 1994; Lewis-Beck & Stegmaier 2013; Maloney & Pickering 2015).Footnote 1 Clearly, politicians often attempt to influence macroeconomic outcomes by, for example, implementing partisan fiscal policies that gratify the needs of their constituencies (e.g., Schmidt 1996; Potrafke 2017, 2018). Politicians cannot, however, influence macroeconomic outcomes fully. Voters understand that macroeconomic outcomes also are determined by exogeneous events and therefore evaluate politicians’ performances based on measures that politicians influence directly. It is conceivable that voters desire competent, honest and exemplary politicians and punish politicians who have been involved in scandals. The empirical evidence on how voters respond to politicians who had been corrupt, favored relatives or abused taxpayers’ money is quite mixed, however (e.g., Karahan et al. 2006, 2009; Hirano & Snyder 2012; Vivyan et al. 2012; Rudolph & Däubler 2016; Kauder & Potrafke 2015; Larcinese & Sircar 2017; Potrafke & Rösel 2019). The rollcall votes cast by members of parliament (MPs) supply information on which voters plausibly reward and punish politicians (retrospectively).Footnote 2 Rollcall votes capture the behaviors of individual politicians in parliament; they often are conducted when politicians confront controversial issues. Examples include Brexit and same-sex marriage (e.g., Kauder & Potrafke 2019; Aidt et al. 2021). Political parties have collective views on such issues. Conservative parties are, for example, less likely to advocate same-sex marriage than liberal parties. Individual MPs may, however, disagree with their parties’ positions on controversial issues and consider voting against the party line. On the one hand, voters may punish individual MPs who defect from the party line when they believe that MPs should be loyal. On the other hand, voters may support defectors when they themselves disagree with the party line or wish to reward rebellion. Empirical evidence on how MPs’ rollcall voting influences citizens’ voting behavior is mixed. In the United States, voters hardly pay attention to congressional rollcall votes (Ansolabehere & Jones 2010). Voters have punished politicians for being too partisan, but not for being ideologically too extreme (Canes-Wrone et al. 2002; Carson et al. 2010). In the United Kingdom, the policy accountability of MPs is both weak and general rather than issue-specific (Vivyan et al. 2012). Voters are likely to reward and punish MPs for their rollcall votes when the electoral system allows individual punishment, the vote received attention in the media, and voters had chances to learn about the votes cast by and the views of individual MPs (e.g., Stiers 2021). The German electoral system is well suited for examining how voters punish and reward individual MPs because the so-called first vote in national elections is a personal vote.Footnote 3 MPs’ individual votes on same-sex marriage were public knowledge and some MPs were quite active in advertising their voting behavior (e.g., Tauber 2017). The rollcall vote on same-sex marriage we study was held on June 30, 2017, in the German national parliament (Bundestag).Footnote 4 It was the only rollcall vote that day. That vote had a profound influence on the public debate about the social-political platforms of the conservative parties in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) (see Wenzelburger & Fehrenz 2018).Footnote 5 Same-sex couples already had the opportunity to enter into legally recognized civil unions.Footnote 6 When the votes were counted, 393 members of parliament (MPs) favored and 226 MPs opposed same-sex marriage (four abstained and seven did not attend). The MPs of the social-democratic SPD, the Greens, and the left-wing party DIE LINKE voted nearly unanimously in favor of same-sex marriage; 225 of the CDU/CSU MPs voted against and 75 in favor of same-sex marriage (four abstained and five did not attend).Footnote 7 The voting behavior of the conservative CDU/CSU MPs was remarkable because MPs usually voted in party blocs in rollcall votes that dealt with moral policy issues, such as abortion and stem-cell research. Christian democratic MPs were more likely to vote for restrictive policies than members of other political parties over the 1992–2015 period (Engler & Dümig 2017).Footnote 8 Conservative MPs were concerned about their re-election chances when voting on same-sex marriage: the margin of victory for the incumbent in the previous election was a strong predictor of supporting same-sex marriage (Kauder & Potrafke 2019). When the winning vote margin increased by 1% point, the likelihood of voting in favor of same-sex marriage declined by around 1.32% points. Against the background of the re-election concerns of the conservative MPs in June 2017, we investigate how voting on same-sex marriage influenced vote shares in the national election in September 2017. The results of the econometric model show that, when comparing the outcomes of the 2017 and 2013 national elections, the vote share of conservative politicians who voted in favor of same-sex marriage was around 1.29% points higher (around 0.33 standard deviations of the change in the candidate’s vote share) than the vote share of conservative politicians who voted against same-sex marriage.",1
191.0,1.0,Public Choice,24 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-022-00959-5,Do women always behave as corruption cleaners?,April 2022,Alice Guerra,Tatyana Zhuravleva,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Do women behave as corruption cleaners? Experimental evidence suggests an affirmative answer, showing that females generally are less likely than males to engage in corrupt acts (Alatas et al., 2009; Fisar et al., 2016; Jha & Sarangi, 2018; Lambsdorff & Frank, 2011; Rivas, 2013; for excellent surveys, see Abbink, 2006; Frank et al., 2011; Chaudhuri, 2012; Stensöta & Wängnerud, 2018), and that female voters tend to punish corrupt politicians and their parties more harshly than male voters (Eggers et al., 2018).Footnote 1 In line with those experimental results, several survey-based studies document a stark, negative correlation between being female and corruption levels or tolerance of corruption (Alexander, 2018; Alexander & Bågenholm, 2018; Bauhr & Charron, 2020; Dollar et al., 2001; Esarey & Chirillo, 2013; Esarey & Schwindt-Bayer, 2018; Lee & Guven, 2013; Sundström & Wängnerud, 2016; Swamy et al., 2001; Torgler & Valev, 2010; Vijayalakshmi, 2008).Footnote 2 While the literature suggests a possible gender-corruption link, the mechanisms through which this link evolves remain under-explored. First, prior research has not clearly identified when gender matters, i.e., the specific corruption conditions under which men and women behave differently. Second, previous experiments focus mainly on male-female differences in bribing behavior, i.e., willingness to engage in a corrupt act in the pursuit of private gains. No prior research thus far has explored experimentally gender differences in the tolerance of bribery, i.e., in the evaluation of corrupt acts when one is neither involved in, nor directly affected by them. Nonetheless, that aspect of corruption is important since tolerance of illegal behaviors plays a critical role in the proliferation and persistence of those actions (Alatas et al., 2009; Kubbe & Engelbert, 2018)Footnote 3; and it likely differs across individuals (Alexander, 2018; Alexander et al., 2019; Barr & Serra, 2010; Lee & Guven, 2013). The logic is simple: when individuals are accustomed to corruption and simply treat it as a cost of ordinary business, corruption no is longer a social issue (Banerjee et al., 2021; Chang, 2020; Munger, 2019). General acceptance of corruption likely leads to rent seeking (Choi & Storr, 2019; Lambsdorff, 2002; Tullock, 1980, 1985, 1987, 1988) and a pervasive “transitional gains trap”, wherein it may nearly be impossible to root out corruption (Méon & Sekkat, 2005; Tullock, 1967, 1975, 1996).Footnote 4 In the paper at hand, we explore whether—and under what conditions—males and females differ in their tendencies to act corruptly and in their moral evaluations of corrupt acts. In so doing, we rely on the experimental data reported in Guerra and Zhuravleva (2021), and expand it specifically by exploring gender differences. Guerra and Zhuravleva (2021) is a modified version of Barr and Serra’s (2009) bribery game. That game simulates a simple bribery situation in which a citizen could bribe a public official, who then can accept or reject it. Accepting the bribe yields private gains to both the citizen and the official, but imposes a financial loss on other members of society. The other members of society are idle victims, included in the game to simulate the negative externalities generated by corruption. All other players suffer a (deadweight) loss for every bribe exchanged. Guerra and Zhuravleva (2021) add two novel aspects to the standard Barr and Serra (2009) bribery game, which also has been played in, e.g., Cameron et al. (2009), Barr and Serra (2010), and Chaudhuri et al. (2016). First, to measure individuals’ tolerance of bribery experimentally, Guerra and Zhuravleva (2021) introduce—for the first time in a bribery game—a fourth player, the monitor, who acts as a third-party punisher and cannot engage in bribery.Footnote 5 More important, the monitor’s payoff is not affected by any corrupt act, but he can react to it by allocating some of his own resources to impose a larger financial cost on the corrupt actor or actors.Footnote 6 That setup—which is known in experimental economics as third-party punishment (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2004)—allows us to pinpoint gender differences in corruption precisely. Monitors can be seen as voters, who can decide to exercise costly effort in casting their votes. Female and male voters may tolerate corrupt actors differently, punishing them by voting for another political party (e.g., Alexander et al., 2019; Chang, 2020; see also Azfar & Nelson, 2007; Arvate & Mittlaender, 2017). Understanding that possibility is crucial for public policies. For instance, if females are found to be more likely to vote against corrupt actors than males, then policies aimed at promoting and encouraging active female participation in elections or other decision-making processes may filter out corrupt actors from governments, bureaucracies, or other social groups concerned with public affairs, such as labor unions and business organizations. Second, Guerra and Zhuravleva (2021) manipulate two key bribery dimensions experimentally: the private gains of the corrupt actors and the negative externality imposed by corruption on other members of society (either low or high). That same approach allows us to ask whether men and women respond differently to the tradeoff between the benefits versus the external costs of corruption in both bribing behavior and tolerance of bribery (third-party punishment behavior). Larger private gains of the corrupt actors make monitors worse off with respect to corrupt actors, while on the other hand, larger negative externalities raise inequities between the corrupt actors and their idle victims but make monitors better off with respect to the latter. Those differences in the consequences of corruption ultimately affect social welfare overall—either enhancing or reducing it—allowing us to determine how reactions to welfare effects possibly vary by gender. The distinction between welfare-enhancing and welfare-reducing corruption has received little experimental attention (Abbink et al., 2002; Balafoutas et al., 2021; Cameron et al., 2009), nor has a gender perspective been adopted. We contribute to the experimental literature by exploring whether male and female subjects behave differently depending on the payoff inequities—and, in turn, the welfare effects—generated by corruption. Good reasons exist to believe that both payoff inequities and overall welfare consequences may affect males and female behavior differently. Indeed, the literature on gender differences in other-regarding preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009; Eckel & Grossman, 1998) implies that females engage less frequently in and are less tolerant of corruption than males as the negative externality increases, owing to their stronger senses of fairness and equity (Cox, 2002; Mieth et al., 2017) and being more concerned about others’ welfare (Alexander et al., 2019; Cumming et al., 2015; Eagly et al., 2000). Several studies exploring attitudes towards unethical behaviors—including corruption and tax evasion—provide evidence of females behaving more ethically (being more concerned with the so-called public good than their own) than males (Chaudhuri, 2012; Swamy et al., 2001; Torgler & Valev, 2010). By contrast, males may not object to corruption if it increases their private gains because they are more selfish than females (Andreoni & Vesterlund, 2001; Eckel & Grossman, 1998). Nonetheless, previous studies report mixed results, and present a confusing picture of when and why males and females differ in other-regarding preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009). In some experiments, females are more inequity-averse than males, whereas in others they are less so. Hence, while we can expect possible gender differences in response to the experimental treatments, we cannot clearly predict their directions a priori. Our results show that, on average, no gender difference is observed in bribing behavior. Nonetheless, we find gender differences in the tolerance of bribery, with male monitors punishing corrupt actors less often than female monitors, but to a greater extent. Our treatment manipulations show that looking at averages does not reveal the entire story. Gender gaps in bribery depend strongly on both the exact contextual conditions and the role taken in the bribery act. Our results reveal that females engage less in, and are less tolerant of bribery when its negative externality increases, reducing welfare overall. Males punish corrupt actors more severely when the gains to corrupt actors increase, yielding them a comparative payoff disadvantage with respect to the latter. Regarding the part played in bribery acts, our findings reveal consistent behavior by females across roles, as a response to a larger externality that reduces welfare overall. Apart from that, gender behavior is strongly role-dependent. Our research adds important insights to the literature, which hitherto has established the conventional wisdom about gender differences in corruption (Chaudhuri, 2012; Stensöta & Wängnerud, 2018), and—more broadly—dishonesty (Abeler et al., 2016, 2019). Prior contributions generally have suggested that females behave as corruption cleaners because of their more critical attitudes to corruption, albeit without specifying the exact contextual factors under which those divergences with males may arise. The main takeaway message of our paper is that either males or females can be found to be more prone to bribe or more tolerant of corruption, depending on both the payoff differentials generated by corruption and the role played in the bribery act. In a broader perspective, our research suggests that gender behavior is context- and role-dependent, and cannot be characterized simply. The remainder of the paper at hand proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the experimental design and procedure. Section 3 reports the results. Section 4 discusses the main findings and concludes.",4

Yet when it comes to monetary policy, existing models often act as if benevolent monetary authorities are solving for the social optimum without considering the incentives policymakers face. As Plosser (2018, p. 2) writes, however, “policy makers are not the romantic ‘Ramsey planners’ that we economists often assume in our models but actors responding to incentives and subject to institutional constraints, both of which shape policy choices and outcomes.” Neither the formation of monetary institutions nor monetary policy is immune to private interests. While economists have long argued that the production of money is not neutral on the distribution of wealth and the pattern of prices (Cantillon, 1755; Hayek, 1931), it is still unclear how and through what channels monetary policy impacts those variables. Richard Cantillon was the first economist, in 1755, to argue that the first receivers of the newly created money will benefit from inflation, while the later receivers will lose from it as the real value of their cash balances depreciates—a process called the “Cantillon effect” (Blaug, 1997). Once we relax the assumption of neutral money, it is clear that certain groups may benefit from newly created money being injected into the economy while other groups may lose. At this point, what more is a central banking institution than one that changes the distribution of assets within society? Alternative monetary arrangements are rarely conceptualized as entailing different distributions of resources, and yet they surely are. The distributional consequences of Cantillon effects from monetary policy, however, are difficult to identify.Footnote 1 For instance, while the development of unconventional monetary policies since 2007 has led to a ballooning literature on the impacts of monetary policy on inequality, the literature has failed to come up with decisive answers.Footnote 2 Earlier studies on the effects of inflation suggest that it mainly increases inequality.Footnote 3 Although some of the more recent research concurs,Footnote 4 much of it has found evidence to the contrary.Footnote 5 Some studies also find that contractionary monetary policy has increasing effects on inequality,Footnote 6 while some indicate decreasing effects (Ballabriga & Davtyan, 2017). Finally, other studies have found a nonlinear relationship between inflation and inequality.Footnote 7 The relationship between inflation and income and wealth inequality seems to be inconclusive on a one-way directional effect (O’Farrell et al., 2016). Similarly, no consensus has been reached when trying to assess the impact of unconventional monetary policy, such as quantitative easing (QE), on inequality. Studies have varied dramatically with respect to their conclusions, with some saying that unconventional monetary policy has increasing (Albert et al., 2019; Saiki & Frost, 2014; Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2020), decreasing (Lenza & Slačálek, 2018), heterogeneous (Guerello, 2018), ambiguous (Bernoth et al., 2015), and negligible (Casiraghi et al., 2018) effects on inequality. The growing literature on this topic seems to have failed to identify a systematic effect between monetary policy and inequality. Prasad (2014), for instance, highlights the discrepancies in the literature on the effects of monetary policy and concludes that “the sheer number of channels suggests that the net redistributive effect is specific to each economy and even to the specific type of monetary policy action undertaken by a central bank” (p. 414). While the absence of a systematic effect of monetary policy on wealth and income distribution may seem discouraging to researchers, this absence has, paradoxically, important consequences for the political economy of monetary institutions. In this paper, we argue that the effect of money creation on income and wealth distribution will depend on both the prevailing economic and political equilibrium. In other words, the distributional consequences of inflation will depend on which interest groups are able to control the money creation process for their own benefit. Yet it is precisely because of the difficulty in identifying the losers from inflation that those harmed by monetary policy are unlikely to play a role in its formation. Monetary policy can be understood as a process providing concentrated benefits to special interest groups while imposing dispersed and not easily identifiable losses on other groups. Hence, while some economists—especially economists in the Austrian tradition—have emphasized how the impact of changes in the money supply depends on the channels through which money is “injected” into the economy (Hayek, 1931; Mises, 1949; Garrison, 2000), the selection of such channels is itself likely to be shaped by the logic of interest groups. On the other hand, while the existing literature on the political economy of money has focused mostly on the impact of the election cycle (Abrams & Iossifov, 2006; Nordhaus et al., 1989; Drazen, 2000) as well as on issues of time inconsistency (Kydland & Prescott, 1977; Barro & Gordon, 1983) and seigniorage maximization (Cagan, 1956), it tends to leave out the role of interest groups in shaping both the tools and objectives underlying monetary policy.Footnote 8 Considering the redistributive effects of money creation and credit allocation policies, on the other hand, allows one to apply the logic of interest groups to the organization of money production. Cantillon effects are a matter of public choice. We provide evidence for our interest groups approach using three case studies: (1) the Fed’s reaction to the 2007 financial crisis, (2) the Fed’s reaction to the COVID crisis, and (3) the establishment and development of the euro. One prediction of our framework is that when either Cantillon effects or the effects of credit allocation are less identifiable, those gaining from money creation and preferential lines of credit are more likely to successfully exert influence on monetary authorities. While our first and second case studies using the Fed show the importance of interest groups receiving concentrated benefits and imposing dispersed costs, the case of the euro provides the opportunity to contrast the latter situation to one where the losers of money creation are easily identifiable and suffer concentrated losses. We show that in this situation, those harmed by money creation and credit allocation policies are more likely to successfully lobby for institutional safeguards preventing other interest groups from inflicting costs onto them.",

Moreno-Ternero,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Sports organizations crucially rely on the revenues they obtain from broadcasting their events. In 2019, the National Football League (NFL—the professional American football league) generated more than US$ 4.5 billion in broadcasting rights worldwide. The English Premier League (EPL—the top English football league), the National Basketball Association (NBA—the major professional basketball league in North America), and La Liga (the top professional football division of the Spanish football league system) followed in the ranking, generating US$ 3.83, US$ 3.12 and US$ 2.27 billion, respectively.Footnote 1 These massive amounts are typically obtained via collective bargaining. That is, each sports league organizes itself via a governing body, which negotiates with TV broadcasters selling broadcasting rights for all games played in the league. An interesting problem emerges once the deal is closed; namely, how to share those revenues among participating clubs in the league. This problem can be solved in two ways. One way is  by means of a social planner (ideally, but not necessarily, considering some sort of rule that is singled out from an axiomatic characterization). We refer to this as a centralized way. The other way involves no social planner, and the involved parties (clubs in this case) themselves decide via some voting protocol. We refer to this as a decentralized way. We will mostly focus in this paper on the latter (although we also include a characterization result in our analysis). One might argue that in a one-club/one-vote environment, uniform sharing is more or less guaranteed because weak-drawing clubs may block unequal sharing by refusing to permit broadcasting games involving them and strong-drawing clubs (Fort & Quirk, 1995). This is less realistic nowadays. In recent years, most leagues have expanded timetables, so that very few games overlap. We also have more accurate data about audiences in each game. Consequently, it is easier to estimate the (broadcasting) strength of each participating club in a league, and the uniform sharing might easily be dismissed on grounds of fairness. Our analysis will take as a starting point the audience matrix associated with each league—that is, the collection of the (TV) audiences of all games in the league. More precisely, if all clubs involved in a league are listed as columns and rows of a matrix, then each entry of the matrix will collect the audience (number of TV viewers) of the game involving the team at the corresponding row and the team at the corresponding column, played at the former’s stadium.Footnote 2 If we assume a pay-per-view system, in which each viewer pays the same fee to watch a game, then the overall number of viewers can be interpreted as the overall amount of revenue to be allocated (normalizing the fee to one). Then, we will consider rules that fully allocate such an amount among all participating clubs. The uniform rule (outlined above) is obviously an option. But others exist too. We concentrate on those that satisfy two basic principles: anonymity and additivity. The first states that a permutation of the set of agents equally permutes the allocation. Thus, the name of the agents does not matter. The second one is standard in axiomatic work and it can be traced back to Shapley (1953). It states that revenues should be additive on the audience matrix, which precludes some externalities, while conveying a form of simplicity. Our first result (Theorem 1) characterizes all the rules satisfying  anonymity and additivity. They require that the amount received by each club is dependent on three characteristics: its overall home audience, its overall away audience, and the overall audience in the whole tournament (league). We then let clubs vote among these rules and obtain a first negative result (Theorem 2): no majority equilibrium exists. That is, for each problem within a large class we identify, and each solution for it (obtained from one of the rules characterized), there exists another solution (obtained from another rule, among those characterized) that is strictly preferred by a majority of clubs. The above negative result is another instance of Condorcet’s paradox of voting, which is perhaps best exemplified by the problem of determining the division of a cake by majority rule (Hamada, 1973). Such a result might lead one to despair of ever achieving a voting equilibrium in our setting. Nevertheless, as Campbell (1975) puts it, majority voting is never allowed to operate by itself without restraints imposed by constitution and convention. We actually show that we can avoid majority cycles in our setting with a simple move in that direction. More precisely, instead of anonymity, we could consider another axiom, dubbed equal treatment of equals, stating that if two clubs have the same audiences, then each time they play a third, they should receive the same amount. Thus, both axioms are related to the principle of impartiality.Footnote 3 It turns out that the combination of this axiom with additivity characterizes another family of rules, which happens to be included in the family of rules characterized in Theorem 1. We refer to them as general compromise rules, because they offer a general (not necessarily convex) compromise between two focal rules: on the one hand, the uniform rule already mentioned; on the other hand, a rule dubbed  concede-and-divide, which allocates revenues comparing individual and average (broadcasting) performance in a meaningful way. We then obtain a positive result (Theorem 3). That is, we show that if we allow clubs to vote among rules within any bounded subset of the family of general compromise rules, majority equilibrium does exist. To prove the previous result, we exploit an interesting feature of the family of general compromise rules. Rules within the family satisfy the so-called single-crossing property, which allows one to separate those clubs that benefit from the choice of one or the other rule, depending on the rank of their overall audiences. This is a sufficient condition for the existence of a majority voting equilibrium (Gans & Smart, 1996). And it also has some other implications, referring to the distributive impact of the rules within the family, as well as the identification of the majority voting equilibrium (Hemming & Keen, 1983). Our work relates to several branches of the literature. On the one hand there is the literature on voting regarding taxes, pioneered by Foley (1967), who analyzed the problem of voting on taxes in an endowment economy (and showed that there always exists a majority voting equilibrium for the class of flat taxes).Footnote 4 In our setting, voting refers to allocation rules, rather than tax methods. As such, we are closer to the literature on voting for resource allocation (Birnberg et al., 1970; Barzel & Sass, 1990). Thus, our work also touches the sizable body of literature on fair allocation, with a special emphasis on its well-developed component dealing with rationing problems (O’Neill, 1982; Kaminski, 2000; Thomson, 2019). On the other hand, this paper is a new stage in our research agenda on sharing the revenues raised from the collective sale of broadcasting rights for sports leagues (Bergantiños & Moreno-Ternero, 2020a, 2020b, 2021, 2022a, 2022b, 2022c, 2022d, 2023). As such, it connects to literature dealing with broadcasting and revenue sharing in sports (Cave & Crandall, 2001; Szymanski & Késenne, 2004). We conclude this introduction mentioning that our analysis may have potential applications that go beyond the four big leagues mentioned at the beginning of this section. Two of those referred to (European) football, also known as soccer. Table 1 below lists the most important leagues for that sport, ranked according to their value per game (based on the contracts in place as of September 2022). This allows us to obtain a more accurate picture for soccer numbers worldwide. Note that most of these leagues have a standard round-robin tournament from which we can obtain an audience matrix, thus satisfying the informational requirements of our model. This is not the case in some other major sports with a different format, such as F1, golf, or tennis. In the case of F1 (and MotoGP and similar racing sports), participants likely compete in several races during the season. We can therefore only have combined audiences for each race, without disentangling the audience for each pair or participants. Similarly, in the case of golf, participants compete at different tournaments, and even though some participants do not make the cut by the last days of each tournament, we can only obtain combined audiences. Finally, both tennis and international football competitions (such as the FIFA World Cup) rely on knock-out tournament formats. In that case, we would easily obtain an audience matrix as well (although it would have more empty entries than an audience matrix from a round-robin tournament), and thus our model could also be applied. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the model, basic rules and axioms in Sect. 2, and we provide the main characterization result in Sect. 3. Section 4 is devoted to the decentralization process. We first show that in letting clubs vote among the rules within the family characterized in Sect. 3, we cannot guarantee the existence of a majority voting equilibrium. We then show that such an existence is guaranteed when the set of voting alternatives is restricted to another focal family of rules. We then explore additional features of such a family and its (associated) majority voting equilibrium. Section 5 concludes. For smooth flow, some proofs have been deferred to an appendix.",3

The reasons that current political decision-makers would embrace public debt as a strategic instrument are manifold and range from the aim of minimizing the pork barrel’s contribution to debt stabilization (Alesina & Drazen, 1991) over concerns regarding interregional or intergenerational redistribution (see Cukierman & Meltzer, 1989 or Weingast et al., 1981) to binding future governments’ allocation of public funds.Footnote 1 Likewise, the political economy of environmental policy has been examined at least since Buchanan and Tullock (1975), who showed why existing firms in a polluting industry would prefer the introduction of quotas over an emission tax. The subsequent theoretical literature has put its primary emphasis on analyzing how interest groups can influence environmental policy through lobbying (see Aidt, 1998 in particular and Oates & Portney, 2003 for an overview). However, to the best of my knowledge, a combined approach which intertwines the political economy of public debt and environmental policy has yet to be established. This paper contributes to the integrated analysis by introducing stock pollutants in a political economy model of public debt with uncertain reelection. Specifically, I ask (i) how strategic debt incentives are affected by considering stock pollution, (ii) how emissions are influenced by strategic interactions, and (iii) how accounting for both effects influences welfare under reelection uncertainty. Strategic incentives are shaped not only by an intertemporal budget interaction (which is known from the literature) but also by an intertemporal emission interaction. This leads to the central finding that reelection uncertainty can have a beneficial effect on welfare through the strategic choice of public debt, current and future emissions.Footnote 2 At the very least, the detrimental fiscal effect of reelection uncertainty is attenuated by more ambitious emission abatement. Reelection uncertainty reduces first-period pollution in comparison to the outcome under certain reelection, if emissions are sufficiently persistent (as in the case of greenhouse gases). This result stems from the emission interaction and occurs even if the first-period government ignores environmental damages. Voting still leads to a strategic increase in public debt like in the underlying models without pollution. The possible implications for welfare are threefold. First, increasing marginal pollution damages (analogously, increasing social costs of carbon [SCC]) may provide a normative justification for positive public debt. In this case, both strategic incentives are welfare-increasing because certain reelection results in insufficient provision of clean public goods in the first period. Second, decreasing marginal damages can mandate public savings such that strategic debt is inefficient. If the environmental damage is relatively large, the welfare gains from strategic abatement may still outweigh this inefficiency. Third, in the case of a net welfare loss, accounting for the beneficial emission-abating effect attenuates the debt inefficiency. As a result, purely debt-focused analyses overestimate the welfare cost of reelection uncertainty. To derive these findings, I employ a two-period model where the first-period government faces uncertainty about reelection in the second period and allocates funds between two public goods. While the provision of one good is clean (e.g., research and development subsidies to clean industries, spending on education or health services), the other good causes emissions (e.g., road infrastructure or fossil fuel subsidies) and, thus, adds to a stock of environmental pollution. In a bipartisan voting economy, two parties compete for office and disagree on how much of the pollution externality should be internalized. The government is either constituted by “environmentalists” (E) who (over-)internalize pollution damages or by “industrialists” (I) who consider the externality only partially (or not at all). This setup can be motivated, for instance, by the recent change to the computation of the SCC in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, as adhered to by the Obama administration, the SCC measured the global costs of carbon emissions. Under the Trump administration, only “domestic” benefits from avoided climate change were taken into account, which reduced the SCC considerably (EPA, 2017). The Biden administration is currently adapting the measure to better account for global damages again. As the novel feature of my model, debt no longer is the only channel through which the incumbent government can influence future policymaking. First-period borrowing serves as a strategic measure to confine future governments’ spending capabilities and shift funds to the first period, where the incumbent government can still allocate the public budget to its own liking. Additionally, the stock characteristic of first-period emissions creates a second channel through which the incumbent influences future decision making. For instance, suppose party I is initially in office but will be superseded by E in the second period. Party I prefers a higher level of the polluting good than E will provide in the second period. This causes the well-known incentive to accumulate debt and spend even more on the polluting good in the first period. However, since emissions remain in the atmosphere, party E would not just dispose of a smaller budget but also inherit a larger stock of emissions from the first period, which leads to even lower spending on the polluting good in the second period. Therefore, the emission interaction disciplines incumbent I to pollute less in the first period if emissions are sufficiently persistent. In the opposite case, where party E holds office in the first period but expects to be replaced by I in the second period, E anticipates that too much of the polluting good will be provided in the next period. To prevent pollution damages from spiking in the second period, E cuts first-period spending on the polluting good while running a strategically high deficit to restrict second-period provision by party I. Hence, any first-period government will strategically abate emissions. Voss (2014) provides several examples from German politics illustrating this effect. In the United States, the Obama administration declared several new national monuments in December 2016, including Bears Ears, Utah, which ties up considerable fossil and uranium deposits. When this act was signed, it was already clear that Democrats would be replaced in the presidential office. Hence, we may view this decision as a means to hedge against the change in office rather than to improve reelection probabilities. The monument was subsequently reduced to 15% of its size by the Trump administration, from which sprang several mining operations. President Biden has since fully restored the Bears Ears monument. Voting uncertainty is empirically documented to be a driving factor of public debt (e.g., Woo, 2003). Since a change in office implies that second-period funds will not be spent optimally from the incumbent’s perspective, any first-period government has an incentive to leave fewer funds for the second period. Most contributions identify this strategic incentive to be detrimental to welfare. However, the integrated analysis of debt and climate policy shows that stock pollution provides a first-best justification to deviate from a balanced budget (Kellner & Runkel, 2021). Whether public debt or savings are optimal depends on several factors including how the marginal environmental damage evolves over time (e.g., estimates of the SCC typically increase, see Kornek et al., 2021). This implies that a balanced budget rule is no longer an effective instrument to restore the social optimum, unlike in the canonical literature on strategic debt. From these findings, I conclude that the total intertemporal welfare effect of reelection uncertainty is path-dependent. If party E is initially in office and replaced by I, reelection uncertainty not only affects the budget efficiency but causes a welfare loss due to excessive emissions in the second period. In contrast, if I constitutes the first-period government and is superseded by E, the strategic incentive to pollute less in the first period is reinforced by intrinsic emission abatement in the second period. Empirically, the latter case may be more relevant, implying that emission levels decrease as a result of voting uncertainty. Lower pollution damages either accompany the welfare gain from the budget interaction if the strategic debt is welfare-improving or attenuate the strategic inefficiency if public debt is excessively high. Consequently, there are two channels through which strategic incentives associated with voting uncertainty can improve welfare relative to the certain reelection outcome. Neither is observed in the traditional political economy models of public debt, which thus implies that certain reelection and balanced budget rules are superior to voting with the ability to issue debt from a welfare perspective. My results challenge these findings and provide a welfare-based rationale to embrace political competition. This paper is closely related to the literature on the political economy of public debt. In particular, I build on and expand the framework established by Tabellini and Alesina (1990) who analyze the effects on public debt when voters decide about the allocation of funds between two public goods. The bipartisan approach with two parties alternating in office is similar to the models in Persson and Svensson (1989) and Alesina and Tabellini (1990). However, these seminal contributions focus exclusively on strategic debt incentives when the government provides nondurable, clean public goods. By neglecting other interactions, they concur that the public budget should be balanced in the optimum and that strategic debt is detrimental to welfare. Peletier et al. (1999) who modify one public good to be a durable investment which earns returns in the future and, recently, Bouton et al. (2020), who introduce entitlements (e.g., future pension payments) as a means to influence future decisions, both show that adhering to a balanced budget rule may be detrimental in the presence of a second interaction. Interestingly, both models reach this conclusion through fundamentally different interactions: productive investments increase future public spending capabilities to the benefit of all individuals, while entitlements redistribute to the current government’s supporters. My analysis joins their rank by unveiling yet another interaction with similar implications via damages from stock pollution. In another recent study, Piguillem and Riboni (2021) show that the debt inefficiency observed by the underlying literature can be attenuated when the incumbent and opposition party have to agree on relaxing debt rules. This interaction differs from the three above because both parties deliberately engage in a bargaining process. Regarding the strategic effect on emission abatement, Voss (2014) also shows that reelection uncertainty can induce the incumbent to pollute less than under certain reelection. However, this analysis does not consider the government’s ability to issue debt and, thus, ignores the budget interaction, which also affects the impact of voting on welfare in my model. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the model. In Sect. 3, I derive the social planner’s solution as a benchmark and compare it to the certain reelection outcome. Section 4 provides the central results regarding political economy incentives under reelection uncertainty. A critical discussion of my findings in Sect. 5 is followed by the concluding Sect. 6.",1

Public choice is “the application of the principles of maximizing behavior…to institutions and behavior in the political world” (Tollison, 2004, p. 191).Footnote 1 You might therefore think that public health has attracted major attention from public choice scholars. But then you would be wrong. The Elgar Companion to Public Choice (Reksulak et al. 2014), an “authoritative and encyclopaedic reference work” of more than 600 pages that “provides a thorough account of the public choice approach”, contains just six pages on which the term health (or a variant) appears. The Encyclopedia of Public Choice (Rowley & Schneider, 2004), a two-volume reference work of more than a thousand pages that “provides a detailed and comprehensive account of the subject known as public choice”, contains just a dozen pages on which the term appears. Not every discussion related to public health must or does include the word health. Still, the presence of but 6–12 index entries for the term in the major reference works on public choice suggests that public choice scholars have attended only modestly to issues in public health.Footnote 2 We expect that to change rapidly given the Covid-19 pandemic, which is in full swing at the moment of writing. The time therefore is ripe for taking stock of public-choice relevant scholarship that addresses issues in public health. That is what we do. Our stock-taking highlights three themes: (1) Public health regulations often are driven by private interests, not public ones. (2) The allocation of public health resources often reflects private interests, not public ones. (3) Public health policies may have perverse effects, undermining instead of promoting health-consumer welfare. Those themes would be at the center of any survey of public choice and public health.Footnote 3 But they are not the only themes such a survey might consider. A different survey also might consider, for example, work that studies how differences in governmental institutions—democracies versus autocracies, presidential versus parliamentary systems, and federated states versus unitary ones—affect public health policies or outcomes. Our survey’s focus on the themes enumerated above reflects our judgment of the primacy of rent seeking and government “failure” to analyses of the public sector in the public choice tradition. While that judgment is ours, it is not ours alone. Gordon Tullock titled his primer on public choice Government Failure (Tullock et al. 2002). James Buchanan described public choice as a “theory of government failure” (Buchanan, 1984, p. 11). And together with Robert Tollison, Tullock and Buchanan produced Toward at Theory of the Rent-Seeking Society (Buchanan et al. 1980).Footnote 4 Even still, our survey’s approach to public-choice relevant scholarship is quite broad. A few studies we consider were published before a subject called public choice existed. Numerous studies considered by us do not conceive of their contributions in terms of the public choice tradition but are in our view relevant to that tradition nonetheless.Footnote 5 And less than 20% of the studies we consider were published in the journal Public Choice. Broad, however, is different from exhaustive and rather militates against it. Thus, while we endeavor to cover as much relevant scholarship as possible, we do not claim our coverage is complete.",22

According to critics of the traditional view, we should either expand public health to cover all health-related market failures (Horne, 2019), or we should reconceive public goods as morally desirable outcomes that governments can achieve by exercising their coercive power (Dees, 2018). In this essay, I will briefly defend the public goods view of public health. But I’ll mainly focus on what we might call “the conversion problem”. The conversion problem occurs when a private good is converted into a public good, usually because a government policy spreads the costs and benefits of risky choices onto everyone in a population.Footnote 3 For example, consider what happens when governments require citizens to purchase home insurance, but then forbids insurance companies from charging higher prices when people build in places that are prone to earthquakes or floods. Under that mandate, refraining from building homes in risky areas is a public good: individual restraint provides nonrival, nonexcludable value to everyone in the insurance pool.Footnote 4 In fact, once the insurance mandates are in place, policymakers could argue credibly on public goods grounds that they should either prevent people from building in certain areas, or pay people to avoid those areas. A more salient case that I’ll discuss below involves public health professionals designating obesity and smoking as public health problems. Public health officials often say smoking and obesity impose costs on a national health service or an insurance pool. But they usually fail to note that rules mandating sharing the costs and benefits of one another’s health decisions are themselves a function of public policies that transform what would otherwise be private habits into public concerns. As those examples show, many modern debates in public health concern publicized goods—goods that are made public through the incentives created by government mandates. Since publicized goods are ubiquitous, even on the public goods conception of public health, there is no timelessly true answer to what constitutes a public health program. What counts as a public health program will depend on the normative judgments of the citizens who comprise a particular polity in conjunction with the incentives their political institutions create.",6

Congleton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Pandemics are not new. They are old enough and occur frequently enough to have affected human nature—at least the genetic component of it. What is new are the possibilities for ameliorating them through medicines, vaccines, and public policies. This paper analyzes issues associated with the selection of public policies toward life-threatening infectious diseases. Whether such policies are feasible depends on the properties of the disease(s) of interest, state capacity, and the extent to which medical and policy interventions can limit the damage of the targeted illness(es). Policy choices, in turn, are affected by voter conclusions about the ideal and the influence of politically active interest groups, although the latter are neglected in the present analysis.Footnote 1 When policies are electorally driven, the policies adopted vary with the tradeoffs associated with voter circumstances, their ideas about a good life, and the political institutions through which such choices are made. The analysis undertaken in this paper suggests that that many, perhaps most, of the best strategies for addressing new life-threatening diseases are associated with federal or polycentric governments rather than unitary ones. The paper begins with some biological background and then undertakes a series rational-choice-based analyses of ideal policies for individuals and communities. The first part of that analysis is undertaken with mathematical models that demonstrate that a variety of responses are likely to advance voter interests better than any single uniform response. The models demonstrate that voters tend to disagree about ideal policies even when they are all well-informed and fundamentally similar in nature. The second half of the paper demonstrates that variation in voter policy preferences implies that democratic federal or otherwise polycentric systems of governance tend to achieve outcomes that are more in accord with voter ideals during pandemics than unitary governments that impose uniform top-down policies. Pandemics arise when a bacterium, fungus, or virus penetrates human defenses against such invaders, harnesses some part of the human body to replicate itself, and spreads to other humans. Human defenses are able to overwhelm and end most such invasions, and afterwards, the associated antibodies and T-cells limit the ability of the same pathogens to reinvade previously infected persons. Such persons are said to be immune, even in cases in which the same pathogen may occasionally reinfect the same persons. However, immunity does not extend to new pathogens, relatively un-contagious pathogens not previously confronted, and ones that exist only in regions that rarely interact with others. A subset of such novel pathogens are able to invade and, in some cases, overwhelm an individual’s immune system. For example, diseases brought to the Americas by sixteenth century European explorers and settlers (such as smallpox) decimated the residents of the new world, but not the European settlers that brought and transmitted them. Europeans, likewise, had difficulties coping with diseases found in the Americas but not in Europe. Similarly, when one travels to new parts of the world, various vaccinations are often strongly recommended, such as ones for yellow fever (viral), typhoid (bacterial) and meningitis (bacterial). As globalization continues, such regional diseases tend to become globalized and both immune responses and other genetic resistance to such diseases tend to become more universal in succeeding generations. Thus, if the population of pathogens were unchanging, humans would gradually become immune to all life-threatening funguses, bacteria, and viruses that they confront in their daily lives. However, populations of pathogens are not entirely stable because of errors in replication (mutations). A subset of such errors occasionally produces pathogens that are more robust than the originals, and so new threats constantly arise. It is for that reason that humans are not immune to the “common cold”, which is not a single disease, but a collection of illnesses with similar symptoms caused by several rapidly changing families of viruses, a subset of which manage to penetrate most human immune systems every year. It may also be for this reason that we have immune systems rather than genetically transmitted resistance to all life-threatening pathogens. Immune systems can adapt to most new invaders within a few weeks and root out invaders that might otherwise overwhelm and kill us. Because the population of pathogens changes continuously, our immune systems constantly cope with both new and rarely confronted pathogens. Such adaptive systems would be less useful if the population of life-threatening and crippling pathogens were entirely stable. It is only a slight exaggeration to suggest that prior to 1900 no treatments for infectious diseases were available. Prior to 1900, few medicinal substances existed that would do more than mitigate pathogen-induced symptoms while one’s immune system puzzled out how to repel the invader. A few vaccines had been developed during the previous two centuries, but they were not used widely and arguably were not treatments, but rather methods for triggering an immune response, so that one has the antibodies and T-cells necessary to repel a given pathogenic invader quickly—before it kills or injures the host. It wasn’t until the mid-twentieth century that antibiotics were discovered that could counter most bacteriological invaders, and a small number of anti-fungal and anti-viral treatments were developed. For the most part, fungal and viral invaders remain untreatable, or nearly so. Instead of cures for the diseases generated by such pathogens, efforts are made to ameliorate unpleasant reactions (symptoms) and to keep patients alive long enough for their immune systems to adapt to and eliminate the relevant invaders. Such efforts were still evident in the early twenty-first century’s pandemic associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people’s immune system could overcome the new invader(s), but millions worldwide were unable to do so quickly enough to survive. The latter effect occurred because the capabilities of individual immune systems vary among individuals at a given age and within individuals over their lifetimes. Some individual’s immune responses are more robust than others, and everyone’s immune responses tend to vary with age, improving from birth through early adulthood and declining thereafter. It is for that reason that most deadly diseases kill a larger fraction of their very young and very old hosts than their middle-aged ones. Older people infected by diseases such as pneumonia, influenza, and Covid 19 die at much greater rates than middle-aged and young adults, with very young children being a bit more susceptible to such diseases than older children, and young adults, although normally far less susceptible to them than persons well beyond retirement age. The pathogens that produce pandemics (by definition) initially are untreatable and able to overwhelm the immune response of a significant subset of the individuals infected. The discussion above implies that the likelihood that one is significantly affected by a new life-threatening pathogen is largely determined by three conditions: (1) the probability that one will come into contact with a person or animal in the infectious phase of the disease, (2) the state of one’s health when exposed to the pathogen and (3) the state of one’s immune system. One cannot catch an infectious disease unless one contacts the germs that induce illnesses in humans. Whether a person’s life is at risk or depends on one’s initial state of health and immune response. A person that is already at death’s door from other illnesses (comorbidities) may be pushed over the edge by a relatively mild infection that a healthy person hardly would notice. The speed with which an infection is repelled varies with the state of one’s immune system. If one has a robust immune system or has been vaccinated, one may not catch the disease in the sense of developing noticeable symptoms, because the invader is repelled rapidly and easily. Because essentially everyone prefers to be healthy rather than sick and safe rather than facing a significant risk of death, public support for policies that can reduce rates of infection at a reasonable cost, especially life-threatening infections, tend to have broad support. Of course, with novel diseases, the best policies are never obvious. Thus historically, all manner of responses have been undertaken by human communities—although few were effective (Hays, 2005). They include praying, human sacrifice, changes in diet, quarantines, and isolation. More recently, as state capacity and biological understanding increased, policies such as mandatory vaccination, subsidies for healthcare research and effective treatments, and regulating personal conduct believed to affect transmission rates have been pursued.
 That a single “ideal” policy is better than a hodgepodge of independently chosen policies is a common theme in contemporary healthcare circles. For example, most discussions about the best policies for the Covid 19 pandemic of 2019–2022 asserted or assumed that a single policy would be best for countries as a whole or for the entire planet. For example, public health officials in most countries asserted that everyone should wear a mask and stay one or two meters away from all other individuals at all times whenever they left their homes. Indeed, for a short period in 2021, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States recommended wearing two masks whenever one left one’s abode, rather than just one, and high government officials such as President Biden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Fauci did so in most public appearances, although both already were fully vaccinated. Such recommendations neglect the variation in risks that individuals living in different regions confront and also differences among individuals within those regions. When such differences are taken into account, it should be obvious—although it seems not to be—that the ideal policies for addressing pandemics are not ordinarily ones that should apply uniformly to all individuals in all circumstances. When considered from the perspective of individuals, ideal policies vary among persons and regions because of differences in circumstances and associated risks and opportunity costs. In economic terms, such considerations affect and individual’s optimal tradeoffs among strategies that can promote health, reduce health risks, or otherwise enhance the quality of life. Of course, a good life is not simply life, but a life that produces desirable outcomes for the individual or family. Good health is part of a good life, but only part of it. The next two sections use rational choice models to show why individuals tend to disagree about the best healthcare policies for themselves and for governments. They demonstrate that disagreements tend to emerge even if people are fundamentally similar, completely rational, and perfectly informed. The models developed are not used because they are “rigorous” (although they are), but because they allow particular aspects of policymaking to be highlighted and have relatively clear implications about “ideal” solutions to such decisions. The models are similar to those that have been applied in previous studies of rational choice politics and fiscal federalism, which have generated plausible implications and withstood many empirical tests. Their main purpose is to demonstrate that fully rational and informed individuals tend to disagree about ideal policies because their circumstances differ. The models are very lean ones; caveats and extensions are provided in footnotes. (Those who find the assertion that well-informed individuals may disagree about ideal policies plausible and who are uninterested in how one can characterize such well-informed choices with respect to healthcare and healthcare policies might want to skip to the second half of the paper.)",8
195.0,1.0,Public Choice,17 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00928-4,Public health and expert failure,April 2023,Roger Koppl,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Pandemics and other health crises demand state action. I think that the national governments of modern democracies generally should respond to health crises. In any event, they will. When a health crisis hits, it always is futile and usually inappropriate to tell modern democratic governments to stand aside and do nothing. In modern democracies, the state has become largely responsible for public health. State actors, including elected officials of a national government, are not in a good position to say, “We run the hospitals, we pay the doctors, we decide what drugs may be prescribed, but you’re on your own in this public health crisis.” It seems good and proper, then, to ask what norms, rules, organizational structures, principles, processes, and procedures might best ensure that the actions the state takes in a public health crisis will do as much good and as little harm as reasonably possible. We need to set up good systems ahead of time because it is too late once crisis hits. I raise a big question for which I have no grand comprehensive answer. I think I can answer, however, an important sub-question. How should national governments arrange for the provision of expert advice? When addressing health crises, national governments should and will seek expert advice. I have some suggestions about how to structure the provision of such advice. The gist of my idea is to simulate a freewheeling market for expert advice. My approach and my general principles apply to any modern democratic government, I think. I nevertheless will concentrate my attention on the United Kingdom (UK) and its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), in part because I am more familiar with it than comparable bodies elsewhere. I intend my analysis to be useful and practical. To suggest impracticable “reforms” is not thinking; it is daydreaming. It would be wrong to impose an idle dream on busy readers. And it may be that SAGE is headed for reform. One report says, “The role of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is likely to be reviewed when the Covid pandemic is over, government sources have said” (Rayner, 2021). The prospective inquiry “is expected to scrutinise Sage and consider whether such a monolithic body should hold so much power.” I intend my analysis to be useful in such an inquiry. My suggestions are not unalterable marching orders or detailed blueprints. They are suggestive. Many stakeholders should contribute to the reform process, and they have different perspectives and know different things. Reforms that do not emerge from deliberation among those stakeholders are unlikely to achieve their stated ends. Deliberation may be guided, however, by general principles hammered out ahead of time. Should stakeholders bring inconsistent principles to the table, the conflicts must be resolved. And some general principles may emerge from the deliberative process. Some general principles, however, must be identified beforehand. It is in that spirit that I outline some general principles implied by information choice theory and sketch the broad contours of reform suggested by those principles. Public health in the United Kingdom “is primarily a devolved matter”. Each of the four nations of the United Kingdom largely have independent authority in matters of public health. Thus, Covid lockdown policies may vary from nation to nation within the United Kingdom And, “In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) is the umbrella term for the four health systems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland” (Institute for Government, 2021a). That devolution introduces some complexities to both the structure of SAGE and its role in the United Kingdom. For example, the “Welsh Government Technical Advisory Group” exists “to ensure that scientific and technical information and advice, including advice coming from the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) for COVID-19, is developed and interpreted in order to ensure” several outcomes, including the interpretation of “SAGE outputs and their implications for a Welsh context” (Welsh Government, n.d.). The complexities of devolution would have to be considered, of course, at some point in any inquiry scrutinizing SAGE. As far as I can tell, however, the complexities do not affect the general principles I lay down below. In this paper, therefore, I will ignore them from here on. My proposed improvements, as I have said, would create within SAGE a simulated market for expert advice. Governmental bodies such as SAGE cannot somehow contain a free market for expert advice. An imperfect simulation is the best we can do. Improvement always is possible and always a worthy goal. But state bureaucracies necessarily are hierarchical no matter our attempts to simulate a polycentric market order within them. Thus, they cannot always be as nimble and adaptive as we would wish. We should adjust our expectations to that inescapable reality.",10
195.0,1.0,Public Choice,07 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00926-6,Foucault and Hayek on public health and the road to serfdom,April 2023,Mark Pennington,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The coronavirus pandemic has led many countries to introduce unprecedented restrictions on personal and enterprise freedom, restrictions justified by scientific discourses on ‘public health’. Prior to the pandemic those discourses appear also to have contributed to the expansion of the regulatory state into ‘lifestyle governance’. While not rejecting a role for the state in public health, this paper draws on the perspectives of the French social theorist Michel Foucault and the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek to illustrate the mechanisms through which public health discourses may undermine a liberal social order. Whereas public choice theory focuses on the incentives facing agents to examine related questions, this paper understands those incentives as shaped by discursive social constructions, and especially a scientific rationalism that may affect the identity, power, and positionality of the actors concerned. Foucault’s perspective has been very influential for interpretive political scientists (Bevir & Blakely, 2018) and the analysis here shows its relevance for the ‘economic approach to politics’. Hayek’s perspective is better known to economists and his ‘road to serfdom’ thesis shares important parallels with public choice accounts (Boettke, 1995). The similarities between Hayek’s subjectivist socioeconomic theory and Foucault’s social constructionist perspective may, however, be less familiar to Public Choice readers, much as they may be to Foucauldian analysts who often consider liberal political economy guilty of atomism and reductionism. What follows, therefore, is a provisional attempt to highlight some empirical and normative issues that bridge the political economy focus of Public Choice with the social constructionist elements in Foucault’s and Hayek’s work. In making the connections the paper contributes to the Hayekian, Foucauldian, and public choice literatures related to public health. First, it adds to the small but growing Hayekian literature on the ‘knowledge problems’ of pandemic response (Bylund & Packard, 2021; Candela & Jacobsen, 2021; Coyne et al., 2021; Pennington, 2021; Storr et al., 2021). Whereas those contributions emphasize problems of uncertainty in identifying appropriate policy, this paper focuses on how background discursive constructions may empower certain actors working in the same epistemic conditions to define ‘solutions’ and to ‘police the truth’. Correspondingly, the paper complements the Foucauldian literature on ‘bio-power’ and ‘power-knowledge’ that emphasises the role of scientific rhetoric in sustaining the prestige of public health experts (Esposito, 2011; Hannah et al., 2020). Hayek’s critique of ‘scientism’ will be shown to complement the Foucauldian approach by destabilising the epistemic authority of such expertise. With respect to public choice theory, significant work emphasizes the importance of rent seeking and bureaucratic capture in public health policies (Leeson & Thomson, 2021) and in related fields such as disaster management (Shughart, 2006). Though not yet applied to public health a literature emphasising how discursive–cultural phenomena may impact rent-seeking dynamics is growing. Choi and Storr (2019), for example, show how rent seeking can be activated within cultural–discursive settings that socially construct political activity in zero sum or negative sum terms. Elsewhere, Chamlee-Wright and Storr (2010, 2011) explore the role governmental narratives, and the stories citizens tell about their governments can play in affecting the expectations and abilities of communities to address collective action dilemmas and to limit rent seeking. This paper adds to that literature by exploring how public health discourses may marginalise certain subjectivities through a moralization and essentialization of externalities and collective action problems. It also points to the role played by discourse in structuring the capacities of different groups to engage in successful rent seeking. The paper commences by synthesizing Foucault and Hayek on the political economy of freedom, social constructionism, and social control. It proceeds to analyze the processes through which liberal freedoms might be undermined in the context of pandemic response. It turns finally to broader discursive processes that predate the current pandemic and that may already have been morphing ‘constitutions of liberty’ into ‘constitutions of control’.",4
195.0,1.0,Public Choice,27 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-021-00944-4,Epidemic disease and the state: Is there a tradeoff between public health and liberty?,April 2023,Mark Koyama,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, I examine the relationship between epidemic disease and the state. Specifically, I consider the existence of a tradeoff between public health and freedom in both the short run and the long run. Although in recent decades, many scholars have emphasized the significance of epidemics in history (e.g. McNeil, 1974; Brooke, 2014; Campbell, 2016), and historians have documented the rise of the public health movement in the 19th century, disease rarely has featured in prominent political economy accounts of the rise of the modern state. With a few exceptions, it has been confined to histories of disease and medicine, and either popular science (e.g., Crawford, 2000) or specialist studies, rather than foregrounded in the major treatments in historical sociology (for instance Mann, 1986; Tilly, 1990; Ertman, 1997; Scott, 1999; Fukuyama, 2011), political economy (Brennan & Buchanan, 1980; Glaeser & Shleifer, 2003; Besley & Persson, 2011), or economic history (Higgs, 1987; North, 1981; Lindert, 2004).Footnote 1 One exception to this generalization is the important work of Werner Troesken. Troesken (2004, 2015) studied the tradeoff between freedom and control of disease in the United States. But, as documented by Leeson and Thompson (2021), until recently little work has been done by public choice scholars on the intersection of epidemic disease and the state. Although, following the Covid-19 pandemic, that neglect already has begun to be remedied (see, for example March, 2021). Disease, and attempts to control disease, have played major roles in the evolution of states throughout history. In particular, the rise of modern states in the 19th century saw massive investments in sanitation, the beginning of publicly funded medical research, and the rise of public health infrastructure. Considerable research has explored the extent to which those developments, in conjunction with the scientific breakthroughs of the same period, notably the germ theory of disease, were responsible for the remarkable increase in life expectancy that occurred between 1850 and 1950 (see Mckeown et al., 1975; Harris, 2004; Harris & Hinde, 2019). At the same time, there was a dark side to the public health movement as the authority granted to public health officials was associated with numerous abuses, the most notable of which included forced sterilizations, and the denial of medical treatment to specific populations. In this paper, I focus on epidemic disease. Contagious diseases pose major challenges to any society. But such diseases pose specific challenges to a liberal social order.Footnote 2 A liberal social order is one that is organized around the principle that, with a few well-defined exceptions, individuals generally can make decisions that are best for themselves. Indeed, the case for a liberal society can be seen as resting on two pillars. The first pillar is the moral intuition that granting individuals this freedom is a good, in and of itself. The second pillar is the empirical claim that a society based on classical liberalism will do better in terms of allowing individuals to flourish as human beings. An important component of that view is that liberalism will make one rich (as argued by McCloskey, 2006). But the benefits of liberalism are broader still: they include good health and longer life expectancy. The presence of novel, dangerous epidemic diseases threatens both pillars. As such, epidemic disease itself is a threat to the liberal order. What principles should guide our response to such threats? Adam Smith observed that “these exertions of natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger the security of the whole society are, and ought to be, restrained by laws of all governments, of the most free as well as of the most despotic” (ii.ii Smith, 1776, emphasis added). Moreover, Smith, in discussing how military institutions may be justified for maintaining a martial spirit in the population, took it for granted that a state will devote “its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy or any other loathsome and offensive disease ... from spreading itself among them, though perhaps no other public good might result from such attention besides the prevention of so great a public evil” (Smith, 1776, v. iii. 345).Footnote 3 John Stuart Mill’s (1989) harm principle also offers the basis for numerous public health interventions, at least for harms judged to be sufficiently large and morally serious. Indeed, as Epstein (2003, 2004) documents, constitutional scholars and the US Supreme Court in the Lochner era, recognized the legitimacy of public health inventions that were limited to containing the spread of contagious disease.Footnote 4 The economic theory of externalities pioneered by Alfred Marshall, Pigou (1952) and Ronald Coase (1960) also can justify widespread government action if the externalities in question are large, non-pecuniary, and difficult to observe and measure. On the other side of the ledger, and as Mill himself recognized, classical liberal thought warns that the power of government to regulate the spread of epidemic disease—known in American law as the quarantine power—can easily be misused (see Parmet, 2008). Perhaps the most notorious example of medical malpractice by public health authorities, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, begun in the 1930s and continued as late as the early 1970s. The aim was to study the long-run effects of syphilis in African American men. To that end, the study’s participants were examined, had their blood drawn, and their corpses subjected to autopsies, but they were not given proper medical treatment. That protocol became all the more egregious once penicillin was developed to treat syphilis. Tuskegee’s medical intervention had a lasting negative impact on public health. Alsan and Wanamaker (2018) documents the adverse long-term consequences of that episode of medical malpractice. Specifically, they find that older African Americans living close to Macon County, Alabama—the site of the Tuskegee experiments—were less likely to visit a doctor or utilize the healthcare system more generally. That response translates into a mortality penalty of 4 percentage points for older African American males and accounts for some for 35% of the life expectancy gap between black and white men in 1980. A similar experience occurred in West Africa as a result of medical interventions undertaken during French colonial rule (Lowes & Montero, 2021). Other examples include the forcible sterilization of African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s studied by Price and Darity (2010). Two lessons can be drawn here and both are important. Major threats such as pandemics can justify widespread government intervention for the duration of the pandemic. But many other historical examples of governments using epidemic diseases to justify violating medical ethics can be identified—including withholding treatment or violating patents’ autonomy by performing surgeries without consent, hence abusing their power. Nonetheless, it does not follow from the simple fact that the extensive governmental powers granted to combat diseases can be or have been abused, that no such powers ever should be granted. In liberal societies, alternative means are available to check such abuses like electoral constraints, independent judicial review, and an independent media. Setting aside well-known caveats concerning the young or mentally incapacitated, a liberal society handles most individual-level risks without resorting to coercive measures. Individuals who vary in their risk preferences, can calculate the possibility of dying from skydiving, smoking, or driving a car and can make informed decisions. They need not calculate those probabilities perfectly; because the underlying probability distributions for such events are stationary, reliance on simple heuristics will enable them to make informed decisions about the tradeoffs involved. This framework likewise can handle most externalities and instances of informational asymmetries. Many individual-level externalities can be internalized through markets and social norms. For instance, the external risk my reckless driving poses to others is, to an extent, internalized by insurance premiums. The same goes for skydiving. Many informational asymmetries can be ameliorated by warrantees or firms that aggregate information (i.e., review accident sites, for example). Other externalities may require government intervention. Here, one simple principle that accords with classical liberalism is stated by Buchanan and Tullock (1962): externalities should be resolved at the lowest level at which the externalities in question can be internalized. Thus, local ordinances or city- or state-level laws often are more appropriate for handing many externalities. A new and highly contagious epidemic disease provides a different set of challenges, however. Unlike the examples considered above, with a novel epidemic disease such as Covid-19, at least initially, the probability of death or serious harm was not a stable number over which individuals could form well-defined beliefs. In the initial phase of the epidemic, the magnitudes of the externalities were unknown.Footnote 5 Early on in the pandemic many commentators were led astray. The probability of catching Covid-19 depends on the share of the population currently exposed to the virus, which is unknown, but might be rising rapidly over time. Moreover, the probability of dying from Covid-19 does not depend only on the virulence of the virus and how it interacts with underlying conditions, but more pertinently on the crowdedness and capacity of the healthcare system ten days or two weeks from now. Thus. comments like the following made by the editor of the New Criterion, Roger Kimball in March 2020 that “you have a 0.000000155963303 chance of contracting and dying from this dread disease?” were nonsensical, because at the time no stable estimate on which individuals could make accurate decisions. Furthermore, in contrast to the case with localized and stable externalities, little benefit is found in allowing local city or state-level authorities to adopt pandemic policies autonomously, as argued by Congleton (2021), because the size of the externality itself depends on the local policies that are being chosen. If the externalities extend across hundreds or thousands of miles, then pandemic policies should be coordinated at a nation or even global level.Footnote 6 The likely constraint here is that governance problems, including both coordination problems and principal-agent problems often worsen with the size and scope of government. From a classical liberal perspective, individual-level or private sector responses when and where feasible, are preferable to government mandates. Dangerous drivers are penalized partially by higher insurance premiums, a market response that counterbalances, to a degree, the negative externality imposed by bad drivers. Of course, that market-driven response does not negate the need for criminal sanctions for reckless driving. But, at the margin, insurance premiums scaled to accident risk reduce the need for traffic patrols and police stops. But the market-based response took time to emerge. The profit opportunities available to entrepreneurs from selling provide insurance became apparent over a period of decades in the early 20th century. In the initial 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, no market-based mechanisms were in place capable of penalizing individuals who failed to practice social distancing, who did not self-isolate after becoming symptomatic, or did not wear masks. That is not to say that the private sector did not contribute (or could not have contributed further had it been permitted) to mitigating the spread of virus—private manufacturers like 3M played critical roles in producing personal protective equipment (PPE) and many instances could be cited of private companies such as alcohol distillers reorganizing so as to produce hand-sanitizers—but the brunt of the response to the epidemic was, and had to be, organized politically. Another possible alternative mechanism for the internalization of externalities that would lessen the need for government mandates and restrictions are social norms. It is probably no coincidence that Japan experienced both a relatively small number of fatalities from Covid-19 during 2020 and promulgated relatively loose constraints on its population. It is at least plausible that pre-existing Japanese social norms concerning mask use, social distancing, handwashing, and a high level of compliance with governmental advice helped to minimize the early spread of Covid-19.Footnote 7 Perhaps paradoxically, attempts to downplay the severity of the virus by libertarian advocates criticizing mask use or advocating unnecessary travel, might have led to, and indeed justify, more onerous government intervention.Footnote 8 As our understanding of the factors responsible for various failures during the Covid-19 pandemic is evolving, it is important to take a historical perspective. In the remainder of the present paper, I first consider the role played by epidemic disease in the rise of modern states. I seek to evaluate both the benefits and the potential dangers of granting a state the power to combat epidemic disease. Specifically, I address the supposed tradeoff between public health and liberty in both the short run and the long run and I consider how the tradeoff can be moderated or even eliminated.",8

Furton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Liberal institutions are often justified on consequentialist grounds.Footnote 1 A common presupposition is that institutional structures offering a high degree of individual autonomy combined with constraints on discretionary political power will, on net, generate beneficial systemic effects (Hayek, 2011). Infectious disease outbreaks, however, present a unique challenge to liberal institutions (Koyama, 2021). The inherently ‘public’ nature of communicable disease calls into question the virtues of both individual autonomy and government constraint (Dees, 2018; Gersovitz, 2011). The rapid onset of a pandemic supplies a pretext for the deliberate curtailing individual liberty in the name of protecting human health, effectively ‘trading off’ some of the former for more of the latter (Ansell & Lindvall, 2021; Porter, 1999). Werner Troesken, in The Pox of Liberty (2015), presents a thorough, historical treatment of the tradeoff between liberty and infectious disease. Using qualitative and quantitative evidence, he shows that American institutions displayed mixed results with respect to health and disease prevention. On the one hand, “smallpox prevention in the continental United States was hindered by its commitment to federalism, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and popular access to a strong and independent judiciary” (p. 69). On the other, these same institutions “fostered investments in urban water systems and contributed to one of the most important public health initiatives in human history” (p. 103). Ironically, Troesken’s research reverses the standard explanation of disease “typically portrayed as the result of poverty and deprivation.… [T]he American experience with smallpox… suggests that the United States had high smallpox rates not despite its being rich and free, but because it was rich and free” (p. 5). In this paper, I cast doubt on the nature of Troesken’s tradeoff by calling attention to the path dependent nature of political institutions. By bringing inter-temporal dynamics to the analysis and accounting for systemic effects of government intervention, the tradeoff between liberty and health appears ambiguous, and at best fluctuates according to the conditions under which public health intervention is executed.Footnote 2 Often, public health intervention expands under conditions of health crises. Within certain windows of institutional and epidemiological fragility, decision-makers face greater urgency and uncertainty with respect to risk (Congleton, 2005; Twigg, 2020). Policymakers, therefore, tend to discount long run costs and place a premium on rapid, short run policy adoption (Lothe, 2020). What follows from the crisis is a series of political contests over preferred policies. Existing interest groups and power holders retain status quo political advantage and can leverage their positions to gain or maintain further advantage. As crisis conditions recede, institutions regain their former durability. However, reforms that were initially contingent on crises circumstances become embedded, generating systemic institutional change and excess government growth over time. Subsequent health crises must then be met by an increasingly large public health apparatus, subject to inefficient or delayed reactions to unexpected disease outbreak. This paper provides a point of connection between two distinct bodies of literature. The first explains institutional change over time through critical junctures and path dependence (Capoccia, 2015).Footnote 3 Scholars in recent decades have emphasized the path dependent nature of choices made under various conditions, both in the market (Arthur, 1994; David, 1985), and in politics (Pierson, 2000). This work often highlights critical junctures as windows of time where institutions temporarily become more fluid, enabling more significant reform. Crises moments are studied as critical junctures, where enduring institutional changes are more likely to take hold. The trend of massive government growth observed worldwide in the late nineteenth and twentieth century has been explained using theories of path dependence (Higgs, 1987; Holcombe, 2005). I supplement this literature with specific application to health crises and the expansion of the public health domain of government. Using insights from rational choice theory (à la Shepsle, 2006), I connect the literature on institutional change and path dependence with health and epidemiological economics. The latter, in orthodox fashion, routinely frame questions in terms of ‘optimal’ policies (Acemoglu et al., 2021; Alvarez et al., 2021; Bloom et al., 2022; Eichenbaum et al., 2021; Gersovitz & Hammer, 2004; Hall et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2021). When deducing optimal health policies and assessing the tradeoff between public health and individual liberty, epidemiological economists often relegate their range of study to the short run or implicitly assume that institutional structures remain constant. A shortcoming of the approach is that it sets a normative standard (optimality) which is static. What is considered ‘optimal’ within a short time horizon may not be ‘optimal’ when that horizon expands. Static approaches overlook the dynamics of government intervention, intertemporal tradeoffs, and the fragility of institutions amid crises.Footnote 4 An additional critique, explored by Coyne et al. (2021), is that models used by economic epidemiologists derive policy conclusions from assumptions that stray too far from reality. For example, SIR models often assume a benevolent social planner whose aim is “to minimize a combination of total (excess) deaths during the pandemic, lives lost… and economic losses…” (Acemoglu et al., 2021, p. 492). Insofar as tradeoffs are considered, they are often presented in absence of more relevant institutional, behavioral, or inter-temporal constraints.Footnote 5 Health economics could benefit from including in their conceptual framework the potential for more intertemporal effects on health, precipitated via institutional change. In the following section, I explore the tradeoff between public health and individual liberty through a review of the literature on infectious disease and the state. Section 3 explains growth in political institutions through path dependence and critical junctures. In Sect. 4, I argue that crises moments exacerbate the tendency toward path dependent reforms, generating costly and excessive government expansion. Section 5 illustrates the nature of political path dependence through the historical development of U.S. public health and the obstacles created by embedded bureaucratic and political institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 6 concludes.",3

But, during a pandemic, the total costs of price-gouging regulations can be more severe than shelves lying bare and people struggling to find what they need. The resulting shortages may lead to more social contact in crowded stores at the worst possible time; at a time when social contact spreads a dangerous pathogen. In short, activating price-gouging laws during pandemics may aggravate contagion. We test this concerning possibility. Specifically, we examine whether activating price-gouging regulation increased social contact in commercial spaces in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic’s abrupt emergence triggered a variety of public policy responses in Spring 2020. Many US states implemented mitigation policies such as “stay-at-home orders” to discourage social contact and slow the spread by encouraging “social distancing.” Many US states also activated price-gouging regulation to discourage sellers from increasing prices during the emerging crisis. For instance, Governor Northam of Virginia issued a statewide “stay-at-home” order for state residents on Monday, March 30, 2020, to help contain the pandemic’s outbreak.Footnote 1 The very next day, the VA attorney general issued a statement announcing stronger crackdowns on price-gouging.Footnote 2 While mitigation policies aimed to decrease social contact and flatten the infection curve, simultaneously activating price-gouging regulation, our proposed mechanism suggests, undermined this goal. Prior work indicates price-gouging regulation creates shortages (Brewer, 2007; Chakraborti & Roberts, 2020, 2021a, 2021b; Deacon & Sonstelie, 1985), and shortages result in increased consumer searches (Barzel, 1974; Chakraborti & Roberts, 2020, 2021a; Deacon & Sonstelie, 1985, 1989; Weitzman, 1991). Motivated by the toilet paper stockpiling consumers engaged in during the early days of the pandemic, Klumpp (2021) establishes a feedback loop between fixed-price-induced shortages and consumer searches and stockpiling behavior. Our work extends this literature by proposing and testing a new cost associated with price-gouging regulation. Using county-level daily data on social contact and mobility, we find evidence consistent with the impact of price-gouging regulation we hypothesize. The results demonstrate price regulation-induced increases in social contact more than offset the stay-at-home-order-induced decreases. Exploiting the pandemic-induced variation in price-gouging regulation, standard two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences (TWFE DiD) estimates uncover a strong association between price-gouging law activation and more visits to, and interpersonal contacts in, commercial spaces, even after accounting for the influence of observed and unobserved county-level and daily heterogeneity in a variety of ways. Given recent concerns about the TWFE DiD methodology, e.g., Goodman-Bacon (2021), in the presence of treatment-effect heterogeneity, we also present event studies based on estimators robust to these concerns, and find further support for these results. Our results contribute to existing literature in two important ways. First, our work identifies a severe, but yet unnoticed, external cost associated with activating price-gouging regulation during pandemics. The new cost we identify will be relevant for the vigorous policy debate surrounding the impacts of price-gouging laws (e.g., Brewer, 2007; Culpepper & Block, 2008; Fleck, 2014; Montgomery et al., 2007; Niles, 2020; Pan, 2020; Snyder, 2009; Zwolinski, 2008). The discovery of this new cost of price-gouging regulation during pandemics adds to the emerging but still scarce literature on price-gouging specific to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Boshoff, 2021; Cabral & Xu, 2020; Chakraborti & Roberts, 2020, 2021a). Second, our results offer an explanation for recent unanticipated findings regarding mitigation strategies. Recent studies find lower-than-anticipated effectiveness of mitigation policies like stay-at-home orders in curbing the pandemic’s spread (e.g., Herby et al., 2022; Bendavid et al., 2021; Reinbold 2022; Gupta et al., 2020). Our results suggest an unnoticed role of price-gouging regulations—increasing social contact and undermining mitigation—behind these surprising findings. Our results should concern policymakers. Recent studies find strong connections between lower community-level mobility and lower COVID-19 case growth (Wellenius et al., 2021), or higher incidence of people staying at home and lower COVID-19 case growth (Guo et al., 2022). These connections, paired with our findings, indicate price-gouging regulation may well have increased COVID-19 case growth during the critical early stages of the pandemic.",1
