Yet, these numbers do not capture the often low quality of the services that are provided. The need for reform of water and sanitation service delivery is therefore urgent, especially in urban areas. Many countries are embarking on organizational reforms that are needed to improve water provision, which include changes in the way utilities are managed, higher charges for water and sewerage services,Footnote 1 and regulation of the sector. Insight into households’ preferences for access to safe, accessible water is needed for the development of the reforms under consideration. Households’ decisions to connect to a piped (safe) water network are based on the comparison of associated costs and expected benefits. The connection costs are usually not too difficult to quantify. Yet, estimating benefits is often complicated, as it requires insight into the households’ expected changes in welfare from getting a private connection to the network.Footnote 2
 Households without a connection to the piped network face several costs. First, they face hauling costs to collect water from non-piped sources (private or public wells, public taps, water vended from trucks, etc.). Second, in some cases they have to pay high prices per unit of non-piped water purchased. Finally, non-piped water may be of lower quality than water provided through the piped water system. Hence, connecting a household to the piped water network is likely to make access to safe water easier, unit prices lower, and the incidence of water-related diseases smaller. The value of a connection to the piped network can be estimated using either stated preference or revealed preference methods. A typical stated preference approach is to ask a sample of unconnected households about their maximum willingness to pay for a water connection. This approach has been widely used, for example, by Whittington et al. (2002) for Nepal and Pattanayak et al. (2004) for Sri Lanka. The most common revealed preference approach is the “hedonic property valuation method”. This approach infers the value of water connections from differences in property values according to connection status. It has been used in developing countries, among others, by North and Griffin (1993) for the Philippines. They find a willingness to pay of 2.4 percent of monthly household income (which corresponds to 47 percent of monthly rent) or less, with the share falling as income rises. Comparable estimates have been found by Whittington et al. (1990) for rural Kenya and Yusuf and Koundouri (2005) for Indonesia. De Oca et al. (2003) find that households are willing to pay 5.8 percent of their monthly household income for well-maintained services and up to 8.3 percent for improved services in Mexico City. Harapap and Hartono (2007) estimate that the availability of piped or pumped water in Indonesia increases house rental prices in urban areas by 9.1 percent. Somewhat lower results have been obtained by Suparman et al. (2009) who estimate the value of piped water at approximately 8 percent of mean household monthly income in rural and urban areas in Indonesia. Nauges et al. (2009) find that tap water connection adds 10–52 percent to the sales value of a house in El Salvador, depending on the non-tap source. For poor neighborhoods in Guatemala they obtain a lower range of 14–19 percent. Anselin et al. (2008) find a hedonic price of INR 170 in Bangalore (2001) and INR 119 in Bhopal (2003), but without reference to household incomes. The present paper reports hedonic price analysis results based on a household survey in Southwest Sri Lanka in 2003-04. This survey was undertaken to support the Government of Sri Lanka in its decision to engage private operators in managing and expanding water and sewerage services in two services areas (Greater Negombo and the Kalutara-Galle coastal strip). The basic objective of the survey was to get a better understanding of the demand for piped water services, and hence consumer preferences, which would be used to shape the envisaged private sector participation. Particularly, estimates of the willingness to pay for connection to the piped network would be used to calculate connection fees and monthly service charges, which would not discourage households to connect; for further details see Van den Berg et al. (2006). The results obtained in this paper complement Pattanayak et al. (2006) who estimate the willingness to pay for piped water by means of contingent valuation for the same sample of households. The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the hedonic price method and in Sect. 3 the sampling design and the model specification. In Sect. 4 we present the estimation results and in Sect. 5 the main conclusions.",18

J. Schoenmaker,Arno J. Van der Vlist,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Real estate development, or the process of land development to construct commercial and residential buildings, shapes tomorrow’s urban scene. This is because real estate development governs future land-use and the associated spatial distribution of jobs and houses. As such, it provides public planners with an instrument to steer urbanization. More specifically, real estate development allows public planners to provide residents with a sense of cohesion and security, to contribute to job creation and a more prosperous and viable economy, and to a more sustainable and energy-efficient built environment (Power 2004). As a consequence, real estate development is intrinsically linked to almost every major area of government policy (see, for the Netherlands, Rijksoverheid 2012). A specific public policy aim is to improve the conditions in which people live, work and relax, suggesting a spatial link between residential and commercial real estate development. The focus of this paper is on the relationship between commercial and residential regional real estate developments. To address this issue, we build upon the literature regarding the spatial distribution of jobs and people. First, we draw on the planning literature that addresses how urban planning and development management affects the job-housing balance (where people live and where they work) and associated implications for future commuting patterns (see Cervero 1995; Zhao et al. 2011). This so-called job-housing balance, which measures the distribution of employment (jobs) relative to the distribution of workers (households) in terms of spatial proximity, depends on the relationship between commercial and residential real estate development. Urban planning and development instruments, such as zoning, height and density restrictions and growth moratoria, all influence commercial and residential real estate development. These regulations typically also regulate land-use and thereby land-use changes, implying that commercial and residential real estate developments competeFootnote 1 (see Evans 2004) in terms of land, labour and development finance (Meen 2002). Such land-use regulations create a substitution (crowding-out) effect between commercial and residential real estate development activities and thus affect the distribution of where people live and work. Second, the geography and economic literature addresses how people and firms make locational choices. These studies stress the behavioural and dynamic relationship between jobs and people, and question whether people follow jobs, or jobs follow people (Hoogstra 2013). Haig (1926) argued that space and time constraints result in people and jobs being within close proximityFootnote 2. In addition, Papageorgiou and Thisse (1985) suggest that households are attracted to places with a high density of firms (agglomeration economies) because of better job opportunities. Furthermore, the literature also suggests that firms are attracted to places with a high density of households because the generated business volume is expected to be higher. In other words, employees (households) want to live in places with many good choices of work, while firms like to locate where many good potential employees live. So firms will locate near people and people will locate near firms, creating a complementary effect in the relationship between commercial and residential real estate developments, and thus where people live and work. Studies on the relationship between commercial and residential real estate developments have considered whether commercial and residential real estate developments substitute or complement each other, and contradictory findings can be observed. Green (1997) concluded that commercial and residential investments are positively correlated over time,Footnote 3 with Coulson and Kim (2002) finding similar results. Wigren and Wilhelmsson (2007), however, found a crowding-out or substitution effect within the European construction industry. Meen (2002)Footnote 4 who had considered industrial real estate development had suggested something similar in the relationship between industrial real estate and residential real estate development. Gyourko (2009)Footnote 5 noted that although commercial and residential real estate markets do show differences they indeed share fundamentals suggesting a substitution effect between commercial and residential real estate developments. We contribute to this debate by considering whether commercial and residential real estate developments are complementary or substitute for each other. We consider the relationship between commercial and residential real estate developments on a regional level. Following Broitman and Koomen (2014), we believe that it is important to disaggregate national level data to regional areas as real estate development differs substantially over space. Disaggregation is important as political and economic conditions, including supply, agglomeration economies, land use regulations and local governments, play an important role (Mayer and Somerville 2000; Vermeulen and Ommeren 2009). As such, addressing the relationship between commercial and residential real estate developments on a regional basis will enable the measurement of any regional substitution or complementary effects in that relationship and thus in the spatial distribution of jobs and households.

According to Oswald’s thesis (see Oswald 1996, 1997, 1999) there is a positive correlation between the two: a ten percentage points increase in the share of homeowners is associated with a two percentage points increase in unemployment. Recently, Blanchflower and Oswald (2013) have reconsidered the thesis. They argue that 
“rises in the homeownership rate in a U.S. state are a precursor to eventual sharp rises in unemployment in that state. The elasticity exceeds unity: a doubling of the rate of home-ownership in a U.S. state is followed in the long-run by more than a doubling of the later unemployment rate.” (Blanchflower and Oswald 2013
, abstract) In the remainder of their paper the authors discuss a number of possible causal mechanisms behind the correlation they observe, that need further investigation. The connection between homeownership and unemployment is policy-relevant, as in many countries homeownership is encouraged (for instance, by the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments). Thus Oswald’s thesis prompts questions of both a policy and a research nature, as is also witnessed in studies by Coulson and Fisher (2009) and Green and Hendershott (2001). In this paper we examine some of the possible causal mechanisms behind the apparently substantial impact of homeownership on labor market outcomes. The next section discusses some issues associated with the interpretation of existing empirical evidence. In Sect. 3 we present a model in which housing tenure and mortgage payments interact with unemployment. In our model the higher exit rates from unemployment of searchers with high housing costs are related to decreasing absolute risk aversion, which is widely believed to be a realistic property of human behavior under risk. The results of an empirical estimation of the model on the basis of Dutch data are reported in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 concludes.",6

However, the role of the CBA in political decision-making processes is a complex one. A priori, the expectation is that transport project proposals with a larger expected social return have a higher chance of being approved by politicians. Nevertheless, as our literature review shows, there is an increasing amount of evidence that CBA outcomes have only a limited impact on political decision-making. Our study analyses the CBA’s for transport projects in The Netherlands between 2000 and 2012. In contrast to most earlier studies (Table 1), which focused on road projects, we include all types of transport projects. Furthermore, we have collected data for both national and regional projects. As such, our study is the first large-scale, systematic statistical analysis on the impact of a CBA outcome on political decision-making. The paper is structured as follows. We present a literature review in Sect. 2 and produce some contextual information in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses the methods and Sect. 5 the results. We end with some concluding remarks (Sect. 6).",24

One reason for this is that competition lies at the very core of economics. Another reason is that cartels and collusive behavior among firms lead to higher prices, which is bad for private consumers and makes the issue of cartel detection highly relevant from a policy perspective. For instance Connor (2004) found the median increase in price attributable to collusion to be around 25 %. Even though cartels and collusive bidding behavior are illegal, they exist and attempts to coordinate price-setting and production volumes are often effective. Antitrust authorities (and sometimes competing firms and private consumers) do their best to find and report suspicious behavior, but cartels are often difficult to detect. Harrington (2008) suggests that one should start by looking at markets characterized by few rivals and homogenous products, but there are many markets with exactly those characteristics. Other indicators to look for are suspicious patterns of behavior such as direct evidence of communication via illicit meetings and messages, or patterns in prices and quantities that indirectly reveal collusion. This study lies within the last of these traditions, which Harrington further divides into tests based on four questions: 1. Does the actual behavior differ significantly from that which should follow from competitive behavior? 2. Is there a structural break in behavior that could, for example, mark the formation or demise of a cartel? 3. Does the behavior of a set of firms that are suspected to have formed a cartel differ from that of other firms? 4. Does a collusion model better describe the available data than a competitive model? The method described herein is based on the third kind. The main purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the Moran’s I test statistic can be used to test for potential collusive bidding behavior (complementary bidding among cartel members) on public contracts. The test builds on the work of Moran (1948) and was generalized by Cliff and Ord (1972) in order to derive a test for spatial correlation in linear regression models; it has since become probably the most frequently used test for spatial correlation.Footnote 1 The main advantage of the proposed method lies in its simplicity and comparatively modest data requirements, which make it suitable for use by organizations such as antitrust authorities as a fairly simple way of screening large numbers of different markets and procurements for potentially suspicious bidding behavior.Footnote 2 It’s low data requirement is of importance as the collection of complementary information (besides the separate bids) from procurements is costly, time consuming and in some cases almost impossible.Footnote 3 The test is applied to data relating to the so-called Swedish asphalt cartel, which was detected in 2001, and the analysis presented here complements that of Bergman et al. (2015), who apply a spatial lag regression approach on the same data set to verify the cartel’s existence.Footnote 4 It should be noted that while methods such as those proposed herein can be used to obtain evidence suggestive of collusion or cartel activity, we would be the first to acknowledge that additional evidence and other forms of proof would be required to support any kind of legal action.Footnote 5
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows: a brief review of the asphalt cartel’s history along with a description of the data set used and the Moran’s I statistic are given in Sect. 2. This section also contains the very important definition of the elements of the spatial weights matrix.Footnote 6 The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 3, and concluding comments are given in the final section.",1

The effects of this fact have been extensively studied in a wide array of fields, including political science, geography, and economics. However, among the ever growing number of studies that employ spatial econometrics to control for spatial effects, distinguishing between different types of borders, or taking borders into account at all, is rare. This goes both for spatial dependence, where the underlying relationship is one of direct influence, and for spatial heterogeneity, where the effects themselves vary over space (Getis 1994). In this paper, we demonstrate with a simple model how this can be rectified. After a brief discussion of previous attempts in this direction, we discuss our data and the spatial setup of our analysis. Finally, we discuss the results, leading to the conclusion.",2

The circular economy involves a number of activities beyond promoting recycling of waste, such as waste prevention and re-use, material efficiency as well as sharing of products and resources (e.g., with the help of digital platforms) (see also European 2016). Nevertheless, recycling is likely to play a key role also in the future. There is potential for higher recycling rates, not the least for some materials such as plastics. Previous research has also displayed important complementary effects in that policies aimed at facilitating recycling tend to have indirect positive effects also on waste reduction (D’Amato et al. 2016a, b). A key challenge for overall recycling policy (goals etc.), though, is that it is often formulated at the national level. However, the primary responsibility for implementation, monitoring and compliance is typically assigned to local actors. These include local authorities, private entrepreneurs, and individual households. This implies that the effectiveness of recycling policy will be influenced by a complex network of actors, the organization of their respective activities, and the incentives that they face. This paper addresses differences in household recycling outcomes across different municipal jurisdictions in Sweden, and how these outcomes in turn can be linked to differences in geographical and demographic conditions as well as to heterogeneity in waste management policies. Previous research on the determinants of recycling outcomes (e.g., recovery rates) has often relied on case studies of one or more municipalities (e.g., Duggal et al. 1991; Sterner and Bartelings 1999; Thomas 2001; Li 2003; Tonglet et al. 2004; Lyas et al. 2005; Dahlén et al. 2007). Other research has instead focused on inter-country differences in recovery rates (e.g., Berglund and Söderholm 2003; Van Beukering and Bouman 2001). These two types of studies, though, will not fully address the importance of context-specific cost elements and local policy measures. Studies that make use of regional data, e.g., at the municipality level, include Callan and Thomas (1997), Kinnaman and Fullerton (2000), Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2004), Hage and Söderholm (2008), Abrate and Ferraris (2010), Abbott et al. (2011), Sidique et al. (2010), D’Amato et al. (2016a), and Gaeta et al. (2017).Footnote 1 The low level of geographical aggregation in this latter research permits analyses of the impacts of local policies, geography, demography and various socio-economic factors. For instance, the results reported in Abbott et al. (2011) using UK data display the importance of curbside recycling and the frequency of residual waste collection for recycling performance. In this paper we add to the above literature on regional heterogeneity in recycling outcomes, highlighting the role of both policy and various socio-economic determinants (see further below). The purpose of the paper is to analyze the determinants of household plastic waste collection in Swedish municipalities, including the role of local waste management policy, geographical and socio-economic conditions and environmental preferences. This is achieved by using cross-sectional data for 282 Swedish municipalities and spatial econometric methods. The Swedish producer responsibility ordinance for packaging waste was introduced in 1994. It outlines national recycling goals, such as that at least 30 percent of the plastic packaging waste should be recycled, hence used as inputs in new plastic products. The ordinance also states that the producers have the physical and the economic responsibility for the packaging waste, i.e., they are obliged to provide suitable systems for the collection and the recycling of packaging waste. In order to comply with the producer responsibility the producers have established material companies, i.e., one of these administering the plastic packaging waste collection. The producers must also consult with the municipalities. Municipalities in Sweden have been legally obliged to take a key role in informing households about the collection systems as well as in supervising the collection schemes. Households have been obliged to clean and sort out packaging waste from other waste, and (in the absence of curbside recycling) transport used packaging materials to assigned drop-off stations. The policies aimed at encouraging households’ recycling efforts, including waste handling fees, the provision of needed infrastructure etc., are designed and implemented at the municipal level. Finally, the material companies have engaged different collection entrepreneurs that operate in municipalities; these put out and empty the containers at the stations, and transport the plastic waste to recyclers. These operations have to 90 percent been funded through fees paid by the packaging producers (Hage 2007). This thus implies that recycling initiatives and outcomes have not been uniform across the country. Our empirical focus on plastic packaging waste from Swedish households is in part motivated by the fact that—although the aggregate national target has been exceeded in recent years—there is potential for improved household recycling in the case of plastic packaging waste (Dahlén et al. 2013). Figure 1 illustrates the regional heterogeneity by displaying the amounts in kg of household plastic packaging waste per resident that were collected in 282 Swedish municipalities in 2005, ranked from the lowest (i.e., 0.04 kg per resident) to the highest (5.71 kg per resident). Source: Staaf (2006) Household Plastic Packaging Waste Collection across Swedish Municipalities, 2005 (kg/resident)  This heterogeneity across municipalities forms the basis of our empirical investigation, and it permits us to make two overall contributions to existing research in the field. First, we devote particular attention to the effectiveness and the spatial cost-effectiveness of the Swedish policy design. Waste management policies in Sweden have had a strong focus on facilitating households’ recycling activities, not least through increased reliance on so-called property-close waste collection (e.g., SEPA 2005). This includes, for instance, easier access to drop-off stations and containers as well as a more intense use of curbside recycling. In addition, quite a few municipalities have implemented weight-based (rather than volume-based) waste handling fees, and thereby an explicit economic incentive for households to undertake waste sorting activities. Unlike most previous studies we clearly distinguish between different forms of pricing programs while at the same time controlling for the presence of curbside recycling and the density of drop-off stations. This is important if we want to provide reliable policy recommendations, especially because there usually is a close correlation between the presence of unit-based pricing and curbside recycling, respectively (Kinnaman 2006). Furthermore, the analysis can indicate to what extent inter-municipal differences in collection rates are due to important cost differences across regions. It is reasonable to assume that both the private and the environmental costs for different waste management schemes differ across municipalities. For instance, the external costs arising from landfill and burning are probably lower in sparsely populated areas than in urban areas, while marginal collection costs are likely to be relatively high in the former regions (Berglund 2004). However, the Swedish legislation does not appear to acknowledge this cost-heterogeneity in their instructions to producers. Basically, the sole instruction is that the packaging waste collection should be nation-wide, and in practice entrepreneurs that are active in “high-cost” regions tend to obtain comparably high monetary compensations from the material companies (Hage 2007; Hage and Söderholm 2008). Thus, if our empirical analysis indicates that important region-specific collection cost elements tend to have negligible impacts on plastic packaging collection rates, this could be interpreted as support for the hypothesis that the spatial cost-effectiveness of the Swedish policy scheme is low. Second, another key contribution is that we test and control for spatial dependency in waste collection rates. This is relevant when using data collected with references to location, one observation associated with location i will tend to depend on other observations at locations \(i\ne j\) (e.g., Anselin 1988; LeSage 1999). In the household packaging waste case there may be several reasons why recycling outcomes in one municipality can be influenced by policies and practices used in neighboring municipalities. For instance, in some instances neighboring municipalities have started jointly owned waste companies, thus implying that information, collection systems and perhaps even other policies may be standardized in the greater region. Moreover, neighboring municipalities may also meet and exchange experiences, and in this way influence each other’s policies and in turn collection rates. If such spatial interactions exist ordinary least square (OLS) methods produce parameter estimates that are biased and inefficient, and for this reason we employ spatial econometric methods that explicitly address the incorporation of spatial autocorrelation in the econometric estimations.",35

Batabyal,Henk Folmer,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the post-World War II era, regional scientists, geographers, regional economists, and others have been studying the notion of space and its myriad ramifications on people’s lives (Isard 1956). Despite their great and laudable interest in spatial matters, these scientists dealing with spatial issues have been less keen to rigorously model and analyze environmental and natural resource (henceforth ER) problems even though many such problems have a distinct spatial dimension to them.Footnote 1 However, as noted by, amongst others, Batabyal and Nijkamp (2003), this insalubrious state of affairs has begun to change and therefore we now observe a steady increase in modeling-based research on ER problems in, inter alia, regional science and ER economics.Footnote 2 Inspired by the justly famous pre-World War II research of Hotelling (1931), standard textbooks by Fisher (1981), Hartwick and Olewiler (1998), and others show how ER economists have systematically analyzed the temporal dimension of resource utilization. As such, there is now a well-established tradition of analyzing the optimal intertemporal use of exhaustible resources such as coal and oil and the management of renewable resources such as forests, fisheries, and rangelands.Footnote 3 This venerable tradition notwithstanding, Albers et al. (2010) pointed out that ER economists have gradually become increasingly interested in problems where space matters in the last three decades. Two salient factors have led to this increased interest. First, the contributions of researchers such as Holling (1973, 1996), Perrings (1996), and Batabyal et al. (2003), working in the field now known as ecological economics, have convinced most mainstream ER economists that natural resources in general and renewable resources in particular ought to be viewed as jointly determined by factors that are partly economic, partly ecological, and partly spatial in nature. In particular, full understanding of and predictions about ER problems require analysis of both their temporal and spatial dimensions as well as of time–space interactions (see Jaya et al. 2017, 2018). In other words, a comprehensive analysis of an ER problem and related policy require insight into three types of locations: (1) the origin where it is generated, (2) its dispersion and deposition, and (3) a valuation of the impacts at the origin and at the location of its deposition. In this regard, ignorance of the spatial or of the space–time dimensions not only leads to incomplete insight into the nature of the problem but also to biased and inconsistent estimators of the parameters of the non-spatial dimensions due to omitted variables. Recognition of this last point has led ER economists to explicitly study—in addition to time—the role that space plays in their models of, inter alia, natural resource management. Second and as pointed out by Albers et al. (2010) and Ando and Baylis (2014), the development of geographical information system (GIS) data sets has now made it possible to comprehend the use, the benefits, and the management of natural and environmental resources in novel ways. The discussion in the preceding three paragraphs yields two conclusions. First, regional scientists, geographers, and others who have historically focused primarily on spatial problems have now begun to study natural resource and environmental problems. Second, ER economists, who have traditionally focused on the temporal dimension of resource utilization and management problems have now started addressing the spatial characteristics of such problems. The five papers in this topical collection demonstrate some of the progress that has been made in the last three decades in rigorously modeling and analyzing problems at the interface of what we call “space and the environment.” The individual papers cover a variety of topics and, in addition, they 
utilize different analytical techniques. In what follows, we group the five papers into two broad categories. The first three papers concentrate on ER problems in regions that are all located within a single nation. The second two contributions deal with ER problems in regions that are situated in different nations. That said, in all five papers, the word “region” refers to sub-national geographic entities.Footnote 4 With this preliminary discussion out of the way, we now proceed to succinctly comment on the intellectual contributions of the individual papers that comprise this topical collection. To this end, we first focus on the three papers that concentrate on regions located within a single nation.",

Cameron,Jacques Poot,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Greater availability of temporal gross flow data in many types of spatial interaction (trade, migration, tourism, etc.) in recent years has led to origin and destination fixed effects (FE) models becoming the standard approach for the estimation of gravity models, following Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). In a panel setting, the coefficients of the spatial interaction (dyadic) variables are estimable and consistent when origin and destination FE are interacted with period FE (e.g., Baldwin and Taglioni 2006), without recourse to the inclusion of systemic variables which are referred to as multilateral resistance terms in the trade literature (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003) and balancing factors in the migration literature (Alonso 1978). Moreover, when compared with ordinary least squares (OLS), FE models eliminate bias arising from standard error clustering when some variables apply only to the origin or to the destination, and not to both (Feenstra 2004). Peeters (2012) has critiqued the OLS and standard FE estimators for their dissimilarity in coefficient point estimates, but despite this critique and those of others (e.g., Etzo 2011), FE gravity models continue to be widely used (e.g., Lewer and Van den Berg 2008; Aldashev and Dietz 2014). In this paper, we first demonstrate that both the conventional OLS estimator of the classical gravity model of migration and the conventional FE estimator are biased estimators of a spatial interaction data generating process (DGP) with origin and destination time invariant effects. We then show that comparisons of the population size coefficients between OLS and panel FE gravity models are not straightforward. We demonstrate that there should be no expectation that the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients of time-varying origin and destination variables on these models be similar. We then introduce a Best Linear Unbiased (BLU) Estimator for the FE DGP that can be used in gravity model specifications. We illustrate the issue of gravity model estimation with the example of five-yearly internal migration flows between regions of New Zealand over the period 1991–2013.",4

Around the turn of the century, it was formally shown that the sign of the change in capital assets, weighted by shadow prices, is equivalent to the direction of intergenerational (i.e., social) well-being in both optimal and imperfect economies (Hamilton and Clemens 1999; Dasgupta and Mäler 2000). Development is deemed sustainable at a given time t, in the sense of Bruntland Commission (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987), if and only if the aggregate change in the value of produced, human, and natural capital assets increases at t based on their shadow prices (i.e., their contribution to social well-being). Carbon damage, oil capital gains, and total factor productivity (TFP) are also adjusted to account for well-being changes not brought about via these three types of capital assets. TFP signifies the overall efficiency of institutions and the knowledge with which the three types of capital assets are used. Applications of this determinant-based approach to sustainability measurement now abound at varied scales and levels of rigor (Arrow et al. 2012; Greasley et al. 2014; World Bank 2011; Yamaguchi et al. 2016). Among them, the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) was inaugurated in accordance with the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, ‘Rio + 20’, in 2012. IWR 2012 measured the produced, human, and natural capital of 20 large economies (UNU-IHDP and UNEP 2012). Their follow-up, IWR 2014, covered these three types of capital for 140 countries, 1990–2014 (UNU-IHDP and UNEP 2014). Now, IWR 2018 (Managi and Kumar 2018) has been published, and it is summarized in the current paper. Moreover, we propose some corrections and further discuss global wealth, the wealth-income ratio, and comparisons with the World Bank’s measurement of wealth.",14

In a spatial context, the firm’s price policy determines how transport costs are reflected in local prices with increasing distance to the firm’s location. If the spatial price schedule follows the development of transport costs, i.e., local prices decrease as transport costs increase with distance, the firm uses mill or non-discriminatory pricing. However, if local prices do not reflect the transport cost difference between two locations, there is spatial price discrimination (Phlips 1983). One important instance of spatial price discrimination is uniform (delivered) pricing where the firm charges the same price to all consumers irrespective of their location. The firm’s pricing decision crucially affects profit, output, and social welfare (Beckmann 1976; Greenhut et al. 1987). Yet the ranking of alternative spatial price strategies (based on economic benefits) depends, e.g., on the shape of individual consumer demand functions (Smithies 1941; Cheung and Wang 1996) or whether the firm is able to optimize its market area (Hsu 2006). Always, however, conclusions are derived for the case of constant marginal costs. The objective of this paper is to relax this assumption and to examine the effect of variable marginal costs on the ranking of uniform and mill pricing in a general monopoly framework. We focus on these two pricing options because they are easy to administer (Espinosa 1992), important in different markets and regions (Greenhut 1981), most previous studies (including Hsu 1983; Cheung and Wang 1996; Hsu 2006; Lederer 2012) compare these options, which provides a point of reference, and both price strategies represent the limits of no (mill pricing) and full (uniform pricing) freight costs absorption. Before the investigation of mill and uniform pricing in a general monopoly setting, I briefly review the most relevant literature. The subsequent presentation and discussion of the results illustrate that, in contrast to prior work focusing on constant marginal costs, the monopolists optimal price is not independent of transport costs and that mill pricing does not always provide higher consumer surplus within the optimal market area.",3

Overall, there is a vast literature on spatial data analysis with a rather heterogeneous treatment of spatial dependence and spillover structures (see, for example, Zoller 2004). Spatial econometric specifications (LeSage and Pace 2009) make the spatial dependence structures among the observations particularly explicit (Bivand et al. 2015). These approaches aim at highlighting the importance of directly accounting for spatial interdependencies among the observations under scrutiny and have recently gained momentum particularly in the regional science and economics literature. Spatial econometric specifications use so-called spatial weight matrices in order to augment standard classical linear model specifications by allowing for spatial spillovers among the observations (see, LeSage and Pace 2009; Anselin 2013). Multiple previous studies highlight the importance of spatial econometrics for capturing disease transmission pathways and network effects, as well as in quantifying the magnitude of spatial spillovers (see, e.g. Emch et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2015; Chagas et al. 2016). For modelling the recent coronavirus pandemic, allowing for spatial dependence appears of predominant importance. In the beginning of the crisis (January 2020), the virus was often seen as a Chinese and later an Italian problem. However, due to the rapid spread of the virus across the globe, almost all Western countries reacted by employing drastic measures to contain or delay the further spread of the virus. These measures entail considerable restrictions in every day social and economic life. Most notable policy measures comprise closings of borders and general curfews to curb the spread. At the beginning of the outbreak, national linkages thus appear of particular importance to explain the spread across the globe. In this paper we use spatial econometric frameworks to model COVID-19 infections across the globe. Our spatial econometric specification pays particular attention to different types of spatial dependence including information on geographic neighbourhood, travel linkages as well as trade ties. By using daily data on country-specific infections, we moreover allow the strength of spatial dependence to vary over time. Both features appear to be of particular importance for adequately modelling the spread of the virus.",34

Analysis of the temporary and persistent effects of sizeable health shocks on local socio-economic systems in terms of the shape of the development patterns and the capacity to absorb such shocks has generated a large body of literature.Footnote 1 However, the environmental consequences of pandemics have not been extensively investigated (Helm 2020). At the time of writing (28 December 2020), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide exceeded 80 million, and more than 1.7 million deaths have been registered.Footnote 2 The speed of the geographical spread of the disease is unprecedented; the first case was reported on 8 December 2019 in Wuhan, and on 28 January 2020, more than 800 cases were reported internationally in Japan, South Korea, the USA, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and Vietnam, although the majority of cases were concentrated in China. In an attempt to contain the spread of the virus, residents of Wuhan were placed under quarantine from 23 January. This was immediately followed by quarantine measures in the cities of Huanggang and Ezhou and the cancellation of Chinese New Year celebrations. This deadly pandemic has happened at a time when the concentration of pollution in urban areas has been steadily increasing over the past decades, imposing a severe death toll in all major cities in both developed and developing countries.Footnote 3 A number of newspaper articles have been published recently on the observed reduction in the air concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 due to the widespread adoption of lockdown measures and semi-voluntary social distancing, which have reduced mobility and overall levels of economic and human activity.Footnote 4 Thus, the introduction of lockdown measures may have potentially saved a significant number of lives due to both the containment of COVID-19 and a reduction in pollution-induced deaths (Bosetti et al. 2020). Although recent studies have focused on the effects of complete lockdowns on air pollutant levels in various areas in China and Europe (Bosetti et al. 2020), this paper is the first to provide empirical estimates on the impact of different degrees of anti-COVID-19 measures in Italy on pollution levels, measured by concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2. This is achieved using a comprehensive dataset containing the pollution levels across all Italian provinces recorded at weekly intervals between 2016 and early 2020. We match the weekly pollution data for each Italian province with the dates on which measures to restrict the spread of COVID-19 were introduced. The different dates on which each Italian province and region adopted specific measures are reported on the official Italian government website.Footnote 5 We found a significant contraction of 17–18% of air concentration levels of PM10 and NO2 compared to the concentrations measured before the outbreak of COVID-19.",11

Garella,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Governments and consumers worldwide are increasingly trying to foster sustainable production and consumption—for a discussion—see Nyborg et al. (2006). Often this implies enhancing a positive externality; one instance is the encouragement of product design aimed at recyclability, durability, waste reduction, as for example for electronics hardware (Hong and Ke (2011) discuss California legislation concerning smartphone producers).Footnote 1 Utilization of processes that do not damage the bumble bee (Smith et al. 2013) are also an example of a positive externality, as much as pesticide-free farming in general, antibiotic-free fish farming, and the likes. If this is the case, the positive externality may enter either both: the consumer utility function and the objective function of Governments, or just the latter. A single consumer, being of negligible size, cannot affect the overall externality, contrary to the Government, but consumers are found to be willing to pay for increased eco-compatibility (e.g. Moon et al. 2002), so that the green attribute, if not also the externality, enters their utility function. The aim of this article, then, is to explore the impact of tax-subsidy policies aimed at increasing the positive externality in a duopoly model of differentiated products. A vertical product differentiation duopolyFootnote 2 is the reference model for Moraga-Gonzalez and Padron-Fumero (2002) who analyze anti-pollution emission standards and taxes. Among other results, they show that discriminatory (firm-specific) tax treatment of the dirtier product leads to a decrease in total emissions, contrary to what happens with a uniform tax rate, while reducing consumer surplus. Quite interestingly, they find that a standard on emissions leading to an increase in the quality of the lowest quality product, decreases per unit emissions but increases equilibrium sales and therefore reduces welfare. This is due to the interaction of quality choices, price to quality ratios, and demand effects. When qualities are exogenous,Footnote 3 as in Kurtyka and Mahenc (2011), the effect of a tax is in line with intuition and improves welfare, but when qualities are endogenous counterintuitive results are not uncommon, as in Moraga-Gonzalez and Padron-Fumero (2002) and Toshimitsu (2010) who finds that a subsidy to consumption of the green variant of product degrades the environment. This is due to the incentives on quality choice at the first stage of the competition process. Lombardini-Riipinen (2005) also uses a duopoly model with vertical differentiation and considers the effects of taxes on emissions when the marginal cost of firms is increasing in the emission abatement effort. Abatement generates a positive externality, entering the utility of consumers and the author discusses the policy tools addressing both the imperfect competition distortion and the environmental distortion.Footnote 4 Most of the models dealing with a first stage where quality or abatement is chosen share the common feature that differentiation is purely vertical, with the two firms producing goods that are otherwise identical in their horizontal dimension. In the present paper (as in Conrad 2005) firms produce goods that have a different appeal to consumers regarding both, the horizontal attribute (which only has private value to each consumer) and the environmental quality attribute.Footnote 5 This two-dimensional (with horizontal and vertical attributes) approach allows a wider range of situations than the pure vertical differentiation. In the same vein, a related paper is Deltas et al. (2013), where two firms produce horizontally differentiated goods with asymmetric intrinsic values; each firm can add an extra green attribute; in their model the exogenous intrinsic value asymmetry explains why increasing consumer green awareness may distort firms’ incentives to increase the green quality. In particular, the low quality firm may decrease its green quality when an education campaign by the Government increases the consumer green awareness; also, the high quality firm decreases its own quality when a Minimum Quality Standard is introduced. These effects are related to the equilibrium market shares dependence upon the asymmetric intrinsic values. Consumer awareness is also treated in Garcia-Gallego and Georgantzis (2009). In general, therefore, these works show that policy instruments affect environmental qualities depending on how the investments in green quality at the first stage of the game are affected. In this respect, the two-dimensional approach here adopted also has some strongly appealing technical features. In particular, the best reply functions of the firms in the stage where they choose qualities are easily defined and regular, while this is never the case in the models with pure vertical differentiation.Footnote 6 Remarkably, as Ronnen (1991) shows, under pure vertical differentiation the quality of the highest quality firm increases as the lowest quality is increased; in the present context by contrast qualities are strategic substitutes, and the high quality increases if the low quality decreases, with important consequences on the resultsFootnote 7. The model is a modified Hotelling linear city of unit length. An increase in the environmental quality absorbs extra-resources in the form of ex-ante development costs (the firm must buy new equipment or retool old one) and it implies a fixed cost. The two firms differ in their ability to obtain a quality improvement, so that the same quality level is more costly to reach for one of the two firms - the “low quality” firm. The game played by the two firms is the following. At the first stage firms choose their environmental quality level and pay the corresponding fixed cost. At the second stage firms choose prices. The Government aims at discouraging the use of the “low quality” product as it is the one that deteriorates the average quality (deteriorates the external effect). The easiest way to do so is that of taxing the good of inferior quality, if one exists. A second way is that of introducing a subsidy for the production of the good of superior quality. Asymmetric taxes (or subsidies) can be applied by lifting the tax (granting the subsidy) if the product meets some pre-specified level of “greenness” (e.g. recyclability). This is a more modest aim for a policy than that of addressing at the same time also the price distortion, but it can be the one achieving political priority if the externality reaches dramatic consequences in the medium-long run (think again of the problem of insufficient bees reproduction). It is also possible to analyze a generic quality-related subsidy going to both firms; this policy is also shown to increase the positive externality, though not necessarily the quality of the dirtiest producer, to increase the quality difference between firms, with higher profitability limited to the greenest producer. An education campaign that increases consumer awareness to the green attribute is also shown to lead to a higher positive externality.",2

Important issues at stake are inter alia: density of population, degree of social interaction, environmental quality conditions, indoor ventilation capacity, and disease exposure of elderly people. Some authors even regard nowadays the city as a source of threat to human health (Mishra et al. 2020) and advocate a ‘post-corona city’ in which ICT (Information and Communication Technology)-determined modes of working and living would allow to create a ‘new rurality’ (see for a critical review Couclelis 2020). Teleworking, tele-shopping and tele-recreating might then herald a new era with a different type of spatial mobility, and with less physical transport movements and interactions. Subsequently, public transportation will have to adapt to the decreased passenger demand and enforced hygiene measures (for a detailed discussion see Gkiotsalitis and Cats 2020). An interesting overview of various issues involved with “cities in a post-COVID world” can be found in Florida et al. (2020). It is evident that COVID-19 exerts a far-reaching influence on the socioeconomic and social geography of our planet. Changes in the frequency of home-to-work trips, shopping trips and social visit trips will affect local labour markets, the retail, entertainment and cultural sectors, and social interactions. Clearly, not everyone is equally hit by the pandemic. Labour markets in particular, are nowadays affected in an asymmetrical way, with blue-collar (often low-wage) workers being more exposed to the pandemic and with white-collar workers being more able to work at home from their newly created home offices (Fana et al. 2020). Thus, the ‘new normality’ of homework is unequally distributed among different income and professional classes, and has great implications for inequality and employment conditions at local, regional or national scales (Palomino et al. 2020). Especially interesting is the case of personal support workers who now face except for racial and gender discrimination increased health hazard as well (Rossiter and Godderis 2020). It should be noted that teleworking is not at all a new phenomenon; it exists already for several decades, e.g. in the US, and has been advocated time and again as a vehicle to cope with the externalities of traffic jams and environmental pollution. But even though the technological means were available, the social and economic barriers against a full-scale teleworking policy prevented often a large-scale introduction. Nevertheless, various countries have over the past years gradually realised various systems of teleworking (e.g., one or a few days per week working from home). The lockdown measures during the corona crisis have meant an enormous boost to a home office practice, not in the first place for environmental or traffic reasons, but mainly for health policy reasons (Beck et al. 2020). This massive turn to teleworking in conjunction with a pandemic situation though raises numerous questions regarding the environment. For example, the reduction in traffic is at the same time accompanied by increased car use, due to social distancing, and freight distribution, due to home deliveries leaving no clear answer as to the level of carbon emissions (Beck and Hensher 2020). After various lockdown measures in the course of 2020 in most countries in Europe, more and more people were encouraged to work at home (or were dismissed from their regular duties) in a dedicated effort to impede the spatial dispersion of the corona virus. In fact, this form of new labour practice, often referred to as teleworkingFootnote 1 or telecommuting, had already grown slowly in size in the past years in the European Union (see Eurofound 2020). Prior to the pandemic, there were significant differences between countries and sectors in teleworking practice, with Northern European countries and ICT sectors being the leaders (see European Commission 2020). Over the past months, additional measures against the COVID-19 pandemic included the closure of the physical location of many stores (excluding those which supply food and medical products), thus forcing many shops to embrace e-commerce as a new part of their business practice. In the past years, there have been numerous studies that have explored the potential of teleworking (Raghuram et al. 2010), and how it relates to the health of employees, sometimes with both positive and negative results (Charalampous et al. 2019). Among other factors, a variance in definitions may be the main reason behind conflicting findings (Madsen 2003). While most studies show that teleworking has a positive effect on physical health, the results are mixed when mental health is examined (Tavares 2017). Possible increase in physical exercise seems to be the main driver behind health claims (Chakrabarti 2018; Henke et al. 2016), while negative feelings such as loneliness and guilt are the main cause of criticism (Mann and Holdsworth 2003) along with the existing ICT over-involvement at the workplace (Tarafdar et al. 2015). Moreover, the frequent complexity of the environmental impact teleworking may have, (through changes in employees’ lifestyles as well as in terms of reduced transportation load) needs to be further studied, as Moos et al. (2006) very correctly point out, since such impact has the potential to affect the health of the whole population. Regarding infectious diseases, workplaces and marketplaces present obviously a hazard. The probability of inhaling infectious aerosols (i.e. air particles which carry pathogens) from an ill coworker or a customer increases, as these places become more and more crowded (Jones and Brosseau 2015). Fomites, objects or surfaces that are potentially contaminated with viral loads present also a significant opportunity for indirect infection (Boone and Gerba 2007). Another source of infection in the workplace is through hand transmission of viruses (Beamer et al. 2015). Ahmed et al. (2018) who performed a systematic literature review on the effect of social distancing rules at the workplace on the reduction of influenza transmission, concluded that if early action is taken and compliance is high, then these measures can be effective. Regarding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a US study of 350 affected participants of which 64% were employed, reported that 34% had close contact with an infected colleague in the previous two weeks, but only 17% of them had the ability to telework (Tenforde et al. 2020). On the other hand, it is noteworthy that e-commerce was studied in the literature mainly from an economic welfare perspective (Brynjolfsson et al. 2003; Nakayama 2009), since it is harder to trace infected individuals in marketplaces and hence to quantify the health effects of e-commerce. Nevertheless, a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China is known to be responsible for a cluster of COVID-19 cases through some of the social and spatial transmission mechanisms described above (Cai et al. 2020). But, clearly, the effects of teleworking and e-commerce on the spread of corona are large unknown. Since the degree of teleworking and e-commerce shows great differences in acceptance and implementation in various countries or regions in Europe, the question is pertinent whether the existing different adoption rates of teleworking and e-commerce are also reflected in corresponding differences in corona infection patterns. Therefore, the research question to be addressed in the present paper is: are geographical differences in pre-corona teleworking and e-commerce practices reflected in distinct dispersion patterns of COVID-19 in Europe? In this paper, we will examine whether the pre-corona teleworking population and e-commerce practice of people in Europe had an effect in containing COVID-19 due to the limited possibilities of this population in contracting and spreading the virus. To do so, we employ the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) convergence approach in order to identify situations of convergent patterns between 35 European countries and compare the percentage of teleworkers and individuals who made purchases online among them. We find the existence of two convergence clubs for which neither teleworking nor e-commerce pre-corona activity appear to show significant differences. Our analysis contributes to the effort of better identifying the factors that can contain the spread of such infectious diseases in the present and future situations and also urges researchers to further study the relation between infectious diseases and information systems. The remaining part of the study is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 we describe the database employed in our empirical analysis, while in Sect. 3 we discuss our methodological framework. Next, Sect. 4 presents and interprets our results, while Sect. 5 concludes this study.",6

An initial investigation,August 2022,Massimiliano Crisci,Federico Benassi,Gavin McArdle,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Airbnb is a peer-to-peer accommodation website and is a new driver of urban change globally (Carvalho et al. 2019; Guttentag 2019). Recently, a large body of literature has been produced about the Airbnb phenomenon, primarily by researchers from North America and Europe (Guttentag 2019) regarding different aspects of the short-term rental phenomenon, such as experience and motivations of guests and hosts, local impacts, tourism and regulations/policies (Nieuwland and Van Merlik 2020; Cheng and Jin 2019; Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018; Zervas et al. 2017; Guttentag 2015). In addition, findings from studies in Southern European urban contexts, where tourism has a central role in the local economy (Proença, Soukiazis 2008), have outlined local peculiarities and shown new processes of transnational gentrification linked to tourist flows from high-income countries and relatively low local housing costs that contributed to a displacement of lower-income residents from the city centres (see for instance: Garcia-López et al. 2019, López‐Gay et al. 2020 on Barcelona; Cocola-Gant and Gago 2019, Sequera and Nofre 2020 on Lisbon; Ardura Urquiaga et al. 2020 on Madrid; Jover and Díaz-Parra 2020 on Seville;  Semi, Tonetta 2021 on Turin; Celata and Romano 2020, Gainsforth 2019 and Picascia et al. 2017 on other Italian urban areas). Research on the geographic dispersion of Airbnb rentals shows that listings are concentrated close to the main tourist attractions and facilities (Cocola Gant 2016; Gutiérrez et al. 2017; Benítez-Aurioles 2018; Guttentag 2019). Tourism drives a particular form of gentrification linked to the planetary rent gap, characterised by the inflow of a ""mobile and floating population"", largely consisting of young highly educated adults and foreign students, forcing the more sedentary residents to leave due to the increase of real estate values and worsening quality of life in neighbourhoods tailored to tourists (López‐Gay et al. 2020). Measures adopted by governments aimed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the activities of the tourism sector, including Airbnb, particularly in Italy and Spain, the first countries in Europe to be affected by the pandemic (Boros et al. 2020; Guglielminetti et al. 2021). Consequently, during 2020, Rome and Barcelona saw the most substantial decrease in the Airbnb reservation rate among the most highly internationalised megacities (Liang et al. 2021). Furthermore, research findings on the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic have shown that the interconnectedness of the world economy, through travel linkages as well as trade ties, can highlight spatial dependence and vulnerabilities (Krizstin et al. 2020; Rose et al. 2021). In this article, a first investigation was developed using a case study in Rome, the third-largest city in Europe based on the number of Airbnb listingsFootnote 1, to highlight the main socioeconomic characteristics of the neighbourhoods where the supply of Airbnb accommodation is more diffused. In particular, the paper's objectives address the following research questions: (a) What is the evolution of Airbnb listings in the different areas of Rome from 2014 to 2020? (b) What are the neighbourhoods' housing, social, and economic characteristics where Airbnb listings are more present? (c) Do these characteristics change with the typology of the listings (entire apartment or private/shared room)? The article is mainly based on data collected from the InsideAirbnb and Tomslee websites,Footnote 2 which provides the opportunity to delineate the diffusion of short-term accommodation structures in many urban areas in space and time. Open access data are useful to detect how the activity of Airbnb is affecting neighbourhoods, for instance, producing gentrification and displacement of long-term residents and growth of housing prices (Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018). In this paper, Airbnb information has been related to socioeconomic and demographic contextual factors from different sources, following quantitative methods based on a spatial regression approach, through Spatial Lag Model (SAR) and Spatial Error Model (SEM) that are compared with traditional non-spatial OLS model. The work is structured as follows. In the next section, the study area, data and methodology are described. Then the results are presented and discussed. In the final section, some conclusions are proposed.",2

The development of such goals is a response to polarization of different regions in the world, often sharing the same issues such as the ever-increasing population, environmental degradation and social issues (Liu et al. 2020). Depending on the global regions, the condition, development, and issues might vary, yet, in all forms, both the industrialized and un-industrialized regions often experience the same issues such as poverty, social issues and environmental pollution. As such, around 23% of the world mortalities are from the environmental issues (annually 12.6 million deaths) with Asia having the highest reported cases (WHO 2018). In the same way, the top 8 greenhouse gas emitters in 2019 are China, US, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Canada, located either in Asia & Pacific or in North America (Amin et al. 2020). With both of the continents are competing for economic growth in two distinctive polarization of East and West (especially referring to China and US trade conflict), environmental degradations and economic and trade conflicts are emerging as its result (Xiong and Wu 2021). In this environment, the economic competition between the two regions is likely to exacerbate the environmental pollution and trade obstacles, affecting the global sustainability and the sustainable development goals. These issues are observable in the emergence of growing political conflicts over trade tariffs and market competition in the recent years (Liu et al. 2020). These conflicts inspire the governments to pursue place-based policies with domestic and independent outlook rather than flow-based ones with global perspectives. To assess this issue, our study aims to evaluate the effects of globalization and openness on sustainable development in the North America versus that of East Asia and Pacific. To do so, this study tries to map the spillover (or interactive) effects, considered as a proxy for globalization and openness, between the two regions. With spillover effect referring to the impact of seemingly unrelated events to a variable (Liu et al. 2018; Sadorsky 2014), a positive (or negative) spillover effect imply synergistic (or trade-off) relationships and beneficial (or detrimental) role of globalization and openness in the sustainability of the two regions, implicitly. This analysis is helpful for policy-makers to develop flow-based (or place-based) governance in case of synergistic (or trade-off) relationship. Synergistic (or trade-off) spillover effects are an evidence for the beneficial (or detrimental) role of globalization and openness in the sustainability of the two competing regions.",19

On January 30 of the following year, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health concern. On March 11, the WHO finally recognized the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic urging all countries to step up their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. During the early phases of the diffusion, while the search for medical treatment and prevention (e.g., vaccine) was still going on, many local and national governments introduced non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the form of strict social restrictions to curb the spread of the virus in their communities with varying degrees of success. As a result, millions of people worldwide experienced different degrees of travel restrictions and self-isolation in their homes. The effectiveness of such policies in reducing death and hospitalization have been the subject of long academic an policy debates but recent studies seem to suggest that in countries with higher degree of subnational autonomy (e.g., the U.S.), the negative consequences of the pandemic have been more severe (Chiara 2021). Nevertheless, the first official lockdown was introduced in the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, followed by travel restrictions in other cities within Hubei province. Large countries like India, South Africa, and many European countries have introduced a country-wide lockdown outside China. For what concerns the US experience, during the initial diffusion of the virus, the federal government did not implement a nationwide quarantine. This has led many states to impose state-wide restrictions. On a more local level, while some major cities like New York had an initially slow response to the fast spread of the virus, other communities like those in California did not hesitate to take some of the strictest public health orders. On March 16, six communities in the San Francisco Bay Area issued a shelter-in-place order that immediately affected the social lives of millions of people living in that area. The order was followed after a few days by a similar but state-wide order from the governor of California. The broader socioeconomic impacts of the current pandemic and the subsequent restrictive measures are yet to be investigated (Wilder-Smith and Freedman 2020). However, there are clear indications from early observations that social distancing and widespread closures, along with restrictive measures such as national and local quarantine orders, have been effective in slowing the spread of the virus (Lau et al. 2020). Furthermore, enforcing quarantine measures in different cities across the world has brought a new trend in public safety improvement, and crime reduction (Jacobs and Barrett 2020; www.kansascitymag.com; www.latimes.com ). That being said, there is a well-documented risk that as more people are forced to work remotely, criminal organizations seize this opportunity and turn to cyberspace for a wide range of criminal activities, from fraud and forgery in the procurement of much-needed medical equipment to organized property crime by impersonation of representatives of public authorities (EUROPOL 2020). Recent literature has quantified the immediate decline in criminal incidents following the quarantine in the US (Abrams 2021; Boman and Gallupe 2020). Specifically, it has been shown that shelter-in-place restrictions were associated with a reduction of at least 35% in overall crime, which was especially pronounced for most violent crimes (Abrams 2021). However, there was no decline in homicides and shootings and an increase in non-residential burglary and car theft in most cities of the US. On the other hand, the drop in the number of crimes was due to the decline in minor offenses (Boman and Gallupe 2020). In a related paper, considering 27 cities across 23 countries worldwide, it was shown that crime decreased by 37% after governments issued stay-at-home orders (Boman and Mowen 2021). The decline rates varied substantially across crime types, with some crimes decreasing more than others. Specifically, property-based crimes decreased substantially, but homicide was relatively unchanged. Focusing on domestic violence in the city of Chicago and using cell phone block-level activity data, the staying-at-home order increased time spent at home, leading to a subsequent increase in domestic violence-related calls for police service (Bullinger et al. 2020). Similarly, focusing on Mexico city, sexual offenses and domestic violence were shown to decline during the COVID-19 lockdown. At the same time, femicide rates remained constant during the pandemic (Hoehn-Velasco et al. 2021).Footnote 1 Concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19 restrictions on the mobility of people, as stay-at-home orders eased, crime increased to pre-COVID-19 historical trends (Boman and Mowen 2021). The results show that sexual offenses, lapses in alimony, and domestic violence decline during the COVID-19 lockdown and then return to pre-pandemic levels by the fall. This paper focuses on the effects of restrictive measures on the number of crimes in general and on different categories of criminal activities in specific by exploiting daily crime level data at neighborhood levels for two major U.S. cities. In particular, we study the effects of the shelter-in-place order on criminal activity using fine-grained spatial units (i.e., neighborhoods). We contributes to the existing literature on the impacts of COVID-19 related restrictions on crimes which have considered entire cities, states, or countries. We provide a robust quantitative assessment to address the following questions: have shelter-in-place (henceforth SIP) policies caused a reduction in the number of incidents? And if they did, what types of criminal activities were mostly affected by these restrictive policies? Finally, we ask how the reported domestic violence cases have been impacted by shelter-in-place? To assess the impact of the SIP policy first introduced in the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, we adopt an event study approach using official historical geo-localized daily data on the criminal activity before and after the introduction to people’s mobility. To make the empirical procedure robust, we first consider the number of daily reported COVID-19 infections in the city of San Francisco along with weather data which include the average daily temperature, precipitation, and heating degree days. In addition, we also include temporal lags of the weather controls since there exists a correlation between city crimes and weather variations (Cohn 1990; Blakeslee and Fishman 2018). Moreover, to account for time-varying factors which may independently affect criminal activity, the analysis controls for the day of the week and the month of the year. In addition, we include neighborhood by time fixed effects in order to account for any time varying difference across neighborhoods within the city. Finally, since crime is an excellent example of a spatially correlated process (Anselin et al. 2000; Elhorst 2014), we also adopt a simple method to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data following the recent literature on spatial determinants of conflicts (Harari and La Ferrara 2018). Daily the number of crimes reduced sharply in both Oakland and San Francisco within a month following the shelter-in-place order of March 16th, 2020 We first show that the total number of crimes in the two large cities in the US was negatively affected by the intervention to stop the diffusion of the virus. In particular, the daily number of total criminal incidents declined by more than 30% after one month from the introduction of the SIP in San Francisco. Traffic crimes, thefts, homicides, and vandalism were mostly affected by the restriction. On the other hand, we resent no immediate reduction in domestic violence after two weeks from the restrictive order. However, we find the reduction in criminal activity to be significant in the short term only. Indeed, as the restrictions eased, the crimes slowly approached their historical trends. However, as shown in Figs. 2 and 4, it appears that crimes in San Francisco even after the SIP order and the consequent return to normal life were slightly below their pre-covid levels. Total reports of criminal incidents from 01-01-2019 to 01-01-2022 in San Francisco. As the restrictions eased, the number of incidents slightly approached its pre-covid trend Reports of criminal incidents from 01-01-2020 to 01-01-2022 in San Francisco selected by type of crime Impact of the Shelter-in-Place order on the natural logarithm of criminal incidents per month from 01-01-2019 to 31-12-2020 in San Francisco. This figure presents results of the estimation of Eq. 2. The periods span between January and December 2020, and are observed every other month. In this specification, we evaluate the effects of the SIP order for each month. Coefficients are reported with confidence intervals based on standard errors, clustered at the neighborhood level In addition to a standard fixed effect model we also estimate a model that includes spatial and temporal autoregressive terms. We show that the decline of all criminal activities falls between 10 and 20% points. While corroborating the baseline results, these results also highlight the spatial correlation of criminal activities. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used to estimate the impact of the forced lockdown on the number of crimes. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy. Section 4 shows the baseline results from the analysis and results for different types of crime. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",

The reason behind the selection of the USA is that it owns the dollar, which is the dominant currency in international trade, is a net food exporter and is one of the largest food producers. The USA has an important and influential role in the global food system. The results to be obtained from the USA will also be useful in explaining the global food related problems. The recent COVID-19 crisis has once more revealed the importance of sustainable food security. Food security was first defined as ""Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life"" at the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome. United Nations Population Prospects 2019 report points out that the world population will increase by 2 billion by 2050, reaching 9.7 billion in total. Furthermore, the report shows that this increase will be the result of more than doubled population increases in less developed countries. Arable lands and useable irrigation water decrease every day. The green revolution in the mid-1950s increased total agricultural production in the process, reduced global hunger, and stabilized food prices. However, despite the fact that the productivity increase stemming from the ""green revolution"" has come to a standstill in the current century, the demand for food continues to increase. All these facts point to a single result that agricultural production will have to provide physically and economically accessible healthy food for the increasing population in the coming period, using less land and water.
 The commodity price crisis of 1974 caused serious concerns, but the effects of the 2007–2008 food price crisis lasted much longer. Global dollar prices of food commodities increased sharply between 2007–2008. This increase attracted severe attention, and many authors investigated the reasons behind the spike in food prices. Gilbert (2010) explained the case with China's rapid economic growth and other developing Asian countries. Abbot et al. (2008) blamed the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar. Mitchell (2008), on the other hand, pointed to the increasing biofuel production. Cooke and Roble (2009) explained the price increases by speculation. Baffes (2007) indicated the increasing input costs due to rising energy prices. Similar food price increases were also experienced in the United States. The change in the U.S. Consumer Price Index for all food has been reasonably low and consistent, with an average 2.5% annual increase between 1991 and 2006 (Baek and Koo, 2010). However, this stability has first changed in 2007–2008, later in 2010–2011, and lastly in the current Covid 19 period. In 2007, United States food inflation recorded its biggest move in 17 years, increasing 4.5% annually (Baek and Koo 2010). It is very important to understand the United States in terms of food prices. The United States is one of the largest importers of many major food products and also owns the global tradable currency, the dollar. This paper aims to explore the interactions between U.S. food prices, energy prices, economic policy uncertainty and the value of the U.S dollar. The study attempts to add significant outcomes to the literature by performing a dynamic regression model and a frequency domain causality test. One important significance of this study is that the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which is the subject of different studies in the literature, such as, Adebayo et al. (2022a, b) but used very shallowly in the explanation of food prices, is included in the models. Within the scope of this study, a study examining the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and U.S. food prices could not be found. In the literature review, it was seen that crude oil prices were chosen as data to represent energy prices. It is known that agricultural production, harvesting, further processing, storage and distribution processes and the production processes of agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilizers apply to a wide variety of energy sources. Therefore, energy prices are represented by the energy price index, which is below the US consumer price index. In this way, it is aimed to achieve more realistic results by representing energy prices more efficiently. In addition to the powerful methods it uses, the study will make significant contributions to the literature in this respect.",1

Fischer,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Opioid-induced deaths (hereafter, briefly opioid mortality)Footnote 1 increased sharply in the United States (US) during the past three decades, and opioid overdose mortality has become an important, yet inadequately understood public health problem (Kopel 2019). Although opioid mortality is a spatial characteristic of a population in a specific area (Cossman et al. 2007), only few studies have used spatial econometric methods to control for spatial dependenceFootnote 2 in regression models that aim to identify the impact of determinants on the outcome of the opioid mortality process (see Cushing et al. (2020)). Sparks and Sparks (2010) apply spatial autoregressive models to the study of US county mortality rates, and Yang et al. (2015) explore geographic variation in US mortality rates using a conventional spatial Durbin model. These studies, however, are cross-sectional in nature on the one side and do not contribute to the opioid mortality literature on the other. To overcome this shortcoming in mortality research in general and opioid mortality research in particular, we use panel rather than cross-sectional data to study the relationship between opioid mortality rates and explanatory variables from a longitudinal perspective that accounts for temporal and spatial dependence simultaneously. Omitting the spatial dependence issue would increase the risk of obtaining biased estimation results, while the use of panel data results in a more accurate inference of model parameters (Baltagi et al. 2007). Panel data is generally more informative, contains more degrees of freedom and less multicollinearity between variables than cross-sectional data, and improves the efficiency of econometric estimates (see Elhorst (2021)). It is more informative since providing information on both the intertemporal dynamics and the individuality of the observational units (regions) and allowing one to control the effects of missing and unobserved variables (for more details, see Hsiao (2007)). The primary objective of this study is to employ a spatial Durbin panel data model,Footnote 3 an extension of the cross-sectional model to a panel data framework, for estimating direct and indirect (cross-state spillover) effects of a set of factors that may influence opioid mortality rates across space and over time. In this model specification, the characteristics of a specific observation unit (in our case: state) and its neighbors are simultaneously considered. To the best of our knowledge, no opioid mortality research has considered spatial spillovers among observational units. Specifically, we consider five variables to capture the racial/ethnic structure of a state, five variables to cover the state’s age structure, two variables to represent the educational attainment level of its population, and three covariates that address economic distress. In addition to the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables, we include the opioid prescription rate to account for one of the opioid supply factors, and health insurance coverage that may have the potential to increase the demand for drugs. Our choice of using states rather than counties as observation units in this study was forced by data availability.Footnote 4 The Annual American Community Survey (ACS) census data is available starting 2014 for the demographic variables included in the study. Hence our study used the period 2014–2019. The model is applied to 49 states over six years, from 2014 to 2019. A k-nearest-neighbor matrix is chosen to represent the topological structure between the states.Footnote 5 The calculation of effects estimates is based on Bayesian estimation and inference that reflects a proper interpretation of the marginal effects for our nonlinear model that involves lags of the dependent variable vector. The study provides a rich picture of how sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants affect opioid mortality. The findings highlight the critical role indirect (spillover) effects play. A neglection of the spillover effects would cause incorrect inferences. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric framework, outlines the proposed model, discusses prior selection for Bayesian estimation of the model, and shows how to calculate direct and indirect effects estimates necessary for a proper interpretation of the model estimates.Footnote 6 Section 3 outlines model specification issues, provides a brief summary of the data set used, and presents then the direct and indirect effects estimates of the explanatory variables on opioid mortality rates. The last section summarizes and concludes the paper.",

The COVID-19 pandemic increased public awareness regarding the limits of the progress generated by globalization and the difficulties of monitoring and controlling certain unpredictable phenomena with effects on the entire socio-economic system. Regardless of the level of technological development, the pandemic determined hesitant reactions from governments which did not succeed to reduce the risk of incidence and casualties in many countries. However, some critical differences emerged: scientific research in many countries analyzed the territorial variability and showed that clustered concentration of COVID-19 incidence and mortality have a strong spatial interdependency (Krisztin et al. 2020; Desmet and Wacziarg 2020; Zhang and Schwartz 2020). They demonstrated the influence of different factors driving these spatial disparities, factors specific to every territory, manifesting themselves in distinct forms at different geographic scales. These are, among others, global interconnection, the capacity of the health system, the quality of institutions and governance, economic vulnerability, polarization and social fragmentation (Collins et al. 2020; Rose et al. 2021). Romania, a state located in South-Eastern Europe, at the intersection of several transcontinental human and economic flows, could not avoid the pandemic circuit, being heavily affected, similar to most European states. Romania’s close ties with other states which were heavily influenced by the first wave of the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain (towards which there is a permanent flow of Romanian workers’ circular migration), determined a rapid spread of the virus, forcing the authorities to institute a state of emergency on 16.03.2020. The adopted measures, considered excessive from particular perspectives (especially in the countries that have the least trust in public institutions such as the post-communist European states) were justified and reduced the impact of the first wave, resulting in a slower spread of the pandemic compared to states that had a more relaxed attitude (e.g. Sweden) (Georgieva et al 2021; Durnescu and Morar 2020). The subsequent relaxations, especially during the summers of 2020 and 2021, amplified the pandemic’s effects, despite the immunization campaign that started in the winter of 2020. Initially alert, the pace of vaccination was negatively affected by population reluctance and by a lack of firmness in applying measures aimed at vulnerable groups. Seasonally, there was an explosion of cases, with massive lethal effects, especially during the autumn (Muntele 2022). For these reasons, Romania is one of the most affected states if we refer to the incidence of deaths caused by the pandemic (3465 deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants, as of 1.07.2022, ninth place worldwide, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center database of Johns Hopkins University). During October 2021, Romania recorded the highest rate of deaths worldwide, reported per 1 million inhabitants (570) and one of the fastest growth rates of the number of cases (over 40% from 1.24 at 1st of October to 1.74 million cases at the beginning of November). Also, the overall mortality rate in Romania (relative to the number of cases) was constantly high for the whole timespan (COVID-19 Data Repository, 2022). The difficulties of managing the pandemic, especially in severe cases, indicate serious deficiencies in the decision-making process and in the functioning of the health care system. The assessment refers explicitly to the fall of 2021 when, amid a governmental crisis, the ability of the health system to handle severe cases generated an abrupt increase in deaths due to COVID-19 (Túri et al. 2022; Muntele 2022). Fast-growing literature analyzes regional and local drivers of the spatially heterogeneous health impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic. In Romania, some solid papers assess COVID-19 diffusion and effects at the national, regional and county scale (Goschin and Constantin 2021; Iordan et al. 2021; Mitrica et al. 2021; Muntele 2022; Enciu et al. 2022; Panazan and Gheorghe 2022). However, there are very few studies at the local level of administrative-territorial units such as cities, towns or communes (Matei et al. 2021; Cioban and Mare 2022). The present paper aims to find the territorial factors that can explain the higher mortality rate on both local and regional scales. The current approach tackles the geography of excess mortality (EXCMORT) during the first two years of the pandemic by analyzing the drivers and patterns of spatial differentiation across Romania. The specific objectives of this study are: To determine which sociodemographic, economic and environmental risk factors relate to COVID-19 EXCMORT rates at the local level and county level; To investigate how the relationship between these factors and EXCMORT varies geographically. The empirical contribution of the study is related to testing, comparing and evaluating a two-scale territorial model of diffusion to illustrate the evolution and impact of COVID-19 during a reasonably long period (two years). A factor analysis and a multiple regression model complemented by a geographically weighted regression were accomplished to obtain a local and regional spatially differentiated perspective that can help decision-makers take targeted, non-uniform technical measures depending on territorial aspects. The overall purpose is to identify the place-based drivers of resilience to pandemics to support governance and policies regarding potential future epidemics/pandemics.",

This holds for movements within and across borders and is focused towards urban areas. Asia is the region with the largest number of international migrants (41 percent of total international migrants, see UN, 2017a) and has seen the largest increase in international migrants across all regions of the world from 2000 to 2017 (about 62 percent, see UN, 2017a). Among the top 5 origin countries of international migrants are four Asian countries: India, Russia, China, and Bangladesh. The increase in migration has almost been exponential. Figure 1 presents the annual total migration flows from all Asian countries towards 16 OECD countries included in our data set. We observe a strong upward trend with drops around the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis. Over our observed time period (1980–2015) we see that migration flows in our sample almost quadrupled. Total Migration Flows. Notes: Total international migration flows (in million) out of Asia over time (1980–2015) At the same time, this region will be heavily affected by the impacts of climate change in the future (Asian Development Bank, 2012). Research has shown that climate change symptoms include an increase in the frequency, severity, and likelihood of weather-related disaster and increases global temperatures (IPCC, 2012). In fact, Asia is already the region most prone to disasters (UN, 2017b) and people are already displaced by disasters (Asian Development Bank, 2012). Its topography, with islands, deltas, mountains, and deserts makes it prone to different kinds of climate change impacts. These include, for example, weather-related disasters (storms, floods, droughts, and extreme temperature events), sea-level rise, water scarcity, food insecurity, health impacts due to climate-sensitive diseases, and ocean acidification (UN, 2017b). The combination of being the most populous region in the world and the most affected region by impacts of climate change makes Asia an interesting region to study the effects of climatic factors on migration. In this paper, we investigate whether climatic factors such as temperature and weather-related disasters are drivers of international migration out of all Asian countries. While country-specific studies in Asia exist (e.g. Bardsley and Hugo 2010 and Bohra-Mishra et al. 2014), this is the first panel data study that uses migration flows out of all Asian countries over a long period of time (36 years). To be precise, we use data for migration flows from 1980 to 2015 out of all Asian countries towards 16 OECD destination countries. Several interesting results stand out. First, we find that temperature, but not weather-related disasters, have a significant direct effect on migration in our sample. Temperature has a smaller effect on migration towards OECD countries in Asia compared to Europe, Africa, and North America. For disasters, we only find a stronger effect on migration in Asia compared to Africa. Temperature matters in most regions while disasters do not. Generally, higher temperatures increase migration flows except in Asia, South America, and the Pacific. This result contradicts studies done on larger data sets by, for example, Aburn and Wesselbaum (2019) who use flows out of 198 origin countries and find a significant positive direct effect of temperature on migration. This result does relate to the discussion about whether climatic shocks can trap populations. Papers such as Gray and Mueller (2012) or Noy (2017) argue that climatic shocks can reduce mobility, which is what we find in our sample. Finally, we find evidence of non-linear effects of temperature on migration with more migration out of countries that origin relatively small, large increase in temperature anomalies respectively. In contrast, we do only find a significant linear effect of weather-related disaster in our sample. The paper extends the the existing literature on the climate-migration relationship in Asia. Alam (2003) shows that changes in rainfall patterns, via affecting droughts and agricultural productivity, have affected migration in Bangladesh. Further, Gray and Mueller (2012), again for Bangladesh, find that crop failure has an effect on migration in a sample of 1,700 households between 1990 and 2004. Using cell phone operator data to measure mobility, Lu et al. (2016), study the displacement and migration after Cyclone Mahasen affected Bangladesh in 2013. They do not find permanent displacement effects. Dun (2011) documents emigration out of flood-prone eras in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.",

Consequently, shortly after the onset of the pandemic, many countries restricted human interactions and limited the mobility of citizens to control the spread of the virus. These restrictions had a significant impact on daily routines, especially in densely populated urban areas. Many cities reported, for instance, an unprecedented decline in public transport (PT) demand that has been sustained during 2020 and 2021 (Google LLC 2022; APTA and TransitApp 2022; UNECE 2022). Nevertheless, PT use data over these two years suggests that different cities report different resilience patterns of PT use (Fig. 1). Among 15 cities from 11 different European Union (EU) countries, there are significant fluctuations over time, with negative and positive outliers, but also with some similarities in resilience patterns. It is therefore crucial to explore and explain these differences and similarities. Two research questions are addressed in this paper: what are the patterns of PT use resilience in the EU during 2020 and 2021? Why are there differences in the recovery paths of PT use among EU cities? From an academic and operational point of view, it is important to investigate these questions to better understand and improve the resilience of PT systems confronted with shocks similar to COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, several studies have been undertaken to assess its impacts on PT use at different spatial levels (Al Zein et al. 2022; Bouzouina et al. 2022; Séjournet et al. 2022; Eisenmann et al. 2021; Jenelius and Cebecauer 2020; Wielechowski et al. 2020; Melo 2022; Rasca et al. 2021; Jiang and Cai 2022). These studies report various findings: decline in PT use in favor of the car, the impact of policy stringency on PT, fear of contamination in PT, and the wide adoption of remote activities, particularly during the first months of the pandemic (Gkiotsalitis and Cats 2021). Nevertheless, research on the resilience of the PT system during COVID-19 and its enabling recovery factors is still scarce (Sunio et al. 2022; Hsieh and Hsia 2022; Laroche 2022; Vickerman 2021; Xiao et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2021). Some studies emphasize the role of government and financial support and the type of contracting in PT resilience (Laroche 2022; Sunio et al. 2022; Vickerman 2021). Others stress the role of anti-pandemic measures (Hsieh and Hsia 2022; Zhou et al. 2021). Some authors emphasize also the heterogeneity in the resilience of PT use among different population profiles (Wang et al. 2022; Xiao et al. 2022). However, most authors focus on specific PT systems, across a particular country, region, or city and during short periods of time, often a few months. Our research distinguishes itself from previous studies in 3 respects: (i) it performs an international comparison between 15 of the most populated cities in the EU; (ii) it investigates PT use resilience towards COVID-19 during two years: 2020 and 2021; (iii) it uses data with high spatial and time resolutions. The paper is organized as follows. After an exposition of the theoretical framework (Sect. 2), we describe our data and the analysis methods used (Sect. 3). Next, Sect. 4 offers empirical findings and interpretations, while Sect. 5 concludes. Percent change of presence in PT places in 2020 and 2021 according to Google Mobility reports (Google LLC 2022)",

Faced with several waves of national lockdown and highly strict health measures, business changed their working models (Bailey et al. 2020; Lund et al. 2020). These changes often included employees being laid off or being sent into furlough for several months, being denied promotions or experiencing pay cuts (Basyouni and El Keshky 2021; Forbes and Krueger 2019; Nicola et al. 2020). With unemployment rates increasing, the levels of job insecurity among employees increased (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020). Job insecurity during large-scale disruptions (e.g., natural disasters, economic recessions, epidemics) has been associated with high levels of anxiety and depression (Jeanne et al. 2020; Margerison-Zilko et al. 2016; Mihashi et al. 2009; Stanisławski 2019). Similarly, job insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to poor mental health among employees across the globe (Blanuša et al. 2021; Ganson et al. 2021; Obrenovic et al. 2021; San Too, Leach, and Butterworth 2021; Wilson et al. 2020). Therefore, it is no surprise that during the past two decades, and especially after the crisis of 2008–2012, a constantly growing number of articles focused on job insecurity, trying to find the determinants, as well as emphasising the variations that the indicator tends to manifest during a shock. The variations were explained in a smaller or larger proportion through age (Yeves et al. 2019), gender (Menéndez-Espina et al. 2019), and level of education (Green 2009), the most common socio-demographical characteristics considered for complex analysis. However, while socio-demographical determinants were thoroughly scrutinized by the scientific community during or following a socio-economic, geopolitical or pandemic shock, less effort was put in finding spatial implications of the job insecurity, despite numerous papers highlighting the importance of the regional economic situation (Amdaoud et al. 2020; Bourdin et al. 2021), especially in terms of job market evolution (Anderson and Pontusson 2007), the industrial contraction (Cooper and Antoniou 2013), or the overall resilience capacity of the governance systems (Harrison 2003), as job insecurity outmatches the job instability (Hassard and Morris 2018). This study addresses this gap in the scientific literature by providing a longitudinal spatial interpretation and evolution of job insecurity during the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in relation with the magnitude of the shock. The study is based on data gathered at personal level through one of the largest worldwide surveys applied during the pandemic (PsyCorona) correlated with data from regional and national institutions regarding the evolution of the case fatality ratio and death rates. The paper is structured as follows: the following chapter is providing a thorough literature review on the topic of job insecurity and its connections with the socio-demographical and regional characteristics; the third chapter details the methodological approach, the sampling procedure, target population, and instrument validity; the fourth chapter presents the main results, while the last section offers an interpretation of the results, followed by several recommendations and the conclusions. .",

The number of new positive cases, which is only an aggregate of positive swabs, was updated daily during the COVID-19 pandemic. The socioeconomic impact of these figures was considerably significant. For example, in March 2020, the New York stock market crashed at least three times. Most people were concerned about a pandemic of an unknown disease, reacted sensitively, and were sometimes misled by the number of new positive cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially published a daily situation report, however, they have been publishing a weekly report since August 16, 2020.Footnote 1 Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) still provides daily figures.Footnote 2 In addition, the news media continue to report these figures daily as if they were reporting the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. In Japan, the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 show periodic changes in time series that repeat every week. For example, the number of new positive cases reported each Monday is relatively small, and it started to be widely mentioned after the second outbreak from July to August 2020. For example, in October 2020, Asahi Shimbun (Nagano 2020) reported this in Tokyo. In this paper, we consider the problem of the weekly periodicity in the daily data of COVID-19 in Japan. We briefly examine the presence of periodicity in Japan by examining the national average of daily cases for the entire period from January 16, 2020, to June 15, 2021 (see Table 1). The last column shows the difference between the average of daily cases for the entire period and the average for each day of the week. Regarding periodicity within the week, Li (2020) examined time series data on newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and discussed weekly recurrence. The author analyzed countries worldwide using country-level data and found autocorrelation with a 7-day lag. Cappi et al. (2022) also estimated annual seasonality using country-level data from 30 countries. Our study analyzes in detail how this periodicity varies across regions. In Japan, public health management is performed mainly by local governments of the 47 prefectures. The central government has delegated the counting of confirmed cases to these local governments. Therefore, the effect is expected to be different for each prefecture. Our analysis assumes a congestion-related delay in reporting information about positive cases of COVID-19. Shim et al. (2020) and Harris (2022) reported similar cases in South Korea and New York, respectively. Sachs et al. (2022) noted the importance of a reporting system. Tariq et al. (2019) also stated a delay in reporting an Ebola virus case due to the murder of an administrative official. Our study focuses on reporting delays because of congestion caused by weekend bottlenecks. We refer to this as the “weekend effect.” Bonifazi et al. (2021) noted a similar effect. We analyze a lag structure that shows how congestion that occurs over the weekend affects the number of new confirmed cases at the beginning of the following week. We use data on the number of new positives reported by the prefectures. By contrast, delay or lag is usually discussed in relation to the serial interval between infection and symptom onset, which is essential to estimate the epidemiological curve and the effective reproductive number; see, for example, Cori et al. (2013), Nishiura et al. (2020), Ali et al. (2020). Furthermore, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies have used the number of positive cases as primary data to estimate the real number of infected; see, for example, Bassi et al. (2021). However, our study does not aim to estimate the number of infections, but rather to describe the geographical heterogeneity found in the time series of reported positive cases. Our result shows that the weekend effect was detected only in some of the most populous prefectures. In about half of the prefectures, the weekend effect was not detected because congestion did not occur due to the low number of reports. In other words, what appeared to be a nationwide event was observed only in the most populous prefectures. In the discussion section, we propose a hypothetical structure to explain the reporting delay that occurred on weekends. We also interpret the estimation results based on this structure. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and methods used in subsequent sections. In Sect. 3, we demonstrate the weekend effect by applying the national-scale data and then present the analysis results for each prefecture. In Sect. 4, we discuss the implications of our results.",

Indeed, knowing the impact of past pandemics might provide useful insights to elaborate the most appropriate measures to face the current crisis. Spell and Bezrukova (2022), for instance, argue that histories of how past crises were managed can help us anticipate how today’s public health challenges will permanently change the workplace. However, the historical approach is often problematic for economists. Indeed, the most of pandemic episodes – with the important exception of the Spanish Flu – are so far in the time that having reliable data is almost impossible.Footnote 1 Therefore, economists usually approach pandemics from an unhistorical perspective. Indeed, pandemics are mainly considered in the context of very abstract neoclassic macroeconomic models. Within such a purely theoretical structure, pandemic is then modelled as a negative labour supply shock because of the huge burden of victims caused by the pandemic.Footnote 2 For instance, Boucekkine et al. (2008), in a highly influential paper, claim that “an epidemiological shock is modelled by an initial shortfall in the size of population” (p.6). More recently, Jordà et al. (2020) argue that the main consequence of a pandemic is given by “the disproportionate effects on the labor force relative to land” (p.8). Garret (2009) argues that “the general conceptual foundation […] is that [a pandemic] results […] in a significant negative shock to manufacturing labour supply” (p.712), while the European Commission (2006) claims that “a permanent negative shock to the population level […] is the fundamental supply shock associated with the pandemic” (p.8). Assessing a pandemic as a labour supply negative shock allows deriving quite clear-cut implications. In particular, Boucekkine et al. (2008) argue that, by suddenly reducing the labour supply, a pandemic causes, in the very short-term, an increase of the per-capita income. However, after this income increase, if the fertility rate is not affected by the pandemic, the economy then goes back to the initial equilibrium, thus experiencing negative growth rates (i.e. a recession).Footnote 3 The negative impact on the economy arising from the labour supply negative shock is found also in the so-called SIR (“susceptible, infected, and recovered” individuals) models, where the reduction of the labour supply is not caused only by the burden of deaths, but also by the micro-founded decisions of individuals to abstain or reduce their participation in labour activities in order to reduce the number of contacts and hence the probability of being infected (see for instance Eichenbaum et al., 2020).Footnote 4 The Spanish Flu episode represents a useful test to discuss the modelling approach of pandemics: in the light of the historical evidence provided by the Spanish Flu, could a pandemic be simply interpreted as a negative labour shock? This approach has been questioned for example by Berbenni and Colombo (2021), where, by using a descriptive analysis of several macroeconomic variables in the post-pandemic period, it is shown that the impact of the Spanish Flu in Italy has been quite different from what predicted by theoretical models. A similar conclusion is reached also by Karlsson et al. (2014), which, by looking to Swedish data in the post Spanish Flu period, find no evidence of real wage variations, in contrast to the predictions of theoretical models that suggest an increase of the real wage because of the scarcity of labour. In this paper, our focus is different from both Berbenni and Colombo (2021) and Karlsson et al. (2014). Indeed, we perform an archival analysis of one of the largest Italian banks (Credito Italiano) during the First World War – Spanish Flu period (1914–1920). The aim is to investigate whether the Spanish Flu has had relevant implications for the organization of labour. As long as the pandemic represents a significant and negative labour supply shock, one might expect relevant implications also for personnel management. At the best of our knowledge, this prediction has not been properly investigated yet in the literature. Hence, our archival inspection provides a first step to fill this gap. In particular, we scrutinize the letters that the Central Management of the bank sent to the local branches, with the aim to assess whether the Spanish Flu has been perceived by the contemporaries as an event that was able to modify the labour organization. The instructions sent by Central Management to the branches on personnel management are reconstructed chronologically. The timing with which the circulars were sent allows even more communications to be traced each month. By focusing on the main topics addressed in the letters and on the provisions taken to deal with the emergence of workforce shortages, it is thus possible to reconstruct the evolution over time - month by month - of the problems associated with personnel management. Identifying how the phenomenon was perceived by contemporaries can help reducing – even if not resolving – the main challenges arising from the absence of sufficiently large and reliable quantitative data, i.e. causality and endogeneity problems. With respect to data analysis, archival analysis has several advantages. The chronological succession of the letters allows distinguishing, for example, the real effects on the labour market of the different waves of the pandemic, which did not occur uniformly over the months. Besides, the circulars sent to the branches allow grasping the complexity of the factors and the events – not attributable to the pandemic alone – that influenced the personnel management of a large banking institution, whose branches were scattered throughout the country. Furthermore, as pointed out by Mariotti (2022), it might be difficult for “econometrics and other quantitative exercises […] to unravel the complex and causal relationships at play. […] Historical events and their chains of cause-effect relations can provide explanations that go beyond their time to help understand subsequent events and outcomes” (p.771). The analysis, while suggesting a particular methodological approach, has the limitation of being restricted to a single case study – one firm/one sector/one country. Therefore, further evidence and international comparison are needed before generalizations can be drawn. However, our tentative conclusion is that the impact of the Spanish Flu on the organization of labour in Italy could have been less remarkable than expected for several reasons. First, despite the great number of victims, the deadliest wave of the Spanish Flu pandemic lasted only few months. Second, the simultaneous end of the Great War provoked the immediate demobilization of the army that overwhelmed the negative, if any, impact of the pandemic on the labour supply. Third, the Great War-induced change in the workforce composition (i.e. the massive participation of women in the job market) probably contributed to make the system more resilient in the face of exogenous shocks. Hence, archival evidence does not support the existence of a remarkable negative supply shock as a consequence of the Spanish Flu pandemic, at least in Italy, because of the existence of other concomitant events. In this sense, our archival analysis suggests that, in order to have the complete picture of the forces at work, any pandemic episode should be analysed by taking into account all the relevant historical aspects. There is a bunch of papers that address the spatial dimension of the implications of the Spanish Flu while focusing on different aspects. Barro and Ursúa (2008) perform an econometric exercise to estimate the capacity of several historical events – namely, World War I, World War II, the Spanish Flu pandemic, the Great Depression, and post-World War II crisis (as the Latin America debt crisis) – of provoking GDP “disasters” (see Barro and Ursúa, 2008, p.1). It is found that, for several countries, the impact of World War I has been much greater than that of the influenza pandemic. This is true, for instance, for UK, France, and Germany, whereas for the US, which have been quite immune from the consequences of Great War, the Spanish Flu provoked a greater contraction of the GDP. Overall, Barro and Ursúa (2008) conclude that “the most serious economic disaster in terms of incidence and severity of declines in […] GDP was World War II. This event was followed in terms of economic impact by World War I and the Great Depression of the early 1930s—which had similar overall consequences” (p.15). Notably, the Spanish Flu is not mentioned in this ranking. Hence, the results in Barro and Ursúa (2008) are in line with our archival evidence (even if limited to the Italian case), where the Spanish Flu seems to be perceived by the contemporaries as less impacting by far than the World War I in terms of labour organization. At the opposite, our conclusions are in contrast with the estimations reported by Barro et al. (2020). Indeed, Barro et al. (2020) – somehow questioning their previous conclusions in Barro and Ursúa (2008) – estimate the impact on GDP growth only of the World War I and the Spanish Flu, and conclude that “the Great Influenza Pandemic is estimated to have reduced real per capita GDP by 6.2% in the typical country [while] World War I is estimated to have reduced real per capita GDP in the typical country by 8.4%” (pp.11–12). Though restricted to the implications on labour organization in Italy, our archival evidence does not suggest a dramatic impact of the Spanish Flu, whereas it seems to confirm the importance of the Great War in terms of labour supply (and hence personnel management). Consequently, archival evidence points out to a much greater impact of the latter also in terms of GDP reduction.Footnote 5 For a more direct comparison, our work could be related to Karlsson et al. (2014), which consider the impact of the Spanish Flu in Sweden. Notably, Sweden has not been directly involved in the World War I, so there are no confounding effects related to the war that might add to the implications of the pandemic.Footnote 6 In particular, Karlsson et al. (2014) find that the Spanish Flu had a significant effect on the labour supply of females and minor, that have been asked to replace the adult males that deceased due to the influenza. Even if the econometric results in Karlsson et al. (2014) do not allow disentangling the implications of such a replacement in terms of work organization, they echo what happened in Italy as a consequence of the World War I, rather than the Spanish Flu. In other words, one might suspect that, in the absence of the war event, labour supply – and, consequently, work organization – would have been more responsive to the pandemic episode than it really was.Footnote 7,Footnote 8 The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we reconstruct the epidemiological framework of the Spanish Flu in Italy. In Sect. 3 we provide the archival analyses. Section 4 discusses and concludes.",

Yair Grinberger,Daniel Felsenstein,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Faced with COVID-19, governments have invariably turned to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI's) such as mask wearing, mobility restrictions and lockdowns to complement pharmaceutical interventions (Hsiang et al. 2020, Batty et al. 2021). These are considered a relevant response for pandemic containment due to the appearance of new variants, the slow progress of vaccination rollout, resistance to vaccination and the decline of vaccination effectiveness over time. Amongst NPI's, lockdowns are criticized for their ineffectiveness and adverse effects on welfare and economic activity (Deb et al. 2020; Marroquín et al. 2020). Dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, requires rigorous means for evaluating lockdowns. Assessing the effectiveness of lockdowns is limited by the contingency of contagion processes on complex socio-spatial interactions and the limited ability for comparing chosen policies with those not implemented. Computational models are often used when making epidemiological decisions. Most notable is the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model, which uses a set of differential equations to estimate the spread of a virus over time (Kermack and McKendrick 1991). This model however lacks any spatial component and is limited when trying to assess fine-grained spatial policies. This issue can be resolved by micro simulation which animates the SEIR model with spatio-temporal dynamics by modeling interactions of individuals over time and space. Agent-based models (ABMs), have been used to simulate epidemiological processes (Alam et al. 2017; Crooks and Hailegiorgis 2014; Siettos et al. 2015), including the diffusion of COVID-19 (Cuevas 2020; Kerr et al. 2021). While these studies allow for assessing the implications of various scenarios, they present a trade-off in terms of spatial resolution. They either define agents as individuals operating within small-scale areas or as collectives such as communities operating over a wide region (O’Sullivan et al. 2020). This paper presents a novel urban ABM for simulating COVID-19 contagion processes and assessing the effects of lockdown strategies. Based on a generic description of urban dynamics and the behavior of citizens, along with general epidemiological parameters, this model can be fitted to any type of epidemic. Lockdowns are formalized within the model via the timing and duration for which buildings in different locations and land uses close down. The model uses highly granular real-world data (see also Firth et al. 2020, Grinberger and Felsenstein 2016) relating to individual citizens and discrete buildings for representing the urban environment, thereby generating outputs at high-level spatial resolution, allowing for a more subtle understanding of the implications of lockdowns. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the general structure of the model, inputs and its mechanics. Section 3 describes the study area for model implementation. Empirical findings and comparisons across different lockdowns are presented in Sect. 4. These relate to global indicators such as total and daily infection rates and to micro-level outputs at different scales such as individual contagion chains, building-level infections rates and COVID-19 import–export networks by neighborhood. Section 5 concludes and discusses policy implications.",

Del Bo,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"While the current COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, researchers warn against the possibility of new viral outbreaks (Carlson et al. 2022) thus suggesting the need to understand how to boost our ability to respond effectively. Vaccination campaigns are one instrument that can help mitigate the adverse effects of pandemics. The aim of this paper is to understand which institutional factors, both at the national and the subnational level, are associated with a higher success rate of a vaccination campaign, measured by the percentage of vaccinated population against COVID-19 across countries. Singling out the institutional aspects related to a successful vaccination rollout may suggest areas for policy intervention aimed at strengthening factors that will, in the event of future pandemics, contribute to curbing the negative consequences associated with them. Understanding the role of decentralization and subnational authority is also useful in light of other global challenges, which require the intervention of different government tiers, such as the climate change crisis.",

Alao,Abdulkareem Alhassan,Ojonugwa Usman,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A clear understanding of the effect of oil price fluctuations on output growth (industrial production) is vital, not only for the developing world but also for the most industrialized countries. Unexpected shocks in the most industrialized countries send resultant waves across the world, especially in the global productivity and oil market (Hamilton 1983; Alhassan and Kilishi 2016; Olanipekun et al. 2019; Balcilar et al. 2017, 2022a; Jelilov et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2021; Olasehinde-Williams 2021; Ringim et al. 2022). Also, oil irrelevance in the manufacturing and industrial sectors is widely speculated in the nearest future, as countries continue to introduce policies that discourage fossil fuel consumption (Meckling and Nahm 2019; Dong et al. 2022; Liu and Chao 2022). This study therefore explores the impact of oil price volatility on the output growth of the most industrialized countries—United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan. The study is motivated by the fact that very few studies have so far adopted symmetric and asymmetric GARCH modelling in analyzing the impact of oil price movements on industrial production. This is quite an important issue as it has been established that symmetric modelling of the transmission mechanism of oil price volatility does not sufficiently capture the impact of economic cycles and policy changes (Donayre and Wilmot 2016). Nonlinear asymmetric modelling of oil price movements, as employed in this study, is thus becoming increasingly popular. This study has two main objectives. First, it examines the interconnectedness between oil price volatility and output growth. Second, it investigates the asymmetric impact of oil price volatility. The study therefore contributes to the existing literature by focusing on the output growth and oil market of the G7, which are the most industrialized countries. The asymmetric or non-symmetric estimation measures the responsiveness of the industrial production index to negative and positive shocks in oil price. The high volume of oil exports and imports by the G7 countries help maintain their giant economies and also provide them with sufficient energy to power their industrial/manufacturing hubs. While some of these nations produce and export huge volumes of oil for profit, others require large quantities of oil to maintain their economic growth and power their industries. US, a member of G7, ranks as one of the top 2 oil importers (with 12% of world oil imports) as well as one of the top 4 oil exporters (with 7.6% of world oil exports), while Canada and UK, also members, are ranked the 6th and 13th largest oil exporters with 7.2% and 2.4% of global oil exports respectively [International Trade Centre (ITC), 2020]. With regards to oil imports, UK, Germany, France, Japan and Italy account for 2.3%, 4%, 1.8%, 6.4% and 2.4% of world oil imports respectively (ITC 2020). In extant literature, there is hardly any information on the symmetric/asymmetric spill-over from oil prices to output growth in the G7. Most studies focus mainly on the reaction of equity markets to oil price volatility. So far, only Alao and Payaslioglu (2021) has empirically examined the oil price and industrial production co-movement. This research thus uniquely fills this lacuna in the existing literature. The study is crucial as it makes an impactful contribution to the growing literature on the resultant effect of oil price on output growth in the G7. The findings will furnish the leadership of the G7, energy researchers/economists and petroleum engineers with necessary information. The following questions are answered: (i) how does the output growth of the G7 respond to volatilities in oil prices? (ii) are the asymmetric analyses truly asymmetric? The remaining part of the study is structured as follows: section two provides the literature review. Section three documents the research method. Section four presents the data and preliminary analysis. Section five discusses the results, while section six contains the conclusion, policy implication and future directions.",

Lyons,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The creative industries have been seen increasingly as a priority in economic development plans at the national, regional, and sub-regional level in the UK, in view of their export potential and capacity to catalyse economic growth (HM Government 2018). At the same time the spatial focus of economic development has been shifting towards sub-regions a trend that may be set to continue as devolution is placed centrally in the UK Government’s levelling up agenda (HM Government 2022). The Cardiff Capital Region (CCR) like other UK regions, has placed significant emphasis on the creative industries as part of its economic development strategy. The CCR is an interesting example city-region in that it houses a capital city, Cardiff and has a history of devolution in broadcasting and culture. The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant sustained impacts on both the supply and demand sides of the global economy (Baldwin and Tomiura 2020). The creative industries have been the worst impacted sector outside of tourism and hospitality (Khlystova et al. 2022). The impact of the shock has varied across the creative industries with the film and television sub-sector particularly badly affected. The CCR has a greater presence of film and TV production than other UK city-regions (Lyons and Davies 2022) and therefore is a particularly interesting case study for evaluating the impact of the shock. To date the evaluation of economic shocks in an IO framework in Wales has been limited to the national level with insufficient disaggregation to reveal the creative industries. This analysis seeks to understand the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the CCR creative industries using a novel sub-regional IO table extended to reveal the creative sectors (Lyons 2022). The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, this paper considers the impact of COVID-19 using IO at a fine geography relevant to the current policy discourse, the city-region. Secondly, the analysis focuses in on a narrow selection of industrial sectors, sub-sectors of the creative industries.

Energy consumption is the most critical component of the economy and a key input to economic activities. However, the type of energy is essential in terms of environmental quality (Shahzad 2020). Manufacturing, agriculture and energy sectors, which are economic growth triggers, play an active role in increasing emissions (Abid 2015). The increase in fossil fuel-based energy consumption causes emissions (Judkins et al. 1993; Wuebbles and Jain 2001; Martínez-Zarzoso and Maruotti 2011) and ecological footprint (Ibrahiem and Hanafy 2020) to increase and leads to many environmental problems, especially climate change. For this reason, countries are looking for ways to achieve sustainable development, which could help improve their welfare without harming the environment. Many indicators are used to represent environmental degradation. Generally, CO2 emissions represent environmental degradation, such as climate change (Alvarado et al. 2019; Destek and Sarkodie 2019; Apergis et al. 2020). However, ecological footprint (EF) considers both production and consumption processes and focuses on different dimensions of environmental degradation (Dogan et al. 2020). EF gives a better idea than many indicators since it offers an inclusive perspective on environmental degradation (Galli et al. 2012; Al-Mulali et al. 2015). Therefore, it has recently been used in many studies examining environmental degradation (Bello et al. 2018; Solarin 2019; Nathaniel et al. 2020a, b; Alola et al. 2021). EF was first introduced by Wackernagel and Rees (1996) and referred to the area required for a sustainable population. For example, built land, forest land, carbon footprint, grazing land, cultivated land, and oceans are included in these calculations. In addition, it includes resource consumption and generated waste (Solarin and Bello 2018). Overall, EF focuses on meeting and replenishing the world’s resource demand. Three leading indicators are generally used as determinants of EF in the literature. These are (i) economic growth, (ii) energy consumption, and (iii) globalization (Alper et al. 2022). In addition, many studies consider natural resources while explaining the effect of economic growth on EF (Hassan et al. 2019; Ahmed et al. 2020; Hussain et al. 2021; Nathaniel 2021; Zia et al. 2021; Jahanger et al. 2022). To calculate EF, the Global Footprint Network (2022) focuses on how much biologically productive space is required to meet individuals’ demands. If the computed footprint is less than the biocapacity, this is positive, and there is more than enough bio-space to meet the needs of that country. Conversely, if there is an ecological deficiency, the bio-capacity is insufficient to meet the demands. According to the calculations made by the Global Footprint Network (2018a, b), many countries in the world have an ecological deficit, and more than 85% of the world’s population lives in countries with ecological deficits. Therefore, it is clear that EF should be included in the strategies and policies to solve environmental problems.
 Turkey is the 8th largest economy among the European Union countries in 2020 (Statista 2020) and is responsible for 1.13% of the world’s CO2 emissions (Global Carbon Budget 2020). Therefore, Turkey’s energy demand has increased significantly as a developing country with an increasing population and rapid urbanization. In this context, the economy-environment interaction is essential in terms of environmental quality and the global climate change problem. Figure 1 shows the ecological footprint of Turkey. While there was an ecological reserve in Turkey during the 1961–1980 period, there has been an ecological deficit since 1980. Turkey has adopted the open economy and export-based industrialization models since 1980. This structural change in the economy has inevitably changed the environmental dynamics of the Turkish economy, and an ecological deficit has emerged. Source: Global Footprint (2018a, b) Ecological footprint versus biocapacity (gha). Figure 2 shows the GDP and CO2 emissions per capita. Accordingly, while GDP per capita has risen in the last few years, CO2 per capita has decreased. There has been a decoupling between economic growth and CO2 emissions since 2018. However, we have to see the future emissions to decide whether this divergence is temporary (due to COVID-19) or permanent. Source: Our World in Data (2022) Decoupling between GDP (per capita) and CO2 (per capita). The contribution of this study is to review Turkey’s climate change policies in the context of ecological footprint. Reducing CO2 emissions to combat climate change is not the only solution. In this context, examining the ecological footprint comprehensively will provide new tools to countries for long-term climate strategies. We also apply the FARDL bootstrap approach, which gives robust results for the small samples and considers structural breaks. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of mineral savings on environmental pollution in Turkey. This study suggests significant policy recommendations to Turkish policymakers to combat climate change, achieve net zero-emission targets by 2053 and adapt to European Green Deal. This study examined the determinants of the ecological footprint in Turkey. For this purpose, we investigate the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, mineral saving, and EF. The study consists of three parts. The first part introduces EF theoretically and discusses the current situation in Turkey. The second part presents a literature review on the relationship between ecological footprint and economic growth. In the third part, empirical analysis findings are reported. Finally, empirical findings are discussed, and some policy recommendations are suggested to policymakers.",2
