The number of record breaking precipitation events increased globally by 12% between 1981 and 2010, with record-breaking being defined as any daily rainfall (sum) that exceeds all previous observations in the given time series (Lehmann et al. 2015). These observations, however, are subject to high regional variability. In Europe as a whole, for example, the increase amounts to 31%, while at the same time the Mediterranean region experienced a reduction in record-breaking precipitation events by 27%. Regional climate models suggest a continued increase in extreme weather events. Regions may experience an increase in heavy precipitation events even though total precipitation in these regions is projected to decrease (IPCC 2012). By the end of the twenty first century, heavy winter precipitation is projected to increase in central and northern Europe and for north-eastern Europe, a further increase in heavy summer precipitation is expected (Beniston et al. 2007). The existing literature consistently finds a positive government spending reaction and a worsening of national budgets in response to natural disasters (Leppänen et al. 2015). Estimates provided by Lis and Nickel (2010) show that extreme weather events have a significant negative effect on countries’ budget deficits, ranging from 0.23% to 1.1% of gross domestic products (GDP). Generally, budgetary impacts of extreme weather events have so far only been analyzed at the national level (Ouattara and Strobl 2013; Lis and Nickel 2010; Heipertz and Nickel 2008). Impacts of extreme weather events and climate change, however, do vary at the subnational level and therefore affect regional governments differently (Leppänen et al. 2015). Effective climate change adaptation and risk management therefore have to be customized to specific regional circumstances (IPCC 2012). In order to implement successful flood risk management, policy makers have to understand the interaction between hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Crichton 2008) and aim to reduce flood risk at the regional level. To achieve this, they need to know where regional exposure, vulnerability, and eventually flood risk are highest i.e. which factors drive existing flood risk and where to reduce risk first. One way to obtain this information is to look at past flood related losses. Generally, there are different kinds of losses one may consider. Most existing studies analyze total economic losses (Hallegatte et al. 2007; Pfurtscheller 2014; Rojas et al. 2013). Other studies look at insured losses (e.g., Czajkowski et al. 2013; Barthel and Neumayer 2012; Changnon 2007, 2009). Typically these studies consider private losses and analyze the impacts these losses have on economic welfare at the national level. What is missing is an analysis of damages to public infrastructure and the effect these damages have on public spending at the regional (i.e. subnational) level. Damages to public infrastructure may have different repercussions than private losses. They are likely to be more costly (e.g. in EUR/m2 terms) as the furnishings and equipment of schools, hospitals, and kindergartens most likely exceed the average value of private furniture (Aerts et al. 2014). They have to be repaired quickly, because public infrastructure and buildings provide services the whole population relies on. They are not accounted for ex ante, and thus, they represent additional liabilities on top of compensation payments to the private sector. Despite these specific features, damages to public infrastructure have so far only been included in overall cost assessments of natural disasters without being differentiated from private damages. This article applies dynamic panel estimation to analyze the impact flood damages to public infrastructure have on four different budget figures of municipalities located in Upper Austria, Austria. The rationale for choosing this area is that Upper Austria is traversed by six big rivers (Danube, Enns, Inn, Salzach, Steyr and Traun) and is densely populated. Due to its diverse topography it is regularly affected by fluvial as well as pluvial flooding. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, it explicitly focuses on the budgetary impact of flood damages to public assets in a high income country with an elaborated risk management strategy in place. Second, by analyzing the response of four budget figures to public flood damages at municipal level it provides valuable insights regarding the detailed impacts of these damages at the regional level. The paper is structured as follows. “The Impact of Extreme Events on GDP, Welfare and Budget Positions” section provides an overview over the existing literature. The “Data” section describes the data and the “Empirical Strategy” section explains the empirical strategy followed. Results are presented in the “Results” section. The “Discussion and Conclusion” section discusses the results and concludes.",19

The volume of international trade has increased in absolute terms and relative to GDP in the last decades, as illustrated by Fig. 1. In 2017, the sum of merchandise exports and imports amounted to 44% of the global production. Nowadays, many production processes are embedded in international supply chain networks and would not be feasible without an intensive cross-border exchange of goods, services and finance (Dietzenbacher et al. 2012; Hummels et al. 2001). Consequently, international trade and the exchange of financial resources are perceived as a driver of economic growth, welfare, political freedom, security, and technological innovation. Global trade volume (in absolute terms and relative to GDP) from 1960 to 2017. Source: World Development Indicators Given the high relevance of international trade and financial flows, the quantitative analysis of possible effects of natural disasters and weather variations on these two areas is an interesting research question per se. Climate change, manifested by higher temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, and more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, will further increase the relevance of this topic (IPCC 2012). In the following, I briefly outline the relation between natural disasters, weather variations, climate and climate change. Weather variation is the temporal stochastic variation of temperature, precipitation and other weather variables (Dell et al. 2014). Natural disasters are major adverse events resulting from natural processes which may cause serious damage and the death of human beings. Except for geological or space disasters, they are usually related to extreme outcomes of weather variables. Climate can be defined as the long term distribution of weather variables (Hsiang 2016). Hence, climate change refers to a change in the stochastic long term distribution of weather. Recent IPCC reports summarize inter alia observed trends in temperature and precipitation, and project their respective future development (IPCC 2013, 2014). The key insights are that global average temperature increased by 0.85 °C between 1880 and 2012, precipitation patterns have changed and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased in many parts of the world. Natural disasters and weather variations may affect trade via different channels: Disasters can destroy transport infrastructure such as ports, container terminals, road or railway connections, thereby raising trade costs. Disasters and weather variations can affect production (mainly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors), and consequently the supply of tradable goods. If income is affected by weather variations or disasters, the demand for imports may change. Furthermore, imports of small developing countries may increase after a major natural disaster as a result of large inflows of external aid. International financial flows, such as foreign direct investments and equity flows, may react to changes in capital productivity induced by disasters and climate change, or – as in the case of foreign aid flows and remittances of emigrants – may be used to assist in the reconstruction process after a natural disaster. In the literature, more mechanisms than the ones already described can be found and will be described in the section on results. In this context, there is an emerging strand of empirical economic literature which aims to identify and quantify the effects of natural disasters, weather and climatic changes on international trade and financial flows.Footnote 1 In this review, I report the main conclusions, most important data sources, and empirical methods of studies from the gray and peer-reviewed literature. To the best of my knowledge, the review takes account of all publicly available studies that meet the following criteria: The study is an ex-post analysis. The analysis focusses on international trade or financial flows as the dependent variable. The estimation includes dimensions of natural disasters or weather variations as an explaining variable. The analysis is not restricted to a single event. Many of these studies include brief literature reviews themselves, and most find the empirical literature on the effects on trade in question to be extremely sparse. In fact, the number of the studies referenced ranges from zero to four. In contrast to these assessments, the present review shows that the number of trade studies meeting the abovementioned criteria is actually not that small but amounts to at least 21 papers published since 2008.Footnote 2 These studies can be deemed as reasonably independent from each other as just three authors contributed to more than one study. The existing literature is relatively diverse in terms of regional and temporal coverage, data sets used, disaster and weather definitions, methodologies, and main conclusions, as shown in the remainder of this review. Regarding financial flows, there are at least additional 12 studies published since 2005. The motivations of the summarized papers are just as diverse as their data and methodology. First and foremost, the mere relevance of international trade for modern economies and societies, alongside with ongoing climate change, is the main motivation for the outlined research question. In the literature on climate change, it is well acknowledged that even if the largest and richest economies of the world were relatively resilient towards the direct (domestic) effects of global warming and natural disasters, they could be severely affected in an indirect way, namely by the impact of climate change or disaster on their trading partners. This indirect effect could even exceed direct effects (Freeman and Guzman 2009; Knittel et al. 2018; Schenker 2013; U.S. Global Change Research Program 2018). There is one particularly interesting question to be answered in the urgently-needed quantitative analysis of this potential channel of climate impacts: Are trade effects of climatic events or changes indeed already observable in ex-post analyses and how large are they? Furthermore, there is a range of more specific motivations behind the reviewed studies: Some authors focus on developing countries because for many of these economies exports and imports are crucial for their economic development (Andrada da Silva and Cernat 2012; Cuaresma et al. 2008; El Hadri et al. 2018; Heger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2018; Pascasio et al. 2014). There is also a focus on developing countries in most studies on financial flows, as remittances and foreign aid inflows are often key components of their national income accounts. Another motivation is the usage of trade data (which is often reported by international agencies or customs authorities) as an arguably more reliable and detailed measure of economic activity than national indicators such as GDP, which is reported by the country itself (Hsiang and Jina 2014; Jones and Olken 2010; Li et al. 2015; Mohan 2017). Moreover, some studies focus on the role of institutions and political indicators for the resilience towards natural disasters (Gassebner et al. 2010; Oh and Reuveny 2010). Cuaresma et al. (2008) and Pelli and Tschopp (2017) raise the question whether natural disasters may induce technological change via a build-back better effect and use product-specific trade data to test their hypotheses. Finally, some more isolated motivational settings include the analysis of temporal and spatial displacement of trade flows and the substitutability of ports in the USA (Sytsma 2018a), the disentangling of the total disaster effect on trade into partial effects (El Hadri et al. 2018), the disentangling of total disaster effects on GDP into its national income components (Mohan et al. 2018), and an analysis of economic impacts of hurricanes in a historical setting (Mohan and Strobl 2013). In the following, I first focus on the effects on trade of goods and services. In this main part of the paper, I summarize the main characteristics of the 21 trade studies, present the datasets on trade, weather variations, and natural disasters, discuss the estimation methods, and synthesize the main conclusions. Second, I briefly review the adjacent literature strand on international financial flows. In the concluding section, I define some common challenges and knowledge gaps and suggest ideas for future research.",17

Never before has an economy as interlinked as the present system been subject to shocks as large as the lockdowns in the wake of COVID-19. Already in March with the lockdown of China alone, Indian pharmaceutical companies began to struggle as they procure more than 70% of active pharmaceutical ingredients from sellers located within the geographical boundries of China (Chatterjee 2020). Matters are not very different in the US and other parts of the world. In a recent survey conducted by the US based Institute for Supply Management, nearly three quarters of the respondents said they had experienced supply chain disruptions (Zeiger 2020). Similarly, Hassan et al. (2020) in a study of the earning calls of more than 12,000 publicly listed companies based in more than 70 countries find that supply chain disruption has become one of the primary concerns of firms around the world. Interestingly enough the stock markets have responded more to COVID-19 than to the Spanish Flu which killed rough 2% of the world population (Barro et al. 2020). Baker et al. (2020), among others, have argued that the sizeably greater response of stock markets to COVID-19 may have something to do with the greater interlinkage of the global economy coupled with the supply-chain disruption caused by the lockdowns. In this paper, we use an agent-based model of out-of-equilibrium economic dynamics to analyze the propagation of the lockdown shocks through input-output linkages. And on this basis assess the short-term costs of the COVID lockdowns. Our model builds on Gualdi and Mandel’s (2016) agent-based extension of Acemoglu et al.’s (2012) equilibrium production network model. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system by unbundling a sequence of decisions which are assumed to occur contemporaneously in equilibrium models. This out-of-equilibrium approach allows us to characterise relative price deviations, spill over of excess demands from one market to another, and non-linear paths of sectoral and aggregate recovery after an exogenous shock. Note that within such a general disequilibrium setting, prices at each time step are not generated by a Walrasian auctioneer who considers the inter-relations between all markets. Rather prices emerge from the interactions between agents who act as buyers in their input market and sellers in their output market. These decentralized interactions mean that the system can be out-of-equilibrium for a substantial period of time. Furthermore, the spill over of excess demands from one market to another is a major source of the disruption of the economic system and therefore an important determinant of the cost the lockdown. Within our setting, the propagation of the lockdown shock through the system generates miscoordination as firms no longer combine inputs in proportions determined by equilibrium prices. The economy suffers not only from the shortage of intermediate inputs but also because inputs are not combined in equilibrium proportions. This is not because firms do not minimise costs, they do, but because firms face disequilibrium prices using which they minimize costs. The propagation of disequilibrium prices and the miscoordination it generates are an important determinant of the cost of the lockdown. It is likely therefore that equilibrium models which ignore such dynamics understate the cost of the supply-chain disruptions. We calibrate our model to the world economy using the World Input-Output Table with 56 sectors in 44 countries (Timmer et al. 2015). We initialise the world economy by setting all variables to their equilibrium values corresponding to the primitives defined by the input-output relations, the exponents of the production functions, and other parameters. We then shock the equilibrated system with the temporal sequence of the lockdowns observed in the real world using publicly available information on the start and end dates of the lockdown. We therefore have two distinct lockdown periods. The first of which extends from February 1 to March 15 and the second of which begins on 15 March. Most world economies enforced a lockdown within the first 10 days of the second period, with the lockdown duration ranging from 40 to 60 days. Note that the lockdown policies were not homogeneous in their sectoral composition. Many countries distinguished between essential and non-essential services, allowing some sectors to operate at reduced capacity, while others were completely shutdown. We shock the equilibrium world economy using a sectoral decomposition of lockdown provide by the IFO-Institute (2020). We then study the geographical and sectoral propagation of the lockdown shocks using computational experiments on our calibrated model economy. We compute not only the direct cost of the lockdown but also the indirect costs which emerge from supply-chain disruptions. Our estimates suggest that the indirect costs can be roughly equivalent to the direct costs, with the relation between two being mediated by the degree of substitutability between intermediate inputs. An economy with high complementarity between intermediate inputs will suffer more from supply-chain disruptions than an economy with high substitutability. The role of price flexibility is limited because the major hurdle faced by firms is sizeable reductions in the availablity of inputs, with few input producers being in a position to respond to the price changes by producing more. Our estimates suggest that the lockdown reduces global output by about 33% at the peak of the lockdown, with the yearly impact being more than 9% of annual GDP. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Related Literature” reviews the related literature. Section “The Model” introduces the model. Section “Shock Propagation in the Global Economy” presents the results of our analysis of the COVID lockdowns. Section “Concluding Remarks” concludes the paper.",82

The start and end dates of these orders varied, however, with some states (eight in all) never issuing blanket orders at all.Footnote 1 What explains the timing of these orders, including their wide variability? There is an assumed tradeoff embodied in the issuing of a stay-at-home order. Its primary intent is to protect lives and reduce peak infection rates (i.e. “flattening the curve”), but it invariably comes with the tradeoff of reduced short-run economic activity.Footnote 2 A governor is presumably concerned with both. In the U.S., which concern dominated in influencing the timing of both issuing, and then ending, these stay at home orders? We explore two hypotheses: first, that the variation in policy response was driven by various epidemiological and economic factors, including population density, age of citizenry, and degree of economic activity. Alternatively, we explore the possibility that the stay at home orders were driven less by any sort of epidemiologic-economic tradeoff, but instead by politics, or ideology, with factors including governor’s party and percent of the state voting for Trump in 2016 affecting the time to response in issuing, and later lifting, the stay-at-home orders. Of course, both sets of variables could have some effect on response time and duration of orders, but it would be useful to know if a certain set of factors mattered more, in more places, as that could inform future policy responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to predict policy responses to similar health crises in the future. Further, as researchers seek answers about the impact of policy responses on the eventual numbers of cases and deaths, selection and timing of policy responses are likely to be important factors in eventual mortality rates. One recent study (Pei et al. 2020) found that if stay-at-home orders had been issued just one week earlier, as much as 55% of the subsequent coronavirus-related reported deaths could have been avoided, although if the timing of response orders is endogenous, the modeling and these results would need to be refined. There is also some concern that lack of compliance with any stay-at-home-order reduced its effectiveness, so the ultimate impact of any stay-at-home-order on infection and mortality rates would need empirical verification. This paper provides background on the overall issue. COVID-19 arrived with startling speed at the beginning of 2020, but with similarly quick response times, the academic community began to study it. Two benefit-cost analyses came out in March, 2020 (Thunstrom et al. 2020; Greenstone and Nigam 2020) investigating the benefits versus the costs of social distancing. Both of these studies concluded that the benefits to social distancing (and thus the utility to issuing state-wide stay-at-home orders) far outweighed the costs,Footnote 3 however the calculation didn’t appear as straightforward to governors who had to weigh protecting citizens’ health (where most of the benefits in the benefit-cost analyses were calculated to have come from), with economic activity, including job losses and business bankruptcies. Another academic study also came out quickly in March (Adolph et al. 2020), which analyzed five types of state-wide policy responses to the pandemic from school closures to stay-at-home orders. The main conclusion was that political variables were the primary drivers of all types of state-wide policy responses. Other variables were investigated, but it was the ideological variables that dominated. This result that politics and political factors dominated policy and public responses to the pandemic is echoed in many other recent studies as well, including Allcott et al. (2020), Barrios and Hochberg (2020), Bursztyn et al. (2020), Gadarian et al. (2020), Makridis and Rothwell (2020), and Painter and Qiu (2020). The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (Faria e Castro 2020), also came out with a COVID-19 related study in March of 2020, investigating policy response options at the fiscal policy level, and La et al. (2020) provided one of the first country-wide policy response comparison studies. Various aspects of COVID-19 continue to be investigated by academics from numerous disciplines,Footnote 4 but perhaps some of the most relevant work to the question posed in this paper appeared before COVID-19 hit. One such study (Clay et al. 2019) investigated the 1918 influenza pandemic and factors related to the variation in mortality across U.S. cities. Factors that turned out to be important included pre-pandemic levels of air pollution, and pre-pandemic poverty rates. The analysis is incomplete, however, as the authors themselves note that one thing not modeled, but which likely made a difference, is the policy response to the pandemic by local governments. Indeed, St. Louis is widely touted as an example of a city that reacted to the 1918 influenza in such a way as to significantly improve the mortality rates it experienced, as compared to other U.S. cities whose policy responses were lacking (CDC 2020). Baekkeskov (2016) investigated the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and specifically, federal-level government responses to it. The paper is narrative, as opposed to empirical, but in interviewing policy experts and comparing responses across European governments, the author found that policy drivers had a significant effect on a country’s response to a pandemic. Baekkeskov (2016) hypothesized a science-driven versus ideology-driven dichotomy in the impetus for government policy responses, and found that in the H1N1 example, at least, the evidence “best supports” the idea that ideology was more of a driver than, as they put it, the Science-Led Policy-Making Model (SLP). Given such previous evidence for the importance of ideology in government policy responses, this paper tests not just the obvious epidemiological-economic tradeoff to issuing (and then lifting) state-wide stay-at-home orders, but also the importance of ideological drivers. Our hypotheses, then, ask what were the main drivers of U.S. policy responses at the state level to the COVID-19 pandemic: epidemiological and economic factors, or ideology? A simplified theoretical model for the policy decision can be modeled as an epidemiological-based versus economic-based tradeoff,Footnote 5 where the slope of any given state’s production possibilities frontier is determined by various epidemiological factors including infection rates and composition of the population, and economic factors related to manufacturing and overall economic activity. Where along the production possibilities frontier a policy point is ultimately chosen is determined by state-based preference functions which are hypothesized to be affected by ideological factors.Footnote 6 We use data from a variety of sources to construct a cross-sectional dataset with variables related to each of the fifty U.S. states (see Table 1). Our two dependent variables are: “Stay-at-home Order” and “Length of Stay-at-home Order” (see Table 2 and Fig. 1). Stay-at-home-Order is a count variable of the number of days from March 1 until a governor issued a state-wide stay-at-home order.Footnote 7 Length of Stay-at-home Order is also a count variable, and it measures the length in days of the state-wide stay at home order from its initiation until the day it began to be lifted.Footnote 8 Histograms of Dependent Variables The independent variables can be categorized into three groups related to our hypotheses: epidemiological variables (Percent of Population Aged 65+, Population Density, Percent of Population identifying as African American, State Poverty Rate, Excess Death Rate in 2020 from All Causes, and COVID-19 Death Rate), economic-related variables (State GDP per capita, 2019 Economic Growth, Industrial MwH per Total MwH, the Increase in the State’s Unemployment Rate from January to April 2020, and Percent of Residents with a Baccalaureate Degree), and political variables (Percent Urban Population, a Medicaid Expansion dummy variable, Percent Trump Vote in 2016, a Democratic Governor dummy variable, and the state’s Number of Electoral Votes). The epidemiologic variables describe a state’s vulnerability to the spread of infectious disease and potential for resulting mortality from COVID-19. Percent of Population Aged 65+ is the percentage of each state’s population that is age 65 or older. It comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data from 2019.Footnote 9 It was recognized early on that COVID-19 had a disparate effect on older segments of the population. Data on state population density come from the “Percent Urban and Rural in 2010 by State” table at the U.S. Census 2010 Census Urban and Rural Classification and Urban Area Criteria website.Footnote 10 The more dense a population, the easier it is for any virus to spread, including the coronavirus.Footnote 11 Data on the racial and ethnic composition of state populations come from the Kaiser Family Foundation and are based on American Community Survey data from 2018.Footnote 12 Early in the pandemic the disparate effect of the coronavirus on the African American population was not immediately apparent, and we discuss the implications of this in the results section. State poverty rates are two-year averages over 2017–18 from the U.S. Census Bureau.Footnote 13 Poverty rates are included as they impact the capacity for social distancing and separation from infected or potentially infected individuals. Data on the number of excess deaths over the period being examined come from the CDC.Footnote 14 We include both overall excess death rates from all causes and excess deaths not attributed to non-COVID-19 causes, and use the CDC’s weighted values to correct for reporting lags. Both overall excess death rates and death rates from causes not attributed to non-COVID-19 causes are included to allow for the possibility that while attribution of a death to COVID-19 for a person with multiple co-morbidities may be somewhat arbitrary, calculation of overall death rates is not. (Pappas 2020) A state’s experience with excess mortality might be expected to impact the length of its stay-at-home orders. The first state-wide economic variable is State GDP per capita, and comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis from the third quarter of 2019.Footnote 15 Next is the 2019 State-level economic growth rate, which is from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Footnote 16 GDP per capita and 2019 growth rates reflect the general economic robustness of the state’s economy, and if preventive measures against the spread of COVID are normal goods, may impact the timing or duration of stay-at-home orders. Industrial MwH per Total MwH is the megawatt hours of industrial electricity use per state, divided by total electrical consumption to yield industrial electricity as a percentage of the state’s total electricity use. This serves as a proxy for the portion of the state’s GDP represented by the industrial sector.Footnote 17 Industrial or manufacturing sectors may have been differently impacted by COVID than other sectors of the economy and those states with larger or smaller industrial sectors could face differing costs of social distancing. Unemployment rates come from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. State economies that were more heavily impacted by COVID and subsequent policy responses - as evidenced by the increase in unemployment from January to April of 2020 - may have been under greater economic pressure to reopen, potentially shortening stay-at-home orders. Finally, data on baccalaureate degrees in the state come from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems websiteFootnote 18 and give the percent of the population aged 25–64 who have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher, based on American Community Survey data from 2018. The first four political variables are all indicators for ideology. Percent Urban measures the percentage of each state’s population that lives in urban areas and comes from the “Percent Urban and Rural in 2010 by State” table at the U.S. Census 2010 Census Urban and Rural Classification and Urban Area Criteria website.Footnote 19 Data on implementation of expansion of Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act came from the Kaiser Family Foundation.Footnote 20 Data on the percentage of the state popular vote that went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election came from the World Population Review.Footnote 21 Party affiliation of governors are from the website 270 to Win.Footnote 22 The last political variable, State Electoral Votes, is an indicator of the importance of a state in U.S. federal elections.Footnote 23 We conducted duration (also called survival) analyses to model the delay from March 1 to initiation of the stay-at-home order, and then the length of the stay-at-home order. The data were analyzed in Stata (version 16.0) with a Weibull distribution (λ(t) =  exp (βx)αtα − 1) to allow flexibility in the direction of the duration dependence, positive or negative.Footnote 24 In each case, an unrestricted model with the political, scientific and economic variables was estimated. Results from these estimations are in Table 3. Duration model results for delay from March 1 are shown in the first column of Table 3. The model shown excludes the variable on race, as knowledge of COVID-19’s differential impact on African Americans was not well-known early in the pandemic. Indeed, the poverty rate variable holds more explanatory power here than percentage of the population that is African American.Footnote 25 The most important result from the model in column 1 is that political factors seem to be the primary determinants of when the stay-at-home order was issued. Results suggest that states with Democratic governors initiated orders sooner, while states that voted more heavily for President Trump initiated orders later, if at all. Not all of the political variables turned out to be significant, but those that did, especially the political party of the governor making the stay-at-home order decision, were strongly significant. A joint test of the political variables (noted at the bottom of Table 3) rejected the null hypothesis that they had no explanatory power with a p value of less than 0.001. A second conclusion from this first model (column one of Table 3) is that while the epidemiologic variables, as a group, had a slightly significant impact (at the 10% level) on the timing of the stay-at-home orders, this impact was not as strongly significant as that of the political variables. States with higher poverty rates were faster to issue stay-at-home orders, however, other individual epidemiological variables did not have much explanatory power, and the economic variables were wholly statistically insignificant. Turning to the final columns of Table 3, we investigate the determinants of the length of the stay-at-home orders. As with the previous model, political factors were everywhere strongly collectively significant (as can be seen in the joint tests at the bottom of the table). In particular, states with Democratic governors had significantly longer stay-at-home orders. In addition, the length of stay-at-home orders seems to have been related to a state’s electoral weight, with larger states having significantly, or nearly significantly, shorter orders. We can only speculate as to the reason for this relationship between electoral votes and length of stay-at-home, but in advance of the 2020 presidential election it may have been that states with more electoral votes were under greater pressure to reopen. Unlike the delay to initiation, the length of stay-at-home orders seems not to have been impacted by a state’s support for President Trump in 2016. Overall, in all four models, a joint test of the political variables rejected the null hypothesis that they had no explanatory power with p-values between 0.01 and 0.02. In a more significant break with the results on delay, the length of stay-at-home orders was also impacted by some economic factors. Longstanding economic conditions in the state, including state level GDP and the state’s reliance on manufacturing lead to longer stay-at-home orders. This suggests that sheltering at home is something of a normal good in the face of a pandemic. By contrast, a state’s increase in unemployment from January to April had no significant impact on the duration of the stay-at-home orders. Jointly, the economic variables demonstrated statistical significance similar to that of the political variables in these models. Neither a state’s vulnerability to the pandemic nor its excess mortality seem to have impacted the length of the stay-at-home orders, however. None of the epidemiological variables had significant estimated coefficients. Both overall excess mortality from all causes and mortality not attributed to non-COVID-19 in March and April were examined, but neither yielded significant estimated coefficients. The joint tests as well show that, as a group, the epidemiological variables did not have a significant impact on the length of the stay-at-home orders. To summarize, political variables were significant in the decision-making for both the initiation, and the lifting of the stay-at-home orders. Epidemiologic factors appear to have played a role in the delay to initiation of stay at home orders, but economic variables came to matter more by the time decisions were being made as to the lifting of those orders. In terms of the theoretical model posited earlier in this paper, it seems that states either were not maximizing utility as expressed in terms of short run economic growth and reduced mortality or that states had varying preferences as expressed by their underlying political tendencies.",7

Pandemic policy interventions in our consideration refer to containment and closure policies that aim to limit social contact. Anecdotal evidence and policy dynamics suggest that accelerated COVID-19 mortality induces a tighter pandemic policy response aimed at slowing the otherwise geometric patterns of the pandemic. With a lag of several weeks, these policies ought to reduce the mortality rate, with reductions varying systematically across countries. Specifically, as COVID-19 mortality affects disproportionally the older population and people with pre-existing conditions, a given increase in policy intensity may have a greater proportionate impact on future mortality in older societies, and in countries with higher average exposure to pre-existing medical conditions. In the same vein, higher urbanization rates, higher population density, and mobility, other things being equal, ought to magnify the decline in future mortality rates associated with a more aggressive pandemic policy stance. Key factors in modeling a pandemic and in guiding policy-making include the infection rates; the mortality rates associated with infections; the ability and effectiveness of the policies, medical system, and society to adapt to the changing dynamics of a pandemic; and other structural factors [Verity et al. 2020]. In the absence of vaccines, policies which limit social contact are a key strategy adopted by most countries amid the COVID-19 pandemic to flatten the curve. However, the strictness and timing of such policy interventions vary substantially across countries. Additionally, institutional and demographic characteristics such as the proportion of elderly and urban populations, the nation’s level of democracy, etc., may influence mortality dynamics both directly through the size of vulnerable populations, and indirectly through citizens’ perceptions and behavioral responses to stringent policies (Van Bavel et al. 2020). Our empirical specification controls for these considerations, subject to the limited data available on key factors. Specifically, the scarcity of COVID-19 testing, and the limited information on the precision of available tests, implies a vast underestimation of the infection rates per capita, possibly by a factor of two digits.Footnote 1 The undercount of COVID-19 population mortality rates is also prevalent, but by an order of magnitude below the errors associated with infection rates.Footnote 2 Therefore, we focus mostly on accounting for the COVID-19 population mortality rates per capita during the first phase of the pandemic, controlling for policy and structural factors subject to data availability and quality. We plan to revisit these issues with better quality and longer-term data in the coming quarters. A fair share of the countries reached a local peak of the COVID-19 population daily new mortality rate curve during the sample period [see Figs. 1, 2 and 3].Footnote 3 Applying various techniques, we study the factors accounting for the empirical shape of the mortality curve from the onset of the pandemic to the local peak, with a focus on the impact of policy intensity interacting with structural variables. Like similar studies, one should use healthy skepticism in reading the results. First, data quality and availability are a major limitation, as each country has its challenges with data collection, aggregation, and reporting. Second, ‘better performance’ in the first mitigation phase of a pandemic does not guarantee superior future performance, as the dynamics of a new viral pandemic are yet unknown. By design, flattening the pandemic curve shifts some mortality incidence forward. The susceptibility to secondary waves of infection remains a looming threat.Footnote 4 Policies adopted in the second quarter of 2020, and the realized pandemic infections, containment, and treatment will explain the future performance of each country. Furthermore, only time and much more medical research will tell the degree to which infected persons that recovered gained immunity for a long enough period to allow smooth convergence to ‘herd immunity.’ COVID-19 mortality rate curves, by country.

Note: Cumulated daily deaths across all countries in the sample Our study relies on daily COVID-19 policy and case data reported by Oxford and John Hopkins University, as well as Apple mobility data and various controls. Our baseline estimation study examines OECD and Emerging Market (EM) sub-samples based on data from 1/23/2020–4/28/2020; or the first 97 days of the pandemic. Below, we summarize the main results. First, we investigate the evolution of weekly mortality growth rates over time and across countries. Applying dynamic panel analysis, local projections (Jordà 2005) suggest that administering more stringent pandemic policies were associated with significantly lower mortality growth rates, with a lag of 2 to 4 weeks, during the first pandemic phase (i.e., during the time from the first death through the end of the sample period). Countries with a Stringency Index (SI) 10 units higher than average had, two weeks later, mortality growth rates that were on average 22 percentage points lower (Oxford’s SI is normalized between 0 to 100; where 100 = strictest response). The reductions in mortality growth rate are smaller after three and four weeks, roughly 17 and 13 percentage points respectively. While the reduction in growth rates seem quite large, it is important to put these numbers in perspective. Given the geometric nature of disease spread, oftentimes, week-over-week mortality growth rates can be anywhere from +50% to +100% or greater. Taking slow-moving country fundamentals from the period pre-COVID-19 as exogeneous, we find that countries in the 75th percentile in terms of proportion elderly (65 or older) saw a much stronger reduction in mortality growth rates from the same 10 unit rise in SI, compared to countries with relatively low proportions of elderly (25th percentile). Countries in the 75th (25th) percentile saw mortality growth rates of about −25% (−10%) after two weeks. Countries with a greater proportion of the elderly are unconditionally more susceptible to the pandemic, but for this same reason, they are likely to benefit more under stringent policies. In countries with a higher proportion of urban population, SI measures had a stronger impact on mortality growth than in countries with a lower proportion of urban population. This heterogeneity is consistent with the fact that urban populations may face greater exposure due to their high population densities. Greater policy stringency is also more strongly associated with lower mortality growth during the first phase of the pandemic in countries with greater inbound travel, greater GNI per capita, higher health expenditures and a greater level of democracy (measured with the EIU Democracy Index).Footnote 5 While international travel flows are quite intuitive risk factors for a pandemic like COVID-19, the role of democratic freedom is an ongoing topic of debate (Ang 2020). Our results are consistent with the view that greater individual rights may be detrimental in this situation, making it more difficult for the government to administer strict quarantines and have citizens abide by them. Next, we turn to cross-country regression results, where the dependent variables include the logged peak new mortality rate (calculated as the new deaths out of the population at the peak of daily new mortality, by country), and the ratio of ‘peak new mortality rate’-to-‘pandemic duration to first peak’ measured in days (a proxy for flatness/steepness of the mortality rate curve). Definitions of these peak-related dependent variables are illustrated in Fig. 4 using the daily new mortality curve of Czechia. Countries with more aggressive policy interventions in place prior to the first death tend to exhibit a lower new mortality rate at the peak (“Early SI” or “proactive stringency policy”).Footnote 6 We find that a one unit increase in Early SI (average SI level prior to the first COVID mortality) is associated with peak new mortality rates on average − 12% lower. Quantitatively, early SI was also associated with flatter mortality curves, but the estimate is statistically insignificant. Unsurprisingly, higher early mortality growth rates (growth rate of new mortality rate in the first week following the first death) are significantly associated with higher peak mortalities and steeper mortality curves, while higher levels of the mortality rate early on (cumulative mortality rate within the first week following the first death) were associated with flatter overall mortality curves.Footnote 7 Greater early mobility was also significantly associated with higher mortality peaks. Higher population density is, somewhat surprisingly, associated with flatter mortality curves (column [2]). However, this association may be driven by the fact that many of the high-density countries are in Asia. Overall, the evidence suggests (but does not necessarily assert) that policy stringency directly reduced the peak mortality rates, and that other forces were also at play (e.g., early mobility, initial pandemic conditions, institutional features). Peak-related dependent variables in country case of Czechia Not only do mortality rates during the first pandemic phase differ across countries, there is also considerable variation in how long new deaths continued to climb in terms of days. We term this as the ‘pandemic duration to the first peak’ (PD). One should be careful when interpreting the effects of covariates on the PD in terms of altering the shapes of mortality curves, as a longer PD could be accompanied by a higher peak mortality rate and thus a steeper curve, or a lower peak mortality rate and thus a flatter curve. Fitting a Kaplan-Meyer curve for the PD over all countries in the sample, in number of days, suggests that countries with stronger Early SI measures (above the average) had significantly lower PDs on the way to the first local peak of the mortality/day curve, compared to countries which did not. The probability of peaking after 40 days is close to 0% for above-average Early SI countries (virtually all of these countries experienced their first local peak by day 40). For below-average Early SI countries, it took approximately 80 days, twice the amount of time, until the first peak was reached. To better understand the cross-country variation in PD, we estimate a Cox proportional hazards model. Higher mortality rates early on are associated with shorter pandemic durations to the peak, while countries realizing higher mortality peaks tend to have, unsurprisingly, longer pandemic durations to the peak. Although the negative association between the strictness of early policy interventions and the pandemic duration to the peak is not significant under the Cox model, more aggressive policy interventions early on could still be associated with a shorter pandemic duration to the peak through reducing mortality peaks as evidenced by the cross-country analysis. Countries that responded faster prior to the first death had shorter pandemic duration to the peak. Additionally, countries with greater proportions of elderly populations, greater proportions of urban population, greater shares of vulnerable employment tend to exhibit shorter pandemic durations to the peak.Footnote 8 Moreover, under certain specifications, the level of democratic freedom appears to be a highly significant determinant in pandemic duration to the peak. That is, countries that have a higher level of democracy saw longer pandemic durations to the peak. Countries further away from the equator also tended to experience longer PD. While at this stage we are reporting suggestive statistical associations, more data and research are needed to get fuller identifications of all these factors.",33

It was first diagnosed, as a atypical case of pneumonia, in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and since then it has become a pandemic, spreading to all around the world. Although since the outbreak in December 2019 until March 6, 2020, it took a few months to get to 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases around the globe, but the number of cases has doubled every few days in March (World Health Organization (WHO) 2020). Such an increase has occurred despite multiple measures such as social distancing (also called physical distancing), telework, closed schools and universities, quarantine of cities, cancellation of sports events, cruises, festivals, and other gatherings that governments in many countries have prompted. As of June, 2020, globally, there has been more than 10.23 million confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 500,000 deaths (World Health Organization (WHO) 2020). In the beginning, the spread of COVID-19 was not a serious concern in the United States. However, the situation suddenly escalated and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths suddenly boomed and rose above other countries. According to the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020), in January 14, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US was only 3 cases, whereas in the middle of April, it suddenly jumped to more than 520,000 cases, and it is 2,632,656 as of June 28. New York with highest number of confirmed cases has been the epicenter of COVID-19 in the US. The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in New York state alone currently are the fifth highest among all other the countries (and had been the highest up until early June). It all started on March 1, 2020, when the first confirmed case in New York was announced. Since then until June 28, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased to 416,769 cases. This is despite multiple protective measures against the new Coronavirus enforced in New York. The measures range from declaring a state of emergency, to closing schools, restricting mass gatherings, and issuing Stay-At-Home Coronavirus Order for the entire New York state. COVID-19 has caused severe negative consequences for the economy of the US and New York by disrupting and introducing risks and vulnerabilities. According to the (US Department of Labor), the Weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims have increased to a peak of more than 6.2 million Seasonally Adjusted Initial Claims in the week ending April 4, 2020. The same data in the comparable week in 2019 shows that there were 203,000 Seasonally Adjusted Initial Claims. In New York, for the last week of March number of new claims was reported to be 366,595, followed by 344,451 new claims in the week ending April 4, 2020, and the peak happened in the second week of April; a week with 394,701 new cases. The total number of New Yorkers filing new jobless claims has surpassed 1.7 million by the end of April. Such numbers shows the severity of COVID-19 and the impacts on New York’s economy. The very high level of jobless claims is more than 4/5 of the total jobless claims filed during the entire time of the Great Recession in June 2007-November 2009. It is specially important to study and aim to understand the economic consequences of the outbreak and the shutdown during this period of time, as any information as such plays a critical role in the decision making processes such as “reopening” policies and timelines. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) uses official service surveys as well as goods sector survey (which are delayed and less frequent) to estimate GDP. The most timely service sector activity within the BEA’s national income and product accounts (NIPA) comes from the Quarterly Services Survey, which is unavailable for the Advanced GDP release, and in lieu of this data the staff at the BEA estimates services GDP based on a judgmental trend. In all likelihood we will not know the full extent of the economic damage until the 2020 benchmark revisions are released in June-2021. So we believe studies that pay attention to the economic effects of the outbreak can be essential during this period of time. Many studies have aimed to provide better understanding of the economic aspects of the lock-downs from different point of view ever-since the outbreak started. Mandel and Veetil (2020) take a supple chain point of view and work with a multi-sector disequilibrium model with buyer-seller relations between agents located in different countries; and using the World Input-Output Table they calibrate their model to the world economy involving 56 sectors in 44 countries. They conclude that world output falls by 7% at the early stage of the crisis when only China is under lock-down and by 23% at the peak of the crisis when many countries are under a lock-down. From a similar point of view (Pichler et al. 2020) analyse the economics and epidemiology of different scenarios for a phased restart of the UK economy. They investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting their best estimates for the increase in GDP. In a more related study, Wang et al. (2020) work with a VAR model and analyse the effect of COVID-19 on the quarterly output of China, working with the daily railway passenger volume data during the Spring Festival travel rush as an exogenous variable, and establish three time series to model the railway passenger volume, GDP in the first quarter model, and GDP in the last three quarters respectively. The VAR model, which enables us to capture the co-variation of economic/financial variables and to utilize it to forecast an outcome variable of interest or to measure the responses of each outcome variable to exogenous shocks, is a very popular among researchers specifically those exploring aggregated macro economic variables (Berisha 2020; Aviral et al 2011; Narayan et al. 2008; Hatemi-J 2014; Giordano et al. 2007). In this paper, we use a two-step forecast model to study the impact of COVID-19 on New York’s economic output; Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In our model, the weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims is one of the variables. Furthermore, following (Wang et al. 2020), the second variable is the total weekly Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) card swipes. Although MTA is not the only transportation medium in the state of New York, but by serving a population of 15.3 million people in the New York metropolitan area, MTA is the largest transportation network in North America and is one of the main transport modes to get to workplace. In the beginning of the outbreak, there were plans to shut down the network. However, being one of the main means of transportation, the plans were never implemented. So in our model we use the ridership to help us capture and present economic activity. The detail of our proposed two-step model is as follows. In the first step, we forecast the effect of the COVID-19 on New York’s workforce. We use a series of weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims as a representative of the work-force condition in a Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model, along with a series of total weekly Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) card swipes representing economic activities. The highly continuous (negative) co-variation of these two series over a long period of time, incorporated in a VAR model which captures such variation of economic time series, enhances our ability to more precisely estimate and measure the magnitude of the shocks these series have encountered recently. In the first stage, we work with the weekly data to have a higher precision as the circumstances have changed rapidly and over a short period of time. Following, using the weekly forecast values we measure the quarterly magnitude of the downfall in the workforce employment since the outbreak. Next, in the second step, we use a VAR model this time with quarterly data and we estimate the response of the GDP with respect to the overall employment shock we measure from the first step. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section “Sample and Data” introduces the data and sources. Section “2-Step VAR Model” presents the model and discusses the findings and insights. Last section concludes the paper.",41

While the adverse effects on the economy are revealing at the macro-level, the impact of the pandemic is likely to be heterogenous across countries and individuals. Moreover, the adverse effects may not be confined to the domestic markets but may be transmitted internationally, particularly in the case of developing countries. This paper explores the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the welfare of households in a remittance-dependent country, which is likely to be severely exposed to external shocks. The pandemic is expected to substantially reduce the amount of remittances that migrants from developing countries can send home. The World Bank estimates that global remittances will decline sharply by about 20% in 2020, the sharpest in recent history, and that remittances to low and middle-income countries are projected to fall by 19.7%.Footnote 1 Many migrants may lose their jobs or be forced to accept lower wages due to lockdowns or oil price crashes in their destination countries (IOM, 2020); they may not be able to send remittances due to stringent movement restrictions and exclusion of money transfer service providers from the list of “essential services” (World Bank, 2020b). Furthermore, many intended migrants who had been preparing for their departure in the near future will be forced to change their livelihood plans for the coming years. In 2019, 80% of the world’s total remittances flowed to low-and-middle-income countries (World Bank, 2020c); therefore, the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak may be more serious in developing countries whose citizens heavily depend on remittances from migrant family members. The Philippines is a sensible case to study for several reasons. First, the country is one of the largest source countries for migrants in the world and is one of the most remittance-dependent, ranked fourth in terms of remittance inflow (Yang, 2011). The proportion of remittances relative to the country’s GDP was close to 10% (World Bank, 2020a, b, c and d). Moreover, some of the countries that host Filipino migrants are the most seriously affected by lockdowns and oil price crashes. The number of overseas Filipino workers was estimated at 2.2 million in 2016 with the top destinations being Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Hong Kong, and Singapore, which combined accounts for two-thirds of total destinations (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2017). The diversity of destinations implies that the impact of COVID-19 may be heterogenous even among Filipino migrants. The Philippine Government has reacted by providing cash relief to overseas migrant workers and their families who are suffering hardship.Footnote 2 In this paper, we use a household-level dataset which was collected in in the Philippines before the COVID-19 outbreak. We first pin down the empirical relationship between remittance income and welfare of households by two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumenting remittance income by a macroeconomic variable exogenous to households. We then project the potential impact of the COVID-19 shock in destination countries on the welfare of remittance-dependent households by utilizing the revision of the 2020 GDP forecasts by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which were made before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the difference between the predicted outcomes of with- and no-COVID projections provides us with the potential shocks on the remittances and other economic welfare outcomes of remittance-receiving households. Our projections show that remittance inflow will decrease by 14–20% and household spending per capita will decline by 1–2% in one year, as a result of the pandemic. Furthermore, the negative impact can substantially vary across different type of households. This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset used in this study. Section 3 examines the effect of macroeconomic shocks on household living standards prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Section 4 performs several projections to gauge the impact of the pandemic on household welfare. Section 5 concludes.",18

Their needs, in order to survive and thrive are different, their dreams and hopes are different, and their necessities ought to be supported and taken care of by adults, not by themselves (Barnes and Wright 2012; Boyden et al. 2012; Jones and Sumner 2011; Lyytikäinen et al. 2006; Nieuwenhuys 1994; Wordsworth et al. 2005). Thus, when measuring child poverty, it is important to use a direct multidimensional measurement. Nevertheless, in the context of COVID-19 and its aftermath, children’s families are suffering from sharp reductions in employment and income. These developments also affect children negatively and can lead to a violation of their right to a minimum standard of living. Consequently, in this article we measure the situation of children indirectly by the level of consumption/income of the household. First, we assess that prior to COVID-19 one out of three children lived in monetary poor households (henceforth MPHs) based on national poverty lines in developing countries. This is, to our knowledge, the first time such an estimate has been carried out. Then, we project there could be between 122 and 144 million additional children living in MPHs by the end of 2020 (compared to 2019). Moreover, there could be between 80 and 144 million additional children in these circumstances by the end of 2021. We use, country-by-country, the prevalence of monetary poverty based on national poverty lines from the World Bank database, GDP growth projections for 2020 and 2021 from the IMF and the World Bank, and population growth projections from the UN Population Division. As, in general, poorer households have more children, we use household survey data (from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and Demographic and Health Surveys) to arrive at the share of children per wealth decile. We combine this information with likely changes in income distribution of varying strength (based on historical trends from the UNU WIDER database) to establish a range of possible paths for the percentage and number of children in MPHs. Ours is one of the few simulations of changes in monetary poverty due to COVID-19 that takes income distribution fluctuations into account (i.e. we do not linearly translate projected declines in per capita income in the country to all households). Moreover, it is the only estimate we know that uses country specific data on income distribution by country (as opposed to a generic assumption about changes in Gini across countries). Besides this introduction, the article is structured as follows. First, we describe the main results and sources of data. This is followed by an explanation about how the baseline (the “pre-COVID” situation) was estimated and how the simulations were carried out. The assumptions (included discarded ones) and models used to estimate the impact of COVID-19 are explained. The paper closes with a few conclusions and suggestions for further research.",4

However, vaccine production and distribution are slow, with the Biden administration stated goal of administering only 1.5 million vaccines daily.Footnote 1 In the meantime, the virus continues to claim about as many lives every day as the 9/11 tragedy. While some European countries have implemented a new round of national lockdowns, there is resistance to imposing more stringent COVID restrictions in the United States.Footnote 2 The costs of a lockdown are felt in real time in the form of inconveniences and lost wages while the benefits from the reduced number of illnesses and deaths come in the future, and as such they may be perceived as hypothetical and underestimated. Moreover, the public may view the pandemic risks as acceptable because children are largely unaffected and frontline workers and first responders are getting protection from the virus by being among the first to be vaccinated (e.g., (Tumpey et al. 2018), Table 12.1). Despite society as a whole being potentially less concerned about saving the lives of the more vulnerable older adults,Footnote 3 the older people’s lives are valuable to them.Footnote 4 The value of life can be quantified by a person’s willingness to pay to stay alive, with metrics such as the value of statistical life (VSL) and discounted quality-adjusted life years (dQALY) being widely used in policy decisions. Moreover, the fatality data shows that COVID-19 also poses substantial risks to the lives of younger people who may be unaware of their health vulnerabilities ex-ante and therefore fail to take adequate precautions. The COVID experience from around the world has shown that centralized policies are critical to achieving an optimal pandemic management. The failed Swedish experiment has illustrated that it may be impossible to selectively protect the vulnerable population without a government intervention.Footnote 5 Analysing U.S. data, (Boehmer et al. 2020) find that increased rates of infection among young people in the June–August 2020 period helped transmit the virus to more vulnerable high-risk groups, such as older adults. This happened in spite of the broad awareness that older population faces higher risks. Even when a COVID infection is not fatal, it is still costly because the sick consume medical services that could have been allocated to other health conditions. They also miss days of productive work, reducing GDP (or in the case of children and older adults, their caretakers miss productive work days). I perform a cost-benefit analysis of a possible lockdown by comparing its benefits that come from reducing the number of future infections until the vaccination target is reached to the incremental costs a lockdown would impose on the economy and finding the optimal stopping time before incremental costs start to exceed incremental benefits. I model the COVID-19 pandemic curve using the SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model widely used in epidemiology. I rely on the COVID literature to obtain the model parameters, such as the basic reproduction number that prevails with the social distancing measures currently in place, as well how it will change during a nation-wide lockdown, similar to lockdowns implemented in Europe in Spring 2020. The expected future monetary cost of the COVID pandemic is calculated from the following three components: (1) the loss of productivity due to missed work of the symptomatically ill; (2) the cost of medical interventions that could have been used elsewhere; and (3) the value of lives of the projected fatalities. I estimate that if no additional restrictions are imposed, even with the vaccination program currently in place, the pandemic will cost an additional $1.3 trillion going forward if the value of statistical life (VSL) is used to value life and $368 billion if life is valued with discounted quality-adjusted life years (dQALY). Evidence shows that the lockdown measures adopted in parts of the United States and Europe in Spring 2020, which included bans on large social gatherings, closures of public places such as gyms, schools, bars and entertainment venues, and shelter-in-place orders, were highly successful at reducing the virus transmission (e.g., (Courtemanche et al. 2020) and (Flaxman et al. 2020)). The benefit of a lockdown is calculated based on reducing the number of new infections going forward, and therefore avoiding a portion of these costs. Obviously, the longer the lockdown lasts, the larger the reduction in the number of new cases it will achieve. If the policymaker’s only objective were to minimize the attack rate (the fraction of the population that will become symptomatically ill), the optimal solution would be to extend the lockdown until the vaccination target is reached. However, each additional week of a lockdown has a lower impact on reducing future infections because the immune population is continuously expanding due to vaccinations, and since the benefits should be balanced against the costs to the economy, a lockdown should be optimally stopped sooner. Analyzing whether it is optimal to start a lockdown a week from now, I find that it is and that such a lockdown should last between two and four weeks, depending on the assumptions made, and will generate a net benefit up to $653 billion, or 3% of GDP. I additionally consider two hypothetical scenarios. First, I evaluate the effect of the proposal to switch from two to one vaccine doses in order to reach more people sooner. By reducing vaccine effectiveness, this proposal would leave the higher-risk older population more vulnerable to the adverse health consequences of the virus. As a result, the number of deaths will increase. I find that a lockdown would be even more beneficial, generating up to $302 billion more in net savings, and its optimal duration will remain the same as under the two-dose vaccination plan. Second, I consider a hypothetical scenario in which the more contagious so-called “U.K. variant” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus becomes the predominant variant in the United States, just like it has in the United Kingdom. If this occurs, the pandemic will be much more devastating, with more people getting sick and dying. I find that a lockdown will bring even greater net benefits, estimated to be up to $2.2 trillion, and the optimal lockdown duration will increase by four weeks, to the total of eight weeks, in the main specification. In sum, under all scenarios considered, and with various combinations of plausible assumptions and parameter values, I find that a lockdown is a valuable non-pharmaceutical intervention that will help save a large number of lives and reduce the overall cost of the pandemic.",10

Gholipour,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of drought on property prices in provinces of Iran throughout 2006–2015. A few works to date on global warming/climatic factors and property prices have attempted to examine the impact of changes in the severity of drought on housing and residential land prices in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Our study addresses this gap in the literature. In this study, we extend the growing literature on the socio-economic consequences of climate change by examining the effect of meteorological factors on housing and residential land prices in Iran. We hypothesize that increases in property prices are stronger in those provinces with less water scarcity. Our hypothesis is motivated by findings of studies, which argue that higher housing values are associated with better amenities such as environmental improvement (Polinsky and Rubinfeld 1977; Roback 1982; Ho and Hite 2008; Huang et al. 2015; Galinato and Tantihkarnchana 2018). The case of Iran, which has special climate features, would give us a unique design setting to conduct this study and provide new insights from the Middle East. Iran is a country with significant cross-sectional variations in amenities and climate. While the country has been hit hard by drought, provinces of Iran are not equally affected by water shortage. Moreover, unlike countries such as Malaysia or Finland, the provinces in Iran have different climates types.Footnote 1 Thus, it is interesting to investigate how the regional property markets behave given such meteorological diversity. For example, our sample includes Mazandaran province with Caspian mild climate and East Azerbaijan province which has a cold mountain climate. Therefore, Iran’s geographic vastness offers significant spatial variation in climate-related variables and people in its different regions have been suffering from consequences of climate change, particularly water shortage.Footnote 2 We focus on the property (especially residential land asset) because it accounts for about 40% of national net capital stock in 2015, according to the Central Bank of Iran.Footnote 3 The volume of residential land transactions was 137,477 units in 2006, with the volume climbing to 298,463 units in 2011, according to a series of surveys conducted by the Statistical Centre of Iran.Footnote 4 Therefore, any significant depreciation or appreciation of property prices would have substantial impacts on the wealth of households and investors. Changes in housing prices matter for non-performing mortgages (Tajaddini and Gholipour 2017) which can have significant effects on bank balance sheets and the ability of banks to extend credit to households and businesses (Muellbauer 2012). Additionally, investors can change the residential land use (after the acquisition of land) for different purposes depending on business opportunities in various economic sectors (Gholipour and Lean 2017). Moreover, land use regulations are not well developed and well implemented and there is a substantial level of corruption among public officials who should be implementing the existing land use regulations (Sodaei 2015). It has also been shown that changes in property prices influence divorce rate, family formation, and income inequality in Iran (Farzanegan and Gholipour 2016; Farzanegan et al. 2016a, b; Gholipour and Farzanegan 2015). This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, the effect of climatological factors, climate change and environmental disasters on property prices are not well explored in the literature out of the U.S. (e.g. Butsic et al. 2011; Galinato and Tantihkarnchana 2018; Glaeser et al. 2008; Mendelsohn et al. 1994; Schlenker et al. 2005; Bunten and Kahn 2014; Eichholtz et al. 2018; Petkov 2018), Australia (Rajapaksa et al. 2017), Germany (Hamilton 2007), China (Huang et al. 2015) and Japan (Zhai et al. 2003). In particular, this issue for Middle Eastern countries is under-investigated. Second, previous studies examining the link between climatic factors and property prices have mainly focused on housing prices (Harrison et al. 2001; Bernstein et al. 2019) and farmland prices (Mendelsohn et al. 1994). Our research is the first to examine the effects of climatological factors on not only housing prices, but also residential land prices in Iran. To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical work on the effect of drought on property prices for Iran. Using dynamic system as well as difference Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators, our results show that intensifying drought reduces significantly the property values across Iran, controlling for other drivers of property prices. To set the scene, the next section reviews the literature on drought in Iran and climate change–property prices nexus. The section after describes the data and our empirical strategy. The results and robustness checks are presented and discussed in the fourth section. Concluding remarks are presented in the fifth section.",7

This is as a result of the extensive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) - or “lockdowns” - that most countries implemented in order to curtail the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and shield health systems from being overwhelmed (Ferguson et al. 2020; Hale et al. 2020). Throughout the world, this has severely curtailed entrepreneurship on the whole, notwithstanding the fact that the crisis created opportunities for some entrepreneurs in certain industries (Zahra 2020) and that start-ups rates have increased in certain countries (Romei 2020). As discussed by Naudé (2020a) the impacts will be of both a shorter and longer-term nature. Over the shorter term start-up rates for businesses based on opportunity-motivations may declineFootnote 1 and business failure rates rise, ceteris paribus, due to the the business cycle impact of a world economy that has gone into a sudden and deep recession.Footnote 2 Over the longer-term COVID-19 could have permanent impacts on entrepreneurship and contribute to a “prolonged recession” (Fairlie 2020, p.12). The danger therefore is that the COVID-19 pandemic will intensify the secular decline in entrepreneurship that is already noticeable in most advanced economies (Decker et al. 2016; Hopenhayn et al. 2018; Naudé 2020b). The search for policy responses to mitigate the adverse consequences of lockdowns, and to reduce the possible long-term fallout on entrepreneurship and the innovativeness of economies, will benefit from the availability of theoretically grounded and consistent models that can aid understanding of how extreme eventsFootnote 3, such as COVID-19 and the 2009-2010 global financial crisis for example, are structurally related to entrepreneurship. In 2011, in the immediate aftermath of the 2009-2010 global financial crisis, Gries and Naudé (2011, p.2) made the point that the relationship between entrepreneurship and extreme events were still poorly understood. In the meantime, there has been a growing literature on entrepreneurship in “difficult” contexts or extreme events, such as in conflict (e.g. Brück et al. 2013, Desai et al. 2013), genocide (e.g. Stel and Naudé 2016), social crises (e.g. Munoz et al. 2020), refugee-ship (e.g. Desai et al. (2020) and natural disasters (e.g. Crespo Cuaresma et al. 2008, Boudreaux et al. 2019). The relationship between entrepreneurship and “crises” more generally, including the concept of “crisis” are examined in Doern et al. (2019). Much of this useful literature tend to be empirical and descriptive, so that the need for theorizing remain. Good theorizing precedes empirical description and provide explanations, as distinct from descriptions. It is the essence of scientific thinking. As Deutsch (2011, p.4) put it “scientific theories are not ‘derived’ from anything [...] They are guesses - bold conjectures”. In this paper we provide some bold conjectures, using a novel theoretical model, to explain the impacts of extreme events, and specifically the impact of a pandemic such as COVID-19, on entrepreneurship. We do so by selectively reviewing the current state of the art, and departing from our own earlier work on the impact of the global financial crisis on entrepreneurship - see Gries and Naudé (2011). Moreover, we argue that the particularities of the COVID-19 crisis need to be taken explicitly into account, and that these are different from other extreme events. In particular, we consider the fact that, as discussed by Brinca et al. (2020) and Guerrieri et al. (2020), that COVID-19 is a “Keynesian” supply-shock, that is a supply-shock which causes a reduction in aggregate demand whilst keeping a part of the economy locked down and unable to respond in terms of supply to expansionary fiscal policy measures. Our model’s comparative statics shows that entrepreneurship recovery after COVID-19 will in general benefit from aggregate demand-side support measures, but even more pertinently if combined with additional measures such as a direct subsidies for start-ups, firm revenue losses and loan liabilities. Entrepreneurship will also benefit from a redistribution of income to the extent that it shifts more income to consumers who have a higher propensity to consume. Given that expenditure shifts will increase opportunities for some entrepreneurs in certain industries (see Zahra 2020), and given that there may be an innovation-response to this as well as to the Keynesian supply-shock caused by the pandemic, the total effect of all of this may even be to result in an increase in start-up rates over the short-term. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section we summarize the relevant literature on the impacts of extreme events on entrepreneurship, and in particular start-ups and innovation. Then, in “Theoretical Conjectures” we provide a simple but novel model to trace these impacts analytically and take into account the demand-side nature of the shock from COVID-19. Section “Impact of an Extreme Event: Comparative Statics” describes the comparative statics of the model from which policy implications can be drawn. Section “Concluding Remarks” concludes.",3

Although, due to several factors, there is still no consensus on how large is the impact on mortality numbers (Beaney et al. 2020; Kontis et al. 2020; Roser et al. 2020), its impact on the economy has been massive, with several countries having their worst recessions on record (IMF 2020; OECD 2020; World Bank 2020). The scale as well as the unexpected nature of the pandemic overshadowed what has been in recent years probably the most debated topic in terms of sustainability, namely, climate change due to human intervention. The behavioral changes that have happened worldwide, specially in terms of mobility (e.g. lockdowns, border closures, see Kurita and Managi (2020), Katafuchi et al. (2021), and Nakamura and Managi (2020)), led to some people to suggest positive impacts in the environment (Le Quéré et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020), which could be translated in improvements to population health, mortality reduction, and increased economic output, due to reductions in air pollution (Pandey et al. 2021). However, given the slow nature of climate change, it is unlikely that this would have any significant impacts in the overall trends. If anything, studies have shown that, although there was an improvement in air quality during lockdowns, these effects were only valid in the short-term, and pollution levels went back to the trend rapidly after cities started reopening (IEA 2020). Nevertheless, besides these purely direct effects on air pollution, there are other potential effects that may arise in the longer term, as the unexpected shocks to the economy and the population can have cascading effects due to their interconnected nature. Therefore, this study attempts to add some insights into the possible long-terms effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population-economy-environment nexus at a global level that can be caused by the observed increases in mortality and GDP drops. To do that I use Wonderland (Sanderson 1994), a highly stylized simulation model of the population-environment-economy nexus. This model presents two main advantages for this purpose: first, its parsimonious nature provides a simple way to analyze these interactions, without the needs of massive data or computational power. Second, and most important, it is one of the few, if not the only model, that explicitly includes mortality as a variable and driver, instead of using population aggregates. In this sense, it allows us to independently add external mortality and GDP shocks without intervening other variables of the model at a specific point in time (i.e. 2020 and 2021), and posteriorly, simulate the effect of these shocks into the future. Nevertheless, it is important to clearly acknowledge that Wonderland is a simplistic “toy model” and, therefore, these results should be taken carefully. However, in order to try to overcome this limitation, I start the study by using empirical data to estimate parameters of the Wonderland Model in order to match the observed global trends in the past years. For this, I follow two approaches, one which performs the estimation of the parameters taking each equation of the model separately (Non Linear Least Squares), and another which estimates the parameters of the system as a whole (Indirect Inference). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to fully econometrically estimate the parameters of a global scale model of the population-economy-environment nexus. The estimation procedures are able to fit the observed data quite closely, although a few of the parameters estimates are not very accurate. Moreover, a series of simulations using these estimated values (without the recently observed COVID-19 shocks) point to a world surpassing sustainability limits in the upcoming decades, in line with the forecasts of the majority of the more complex models, which gives support to the suitability of the Wonderland model for the analysis. Building on this, I externally add the COVID-19 pandemic to the model for the years 2020 and 2021 using excess death estimates from Kontis et al. (2020) to simulate the shock in terms of mortality, and scenarios of the effects of COVID-19 on GDP from IMF (2020) for the short-term effects in the economy. Then, I use the Wonderland model to simulate pathways from the year 2020 onwards to find that, while the consequences on the economy should be persistent and expected to last between 40 to 70 years, the effects in the environment can be considered to be largely negligible. Although there have been studies that look at the potential effects of the pandemic on the population (e.g. Banerjee et al. (2020), Ghisolfi et al. (2020), and Marois et al. (2020)), the economy (e.g. Baker et al. (2020), Fernandes (2020), and Maliszewska et al. (2020); Gharehgozli et al. (2020), Mandel and Veetil (2020), and Jena et al. (2021)) and the environment(e.g. Forster et al. (2020), Saadat et al. (2020), and Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020)) this is the first study (also to the best of my knowledge) that looks at the potential consequences in all these aspects at the same time. In addition, the current studies tend to focus on the short and, at most, medium terms effects of the pandemic, while here the purpose is to see how much the longer term trends are affected, looking to potential cascading effects and associated pitfalls in the upcoming decades. This paper is structured as follows. In the following section, I present and briefly describe the model from Sanderson (1994). Then, in Section “Parameter Estimation and Model Fit”, I present the procedures and the results from the estimation. In Section “Future Scenarios and the Impact of COVID-19” I show the results of the simulations using the estimated parameters from Section “Parameter Estimation and Model Fit”. In the last section, I present the conclusions.",3

English,S. Aaron Smith,Michael Gunderson,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"In the spring of 2019, U.S. agriculture experienced a record high number of prevented planted acres primarily due to historic rainfall across large portions of the Corn Belt and Mid-South (Newton 2019a). Producers of corn, upland cotton, soybean, and wheat were impacted with a substantial loss of revenue due to no crops being produced and marketed. With about 11.4 million acres of corn not planted, foregone gross revenue from crop sales likely exceeded $6 billion. For soybeans, wheat, and upland cotton, those numbers are estimated at 4.5 million acres and $2 billion, 2.2 million acres and $930 million, and 0.49 million acres and $325 million, respectively. To a large extent, prevented planting crop insurance and federal disaster assistance payments will reduce the adverse financial impact of a particularly wet spring on producers’ incomes. Full prevented planting crop insurance indemnities paid to producers are equal to the crop insurance guarantee (revenue or yield) multiplied by a commodity specific prevented planting factor for 2019 (corn – 55%, upland cotton – 50%, soybeans – 60%, and wheat – 60%). For example, a producer who purchased corn revenue insurance could receive a $308/acre prevented planting crop insurance indemnity.Footnote 1 Additionally, the federal government provided $3 billion in farm disaster assistance under the Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) (Newton 2019b). Thus, while it might not have been a particularly satisfying crop year, the adverse impact on producers’ incomes will be partially mitigated through federal government programs and payments. Other agricultural economists have already analyzed the farm level financial impacts (see for example: Newton 2019a, b; Schnitkey et al. 2019; Purdue University Center for Commercial Agriculture 2019). Instead of focusing on the loss of producers’ incomes as a result of prevented planted acres, our analysis focuses on the economic impacts, due to lost sales, for firms that provide inputs to farmers. Acres prevented from planting resulted in producers not incurring typical expenditures for planting and post planting inputs such as seed, crop nutrients, and crop protection (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.). Agricultural input manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers do not have similar opportunities to insure against foregone sales and have received no disaster assistance payments. Normally, the large geographic footprint of many of these firms mitigates the impact of localized weather effects. However, given the widespread nature of the wet spring, these firms were negatively affected across the Corn Belt and Mid-South, representing a substantial production area. Our analysis estimates the direct, indirect, and induced economic impact (multiplier impact) as a result of lost sales from firms that provide inputs to corn, upland cotton, soybeans, and wheat farmers including support activities (e.g. custom planting and application), petroleum refineries and manufacturing, fertilizer manufacturing and mixing, pesticide and other agricultural chemical manufacturing, transportation, and agricultural wholesale trade and retail. For our study region, the result of prevented planted acres in the 2019 crop year was a decrease in input purchases and, therefore, a decrease in transactions by producers of an estimated $2.9 billion to agribusiness firms. The research objective was to understand the scope and distribution of those foregone crop production expenditures among firms operating in the value chain before the farm gate. The $2.9 billion impact has substantial consequences for the firms operating in these sectors. With much of the infrastructure fixed and limited flexibility in reducing the labor force, profitability of agribusiness firms likely suffered as a result. The impact was largely shouldered by the agricultural retail sector. As farmers chose not to plant a crop, this eliminated the need for crop nutrients and protection chemicals. Agricultural retailers are largely reliant on a fixed infrastructure to manage inventories of these inputs in a relatively limited planting window. The reduction in inputs is exacerbated by a reduction in the need for custom application of these nutrients and protection chemicals. This reduction was passed up the value chain to manufacturers as well. A smaller, but significant portion of the reduction (more than $50 million) also impacted transportation.",1
5.0,3.0,Economics of Disasters and Climate Change,11 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41885-021-00092-5,Lockdowns and the US Unemployment Crisis,October 2021,Christian Dreger,Daniel Gros,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented economic decline. Since February 2020, policymakers around the globe have introduced several emergency measures such as social distancing and the wearing of masks, restrictions to mobility and travel and shutting down large parts of the economy, including firms, workplaces and schools. The aim to slow down the spread of the virus (flatten the curve) initially led to the harsh restrictions (lockdown). During the summer period, many restrictions were lifted or relaxed, only to be reinstated when infections surged again during autumn and winter. The lockdown has been associated with a deep economic recession. Following Barro et al. (2020), the losses in output and consumption attributed to the current virus exceed those of the Spanish flu, even under conservative assumptions. The key question for policymakers is how to manage the trade-off between the spread of the virus and the severity of the lockdown. Dealing with this trade-off is a major challenge under pandemic conditions (Eichenbaum et al. 2020). The pandemic shifted both the aggregated supply and demand curve of the economy. On the supply side, infections and lockdowns worsened labour supply and productivity. On the demand side, layoffs and income losses (because of morbidity, quarantines, and unemployment) lowered household consumption and firms’ investment. For example, more than one half of the participants surveyed reported substantial income and wealth losses (Coibion et al. 2020). Large drops in consumption, especially in travel and clothing, are also involved. The high uncertainty with respect to the path, duration and impact of the pandemic might create downward spirals that dampen business and consumer confidence, with further job losses due to the anticipation of lower future demand. Higher credit default and non-performing loans might contribute to tighter lending standards. Guerrieri et al. (2020) argue that supply shocks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are amplified by changes in aggregate demand, especially shutdowns, layoffs and the exit of firms. The appropriate design of policies is of critical importance, as massive losses can be involved. However, empirical evidence on the economic impact of lockdown policies is rather limited. Several studies have discussed the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on the evolution of the pandemic, the latter proxied by the growth rate of infections in OECD member states (Pozo et al. 2020) or the decline in the virus reproduction rates (Brauner et al. 2020). Overall, the interventions are found to be successful in flattening the infection curve, to a more or less extent. Hsiang et al. (2020) argue that the interventions dampened the contagion, to the order of 61 million Covid-19 cases in six major countries (China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the US). We provide new evidence on the short run impact of social distancing measures on the local economy proxied by US state level unemployment. To ensure a high number of observations in a rather short period of the pandemic, high frequency business indicators are needed. Although some popular indicators such as trade volumes and electricity consumption have been reported, they cover only partial aspects of economic activities. Unemployment claims and rates are the only comprehensive variables at the short run (weekly) frequency. As 55 weeks and 51 states (including the District of Columbia) are involved, empirical evidence can be based on more than 2800 observations. The empirical evidence presented here is based on panel models with state specific thresholds. The results point to a strong and quick impact of the lockdown on unemployment. From the variety of measures, closures of schools and working places seem to be most critical for the economy. The bulk of the reaction of unemployment to a change in the social distancing restrictions is observed with a delay of 2–4 weeks. The evolution of unemployment is highly asymmetric. If the government switches to tighter regulations, the increase in unemployment is higher in absolute value than a decrease after a relaxation. Hence, the decline in unemployment towards the end of the sample cannot be explained in terms of regulation easing. Controls representing the spread of the disease, such as the number of new infections and fatalities exert some impact, but their role is minor. The next section provides a summary of existing studies of the economic impact of social distancing. Section 2 offers a small model of the impact of lockdowns on the labour market. Section 3 presents the broad trends of the US labour market during the ‘Great Lock-down’. Section 4 explains the Oxford index of restrictiveness used in the empirical analysis and Sect. 5 presents the main results from our panel estimates allowing for asymmetric effects, using data for US states. More than 55 weekly observations are available per state. Section 6 concludes.",8

While pandemics or health crises of various sorts have had economic consequences before (Bloom et al. 2020; Dieppe 2020), previous events were less globalized because they were confined to certain regions and because they occurred in economies less marked by the fluid interactions that characterize modern economies, both advanced and emerging. The new reality is societies with an ever-growing degree of social interaction and high mobility at the local, regional, and global levels (see Nakamura and Managi 2020). In such a context, the speed of transmission of a disease, captured by the coefficients of epidemiological models, has been fast and variable across regions and economic sectors. The combination of government intervention and social response to COVID-19 (see for example, Katafuchi et al. 2020) has led to short- and long-term uncertainties (the timing of the introduction of effective vaccines being one of them), multiple phases (Moore et al. 2020; Ahumada et al. 2020; Baqaee et al. 2020), and an ongoing adaptation of economic activity—all resulting in a macroeconomic cycle different from previous crises. This view is implicit in recent assessments of the economic effects of COVID-19 (IMF 2020a, b), since forecasts depend on the interaction between government policies and social responses, which in turn lead to a rather cautious view of the speed of recovery, with possibly marked differences between advanced and emerging economies. The explanations of the slow expected recovery go beyond the effects of fiscal and monetary policies to the interaction between health and economic outcomes under uncertainty and a “drag” caused by a reallocation shock that the economy needs to process (Barrero et al. 2020; Barrero and Bloom 2020). This “slow exit” hypothesis rests on evidence that high and sustained uncertainty due to COVID-19 fuels expectations of downside risks, which then exacerbate the recession, slow the recovery, and reduce the effectiveness of policy interventions, including current vaccination programs. While attention has been focused on the interactions among the spread of the pandemic, the effects of interventions, and the effects of behavioral responses on aggregate economic activity and employment (IMF 2020a), there is less evidence on the nature of the economic effects and the process of transmission of supply and demand shocks in given sectors after COVID-19. Several papers have studied the nature of the impacts on multi-sector economies. Brinca et al. (2020a, b) follow a decomposition proposed by Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) and use a SVAR estimation to classify, using U.S. labor data, supply and demand shocks across sectors. They obtain results that show that two-thirds of initial shocks were supply-side shocks concentrated in certain subsectors of domestic services (hospitality, such as hotels, restaurants, etc.), construction, and manufacturing. By contrast, infrastructure-related sectors, such as utilities and transport, suffered less, while other sectors, including information and financial services, fared relatively well. Theory-based models like that of Baqaee and Farhi (2020) study the effects of the COVID-19 crisis in a disaggregated Keynesian model with multiple sectors, finding that negative supply shocks are stagflationary, and negative demand shocks are deflationary. Guerrieri et al. (2020) show that in a model of multiple sectors and incomplete markets, and under certain assumptions, supply shocks can have effects that resemble demand shocks. Other theoretical models incorporate aspects of epidemiology into standard macroeconomic models; here, epidemics generate reductions in economic activity that are captured as negative supply and demand shocks (Eichenbaum et al. 2020). Some computable multisector models were implemented early on in the pandemic to simulate the global effects of lockdowns using input–output data (Mandel and Veetil 2020). Finally, going beyond aggregate intersectoral models, papers that study allocative shocks after COVID-19 have used firm data based on expected sales and employment to look at intrasectoral reallocations (Barrero et al. 2020). According to their vision, much of the allocative effect occurs within parts of the services sector, instead of across sectors. In the case of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), evidence is scant concerning the magnitude and nature of shocks following the COVID-19 pandemic. The lacunae extend to the differential nature of contraction in activity and employment, its sectoral decomposition, and, finally, the prospects for recovery. Available evidence (IMF 2020b) shows an employment contraction more severe than in advanced economies, associated with the stylized fact that unemployment is concentrated in hard-hit sectors such as services and construction and where small-size firms, informality, or soft contracting without job protection is pervasive. This evidence shows that the adjustment falls asymmetrically on sectors and firms that rely more heavily on informal labor contracts and have a relatively large (negative) productivity gap, low capital intensity, and low productivity.Footnote 1 Finally, while there is limited evidence (IMF 2020b) on the role of informality in adjustments to the COVID-19 crisis, some stylized facts on extensive and intensive margins of mobility across income deciles and across urban populations (Aromi et al. 2020) show that in the first decile of the income distribution, where informality approaches 90% in LAC economies, a faster recovery of mobility is found. This paper attempts to fill the gap in our knowledge about the sector-level effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on LAC. The unprecedented global scope of the pandemic complicates the task of benchmarking the pandemic to previous crises. The global crisis of 2008–2009 was characterized chiefly by productivity losses in the manufacturing sector owing to an interplay of international trade and financial shocks. The effects of COVID-19, by contrast, seem to be located in service subsectors, where demand and/or supply were constrained because of restrictions and social behavior. The losses in these subsectors may have had direct effects on the economy and indirect ones through their effect on other sectors—and in a way that may have lasting consequences on the productivity path of the economy. While the type and size of shocks may be different, their transmission across sectors can have lasting consequences, as explained, for example, in the sudden-stop literature (see Calvo et al. 2006) and in the study of total factor productivity (TFP) in LAC (Daude and Fernández-Arias 2010). Cross-sectoral transmission is also supported by Cavallo and Powell (2021), who use the KLEMS dataset to study the effect of macroeconomic crises on TFP in LAC, separating sectors by their capital intensity. In fact, capital-intensive sectors appear to have suffered lower output losses in the wake of COVID-19 (Brinca et al. 2020a, b). It is likely that they will adjust more easily to a new normal because of their high productivity. Among them, infrastructure-related sectors such as utilities, transport, and logistics may gain in productivity, exerting long-run effects on aggregate productivity growth. Thus, one might posit that economies were shaped by the pandemic as a function not only of the magnitude of the shocks they suffered, but also of their sectoral distribution. The flip side is that productivity growth in infrastructure may help to compensate for COVID-19 shocks by providing more efficient services and allowing demand to manifest itself more easily in the more affected sectors—thereby facilitating the economy’s adaptation to the new normal. Testing this hypothesis requires an empirical approximation of the relationship between sectoral productivity growth, COVID shocks, and infrastructure. With that in mind, we build on the literature on productivity growth, macroeconomic shocks and the interplay of infrastructure and growth. The global productivity slowdown that took place after the great recession of 2008–2009 posed challenges for advanced and emerging economies alike—and these have increased with COVID-19 (Dieppe 2020). Against this background, infrastructure investment can be a conduit to increasing productivity growth (Ahumada and Navajas 2019). Much of the literature on the effects of infrastructure since Aschauer (1989) view it as capital additions (public and private) that stimulate aggregate productivity and economic growth. More recently Ramey (2020) offered a solid elaboration on the interplay between infrastructure and aggregate output, separating short- and long-run effects. With respect to empirical research, the growth-infrastructure relationship has been profusely tested at the level of the economy, with results varying according to the types and forms of physical infrastructure (see, for example, Calderón et al. 2015; Calderón and Servén 2016; Estache and Garsous 2012; Égert et al. 2009), but all point to the relevance of infrastructure for long-term growth.Footnote 2 Evidence of the insufficiency of infrastructure investment in many emerging economies, including some in LAC, has come from an approach that measures investment gaps (see for example Fay et al. 2017; Dieppe 2020; Borensztein et al. 2014). However, the estimated gaps may not be reliable enough to guide priorities in a growth strategy based on what types of investment contribute most to raising per capita income (Izquierdo et al. 2016), or in a broader sustainable strategy (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). Another approach points to the need to focus on the “software” side of infrastructure provision (Cavallo et al. 2020). This approach highlights the need to focus on infrastructure as a service, particularly in regions such as LAC that have fiscal constraints and regulatory environments that make it difficult to close investment gaps quickly by increasing capital stocks exclusively. Within this broader vision, Ahumada and Navajas (2019) evaluate the effects that increases in the productivity of infrastructure-related sectors have on other sectors. They do so within a productivity-growth framework in which productivity in infrastructure-related sectors affects productivity growth in other sectors of the economy and thus exerts direct and indirect effects on aggregate productivity growth. They test sectoral effects in 25 countries using data from the Groningen GGDC dataset (Timmer et al. 2007, 2015). Employing an automatic selection procedure (and taking into account exogeneity and cross-dependance), the authors find several cointegrated relationships between the productivity of labor and capital in utilities, transport, and construction and that of several other sectors, from agriculture to services (wholesale, retail, and hospitality). Indirect effects of productivity improvements in infrastructure-related sectors are quantitatively more significant than direct effects, pointing to significant spillovers on other sectors.Footnote 3 This paper uses the growth-accounting KLEMS dataset for a group of eight LAC countries (LAKLEMS 2020; IDB and IVIE 2020; Mas and Benages, 2020; Hofman et al. 2017a, b). Combining this dataset with its sample-compatible counterpart for a group of 16 OECD countries (available for 1995–2015) allows us to study intersectoral transmission of shocks, which we use to calibrate a simulation of the COVID-19 shocks. Section 2 begins with a description of sectoral TFP shocks apparent in the KLEMS dataset for the years 1995–2015. We move on to gauge the shock from COVID-19 by tracking the changes in monthly sectoral output over 2020 in most of the countries of the KLEMS sample. In Sect. 3, we estimate a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) of sectoral rates of growth in labor productivity to characterize the nature and size of sectoral shocks for the OECD and LAC countries in the KLEMS dataset. Using the PVAR estimates, we then perform an impulse response simulation for shocks of one standard deviation in sectors such as wholesale, retail, and hospitality services; construction; and manufacturing, which we conjecture to be a good approximation of observed first-round shocks from COVID-19 in 2020. Separating estimates for the whole sample from those for LAC countries, we show that the latter suffered greater shocks. In Sect. 4 we compute direct and indirect effects of the selected shocks to labor productivity. We find that in the aggregate, effects in the three sectors add up to a 4.9% hit to economy-wide labor productivity in LAC and a 3.5% hit in the sample as a whole. In Sect. 5 we assess how much the productivity of infrastructure-related sectors would have to improve to compensate for the losses ascribable to COVID-19. We proceed by implementing—for the KLEMS dataset running from 1995 to 2015—the framework proposed in Ahumada and Navajas (2019) to estimate long-run relationships between productivity in wholesale, retail, commerce and hospitality, services (the sector most affected sector by COVID-19) shocks, and productivity improvements in infrastructure-related sectors. Specifically, we carry out an exercise in which we raise the productivity of infrastructure in order to observe the likely effects of such improvements on other sectors, chiefly wholesale, retail, and hospitality services (the subsectors most affected by COVID-19), but also manufacturing and construction. These are the sectors that, according to Brinca et al. (2020a; b) and from the evidence offered by the 2020 data, provide the appropriate characterization, qualitative and quantitative, of the COVID-19 shock. The rest of the sectors play a much more passive role. We then ask what degree of improvement in infrastructure productivity would be sufficient reverse the effect of this shock. Some policy implications and lines of further research are laid out in Sect. 6.",3

Natural disasters generate significant costs in the form of damaged property and infrastructure but may also have negative impacts on humans and the environment. This paper focuses on how different impacts of landslides are valued. The purpose is to elicit the preferences and willingness to pay for reductions in some of the consequences of landslides. Methodologically we apply a choice experiment approach. Although the literature on the social costs of climate change is substantial, studies on the valuation of impacts caused by extreme weather, and in particular landslides, are scarcer. There are studies focusing on landslide effects and the willingness to re-settle from landslide prone areas in developing countries (Charoenphong 1991; Mertens et al. 2018; Vlaeminck et al. 2016). When Vlaeminck study the willingness to re-settle from landslide prone areas in Uganda, they find that people living in high risk areas (on steep slopes or in villages that have already been affected by landslides) are more willing to re-settle than people living in low-risk areas (Vlaeminck et al., 2016). It has also been found that wealthier households are more willing to re-settle than poorer households and that institutional factors such as trust in institutions are important for the willingness to re-settle in Cameroon (Baert et al. 2020). In a European context, there are studies on the societal impacts of landslides focusing on e.g. Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the UK. To the best of our knowledge there is no previous study on the preferences for reducing landslide risk in Sweden. Flügel et al. (2015) apply a choice experiment to examine how car drivers in Norway value landslide risks compared to road accident risks. Vranken et al. (2013) use a restoration method approach to estimate (a lower bound for) landslide costs in Belgium. They find that reconstruction of roads and railroads damaged after landslides constitute an important part of these costs. Mattea et al. (2016) use a choice experiment to examine whether visual information affects preferences for different devices that can be used to reduce landslide risk in the Italian Alps. Their results show that visual information contribute to higher willingness-to-pay for the measure for which information was provided and they thus conclude that education may increase peoples’ willingness to pay for measures to reduce landslide risk (Mattea et al. 2016). Franceschinis et al. (2020) use the same data as Mattea et al. (2016) but apply a Latent Class model to analyze preference heterogeneity across groups. They find women with higher education and income more likely to belong to the class with a higher willingness to pay for all devices. When Thiene et al. (2017) analyze how subjective perceptions about the probabilities (for instance that a landslide will occur, and that people will die as a result) differ from science-based probabilities, they find that respondents overestimate these probabilities also after receiving information about the science-based estimates (in particular their own chance of dying were hugely overestimated). In a second step, Thiene et al. (2017) use the subjective risk perceptions in a choice experiment in which participants could choose between different types and levels of risk reductions, results reveal that that larger risk reductions, compared to baseline, were significant in explaining choices. Based on a review on the socio-economic consequences of natural disasters, Allaire (2018) argue that the evaluation of impacts is mainly focused to damages on infrastructure and property, while non-tangible impacts on health and public services are largely omitted. The aim of this study is to contribute with such knowledge in a Swedish context. Sweden has many relatively small municipalities (in number of citizens) and local decision structures; local authorities and decision makers often work simultaneously with different issues related to land and water use – sometimes with conflicting policy goals. Thus, the environmental values held by the citizens constitute important input for decision makers and public officials involved in climate change adaptation, such as undertaking measures aimed to reduce future landslide risk. This is where the present study contributes, by focusing on preferences closely linked to the same criteria used by the public authorities. These criteria – which are used as attributes in the choice experiment—include impacts on: human life, the environment, infrastructure, and on important societal services. Due to geological and hydrological characteristics, the Gothenburg region in the south-western part of the country is the most vulnerable to landslides and flooding. Most of previous landslides in the country have occurred in proximity to the Göta River and as a result of expected changes in precipitation in combination with continued urbanization this region is expected to be even more severely affected by landslides and flooding in the future (e.g. Kiilsgaard et al. 2015; Swedish Geotechnical Institute 2016; SOU, 2007:60). We use the Göta River area as our case study but will evaluate how different impacts are valued in a somewhat generic context, i.e. participants are asked to choose between alternatives describing different impacts of landslides in their municipality without specifying the context in detail for each municipality, instead the attributes and levels are selected to be considered reasonably realistic in each municipality in the region. This helps us to empirically challenge whether the different impacts are equally weighed as (implicitly) assumed in the assessments of the public authorities. Since policy makers and officials involved in mitigating or adapting society to the consequences of climate change often need to prioritize between different policies and measures, knowledge about how different types of impacts are valued in relative terms is highly relevant for the implementation of resource efficient risk reducing policies. If citizens do not consider different types of consequences equally important, decisions based on such (implicit) assumptions will lead to inefficient use of societal resources.",1

There is little doubt that this global health crisis found economists mostly unprepared, as the analysis of the pandemic’s effects has hardly found its way into the discipline’s most central publication avenues (Noy and Managi 2020). However, this does not mean that the economic analysis of pandemics is starting from scratch, as economists and economic historians have never ceased to expand our knowledge on the subject. The connection between pandemics and economic theory has historically been so relevant that it has directly contributed to labeling economics as the ‘dismal science’. Cipolla (1974) illustrates how reflections on the plague and its consequences led many scholars to develop Malthusian ideas on the complex long-term relationships between population growth, economic growth, and diseases, well in advance of the Essay on the Principle of Population (Malthus 1798). However, the Industrial Revolution and the concomitant development of medical knowledge led to a decreased incidence of catastrophic plagues in the West, and a corresponding decline in the interest in pandemics on the part of economists (Easterlin 1995). The demographic boom of the West and the visible lack of corresponding pestilence and famine further discredited Malthusian perspectives, leading to a disconnection between the demographic and economic disciplines. Furthermore, from 1900 to 2019, pandemics were either eclipsed by more disruptive events or had a relatively limited economic impact (Garrett 2008; Lee and McKibbin 2004; Noy and Managi 2020). Finally, the marginalist revolution greatly focused economists’ attention on purely economic elements, eliminating from the discipline those elements perceived as spurious, like the study of pandemics’ effects (Schumpeter 1954), relegating it to a debate of mainly historical interest. The expansion of economic analysis beyond its traditional boundaries that has occurred in the last two decades has gradually re-included the consequences of pandemics within economic theory, although most contributions remain on the periphery of academic debate and are relatively hidden (Arora 2001; Dunn 2006; Weil 2014). As Noy and Managi (2020) observed, the inherently multidisciplinary nature of pandemics, combined with its poor fit with what are called “hard” methods, have both conspired to make the contribution made by economists to the analysis of pandemics modest. The efforts of economists have been greatly augmented by the continuous work done by economic historians to understand the impact of past pandemics on the long-term development of various socioeconomic systems. Yet, while the total contribution to the economic analysis of the long-term impact of pandemics is significant, it is scattered across different journals, disciplines, academic approaches, and debates, making a review work necessary in order for all these contributions to become accessible. This paper reviews the long-term economic effects of pandemics, defined as health shocks arising from infectious diseases with global diffusion. Within the definition of long-term effects, we include both those mechanisms that are immediately present and persist for a significant amount of time and those effects that arise in the long term. Due to the focus of our analysis, transient short-term effects are not part of our study. To the best of our knowledge, few literature reviews have studied the connection between pandemics and economic development. Bleakley (2010) critically reviews how diseases, rather than pandemics specifically, affect human capital formation and income growth at the micro and macro levels. Costa (2015) describes how health improvements affect economic growth, with a specific focus on the US, concluding that improved health is not sufficient to foster growth. Finally, Boucekkine et al. (2008) formally analyze how and which growth models are better able to mathematically describe the epidemics’ effects. Moreover, some scholars have also reviewed the long-term economic effects of particular health shocks, like the preindustrial epidemics (Alfani 2021), Spanish flu (Beach et al. 2021), HIV (Gaffeo 2003; Zinyemba et al. 2020), and modern pandemics (Bloom et al. 2021). We differ from these works because we analyze the long-term impact of pandemics in general on economic development. A similar approach has been adopted by Gries and Naudé (2021) and Callegari and Feder (2021a), but with an entrepreneurship and not a macroeconomic focus. Our broad approach has led us to review a large number of studies in order to identify recurrent results across very different pandemic events. Pandemics could affect aggregate demand, aggregate supply, and productivity growth (Basco et al. 2021; Dieppe 2021; Guerrieri et al. 2020; Jinjarak et al. 2021; Rassy and Smith 2013; World Bank 2020). Recalling the Solovian framework, we divide the long-term pandemic economic effects into three categories: labor and human capital; investments and physical capital; and knowledge and innovation. We find that all productive inputs are affected in the long term by the pandemic. More specifically, labor and human capital are negatively affected directly by health shocks. However, the intensity of this effect is heterogeneous among countries, labor markets, and industries. Investments and physical capital are affected by pandemics through complex, interacting, and often contrasting mechanisms, leaving long-term effects ambiguous and usually marginal and non-linear. However, the asymmetric impact of pandemics on the capital market and household income leads to the poverty trap and highlights the weakness of the health insurance system in coping with these shocks. Finally, pandemics could positively affect innovations in public and private institutions and bring about relevant technological changes in industries. The scope and direction of these socioeconomic changes appear to mediate the long-term effects of pandemics, determining both their direction and scope. However, relevant and radical institutional changes are necessary if the impact of pandemics on development is to be positive. We therefore suggest that scholars should develop meta-analysis to understand the complex tapestry of long-term pandemic mechanisms. Many policy implications follow directly: an efficient public intervention must be characterized in the long term by flexibility, pro-market orientation, and design customization. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the selection methodology used in the review. Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe, respectively, the long-term effects of pandemics on: labor and human capital; investment and physical capital; and knowledge and innovation. Section 6 critically discusses the survey and summarizes the main lessons drawn from the literature for researchers and policymakers. Section 7 concludes.",9

This “fear factor” is intentional in the case of terrorist attacks, accidental in the case of toxic spills, and intrinsic in the case of pandemics. The fear induces behavior that often exacerbates direct losses from disasters in terms of GDP, employment and other macroeconomic indicators, as well as microeconomic welfare measures. Moreover, fear not only pertains to individuals but also to government actions through its elected officials and employees, potentially leading to especially costly responses to reduce risk. Examples of such behavioral responses to disasters include: Fear of airline travel following airline industry attacks Fear of working, shopping, and investing in sites struck by chemical, biological, radiologic and nuclear weapons Fear of rioting causing businesses to shut down Fear of returning to earthquake-stricken buildings over concerns for aftershocks Fear of impending hurricanes or floods causing government to evacuate residents prematurely Fear of human disease spread leading to government imposing sweeping business shutdown mandates and stay-at-home orders Fear of public assembly sites and the workplace during a pandemic Fear of animal disease spread causing extensive herd slaughtering Fear used as an excuse to ban all imports of suspected diseased or contaminated products Fear of continued terrorist activity leading to pre-emptive strikes Estimates of exaggerated behavioral responses to disasters indicate they can be sizable. For example, Rose et al. (﻿2009) estimated that 85% of the business interruption (BI) losses from the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks of September 11, 2001, were attributable to the almost 2-year reduction in airline travel and related tourism. Giesecke et al. (2012), analyzing a simulated “dirty” bomb attack in the financial district of Los Angeles, found that providing higher pay to employees for their aversion to the workplace, discounts to shoppers for their aversion to retail outlets and restaurants, and higher rates of return to investors for their aversion to the location would lead to impacts 15 times greater than ordinary estimates of GDP losses typically measured on the basis of the shutdown of the district for repair and decontamination. Other studies have found similar large responses from the 10 examples of fear-motivated responses noted above (see, e.g., von Winterfeldt and O'Sullivan 2006; New York Times 2011; Oladosu et al. 2013; Rose et al. 2017b; Gertz et al. 2019; Walmsley et al. 2021b). A major question is whether these behavioral consequences should be included in benefit–cost analysis (BCA) of projects, products, or policies intended to reduce disaster losses. We know that these effects take place, so one of the main issues is whether they can be isolated and measured in a way that avoids overlaps or double-counting with other effects in particular and are consistent with BCA principles in general (see, e.g., Boardman et al. 2018; Farrow and Rose 2018; Farrow 2020; von Winterfeldt et al. 2020). We need to be able to conceptualize and measure these effects so that they are neither over-counted or under-counted. There is a tendency in benefit–cost analysis (BCA) to shy away from inclusion of such impacts because they often defy quantification or are considered indirect effects. Not only are these behavioral reactions difficult to measure but also to include in policy analysis frameworks. For example, BCA is a powerful tool to evaluate projects, products and policies to reduce disaster losses, but it can also be confining in terms of what can be included among benefits and costs (U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2003; U.S. EPA Science Advisory Board 2017, 2021; Boardman 2018). In effect, diminishing what can be included in measuring economic consequences of disasters, which represents the benefits side of the ledger of disaster risk reduction, can lead to an underestimation of benefits of ways to reduce disaster risk. The purpose of this paper is to develop an economic framework for analyzing and estimating the behavioral effects of disasters and their consequences for disaster losses. We provide definitions, conceptualizations, classifications, and a formal welfare analysis of this category of economic consequences. The analysis is intended to serve as the basis for the legitimate inclusion of a broad range of behavioral consequences in BCA. Because we are interested in a comprehensive assessment of behavioral effects, we also cover resilience adjustments and extend our initial partial equilibrium analysis to the general equilibrium level. The following section makes important distinctions in the realm of behavioral consequences and risk aversion. Section III analyzes the relationship between behavioral impacts and risk. Section IV presents a categorization of behavioral consequences of disasters in relation to aspects of supply and demand at both the partial and general equilibrium levels of analysis. Section V explores the implications for BCA in terms of the extent to which behavioral responses are amenable to standard welfare analysis. Section VI concludes with a discussion of assumptions and limitations of the analysis and directions for future research.",1

Even in the twenty-first century, novel viruses, such as H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19, have posed a great threat to human lives and society. To mitigate the infection spread, it is essential for individuals to avoid risky behavior and maintain appropriate social or physical distance from one another (Fenichel 2013; Fenichel et al. 2011; Institute of Medicine 2007; Ipsen 1959).Footnote 1 However, it can be difficult to achieve sufficient levels of distancing, because of attendant economic costs, free-riding behavior, and uncertainties about transmission risk. Earlier studies show that individuals’ behavioral responses vary across their demographic, socio-economic, and psychological characteristics (Bish and Michie 2010). Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also demonstrated similar patterns (Barrios et al. 2021; Brodeur et al. 2021; Dasgupta et al. 2020;). While insightful, most earlier studies have left an important issue unaddressed. Individuals’ behavioral response to the initial phase of a pandemic may differ from that of later periods, due to changes in knowledge about the virus, policy interventions, and socio-economic conditions. However, how they respond in the initial phase of the infection spread is not well understood. This is crucial for two reasons. First, prompt, appropriate initial responses are essential to minimizing later infection spreads. Second, it is even more costly for people to adopt—and justify—protective behavior in early periods, because of poor knowledge about the virus’s risks and effective policy interventions. Therefore, it is relevant to identify obstacles that prevent individuals from taking protective behavior, such as social distancing, in this period. This study bridges this knowledge gap by examining the case of Japan during the initial phase of the COVID-19 infection spread, prior to the announcement of a state of emergency on April 7th, 2020. Japan is suitable for this exercise, because it was one of the earliest countries to confirm COVID-19 cases outside of China, following Thailand (WHO 2020). Therefore, citizens, as well as the government, suffered from a lack of knowledge about the virus. Furthermore, the Japanese government was less interventionist than other countries, in that it did not restrict residents’ activities or provide financial support. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were not made widely available. Rather, the government simply recommended that citizens avoid risky behavior and stay home voluntarily. Exploiting these features, this study analyzes the extent to which increases in infection risk are associated with the prevalence of risky behavior—such as face-to-face conversation and dining outside—between January and March 2020. We also examine differences in the magnitude of association by individuals’ demographic and socio-economic conditions. Crucially, this study also uncovers obstacles to voluntary compliance with risk-reducing measures, such as economic conditions, poor access to information, low perceptions of transmission risks, and socio-psychological characteristics. Disentangling these obstacles allows us to discuss the interactive roles between individuals’ responses and public policies. For example, if people do not modify their behavior due to the low perception of infection risks, then interventions that elevate risk perceptions should mitigate the spread of COVID-19 effectively, without the need for drastic legal restrictions. Using original survey data and a fixed effect model, we regress risky behavior on the monthly average of confirmed cases per day in each prefecture—the main unit of subnational government in Japan. Considering the absence of a natural experimental condition, it is difficult to fully rule out the possibilities of reverse causality and sample selection. However, we provide evidence that these biases are unlikely to be severe, and if anything should work against our central hypotheses. We find that the increase in the number of confirmed cases is associated with decreases in risky behavior, even in the early pandemic period and even without legally enforceable policy interventions. However, the association is weaker among high school graduates than university graduates, implying that exposure to infections may not be equal across individuals. We also provide suggestive evidence that the differences in the perception of infection risk is the most plausible reason for the heterogeneity. These results suggest the importance of interventions that incorporate nudges to heighten perceptions of risk in the early phase of pandemics. This study is most closely related to Barrios and Hochberg (2020), Machida et al. (2020), and Muto et al. (2020). Using daily panel data at the region level in the U.S., Barrios and Hochberg (2020) find that relative to Republicans, Democrats are more concerned about the infection spread and economic damages and are more likely to avoid risky behavior, given the increase in the confirmed cases. A distinction between this study and theirs is that they do not examine the role of socio-economic status, which is an important predictor of disaster preparedness and resilience. Furthermore, Barrios and Hochberg (2020) analyze risky behavior in the U.S. after the government started to restrict residents’ activities, while we study Japan before the government intervened. The findings of this study are also in line with those of Muto et al. (2020) and Machida et al. (2020), who conducted a survey in Japan as early as or even earlier than this study to examine individuals’ risky behavior. Muto et al. (2020) find a negative correlation between socio-economic status and risky behavior in line with this study, but they do not test the potential reasons for the correlation. Machida et al. (2020) find insignificant association between socio-economic status and behavior. Another distinction is that these studies analyze cross-sectional datasets, while we employ monthly panel data. This enables us to examine individuals’ behavioral changes in response to the infection spread more rigorously. Our findings are also relevant to understanding individuals’ protective behavior in the absence of policy interventions. Governments enforce social distancing through various interventions, such as closing public transportation and workplaces, making viral or antibody tests widely available, and providing financial subsidies (Hale et al. 2020). Existing studies suggest that these domestic regulations can be an effective tool to control the infection spread (Gatto et al. 2020; Hoeben et al. 2021; Jarvis et al. 2020; Katafuchi et al. 2021).Footnote 2 However, an obvious concern regarding these legal interventions is their economic consequences, such as increases in the unemployment rate (Acemoglu et al. 2020; Gharehgozli et al. 2020; Inoue and Todo 2020; Mandel and Veetil 2020; Martin et al. 2020). Mandatory social distancing also affects residents’ mental and physical health negatively (Liu et al. 2020; Pfefferbaum and North 2020; Yamamura and Tsustsui 2021) and exacerbates anti-social behavior, including violence and suicide (Dsouza et al. 2020; Mazza et al. 2020). As a result, governments often lift social distancing requirements to restart social and economic activities even before infections are brought under control. These negative side-effects point to the importance of illuminating how governments can cope with infections without relying on costly regulations. One component is uncovering the obstacles to voluntary social-distancing behavior in the absence of legal regulations. Finally, this study also contributes to the extensive literature on the relationship between risk perception and health behavior. Prior studies have argued that perceptions of health risk play pivotal roles in predicting risky/protective behavior, such as smoking, the purchase of health insurance, and immunization (Brewer et al. 2007; Lin and Sloan 2015; Schaller et al. 2019; Zhou-Richter et al. 2010). The same patterns have been confirmed for protective behavior from infectious diseases (Bennett et al. 2015; Gidengil et al. 2012; Lakdawalla et al. 2006). Since the health impact of these behaviors are scientifically confirmed and widely known, individuals’ risk perception for these behaviors is determined by their knowledge of and trust in scientific research. Hence, not surprisingly, those with higher socio-economic status, particularly with higher educational attainment, are more likely to take protective behavior (Lowcock et al. 2012; Maurer 2009). By contrast, scientific knowledge about COVID-19 was still scarce during the initial phase of the pandemic. Furthermore, unlike other infectious diseases such as SARS and H1N1, COVID-19 has distinctive features, including a high proportion of asymptomatic infections, limited capacities to conduct RT-PCR tests, and frequent mutations of the virus. Consequently, both scientifically confirmed and unconfirmed information about COVID-19 spread on social media (Cato et al. 2021b). These features could cause the perceived risk of COVID-19 to vary even among those with similar educational backgrounds. Therefore, it is informative to confirm that even under these conditions, those with higher educational attainment have both higher risk perceptions and are more likely to avoid risky behavior. The rest of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the infection spread and government responses in Japan. Sections 3 and 4 describe the dataset and identification strategy, respectively. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 disentangles the obstacles to avoiding risky behavior, and finally Section 7 concludes.",3

Its effects on the economy and public health will linger for a long time. The non-pharmaceutical pandemic responses of different states were diverse, and so was the outcome. We analyze epidemic, mobility, and labor-market data to shed light on factors affecting the balance between the economy and health. The spread and impact of infectious diseases is typically analyzed via structural models that rely on rational actors balancing complex economic and health risks. In particular, disease spread is usually modeled by variations of the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model originally proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) (see also Zhao et al. 2020; Sanche et al. 2020; Flaxman et al. 2020; Ziff and Ziff 2020; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Adam et al. 2020; Hébert-Dufresne et al. 2020; Allen 2017; Mkhatshwa and Mummert 2010; Szapudi2020; Yang et al. 2020b). In a departure from this practice, we opt for a data-centric approach that does not require potentially unsubstantiated assumptions. The exponential nature of disease spread and the tendency of COVID-19 to create localized clusters through super-spreading motivates a closer examination of correlations between epidemiology, mobility, and economic data. In particular, we look at the state and county level heterogeneity in the evolution and intensity of COVID-19 along with the mobility and labor market response. Our aim is a general understanding of the basic relationship among these processes. We take COVID-19 deaths as our primary variable to quantify disease progression, occasionally supplementing it with confirmed cases and hospitalizations. Confirmed cases are sensitive to the number of tests performed, varying state to state and increasing in time as tests became more readily available. The the case fatality ratio (CFR), which is the proportion of deaths relative to cases, decreased over time as health care providers became more effective in treating the disease and testing increased. Both death and hospitalization rates are sensitive to the patients’ demography, as the probability of a fatal outcome or hospitalization increases steeply with age. None of the variables are perfect for characterizing the epidemiology, and, especially in smaller counties and earlier times, the data can be lumpy. With these caveats, we use all three variables emphasizing death rates whenever possible. For characterizing economic conditions, we use state and county-level economic variables, primarily focusing on changes in jobs and employment. The decline in employment directly captures the economic pain of the pandemic-stricken population, and at the same time, it is available at a higher frequency and finer spatial resolution than other indicators characterizing the overall state of the economy. The critical variable at the intersection of economic conditions and non-pharmaceutical public health intervention is mobility: it is the best quantitative proxy for behavioral response to the pandemic. Note that while behavior is partly a response to local policy, mobility measures what people actually do as opposed to what they are told to do. A decrease in mobility in and of itself will not lower COVID-19 case counts; rather it is the number of encounters favorable to a transmission that matters. Thus, the number of transmissions could vary between urban and rural locations and by lifestyles. Note that mobility is an endogenous variable: a decrease in mobility suppresses the economy, but conversely, lower economic activity results in less mobility. Therefore, we focus on correlations rather than a causal relationship between mobility and the economy. As the caveats outlined above suggest, the three classes of variables tracking the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis are fraught with a lot of statistical and systematic uncertainty. Nevertheless, we hope to find a deeper understanding of the relationship between pandemic spread and economic outcomes. In addition to looking at correlations, we also use regression to analyze the dependence of employment fluctuations on labor market composition, epidemiological, and demographic factors. Our paper contributes to a growing literature documenting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economic downturn, in particular the labor market. Early research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions includes Chetty et al. (2020a) and Chetty et al. (2020b). The interplay between mobility and the economy has also been documented widely. Fuleky (2021) uses high frequency mobility indicators to nowcast economic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial amount of research on labor market outcomes was surveyed by Handwerker et al. (2020). Dreger and Gros (2021) showed a strong relationship between mobility restrictions and unemployment insurance claims, with tightening measures having a 50% greater impact than their easing. The greater vulnerability of dense cities to economic losses was recognized by Cho et al. (2020), who found that larger U.S. cities fared worse than smaller communities. What distinguishes our study from others is that we try to provide a high-level description of public health and economic outcomes, rather than pursuing a more narrowly focused analysis.",2

However, the significant losses that the poor suffer from natural disasters are an obstacle to this goal (Guterres 2019). For example, it is estimated that, on average, more than 25 million people fall into extreme poverty each year owing to floods and droughts alone (Hallegatte et al. 2017). The poor are often severely affected because they live on lands and in houses that are vulnerable to disasters (Brouwer et al. 2007). Moreover, they often do not have significant savings, which can cause them to fall into debt and make it difficult to invest in their businesses and education (Collins et al. 2009; Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler 2015; Janzen and Carter 2013). As a result, it becomes extremely difficult for them to break the cycle of poverty (Hallegatte et al. 2020; Rentschler 2013; Carter et al. 2007; Shimomura 2020; Sen 2003; Dube et al. 2018; Banerjee and Duflo 2007). Floods are particularly devastating, causing the largest cumulative global economic losses of any natural disaster since 1950 (Podlaha et al. 2020). Furthermore, it is estimated that global exposure to floods will more than triple by 2050, not only because climate change is expected to intensify floods but also because populations and economic assets in flood-prone areas are expanding (Jongman et al. 2012; McGranahan et al. 2007). Since climate change worsens the exposure of the poor in particular (Winsemius et al. 2018), there are concerns that future floods will lead to greater inequality. However, since the effects of disaster risk reduction investments do not actualize over short periods and are difficult to evaluate quantitatively because of future uncertainties, disaster risk reduction measures are not prioritized as policies in developing countries with limited budgets (Watson et al. 2015; de Ruig et al. 2019). In addition, even when investments are made for disaster risk reduction, the effects of the individual policies are often evaluated in terms of benefits to the overall region (Ward et al. 2017), and the impact on the poor, whose assets and flood damages are small to begin with, is likely to be ignored (Masozera et al. 2007; Rao et al. 2017; Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017). Moreover, although the poor fall into the trap of long-term poverty because of disasters, cost–benefit analyses of disaster risk reduction investments often focus only on the direct losses caused by disasters and do not consider the indirect effects on the long-term improvements in the livelihood of the poor (Kind et al. 2020; van Hattum et al. 2021). For these reasons, some policies may even increase the vulnerability of the poor and contribute to widening inequality (Pelling and Garschagen 2019). In addition, Thacker et al. (2019), who analyzed the impact of infrastructure on the SDGs, found that the indirect impact can be as high as three times the direct impact. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate disaster risk reduction investments, it is necessary to determine their effectiveness in not only reducing the losses in the event of a disaster but also with respect to long-term poverty eradication. Furthermore, in recent years, it has become clear that, in addition to flood control measures, educational support is effective in alleviating the poverty caused by floods (Masozera et al. 2007; Fang et al. 2016; Tahira and Kawasaki 2015; Kawamura and Kawasaki 2018). The poor often have low levels of education and are therefore forced to work in unstable, low-income jobs. This is one of the main reasons for the inequality. Therefore, if educational support were to be made equally available to the households that have not been able to afford education, the poor would have a better chance of finding stable jobs. This would make it easier for them to increase their savings and reduce their flood vulnerability. In addition, since the poor are often forced to drop out of school due to disasters (Maccini and Yang 2009; Ferreira and Schady 2008; Baez et al. 2010; Cadag et al. 2017), educational support would be effective. However, no study has quantitatively confirmed this effect. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated various policies for helping the poor decrease their flood vulnerability and compared the effects of flood control measures and educational support, which are considered effective strategies for reducing flood vulnerability. For this purpose, a model was constructed to calculate the savings related to the flood vulnerability of each household. The model estimated who would be affected by floods and to what degree by determining the changes in the household economy instead of changes in the economy of the entire region. In addition, instead of focusing on the damage caused by a single flood, we focused on the long-term changes in savings, considering the impact of frequent floods and the livelihood improvement for each household based on the savings. By combining the savings determined using this model with the results of inundation calculations based on various flood control measures, we could assess the extent by which the flood vulnerability of each household, as defined in this study, would be reduced. Furthermore, we also estimated the changes in income inequality owing to individual policies. Borgomeo et al. (2017) had quantified the negative impact of floods on poverty. They analyzed the impact of floods on agricultural income as well as the resulting changes in household assets in the coastal areas of Bangladesh and found that floods exacerbate poverty. Based on this study, Barbour et al. (2022) estimated the long-term effects of infrastructural features such as embankments. However, these studies neither considered the changes in the living conditions as determined based on the assets of the individual households nor addressed inequality at the household level. Hallegatte et al. (2017) also attempted to assess the losses experienced by the poor whose livelihoods were severely affected by disasters. They did this by defining the “well-being losses” based on the reduction in consumption during the recovery period after the disaster. Furthermore, case studies that used this index have shown that the magnitude of asset losses during disasters does not match that of the loss in well-being (Markhvida et al. 2019; Walsh and Hallegatte 2019). However, these studies did not attempt to estimate the effects of specific measures. Poverty is a multifaceted problem that involves not only material poverty, represented by a lack of money, but also physical weakness, isolation, vulnerability, and powerlessness (Chambers 1983). This study aimed to approach poverty reduction from the aspects of both material poverty and disaster vulnerability.",1

(Besley and Hennessy 2009). Disasters have been the subject of social science research for some time (O’Keefe et al. 1976). Catastrophic events, ones that have the potential to extinguish the human species are also not inevitable ‘natural’ events. Indeed, the insurance term ‘Acts of God’ to describe acts that are not within the immediate power for us to prevent are mis-labelled. Disasters occur because of our actions or inactions. Epidemics are no different to earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, and their impact is also largely dependent on how we prepare and react to them. And yet, practically every country was unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in early 2020. If economists have failed to predict or prevent the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and the more disastrous pandemic of 2020, what else is the profession missing? This is the question that motivates this survey. Specifically, we want to highlight four catastrophic risks – i.e., risks that can potentially result in global catastrophes of a much larger magnitude than either the 2008 or 2020 events. Inevitably, and fortunately, these catastrophic scenarios have not yet occurred, so the literature investigating them is by necessity more speculative and less grounded in observations. Nevertheless, that does not make these risks any less real, any less dangerous, or any less worthy of our attention. The four risks we examine here are space weather and solar flares, super-volcanic eruptions, high-mortality pandemics, and misaligned (or maligned) artificial intelligence. All four have a non-trivial probability of occurring and all four can potentially, and disastrously, lead to a catastrophe not very different from human extinction. As Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem suggests, the basic approach to economic assessments of risks fails for these extremely catastrophic ones (Weitzman 2009). “There is a race being run in the extreme tail between how rapidly probabilities are declining and how rapidly damages are increasing. Who wins this race, and by how much, depends on how fat (with probability mass) the extreme tails are.” (Weitzman 2011). As Weitzman points out, it is often difficult to assess how fat these tails are, because they represent sets of events that are far outside the realm of our concrete experiences. Still, this survey is motivated by the belief that economists can and should be thinking about these risks more systematically, so that we can devise appropriate ways to prevent them or ameliorate their potential impacts.",1

Most states ordered social distancing measures – leading to school and business closures – to avoid the spread of coronavirus (Courtemanche et al. 2020). The U.S. COVID-19 death toll exceeded 148,000 and infection rate reached 4.3 million by the end of July 2020 (Bauer et al. 2020). The growth rates of unemployment and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all food surpassed those during the Great Recession, mainly affecting households with low-income, lower education, and households identifying as Black or Hispanic (Bitler et al. 2020; Gharehgozli et al. 2020).Footnote 2 Among non-senior adults, food insufficiency increased by threefold in July 2020 compared to 2019 (Ziliak 2021). The share of households with children who are food insecure went up by three percentage points compared to 2016/2017 (Ahn and Norwood 2021).Footnote 3 The number of food insecure Americans increased by a projected 17 million compared to the 2018 level, reaching a total of 54 million in 2020 (Gundersen et al. 2021). In response to the pandemic, the U.S. government stepped up and enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (2020) (FFCR) and the Coronavirus Aid (2020) (CARES), supporting American households through unemployment insurance (UI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT), and Economic Impact Payments (EIPs). The EIPs, which are also referred to as recovery rebates or stimulus payments, provided a refundable tax credit up to $1,200 for eligible single tax filers ($2,400 for eligible joint tax filers), plus $500 for each dependent child (Bitler et al. 2020). Stimulus payments like EIPs are a significant fiscal expenditure of the U.S. government during recessions. For instance, the U.S. government distributed around $267 billion from early April to early June of 2020 (USDT 2020). It is imperative to investigate if EIPs were positively associated with the economic conditions of American households because that was an objective of EIPs. One particular and important manifestation of improving economic conditions is a decrease in food insufficiency among households. In this study, we particularly investigate the association of EIPs with household food insufficiency in a sample of late recipients of EIPs. We do this by exploiting the late receipt of first-round EIPs among food insufficient households. Studying food insufficiency of late recipients of EIPs is important because about 12 million eligible individuals did not automatically receive first-round EIPs, and these individuals were more likely to be low income and much in need of economic relief (Bitler et al. 2020). Additionally, the late receipt of EIPs was potentially anticipated by some households and may have led to consumption smoothing, so our study bears some evidence on the association between anticipated EIPs and food insufficiency. In other words, the anticipation of additional income can also be relevant for household food insufficiency. In our analysis, we use the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS) for Weeks 7 – 12, which spans June 11, 2020 through July 21, 2020. Our analysis sample focuses on households that are late receivers of EIPs, i.e., households that did not automatically receive EIPs during early April to early June of 2020. The Internal Revenue Service could not automatically send EIPs to eligible households that did not have tax file information or benefit records. Given our analysis sample, the reader should interpret the results within the context of households that are late recipients of EIPs. The results do not apply to the overall population in the U.S. Although the dependent variable of interest is household food insufficiency, we also study the association of EIPs with households’ future food confidence and receipt of free food. We find that the receipt or expected receipt of EIPs is associated with a 9.2 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of household-level food insufficiency. And EIPs have no association with household-level future food confidence or receipt of free food. Although stimulus payments are aimed to boost aggregate demand during economic downturns, results from this study show that the first-round EIPs were also helpful in managing immediate food insufficiency at the household level during COVID-19. However, EIPs were not enough to fight food hardship because food insufficient households kept relying on other means of food assistance, for instance, receipt of free food. Because late-recipient households are more likely to be low-income, our work suggests that government efforts to deliver future stimulus payments more quickly to these households could have substantial benefits. Supporting low-income households on time will not only boost aggregate demand but also fight food hardship. A fiscal policy response during economic downturns certainly benefits from including consumption responsive households such as low-income households (Andreolli and Surico 2021).",

Large-scale radiological accidents are considerably less common than citizens assess them to be (Huhtala and Remes 2017), but when they occur, they present complex, long-term, and potentially catastrophic implications. In such events, resilience requires broad prior knowledge and planning preparedness. Continued use of nuclear power arguably requires rigorous security and realistic policies in case of a radiological release. However, while many human and technological safety issues in nuclear facilities are well researched (e.g., Hamer et al. 2021), less is known about community attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors and how they affect risk management in the event of an accident. The principal safety measure of governments in the event of a radiological accident involving emissions in populated areas encompasses evacuation and decontamination, followed by return migration (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 2013). However, for such extensive measures and investments to be worthwhile, a sufficient number of people must be willing to return. Research on the most recent case, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. which occurred on 11 March 2011, shows a slow pace of return migration after bans on returning were lifted (Do 2020) and that public concerns with health risks have been widespread (Murakami et al. 2015). In 2012, the number of evacuated citizens reporting a willingness to eventually return was 12,882, less than eight percent of the total number of evacuees from the exclusion zone. The cost of decontamination has since been estimated at USD 3.36 million per returnee (Nagamatsu et al. 2020), and the recovery strategy has resulted in aging and depopulation problems in radiation-contaminated areas. Furthermore, slow recovery has had the effect of inhibiting further return migration (Zhang et al. 2014). Studies of demographic variables show that women, parents with children at home, and young adults rate risks higher and are more reluctant than others to return to a decontaminated area (Morita et al. 2018; Murakami et al. 2015; Rasmussen et al. 2020; Rasmussen and Wikström 2022; Zhang et al. 2014). However, other demographics may also be important. Socioeconomics has been found to be important in explaining behavior after natural disasters (Fussell et al. 2009; Landry et al. 2007; Thiede and Brown 2013). In general, high socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with relatively low risk perception. Moreover, in terms of behavioral reactions to natural disasters, affluent citizens are more likely to keep their homes than others (Fussell et al. 2009). However, there is a dearth of research on the association between SES and risk attitudes in the event of a technological disaster, such as a serious NPP accident. In the present article, we tackle this issue using an NPP accident and recovery scenario. It demonstrates that higher SES is associated with less worry over radiation risk but a greater inclination to move permanently from one’s home in an affected area and thus avoid potential radiation risk. Therefore, a government’s plans for recovery could be hampered, resulting in the decline of the decontaminated areas. Indeed, a population with higher education and income implies higher employment rates, tax revenue (Berger and Fisher 2013), and civic engagement (Gaby 2017). Furthermore, it would be unfortunate if those characterized by low SES remain in a decontaminated area for economic reasons rather than preference. The consequences could include an increase in costs associated with mental ill-health and other social problems, as indicated in some of the public health research on the Fukushima area (Fukasawa et al. 2017; Maeda et al. 2018). We used survey data from Sweden (N = 2,291) to study citizens’ risk attitudes regarding an NPP accident scenario. By risk attitudes, we refer to “intentions to evaluate a risk situation in a favorable or unfavorable way and to act accordingly” (Rohrmann 2008, p. 4). These attitudes encompass both risk evaluation and behavioral intentions. The indicators of risk attitude used here are prevalence of worry over radiation and likeliness to leave a decontaminated area, that is, aspects of both risk evaluation and preferred action orientation. Furthermore, we approached worry as the negative feelings and relatively irrepressible thought processes that people experience when facing a risk (Borkovec et al. 1983), while action orientation is about whether one can accept to live in the decontaminated area or prefers a “path that does not touch on the risk” (Aven and Renn 2010, p. 122). Thus, by studying citizens’ SES and attitudes to an NPP accident scenario, we hope to contribute a more fine-grained understanding of the interdependence between the economic and social contexts (Asad 2014; Hellmich 2017). The following section provides a summary of the existing research on socioeconomics, citizens’ risk appraisal, and safety-seeking migration, along with theme-by-theme study hypotheses. Subsequently, the research design and methodology are presented, followed by the empirical analysis. The concluding section discusses the results in relation to previous research and explores implications for risk management. A key question regarding the government strategy to decontaminate areas affected by an NPP accident is whether people are going to live there. This includes understanding migration volume and selection and public attitudes to risk (Hunter 2005). In what follows, we provide a brief overview of the relevant research. A general pattern found in the research is that people with high education or income rate risks lower and report less worry compared to others (Finucane et al. 2000; Slovic 2000). This pattern is found in research on perceptions of the risk of flooding (Botzen et al. 2009), terrorism (Stevens et al. 2011), climate change and genetically modified foods (Lo 2014), and a reactor incident in Sweden (Hedberg and Holmberg 2009). Higher SES seems to lessen the degree of concern over risk because the higher degree of welfare and economic security entails a greater degree of control over one’s life and community (Olofsson and Rashid 2011; Olofsson and Öhman 2015). Nevertheless, the existing results are not unambiguous. Research focusing on concerns over radiation following the Fukushima accident, which is comparable to our study, is yet to find a negative association between education and worry over radiation risk (Kusama et al. 2018). However, there is no explanation regarding this discrepancy. Thus, in line with the majority of the research presented above, the following hypotheses are proposed: Hypothesis 1: Education is negatively associated with worry over the risk of ionizing radiation exposure. Hypothesis 2: Income is negatively associated with worry over the risk of ionizing radiation exposure. Research on attitudes toward migrating, or actual migration, in connection with large-scale accidents and emergencies shows a range of results regarding different types of hazardous events. Generally, emergency victims who could opt to migrate compare the origin and destination contexts with regards to job opportunities, education, community services, distance to family members, and other citizens’ attitudes toward evacuees (Asad 2014). Regarding natural disasters that do not spread toxic or radioactive materials in the living environment, like large-scale technological accidents often do, there are indications that high education and income imply a greater likeliness to return after evacuation (Fussell et al. 2009). Less advantaged citizens tend to return more rarely or slowly because they reside in more risk-prone areas, take fewer preventive measures, and suffer more damage to their homes (Asad 2014; Botzen et al. 2009; Fussell et al. 2009; Hak et al. 2016; Hunter 2005; Reininger et al. 2013). Moreover, studies on soil pollution management in China (Zhou et al. 2020) and radiation protection after the Fukushima accident (Aruga 2016) indicate that higher SES is associated with taking more precautionary measures. These studies cannot be generalized directly to the object of study in the present paper, however, in part because their focus is undefined protective action, food choice after the Fukushima accident, or other environmental risks. We believe that one of the main differences between natural and technological disasters is the general public’s perception of dread risk in some cases involving the latter. This pertains particularly to radiological accidents involving the release of radioactive materials (Slovic 1996). Therefore, there is reason to believe that citizens who have the financial means to avoid an area affected by a risk that is dreaded by many will, to a greater extent than others, express intentions to avoid the area and move elsewhere. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 3: Education is positively associated with the preference to move from a decontaminated area. Hypothesis 4: Income is positively associated with the preference to move from a decontaminated area. Further support for our above hypotheses may be that socioeconomic vulnerability stands as an obstacle and provokes caution in the face of major life changes. There are related mediating psychological factors that reflect and reinforce vulnerabilities such as perceived control over life outcomes, optimism/pessimism, and trust (Mittal and Griskevicius 2017). Moreover, studies show that a high degree of civic trust is associated with higher readiness to deal with crises (Reininger et al. 2013). After the Fukushima Daiichi accident, low trust in government and science had a negative impact on willingness to return following decontamination (Murakami et al. 2015). These results support the inclusion of a trust indicator among our control variables in addition to more basic demographic factors.",

Besides increasing assets in hazard prone areas, climate change is already contributing to the mounting damages of disasters (IPCC 2018, IPCC 2022). While considerable attention has been given in the past to the direct damages caused by natural hazards, indirect impacts, i.e., losses that occur due to direct damages (Hallegatte et al. 2007), and the management of it, are gaining increasingly attention (Reichstein et al. 2021). This is not to the least because in our interconnected world, direct losses can easily spread across different sectors and risk bearers and therefore can cause large opportunity costs (Centeno et al. 2015; World Bank 2021) including hindering sustainable development (Hallegatte et al. 2020). Global agendas and frameworks such as the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the Sendai Framework for Risk Reduction are therefore calling for the explicit inclusion of such risk dimensions, usually subsumed under the term resilience (UN 2015; UNDRR 2015; Noy and Yonson 2018). The government is usually seen as one key risk bearer, both for public and private losses, and is expected to be responsible to assist and support a fast recovery of the economy (Hochrainer-Stigler et al. 2018). Therefore, fiscal resilience is an important dimension as urgent liquidity is vital for humanitarian aid and the recovery process as without swift access to available funds for disaster relief, damages to human and the economy would be further exacerbated because of lacking necessary logistics and slow recovery (World Bank 2021). To enhance fiscal resilience various options are available to governments, including setting up reserve funds, contingent credits, emergency loans or insurance (Ghesquiere and Mahul 2010), particularly in the form of sovereign risk pools (Ciullo et al. 2023). While current approaches usually assess such management options using the full probabilistic information about all possible disaster events that could happen (Woo 2011) we introduce in this paper a so-called climate storyline approach (van den Hurk et al. 2023). In essence, climate storylines are based on past events but include plausible different risk realizations. Furthermore, these climate storylines can be assessed under different future climate and socio-economic settings. One of the strengths of such an approach compared to a probabilistic assessment is that it improves risk awareness as it reproduces disaster events that are similar to those already experienced and thus can be personally related to (Shepherd et al. 2018). Such climate storylines can therefore trigger a wake-up call and motivation to change and improve climate risk governance (Krauß and Bremer 2020). Another strength of such an approach compared to probabilistic ones is in regard to climate change considerations as top-down approaches from global climate model ensembles simulations are usually inadequate in dealing with uncertainties in regional climate predictions as aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are mixed (Shepherd et al. 2018). By focusing on climate storylines no such probabilistic information is needed and consequences can be assessed and understood conditioned on specified climatological and socio-economic boundary conditions (van den Hurk et al. 2023). Recognizing the potential benefits of a climate storyline approach we developed and applied a corresponding framework to the Caribbean and Central America (CCA) region to analyze the fiscal performance of local governments due to cyclone risk and potential benefits of insurance. The area was chosen as it is one of the most vulnerable regions to tropical cyclones and saw the establishment of the first multi-country risk pool in the world, namely the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). CCRIF was designed as a regional catastrophe fund for local governments to limit the financial impact of devastating hurricanes and earthquakes by quickly providing financial liquidity when a policy is triggered. We therefore specifically focus on possible liquidity gaps of governments within the Caribbean region, i.e. not having enough resources to address all emergency related losses, their consequences on fiscal performance over time and the effect of CCRIF on these fiscal effects. Up to now, an empirical analysis of such pooling arrangements to tackle fiscal risks was not looked at yet. We relate these results with climate storylines for the year 2016 and 2017 and analyze fiscal performance over time for those events. In a final step, we include climate and global change scenarios and investigate future changes in fiscal performance under these new boundary conditions. We found that fiscal effects can be significant due to natural hazard events for Caribbean countries and there are indications that insurance can help to mitigate some of these fiscal effects in the short term. The climate storylines showed that many more devastating events (in terms of damages, number of countries hit, number of consecutive events) could have happened in the past, and consequently fiscal stress in the region could have been much higher under such plausible events, with some of the fiscal stress reduced through the participating countries in CCRIF. The paper is organized as follows. The “Context and Case Study Area” section presents a discussion on the liquidity gap concept, its relation to insurance instruments and more specifically to the CCRIF to set up the stage for the “Methodology” section, including a detailed discussion on the climate impact storyline and the panel regression approach used. The “Results” section then presents the corresponding results and afterwards the “Discussion” section discusses them within a broader development and climate resilience context. Finally, the “Conclusion” section summarizes our findings and provides an outlook to the future.",
