Knowledge and technological change or innovation have become key drivers of economic growth in the knowledge-based economy (KBEFootnote 1): nowadays the national innovative capacity is the ability of a country to produce and commercialize pioneering technology in the long term. The role of innovation and diffusion of new technologies as engines of growth is empirically well established by firm and industry level studies (Nadiri 1993). As a KBE, the US economy is considered a model to imitate, but close linkages among firms, research communities, the financial community and government are also operating in other countries. In Canada, for example, several important regional systems of innovation (RSIs) are used in large cities such as Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and OttawaFootnote 2 (similar to those in the US). From these we focus on Toronto (Ontario), because it leads the Canadian software industry, and is ranked second in telecommunications and semiconductors (after Ottawa) and in aerospace and biotechnology (after Montreal).  If the European Union (EU) has set the Lisbon 2010 targets,Footnote 3 Canada has set the goal of becoming the fifth highest R&D intensive country by 2010, up from its current position of 15th out of OECD and non-OECD countriesFootnote 4 (Achieving Excellence, Govt. of Canada 2001). Mansfield (1995) linked universities to national innovation performance and found that even if academic researchers do not provide the invention itself, they provide theoretical and empirical findings and new instrumentation essential to new product/process development. For this reason, this paper devotes particular attention to academic research and the university–industry relationship.  This paper has three aims. First, it draws a comparison between Silicon ValleyFootnote 5 and Route 128 and the Region of Waterloo, underlying the theme of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Second, it focuses on the linkage between Venture Capital (VC) and Canadian universities in the Waterloo Region. Third, it discusses some successful examples at the University of Waterloo (UW). We demonstrate that innovation is strongly dependent on exchange and integration of knowledge originating from all the relevant players within a country: firms, scientific communities, the financial community, and government.  In the KBE, development is a critical factor involving the systematic use of knowledge or understanding gained from research to produce useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes. Innovation is a broader concept than research and development (R&D), although the latter is the starting point for innovation and R&D productivity is a central element of science and technology policies in advanced economies. Theoretically, several new approaches to understanding innovation have emerged including ideas-driven endogenous growth theory (Romer 1990), cluster-based models of national competitive advantage (Porter 1990), and models on national innovation systems (Nelson 1993). Alfred Marshall (1890) noted that the concentration of firms in cities fostered economic growth by facilitating the diffusion of knowledge (knowledge spillover). Porter defines clusters as concentrations of highly specialized skills and knowledge, institutions, competitors, and related businesses in a particular region, and says that “Clusters are a driving force in increasing exports and are magnets for attracting foreign investment”Footnote 6. The reason lies in the fact that in a cluster the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Breschi and Malerba (2001) argue that a successful factor for high-tech clusters is the extent to which local firms are embedded in a very thick network of knowledge sharing supported by close social interactions. Research funding must be included in any consideration of drivers of successful innovation. In addition to traditional government and in-house corporate funding, VC has become an important source of funds for R&D as well as an important component of the financial system, both in the US and globally (Gompers and Lerner 1999; Lerner and Schoar 2004; Megginson 2004). Its importance to the funding of new high-tech and/or high-growth potential firms is widely acknowledged. The establishment of more than 30 national venture capital associationsFootnote 7 in the past two decades indicates that VC financing has become an important feature of the financial system of many countries. VC represents an alternative to raising funds via public equity or debt markets, especially if uncertainty or simply a long time horizon associated with the investment deter debt providers from funding these endeavours. These occur in high-technology environments, where the commercial potential of innovations is difficult to estimate. Venture capitalists (VCs) become co-owners of the start-up companies and share both risk and returns. The reward to the VC directly depends on the growth and profitability of the start-up firm. Successful investments are mainly executed through trade sales or Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on the stock market. Frequently in the seed stage, VCs are preceded by business angels,Footnote 8 which organize themselves into angel networks to share research and pool their own investment capital: the Angel Capital Electronic Network (ACE-Net) was developed by the US Small Business Administration Office in 1995; European Business Angels Network (EBAN), a non-profit association, was established with the support of the European Commission in 1999; in Canada the National Angels Organization (NAO), an incorporated not-for-profit organization, was created in 2002, as the point of match of local association with the Angel Forum-Vancouver started in 1997. Many important firms of the last three decades such as 3Com, Compaq, Cisco, Federal Express, Genentech, Intel, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems were first funded by VCs. Venture Capital supports some of the most innovative, dynamic firm clusters in the world: Silicon Valley and Route 128 in the US, Silicon Wadi in Israel,Footnote 9 Cambridge Cluster in UK, Sophia Antipolis (Telecom Valley) and Grenoble (high-tech hub for micro nanotechnologies) in France, Hsinchu Region in Taiwan, Bangalore in India, Tsukuba in Japan. The common model (except for Taiwan where universities focus primarily on teaching rather than research) is based on the presence of universities and linkages among firms and academic centres (see Table 1): local universities with strong competencies in one or more technical areas are often starting points for such clusters. The main academic contribution to the industry is through technology transfer largely through commercialization of research findings and technologies developed by university researchers. Since the 1990s many countries (US, Australia, Canada,...) have implemented policies to facilitate knowledge transfer from university to industry: legal framework, universities’ technology transfer offices, and collaborative R&D. University research laboratories are a source of new technology, entrepreneurial talent and, in the early stages of the life-cycle, ‘untraded interdependencies’ (Storper 1995). In this paper we highlight the positive role of university spin-offs, which are start-up companies whose formation were dependent on the intellectual property rights of the university and in which the university holds an equity stake (Tang et al. 2004).
 The recent Korean project, Jeju Free International City Development Center (JDC) also lends supports to the efficacy of this models. This new self-governing province in Korea will create a High-tech Science and Technology Complex located near Jeju National University to enable companies to secure quality research facilities through industrial and academic cooperation. Additionally, this facility will be enriched by the presence of a well-developed high-tech industry as well as a clean natural environment. By 2011, when the complex is due to be completed, Jeju is expected to become a high-tech and biotech focal point.Footnote 10

54,3,International Review of Economics,18 September 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0022-5,Competitive balance in football leagues when teams have different goals,September 2007,Nicola Giocoli,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The paper presents a simple extension of the basic two- and three-team model of a professional sports league with the aim of capturing a peculiarity of European team sports in general, and of Italian football in particular, which has so far been neglected in the literature. The canonical model, as envisaged, for example by Fort and Quirk (1995) and Szymanski (2003), suggests two possible behavioral assumptions about professional teams: clubs are supposed to maximize either their profits (profit-maximizing, PM, behavior) or the number of seasonal wins (win-maximizing, WM, behavior). What matters most, behavior is assumed to be homogeneous, so that teams are either all PM or all WM: the former being predicated to mirror the reality of US professional leagues, the latter being viewed as better capturing the situation of European team sports. If we define the league’s competitive balance as the deviation from the ideal case where all teams win exactly the same proportion of matches during the season and if we accept the traditional assumption of sports economics literature that each team’s revenues are concave with respect to the team’s win percentage on account of the fans’ diminishing interest, and willingness to pay, for events whose outcome can be easily predicted (so-called uncertainty of outcome hypothesis), the well-known result is that a league’s competitive balance is higher under the all-PM case than under the all-WM one.
Footnote 1 This because rational, profit-oriented teams internalize the negative effect on their revenues of an “excessive” number of wins and thus never fully exploit any technical or athletic advantage that might stem from their financial strength vis-à-vis their weaker opponents; on the contrary, rich WM teams simply try to extract as many wins as possible from such an advantage, eventually winning almost all matches and thus earning so little revenues that they barely manage to break even or, worse, incur in (possibly huge) economic losses that owners are called to stand at the end of each season. What is suggested in the paper is that a more realistic characterization of European professional leagues is that of “mixed” leagues, namely, of an environment where, while some teams still pursue the traditional win-maximizing goal, some others have modified their behavior in the direction of straightforward profit-maximization (so-called Americanization of European sports: see Hoehn and Szymanski 1999). In particular, it is argued that this characterization may capture the recent development in the main Italian football league: the Serie A: where, in the face of the dramatic financial imbalances caused to WM teams by the rising cost of the players’ talent, a few clubs seem to have shifted to a profit-oriented pattern of behavior. Hence, we propose a modified version of the standard model, where one team is PM, while the other(s) is (are) WM. The peculiarity of our simple comparative statics exercise is that the team that is assumed to embrace a profit goal is either the small (in the 2-team setup) or the medium (in the 3-team case) one in terms of revenue potential and market size (which in turn depends on, say, the team’s urban area of reference, the number of its fans, the latter’s ability and willingness to pay, the team’s skills in exploiting its merchandising possibilities, etc.). The rationale is straightforward: starting from an all-WM situation, where the equilibrium competitive balance entails a larger win-percentage for the big team because of its higher capacity to purchase technical–athletic talent, the small or medium team’s owner may reasonably ask herself what is the point of pursuing a sporting goal (say, winning the league’s title) she would never achieve, while at the same time forfeiting the possibility to earn some profits. Hence, there is a strong incentive for the small or medium team to shift to a PM behavior, at the only price of a further—but possibly irrelevant from the end-of-season outcome’s viewpoint—reduction in its win percentage. This, again, seems to capture a feature of the Italian Serie A (Baroncelli and Lago 2006). On one side, we have big teams’ owners who stick to a WM behavior, sometimes in the eventual pursuit of other, non-sporting goals (such as personal prestige and a positive spillover on their other business, or non-business, activities), and thus go on spending large amounts of money in the effort to secure wins, caring not too much about end-of-season financial losses which they are always willing to foot.
Footnote 2 On the other side, we have some medium and small teams’ owners who are well aware that they cannot really compete against the big clubs and who, above all, consider the management of a football club their main, and sometimes exclusive, business: these owners are led to adopt a PM behavior with the only constraint (not modeled here, but see Giocoli 2006) of not incurring in so many losses that their team risks being relegated in the league’s lower division. The outcome of our “mixed” model is a change in the league’s competitive balance with respect to both the “pure” (WM and PM) cases. In short, starting from an all-WM league and having the small or the medium team shifting to PM behavior should produce an increase in the win percentage of all the other teams on account of the reduction in the number of wins of the changing one. In the 2-team case this leads to an obvious worsening of the league’s CB, while in the 3-team setup, provided the behavioral shift is made by the medium club, we witness a softening of the competition for the top places and a hardening of the struggle to avoid the bottom positions. In the case of the Italian Serie A, these outcomes seem indeed to capture what emerges from casual observations (such as, say, the high frequency with which a few teams occupy the league’s top spots to the almost complete exclusion of the others) as well as from more systematic ones (such as the time pattern of the commonest measure of competitive balance, the standard deviation of seasonal wins).
Footnote 3
 If this is so, what may be done to restore more balanced conditions on the playing field? The paper suggests three policy measures that may lead to this result: (1) market-size-based revenue sharing, (2) general salary cap, (3) team-specific salary cap. Remarkably, all are shown to be potentially effective in promoting conditions of more competitive balance in our “mixed” league. This goes against the traditional wisdom that, with the only exception of a general salary cap, no such measure may be capable of doing so (so-called invariance proposition, a cornerstone of team sports economics since Rottenberg 1956). Hence, the paper offers a normative, though idiosyncratic, justification for a change in the “rules of the game” of the top Italian football league. Moreover, it is suggested that, though all effective, the three measures may nonetheless be ranked in terms of either their actual enforceability or their conformity to the main principle of asymmetric paternalism (Camerer et al. 2003). The content of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we review the basic ingredients of the standard team sports economics model. The so-called invariance proposition, the traditional benchmark for any policy evaluation is introduced in Sect. 3. The 2-team model in its two “pure” versions, namely, when teams are either both WM or both PM, is analyzed in Sect. 4. The fifth section presents the “mixed” model, where one of the teams—specifically, the small one—changes its behavior from WM to PM. In Sect. 6, we extend the analysis of the “mixed” case to the 3-team setup, this time assuming that the behavioral shift is made by the medium club. The seventh section offers our policy exercises in the 2-team case, as well as a ranking of the proposed measures. Section 8 concludes.",1
54,3,International Review of Economics,22 September 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0020-7,The effect of the war risk: a comparison of the consequences of the two Iraq wars,September 2007,Elena Corallo,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper measures the effect of war on some financial variables for Italy and the US using the heteroskedasticity-based estimation technique proposed by Rigobon (2003). This work refers to the days of the two wars with Iraq and considers their effects in Italy as well as the effects of the Iraq war of 1990 in the US. The present study has been motivated by The Effects of War Risk on US Financial Markets by Rigobon and Sack (2005). The aims of this work are the following. The first is to verify whether the two Iraq wars had similar effects. In order to assess whether international investors might anticipate the effects of the war, changing, in accordance to these presumed effects, their position in the financial markets, we analyse whether the war had different results in the two periods and in the different countries analysed. Second, to measure the war effects on other variables beyond those considered by Rigobon and Sack. The econometric technique used by Rigobon and Sack (2005) is innovative owing to the difficulty of identifying the effect of war, which is a non-measurable variable. If the risk of war were an observable and measurable variable, then we could have simply used an OLS regression to estimate its effects on the economy. The advantage of the heteroskedasticity-based approach is that it allows to capture the impact of war risk without having to quantify or even sign the risk itself. The effects of the war risk factor are estimated from the shift in the second moment of the financial variables on the days of the war. Implementing this estimator only requires identifying two sets of days: one in which the variance of war-related news was high and one in which the variance of war-related news was low. These days include the events and news, which have been considered as having a significant effect for the war. Rigobon and Sack’s methodology indicates that selecting this set of days is sufficient to capture the effects of the level of war risk factor on various asset prices. This feature of the methodology is appealing because it is much easier to determine when war-related news took place, than to quantify the news itself. It is important to note that we use the variance of the variables because the first moment of the financial variables on the war days is less informative; the reason is that the war-related news on the days that we identified can have either sign. When we refer to the Iraq war of 2003, the findings of this study suggest that the risk of war has a significant role in explaining the behaviour of Italian financial variables. The financial variables considered are the equity price index, the average yield of a 10- and 5-year government bond, the 30-, 10- and 2-year government bond price index, the gold price, the nominal euro effective exchange rate and the interbank rate at 1 month. As we show in the results, increases in the risk of war have significant effects. The increase in the risk of war caused a significant increase in the government bond price index at all maturities, a significant decline in the equity price index and in the average yield of bonds, and finally a depreciation of the dollar. These findings are in line with those found by Rigobon and Sack (2005) for the US. As suggested by the simultaneous behaviour of the financial variables, financial market volatility appears now to move rapidly across countries (Abbas et al. 2006). This result has been possibly affected by the liberalization of capital markets in the past two decades. Taken together, these results seem to suggest that people are risk averse and in view of higher uncertainty related to the war they prefer safer to riskier assets. The problem with the war is both its high expected costs and the uncertainty it introduces in the economy, as is evident from different studies (Nordhaus 2002). Greater economic uncertainty increases the risk premium demanded by investors and consequently reduces stock prices; this effect might induce investors to position themselves in anticipation of a war by short selling stocks and buying bonds. While the suggestion in support of interdependence between different markets is validated, this last conclusion vanishes when we refer to the Iraq war of 1990, where the results suggest that the risk of war did not affect the behaviour of the financial variables in both Italy and the US. Different from previous findings, here none of the variables reacted in a significant way to the war in Iraq. The first Iraq war seems to have had no effects on the behaviour of financial markets. These opposite results make it not possible to ascertain a general behaviour of the financial variables following an event of political and economic instability such as a war. We believe that the behaviour of financial markets cannot be totally explained by an event such as the instability occurred with a war, but depends instead on other non quantifiable factors such as the reasons behind the war, the time, the feature of the economies of the period when the war broke up and, above all, the perception of the intensity of the war itself by the market. As mentioned above, the results between the countries, (as for 2003), instead, exhibit a similar pattern: both Italian and American financial markets are not affected by the war of 1990. In an area of increasing globalisation, the transmission of movements in international financial markets is an important issue for economic policy, especially in periods when markets are very agitated. Statements supporting the existence of these interdependences are frequently found in the financial press. These links have also been studied in many different ways by a growing body of academic research attempting to describe and quantify the way in which financial markets interact (Isakov and Perignon 2000). The results of this paper imply that the markets under consideration are integrated. The structure of the work proceeds as follows. We first describe the methodology applied, underlying its main advantages. We then apply it to our data and finally we present the results followed by the conclusion.",

54,4,International Review of Economics,31 October 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0024-3,"Fertility, income and welfare in an OLG model with regulated wages",December 2007,Luciano Fanti,Luca Gori,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Although a vast debate about the macroeconomic consequences of minimum wages
Footnote 1 has been developed dating from Stigler (1946), less attention has been paid to the long-run effects of the regulation of wages in a dynamic context (i.e., a simple OLG framework). The idea that the introduction of minimum wages in a simple competitive one-sector
Footnote 2 economy always brings an output loss due to unemployment is a widespread belief.
Footnote 3 Furthermore, the prevailing literature (e.g., among others, Bean and Pissarides 1993; Daveri and Tabellini 2000) establishes a negative relationship between unemployment and growth: i.e., unemployment always deteriorates growth. Indeed only few papers have found possible positive long-run macroeconomic effects of the minimum wage legislation in an inter-temporal OLG context, for example Cahuc and Michel (1996) and Ravn and Sorensen (1999). However, in these papers such a possibility depends on the specific assumption of a positive relationship between the unemployment created by the minimum wage and the long-run productivity growth induced by schooling and on-the-job training; such a disputable assumption introduced a positive externality which implies a departure from the conventional OLG model (Diamond 1965) we have adopted. In particular, none of these models are concerned with the role played by government interventions on the labour market, such as minimum wage legislation along with unemployment insurance mechanisms, in a context of endogenous fertility. In this paper we will try to fill the gap by developing a standard OLG model of neoclassical growth embodying such features. The value added of this paper grounds on three novel results, which have so far escaped closer scrutiny: (1) under suitable conditions—that is, sufficiently high weight for capital in technology and sufficiently high unemployment benefits—a regulated wage economy may perform better than a market-wage economy; (2) the correlation between unemployment and income per-capita may be positive; and (3) the level of the regulated wage may also be treated as a policy parameter for the control of population growth. The basic idea behind our results may be summarised as follows: a minimum wage, will increase the income of the currently young generation on one side but on the other side it will lead to unemployment as the hourly wage is fixed at too high a level for the labour market to be cleared. In the short-run, this brings about either an increase or a decrease in the overall income of the younger generation (depending on the size of the unemployment insurance benefit) and thus in saving as well. As regards fertility and time spent working, we note that, with both population growth and labour supply being endogenous, the individual, in principle, is allowed to choose to supply more labour and have less children or to supply less labour and to raise more children. Nevertheless, the final result is that the introduction of minimum wages, establishing a (short-run) negative correlation between unemployment and fertility, entails a lower number of children. Moreover, fertility may reduce more than savings. In the light of the latter effect (a lower fertility rate), the pace of accumulation of capital per-capita (which depends on the ratio between savings and the demand for children) in the regulated-wage economy may be higher than the capital accumulation path in the competitive-wage economy. The possible increase in capital accumulation is, however, only a first necessary engine of a possible higher per-capita income.
Footnote 4 Another condition—which depends on technology—is essential for the long-run income to be improved by the regulation of wages, and the mechanism is the following: in contrast with the static context in which a regulated wage always brings upon an output loss due to a labour demand reduction, the other input (the capital stock) being fixed, in a dynamic context the effect of minimum wages on income per-capita depends on two counterbalancing forces: on the one hand the induced increase in the capital input and, on the other hand, the induced reduction in the labour input. Whether transitional economic growth and long-run per-capita output will be reduced or increased by the introduction of a regulated wage will depend ultimately on the weight of the capital input in the production function. Therefore, if capital accumulation is improved by the regulation of wages and the capital’s weight in production is high enough, the transitional rate of growth as well as the long-run income per-capita are higher in a regulated-wage economy than in the standard competitive-wage economy. But the noteworthy improvement in the long-run level of per-capita income is not the end of the story: the regulation of wages may also generate an increase of individual’s lifetime welfare due to the increased lifetime consumption which overcompensates the reduced demand for children, provided that individuals are not too much interested in smoothing consumption over time and having children.
Footnote 5 Finally we note that, when per-capita output is enhanced by the regulation of wages, a self-evident corollary is that the correlation between unemployment and long-run economic performance, in contrast with the prevailing literature, is found to be positive.
Footnote 6
 It must be emphasised that we have sought to clarify these theoretical findings using as parsimonious a model as possible, that is, the standard Diamond’s (1965) OLG model of growth here extended to account for endogenous fertility decisions of households, minimum wage legislation and unemployment benefit policies. The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the competitve-wage economy.

Pollard,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Most work on modeling stock market volatility has largely relied on the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model introduced by Engle (1982) and the generalized-ARCH (GARCH) specification of Bollerslev (1986). Such models have found a wide variety of applications in the finance literature because of their ability to model the well-known phenomenon of volatility clustering, i.e. the tendency for large (small) changes in asset prices to be followed by larger (small) changes.Footnote 1 A common finding from the ARCH and GARCH family of models is that they usually imply a very high degree of persistence for the conditional volatility. Chou (1988) for example, applying a GARCH model on weekly US stock returns, estimates that it takes 49 weeks for just half of the previous volatility shock to dissipate. Similar evidence is reported by Poon and Taylor (1992) for the UK stock market and Lee and Ohk (1991) for the Japanese stock market. However, as pointed out by Diebold (1986), this high degree of persistence may be spurious if there are structural changes in the conditional volatility, perhaps due to increases in outliers caused by large volatility shocks as might occur during a financial crisis. In such cases, the ARCH and GARCH models overestimate the true variance of the process. Along these lines, Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990) argue that the high persistence found in conventional ARCH–GARCH models may originate from structural changes in the variance process, and find that introducing deterministic shifts in the conditional variance leads to a marked reduction in the degree of persistence. These results suggest that the standard ARCH–GARCH models may be misspecified in the presence of structural changes in the volatility process. Structural changes, such as a switch in stock market regimes caused by low probability events like the crash of 1987, the Asian crisis of 1997–1998 or the Mexican peso crisis of 1994–1995, can cause volatility to behave very differently. Schwert (1990), Nelson (1991), and Engle and Mustafa (1992) show that the standard ARCH and GARCH models are not flexible enough to describe events like the crash of 1987. Similarly, Hamilton and Susmel (1994) emphasize the inadequacy of ARCH models in the presence of structural breaks leading to switches in variance regimes. Cai (1994) and Hamilton and Susmel (1994) propose a Markov regime-switching ARCH (SWARCH) model that incorporates regime switches into the conditional variance process. Specifically, they postulate that volatility is both time and state variant, and assume that the parameters of the ARCH model depend on a discrete number of regimes, where the switch between regimes is governed by a discrete-state Markov process. Hamilton and Susmel (1994) apply the SWARCH model to the US stock market and report that the model not only provides a better fit to the data, but also implies a lower degree of volatility persistence than the standard specifications without regime shifts. Their findings lend further support to the hypothesis that volatility persistence is linked to regime shifts and structural changes. A few other studies, e.g., Li and Lin (2003), Edwards and Susmel (2001), Susmel (2000, 1998), Chen and Lin (2000), Ramchand and Susmel (1998), Dueker (1997), and Fong (1997), among others, analyze stock return volatilities using the SWARCH approach and document the existence of distinct volatility regimes. Edwards and Susmel (2001), in particular, apply the SWARCH model to a group of Latin American and Asian stock markets and find evidence, using weekly data from August 1989 to October 1999, for state-varying volatility during the 1990s in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Further, their results indicate that the high-volatility episodes are, in general, short-lived and tend to be associated with common international crisis. In this paper, we provide additional evidence on regime-switching volatility in Latin American stock markets. We use a SWARCH model to estimate the conditional variance of daily stock market index returns of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela from the beginning of January 1994 to the end of April 2005, a period that includes, among others, the Mexican peso crisis of December 1994, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Brazilian currency crisis of 1997–1998, and the Argentinean debt crisis of 2001–2002. Three interesting results emerge from this research. First, we find that stock market returns in Latin American markets can be adequately characterized by a SWARCH model. Second, we find that the ARCH effects, i.e. the tendency for volatility to cluster, are much weaker once structural changes are incorporated into the model. This implies that ARCH models may not be very robust whenever there are large jumps in volatility and lend support to the Lamoureux and Lastrapes’ (1990) argument. Third, we show that volatility switches from low volatility to high volatility are triggered to a large extent by the occurrence of a financial crisis. These switches are contagious and global in nature. A switch from low volatility to high volatility that starts in one Latin American country is almost immediately transmitted to other Latin American countries. The only exception is the Argentinean debt crisis, where we find that the switch from low volatility to high volatility remains a local phenomenon. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines Hamilton and Susmel’s (1994) SWARCH model. Section 3 presents the data and details the empirical results, while Sect. 4 concludes.",14

Crespo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The argument of this paper is as follows. First, I will specify an appropriate definition of reciprocity suitable for this paper. This notion will mainly address the ends of the persons who reciprocate. According to this perspective, the predominant aim of “reciprocal exchange” is neither mere exchange nor to acquire some goods that are means. Reciprocity entails giving rather than obtaining something. This giving looks for ends that are beyond the nature of the goods exchanged. In other words, the person who gives seeks an end, which is different from obtaining the thing she will receive as reciprocal. Moreover, giving is independent from receiving: receiving cannot be regarded as a condition for giving. In this view, the “exchanged” goods—more properly, reciprocated—only count as subjective signs of some connected ends. Thus, the rationality governing reciprocal actions is not a means-ends rationality—i.e., instrumental rationality—but an ends rationality—i.e., practical rationality. The logical structure of both rationalities—instrumental and practical—is different. Given that social science applies means-ends rationality to any social phenomena (and would then also apply it to reciprocity) it is relevant to understand the differences between instrumental and practical rationalities: this would be a misapplication. Conversely, we should know practical rationality to analyze reciprocal phenomena. The type of ends aimed by reciprocity adds an additional difficulty: they are incommensurable. This problem arises when we have to assess the fairness of a concrete reciprocation. The solution to these problems can be found at the level of practical rationality. Hence, in this paper I will first define reciprocity; second, I will highlight the embeddedness in ends of this concept; third, I will develop the logic of the rationality of means and of the rationality of ends; fourth, I will demonstrate how the “subject of ends” raises the problems of incommensurability, and I will propose a possible way to solve it; finally, I will return to reciprocity and will show how this frame solves the problem of how to determine a fair reciprocation.",3

Theocarakis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Les besoins réciproques; voilà le principe du commerce: la bonne foi & la confiance; en voilà les seuls fondemens.(Talleyrand 1790) Qu’étoit-il besoin d’aller chercher la dépendance des hommes les uns des autres, et la réciprocité des secours dans un expédient aussi pernicieux que l’inégalité de fortune, tandis que la nature en offroit tant d’autres si simples et si merveilleux. (Morelly 1755) In his Introduction to the Handbook of economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity, Serge-Christophe Kolm writes that “[a] gift or favour motivated by another gift, […], constitutes the very important social relation of reciprocity. This is very different from a self-interested exchange where each transfer (or favour) is provided under the condition that the other is provided, and hence is not a gift (in the proper sense of the term)” (Kolm 2006, p.25). Further below (p. 26), he notes that “[t]he presence of reciprocity constitutes both a motivational and relational “failure” of systems of market and command solely based on self-interest, and the most common cause of spontaneous remedy to the other “failures” of these systems due to difficulties in information, communication, or coercion of all types.” In the core structure of modern economics the concept of reciprocity is excluded. If anything, the contributions to the Handbook prove this rule. The sole motivational assumption about the economic agent is self-interest as described by a well defined set of preferences and an ordering relation upon it. It is indicative of the exclusion of the concept of reciprocity of modern economics that a French movement in the social sciences “who have dedicated themselves to a systematic attack on the philosophical underpinnings of economic theory” adopted the acronym MAUSS (Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales) taking their inspiration from French sociologist Marcel Mauss, whose most famous work, the posthumously published Essay on the Gift, saw in reciprocity “one of the human rocks on which our societies are built” (Mauss 1923/4, p.34). The notion that reciprocity maintains the bond of societies goes back to Aristotle. In his Politics (Pol., hereafter), he wrote that “a collection of people who are all alike does not constitute a state, because a state is a different thing from a league” (Pol. 2.2, 1261a24-5), a statement that Émile Durkheim (1893) placed in front of his De la division du travail social. This union of dissimilar persons is kept together by reciprocity which actually exists because they are dissimilar. Aristotle notes that “reciprocal equality is the preservative of states” [1261a30-1]. Equally he writes in Nicomachean Ethics (NE hereafter, Aristotle 1894, 1926, 1980, 2000; Jackson 1879) that “a state is kept together by proportionate reciprocation” (5.5 1132b33).Footnote 1 In fact, it is in Book 5 (“On Justice”) of NE where the philosopher used the concept of reciprocity, indeed justice according to reciprocity, as the basis of a theory of value in exchange. There exchange and reciprocity go hand in hand. I will attempt to demonstrate in this paper that the concepts of reciprocity and equivalent exchange developed by Aristotle were used, at least until the end of the 18th century, as the basis of a theory of value and a theory of equilibrium in economic transactions. It was later, in a break suggested by Turgot, and there only partly, that the notion of equivalent exchange is no longer valid. Indeed, it was only in marginalist economics that this equivalence is transferred––assuming the form of an optimizing principle––from a relation between persons to the equivalence of pleasure afforded by goods in the mind of the same person. Certainly, reciprocity as used by Aristotle was not the same concept that reciprocity has in the modern context. Indeed in Aristotle we will find the concerns of what we now call reciprocity in his books on philia––a term inadequately translated by the word “friendship”––namely in books 8 and 9 of NE and book 7 of Eudemian Ethics (EE, hereafter, Aristotle (1935)). I will start with the text of the fifth section of book 5 of NE.",3
55,1,International Review of Economics,21 February 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-008-0041-x,Trust and reciprocity: misunderstandings,April 2008,Cristiano Castelfranchi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In social theory we have to clearly distinguish the two basic constituents and moves of pro-social relations
Footnote 1:  On one side, goal-adoption, the disposition (and eventually the decision) of doing something for the other, of favoring him. On the other side, the disposition (and eventually the decision) to count on the other, to delegate him for the realization of our goals, of our welfare (Castelfranchi 1998). It is important to realize that this basic pro-social structure (the nucleus of cooperation, of exchange, etc.) is bilateral but not symmetrical.
 Pro-social bilateral relations do not start with “reciprocation” (which entails some symmetry), with some form of “exchange”. The basic structure is composed by a social disposition and by the act of counting on the other, of being dependent on, of expecting adoption (“trust”); while, on the other side, it hopefully responds to that disposition and to an act of doing something for the other, an act of goal-adoption (Spinoza’s “benevolence”).Footnote 2 “Benevolence” and “trust” are not at all the same move or disposition (although both are pro-social and can be combined); they belong to and characterize two different although complementary actors and roles. “Benevolence” and “trust”—as we have just said—are complementary and one related to the other, but they also are partially independent: they can occur alone and can just be “unilateral”. X can rely on Y, and trust him, without Y being benevolent towards X. Not only in the sense that X’s expectation is wrong and she will be disappointed by Y; but in the sense that X can successfully rely on Y and exploit Y’s “help” without any awareness or adoption by Y. On the other side, Y can unilaterally adopt X’s goals without any expectation from X, and even any awareness of such a help. Moreover, trust and “benevolence” do not necessarily meet and reflect themselves. An asymmetric trust is possible, where only X trusts Y, while Y doesn’t trust X (although he knows that X trusts him and X knows that Y doesn’t trust her). Analogously, trust doesn’t presuppose any equality. There can be asymmetric power relationships between the trustor and the trustee: Y can have much more power over X, than X over Y (like in a father–son relation), or vice versa. When there is a bilateral, symmetrical, and possibly “reciprocal” goal-adoption (where the “help” of X to Y is (also) due to the help of Y to X, and vice versa) there is trust/reliance from both sides and adoption from both sides.Footnote 3
 In sum, trust is not the feeling/disposition of the “helper” but of the expecting receiver. Trust is the feeling of the helper only if the help (goal-adoption) is instrumental to some action by the other (for example, some reciprocation). In this case, X is “cooperating” with Y and trusting Y, but only because she is expecting something from Y. More precisely (this is the interesting claim for the economists) X is “cooperating” because she is trusting (in view of some reciprocation); she wouldn’t cooperate without such a trust in Y.Footnote 4
 However, as we have explained, this is just a very peculiar case; not good at all for founding the notion and the theory of “trust” and of “cooperation”. Let us also consider—before introducing our complex model of trust—a good definition of trust, based on a large interdisciplinary literature and on the identification of fundamental and convergent elements. Trust is “a psychological state of a trustor comprising the intention to accept vulnerability in a situation involving risk, based on positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of the trustee” (Rousseau et al. 1998). Notice that the “positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of the trustee” do not necessarily refer to an act of reciprocation, but can be interpreted in a much broader sense. Y can do something good for X—on which X relies—not in order to reciprocate something done by X. And on the other side X may trust Y and rely on Y’s behavior without having done something for him (like a son towards his parents). Trusting by relying on a reciprocation behavior or motive from Y is just a peculiar sub-case. Notice that the decision/intention is not about “doing something for the other”, to help or to “cooperate” with him (in our terminology “adopting the other’s goal”); the act of trusting is not a cooperative act per sè. On the contrary, in a certain sense, the trustor X is trying to exploit the other, is expecting from the other some sort of “help” (intentional or non-intentional). Of course, in sub-cases, the decision to do something for the other (which is not a decision to trust him) can be joined with and even based on a decision to trust the other, when X is counting on an action of Y useful for herself as a consequence of her own action in favor of Y. One case is in fact when X does something for Y while expecting or eliciting some reciprocation from Y. This is not the only case of active influencing (manipulation) Y’s behavior in order to obtain the desired action: X might try to produce an action of Y that is useful for herself (an action on which she decides to count and bet) not as a reciprocation to her “help”, but simply as a behavioral consequence due to Y’s independent aims and plans. For example, X might give Y a gun as a gift, because she knows that he hates Z and she wishes Y to kill Z (not for X but for his own reasons). Analogously, it is not the case that X always expects an adoptive act from Y and trusts him for this (decides to depend on him for achieving her goal), as a “reciprocation” of her own “adoption”. However, for sure this is an important family of situations, with various sub-cases, one quite different from each other, from the cognitive point of view. In some cases, X counts on Y’s feeling of gratitude, on a reciprocation motive of affective kind. In other cases she trusts on the contrary Y’s interest in future exchanges with her. In other cases, X relies just on Y’s sense of honor and on his sensibility to promises and commitments. In other cases again, she knows that Y knows the law and worries about the authority and its sanctions.Footnote 5
 In these cases the act of “cooperating” (favoring the other and risking on it) is conceived as a (partial) mean for obtaining Y’s adoption and/or behavior. Either X wants to provide Y with conditions and instruments for his autonomous action based on independent motives, or she wants to provide Y with motives for doing the desired action.",15
55,1,International Review of Economics,11 January 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0027-0,Reciprocity and economics in historical perspective,April 2008,David Wilson,William Dixon,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is now compelling evidence to suggest that people respond in kind to helpful or hostile behaviour, so much so that some have been led to suggest that the subject of economic behaviour is not so much homo economicus as homo reciprocans. This recent interest in the phenomenon of reciprocity is part of a wider (and very welcome) rethinking of the basic attributes of the economic actor. On the basis of this recent work, economic theorising has moved some distance from the traditional modern economic approach—an approach that simply assumes a crude egoistic actor and develops elaborate theorems therefrom—and towards a richer, more complex conceptualisation of the economic actor and her acts. We wonder, however, whether this re-conceptualisation has yet moved far enough. As Bruni and Sugden (2007) point out, there is much to be learnt regarding the less-than-secure foundations of modern economics from a study of its history. Psychology was the “path not taken” by economic science, and it was Pareto who made the fateful move to separate out psychology from the proper, economic study of rational choice. There are “significant parallels”, they claim, between the issues at stake then and now, between Pareto’s rejection of the psychologically infused economics of Jevons and Edgeworth at the end of the nineteenth century and the “counter-revolution” that is behavioural economics, which over the last 20 years or so has attempted to bring psychology back into the economic-theoretical fold. We agree that there is much of contemporary relevance to be gleaned from revisiting important debates of the past. But we wonder how far the deletion/reintroduction of psychological concerns can adequately re-focus the arguments surrounding the nature of agency in economic behaviour, given that pre-Paretian psychological economics, post-Paretian rational choice theory and behavioural economics all share a common ground in an essentially atomistic view of the human actFootnote 1. In our view, the debates that constitute so-called British moralism, and in particular those contributions that run from Thomas Hobbes through to Adam Smith, offer a more compelling lesson for our own times, anticipating as they do many of the positions struck by modern economics and its malcontents. Recent departures from the standard textbook (strategically rational, egotistical) homo economicus—departures that look to a more extensive repertoire of motives and capacities to account for the apparent non-standard behaviour of the actually existing human animal—echo in tone, if not in method, the critical responses to Hobbes’s (1991) vision of a world populated by (guess what) strategically rational, egotistical agents. These recent departures, though, also suffer from the same defects of post-Hobbesian, but pre-Smithian, moralism - principally, the inability to offer a theory of economic agency that matches Hobbes’s in terms of intellectual elegance and internal consistency. As we argue below, the delivery of a coherent alternative to Hobbesianism in the eighteenth century had to wait for Adam Smith and the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759. Smith’s contribution, however, is as relevant today as then, providing as it does a benchmark as to whether claims regarding new and more adequate beginnings in economic theory can really be cashed out.",2
55,1,International Review of Economics,22 November 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0026-1,Which norms are strong reciprocators supposed to enforce? Not all norms are psychologically the same,April 2008,Laurence Fiddick,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A strong reciprocator is defined by Gintis (2000) as an individual who is “predisposed to cooperate with others and punish non-cooperators, even when this behavior cannot be justified in terms of self-interest, extended kinship, or reciprocal altruism” (p. 169). The proposed existence of strong reciprocators is embedded in a much larger theory of human nature based on gene-culture coevolution in which the adoption of norms plays a central role (e.g., Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Gintis 2003, 2007; Gintis et al. 2003). Underlying this theory is a model of the human mind as a general-purpose fitness maximizer that treats all norms alike, provided they contribute to the fitness of the replicating genes be it through selective feedback on the individual, group, or some other level of organization (Gintis 2007). The goal of this paper is not to dispute the existence of strong reciprocators, but to question the underlying theory of human nature that provides the foundation for Gintis’ analyses of strong reciprocity. There is an extensive body of research in developmental psychology (Turiel 1983), cultural psychology (Fiske 1991), social psychology and neuroscience (Bugental 2000) that suggests that all norms are not psychologically equivalent—there exist distinct normative domains that even young children reason about in dissociable ways. Hence, an alternative view emerging from psychology is that norms are not internalized from an external source, but are the projection of specialized psychological mechanisms for dealing not only with various aspects of the social world, but also other real-world problems. It is a view, I will argue, that is at odds with Gintis’ view of human nature.",3
55,1,International Review of Economics,28 November 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0029-y,Reciprocity in the shadow of threat,April 2008,Raul Caruso,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The basic question of this work is whether a particular form of strong reciprocity can favor the establishing of conflict management between rational agents involved in a destructive conflict. This is the story of two rational agents clashing over the redistribution of a divisible stake. Due to the absence of norms and institutions governing and enforcing the redistribution of the stake they compete by means of positive investments in arms and violent efforts. A conflict interaction is assumed to be: a destructive interaction which involves strategic interdependent decisions in the presence of coercion and anarchy. This concept of conflict relies upon three interdependent features: (i) coercion; (ii) anarchy; (iii) wastage of resources. By coercion, I intend that behavior shaped and influenced by the existence of a credible threat. A credible threat depends upon the potential exploitation of brutal force. Albeit with different approaches, the importance of threat has been brilliantly expounded by John Nash (1953), Thomas Schelling (1960, 1966), Kenneth Boulding (1963) and John Harsanyi (1965). Under a credible threat the choices of an agent are made under coercion. Even though agents have options to make a choice, this is not purely voluntary.Footnote 1 Take extortion. In economic terms, it is nothing but a monetary transfer flowing from an individual to another. A shopkeeper under the credible threat of a racketeer has a choice. (S)He could not acquiesce to the extortion. Whatever the outcome of this interaction, it is a choice under coercion. The second characteristic feature of conflict is anarchy. By ‘anarchy’ I simply mean nothing but the absence of rules governing agents’ behavior. As noted above, it is a state-of-nature environment where allocations of resources are determined also through the exploitation of brutal force. Albeit appearing to be a worst case scenario, this does not imply that a conflict cannot be managed or solved. It can be managed and solved only in the presence of endogenous ‘rules-of-the-game’ governing the interaction. There is no hierarchical way of mediation and conciliation as that provided by states or—broadly speaking—by organized communities. The third key feature is that conflict is costly and wasteful. Positive expenditures in conflict are irreversible sunk costs. In particular, conflict efforts are interpreted as unproductive activities leading to inefficiencies in economic life. This is in the spirit of the definition provided by Bhagwati (1982), who proposes a general taxonomy for a broader range of economic activities representing ways of making profit in spite of being directly unproductive; conflicts, contests and rent-seeking can be considered directly unproductive activities (DUP). However, conflicts are rarely a simple exploitation of brutal force. Most conflicts involve remarkable bargaining and communication efforts between the antagonists. Beyond violence, as applied when sending actual or potential threats, agents apply other instruments to successfully end any struggle. In a war, the exploitation of actual violence is often interlinked with diplomatic efforts. Diplomatic negotiations are conducted while troops are deployed on the battlefield. In international interactions, the exploitation of potential or actual violence cannot be disentangled from partial openings and cooperative behaviors. In general they could be labeled broadly as ‘conflict management efforts’. What is the nature of such conflict management efforts? By conflict management can be indicated the entire set of joint actions available to the opponents in order to be better off whilst reducing the intensity of conflict. Moreover, what agents pursue while managing the conflict is also the establishing of a certain ‘rules-of-the-game’ governing the conflict interaction. Given the non-cooperative environment it must be a self-enforcing joint strategy that makes parties better off allowing for the emerging of institutions. In a broader view, ‘conflict management efforts’ can involve a wide spectrum of activities. For expository convenience, consider among others: (i) bargaining; (ii) communication and strategic information transmission; (iii) costly signaling. Like efforts exerted in offending and hindering other agents’ behavior, efforts exerted to manage or solve the conflict fall within the broader category of unproductive activities. Pigou ([1921] 1929) already enlisted ‘bargaining’ amongst the sources of inefficiency in public and private sectors of the economy. Using his words “[...] Of bargaining proper there is little that need be said. It is obvious that intelligence and resources devoted to this purpose, whether on one side of on the other, and whether successful or unsuccessful yield no net product to the community as a whole. [...] these activities are wasted. They contribute to private, but not to social, net product [...]”Footnote 2
 This paper aims to study the emergence of a conflict management scenario grounded upon strong reciprocity. Here, I would recall a definition of strong reciprocity as presented by Gintis (2000). Borrowing his words: [...] Homo Reciprocans
exhibits what may be called
strong reciprocity, by which we can mean a propensity to cooperate and share with others similarly disposed, even at a personal cost, and a willingness to punish who violate cooperative and other social norms, even when punishing is personally costly [...].Footnote 3 Then, in such a view, the existence and the awareness of punishments shape any reciprocal and strategic behavior leading to establishing norms and institutions. The idea of strong reciprocity does fit dramatically well with the vigorous argument of ‘integrative relationship’ and ‘grants economy’ as presented by Kenneth Boulding (1963, 1973). To Boulding, any social system can be divided into three large, overlapping and interacting sub-systems: exchange, threat and integrative system. They do not occur in pure form. All human institutions and relationships involve different combinations of all three. Using Boulding’s words: ‘the integrative response is that which establishes community between the threatener and the threatened and produces common values and common interest’.Footnote 4 The integrative system involves many different concepts. Among individuals, an integrative relationship involves a complex spectrum of feelings, such as respect, love, affection and so on. It also involves other concepts emerging between individuals as well as organizations: legitimacy, status, sense of identity, community, etc. In general terms, an integrative system needs to exhibit a convergence and interdependence of utility functions of parties involved. Moreover, the key feature of integrative systems is the existence of ‘grants’. In general terms, a grant is supposed to be a unilateral transfer from an individual, a group or a social unit to another. When it occurs, the donor agent does not receive anything in return. Then, in this paper I model a conflict involving a costly commitment to conflict management between agents. This behavior is captured by means of the existence of ‘grants’ or ‘transfers’ provided, under some conditions, by each agent to the opponent. Hence, they shape a mechanism of reciprocal concessions. However, in such a framework, brutal conflict and threats do not vanish. Any cooperative behavior grounded on reciprocity will constitute a kind of ‘armed cooperation’. But it is reasonable to consider that they do have a different impact on the conflict interaction. This is the rationale of labeling reciprocity in the shadow of threat. Eventually, a key-feature of this work is that agents differently evaluate the stake of the conflict. This is a fundamental and crucial assumption. Investigating how agents form their own beliefs go far beyond the aim of this work. However, it appears clear that the asymmetry in the evaluations does constitute a really powerful force shaping parties’ behavior. In particular, it is possible to show how agents’ choice of fighting and ‘negotiating’ depends upon the degree of asymmetry in the evaluations. Recall that the evaluation of the stake can be translated in ‘incentive’ for all parties involved. Conflict and Conflict management can follow the same incentive. On one hand, the higher is the incentive the more brutal is the conflict. On the other hand, the incentive works also in favor of a settlement. That is, in other words, it would mean that agents are more prone to conflict management. This can happen when agents are rational. In fact, as rational agents the parties evaluate the incentives as well as the costs and the benefits of a conflict interaction. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 some formal pillars are presented. In Sect. 3 a baseline partial equilibrium model of conflict is expounded. Section 4 does constitute the ‘core’ of this work. It presents a model of conflict augmented with conflict management efforts. It underlines under which conditions a potential settlement region (henceforth PSR) can be established. Section 5 is devoted to the issue of measurement. It applies the idea of statistical entropy. Finally, the last section summarizes the results and provides suggestions for future research.",3

55,1,International Review of Economics,11 January 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-007-0036-z,On the value of participation: endogenous emergence of social norms in a three-player ultimatum game experiment,April 2008,Gianluca Grimalda,Anirban Kar,Eugenio Proto,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The question of the formation of institutions and of their evolution over time has received growing attention within the social sciences. The works of North (1990) and Sen (1999) have been notable attempts to approach the subject from an inter-disciplinary perspective, where “economic” and “political” factors of analysis interact with one another. In its focus on the relationship between governance and economic development, the recent book by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) is one of the most remarkable achievements of this newly-developing approach. However, this strand of literature, which may be grouped under the heading of “New Political Economy”, still seems to suffer from its almost exclusive reliance on the homo-economicus paradigm, i.e. the idea that individual behaviour is largely accountable by the rational pursuit of one’s own self-interest. This approach is still widely utilised in economics, in spite of the growing evidence coming from the experimental literature that additional motivations need to be taken into account to provide a satisfactory explanation of human behaviour (Camerer 2003; Henrich et al. 2004). In fact, economists still struggle to explain the process of full political enfranchisement and the massive participation in the voting process with a purely self-interested model of individual behaviour. On the other hand, the experimental literature has typically focused on complex institutional settings, such as committee decision-making, electoral competition among candidates, and on the relationship between information aggregation and committees (see e.g. Schram and Sonnemans 1996; Tyran 2004; Palfrey 2005, for a survey). Perhaps paradoxically, what seems to be lacking in this literature is an understanding of the basic individual motivations with respect to institutional settings. The purpose of this paper is to increase our understanding of individual motivations in relation to institutional settings using an experimental approach.Footnote 1 Our focus is on a basic aspect of democratic institutions, that is, the participation in problems of collective choice. We observe individuals’ behaviour in two different institutional settings, one allowing individuals more participation in a bargaining problem than the other. Apart from this feature, the two institutional settings are identical. In particular, the two settings are strategically equivalent from the game-theoretic point of view, i.e. rational payoff-maximising agents should behave in precisely the same manner in the two contexts. Differences that emerge may thus be attributed to the value that individuals attach to the different degree of participation in the collective problem. We are particularly interested in studying whether the manipulation over the amount of participation in bargaining leads to significantly different outcomes in terms of efficiency and payoff inequality. We also elicit individuals’ preferences over the institutional settings, and study their determinants. The situation of interaction is an extension of the Ultimatum Game (UG) (for a review, see Camerer 2003, Chap. 2) to three players. In the basic UG, an individual—the proposer—makes a proposal to another individual—the receiver—on how to divide a pie. The receiver then has the option of either to accept or to reject such proposal. If she rejects, then the proposal is not implemented and both receive a payoff of 0. If she accepts, then the proposal is implemented, and the participants receive the share of the pie as per the proposal. The game theoretic analysis of this interaction is that people should play the only Nash equilibrium of this game, which is given by the proposer claiming the whole of the pie (or the maximum amount compatible with the receivers being better off in accepting the offer rather than rejecting it), and the receiver accepting this offer. Experimental behaviour is instead markedly different. Several offers with positive amounts are rejected by receivers, and proposers seem to discount that by claiming only a part of the pie for themselves. In fact, the modal offer is in most experiments the equal split of the pie. Although the literature on two-player UGs has now reached mammoth proportions, UGs involving more than two players are not so common. Exceptions are those studies testing the Baron and Ferejohn (1989) model of dynamic multi-player bargaining. So, Frechette et al. (2003), Diermeier and Morton (2003) and Hsu et al. (2004) conduct experiments on five-player and three-player UGs with the main objective of testing the patterns of coalition formation in a context of repeated bargaining. In particular, at each stage of the interaction a proposer is drawn at random within a pool of players and makes an offer to any of the remaining players. A majority rule is then required to implement the proposals. Given the possibility for a proposer to specify different allocations for the receivers, coalitions are likely to be formed, in which a minority of players is systematically excluded from the sharing of the pie from a majority. Another strand of literature using multi-player UGs is that interested in studying individuals’ preferences for fairness and inequity aversion. For instance, strategic considerations are pitted against concerns for fairness in Guth et al. (1996) and Guth and van Damme (1998). In the former study three players play a pair of concatenated two-player UGs, with a player acting as receiver in the first UG and as proposer in the second. In the latter a third inactive player is a recipient of the allocation of the pie between a proposer and a receiver. Knez and Camerer (1995) investigate the interaction in which a proposer makes two simultaneous offers to two receivers having positive and possibly different outside options. This is done to test if social comparisons between the two receivers significantly alter their behaviour. Fischbacher et al. (2003) study the effect on UG allocations from varying the number of “buyers” and “sellers”, whereas Kagel and Wolfe (2001) test theories of inequality aversion in a study in which a proposal implies an allocation for two receivers, one of whom is chosen at random to either accept of reject the proposal. Finally, Bolton et al. (2005) adopt an approach similar to ours in comparing the outcomes of strategy–equivalent interactions in two-player UGs. Their focus is on individuals’ perception of procedural fairness, rather than participation in collective choice problems. In the present paper, we are not interested in either coalition formation or preferences over distribution, so we make some relevant changes to the settings described above. More precisely, the proposal’s offer is equally divided between the two receivers, so that there is no possibility for the proposer to form a coalition with one of the two receivers, and receivers are not influenced by the relative payoff with respect to the other receiver. Moreover, similarly to Baron and Ferejohn (1989), both receivers are called to vote over the proposal. If both of them reject the proposal then everyone obtains a payoff of 0, otherwise the proposal is implemented and the participants receive their share according to the proposal. Perhaps more importantly, the main goal of our experiment is to compare two different kinds of rules under which the above interaction is played. In the “Monocratic” rule, a proposer is randomly selected ex ante, and she becomes the only person to propose a division of the pie. In the “Democratic” rule, all of the three group members, individually and simultaneously, make a proposal. One proposal among the three is then selected by a random draw, and the receivers decide whether to accept or reject it. Even in this case, two rejections are necessary for the proposal not to be implemented. The thrust of our experiment is thus that the two rules are “strategy equivalent”, in the sense that the expected payoffs are ceteris paribus the same under the two rules. However, they offer different degrees of participation to the subjects in that everyone gets the opportunity to put forward a proposal in the “Democratic” rule, whereas only one participant is entitled to do so in the “Monocratic” rule. Moreover, the fact that all players are asked to submit a proposal in the “Democratic” rule creates a “veil of ignorance” that may force agents to reflect on the possibility of “role reversal” and act accordingly.Footnote 2 It is thus plausible that an agent takes into account the division she herself proposed (but was not chosen in the random draw), while responding to the selected offer. The results of the experiments point to the emergence of different patterns of behaviour in the two rules. In the “Monocratic” rule proposers seem entitled to demand a larger share of the pie, and receivers seem to be more lenient in accepting low offers than in the “Democratic” rule. Therefore, one may conjecture that institutional settings allowing more participation bring about more equality in payoff distribution, but also more conflict, as individuals are less prone to accept unequal offers from the proposer. More generally, this result highlights that even strategy–irrelevant differences in the institutional settings may lead to substantially different outcomes. These patterns do not occur from the start, but emerge as the number of interactions increase. This suggests that social interaction is necessary for such patterns to emerge, rather than being unconditional “hard-wired” individual propensities. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 illustrates the protocol of the experiment. Sections 9 through 11 offer a descriptive analysis, whereas Sects 12 and 13 report the results of econometric and test analysis. Section 14 concludes.",3

The existence of virtual or ‘electronic’ communities is one of the main consequences of this impact. The growing number of these communities and the development of the internet are continuously giving birth to an increasing number of information or knowledge seekers and providers. Virtual communities do not only provide a new type of organisational device, different from both the market and the firm. They also seem to facilitate new forms of economic and social interaction among economic agents on markets as well as in production processes. It is, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the extent to which this first impression is correct: Which features could allow a characterisation of virtual communities in terms of an original type of organisation and interaction? Why do firms and consumers take part in these communities? Are they driven by the usual or by more specific motivations? Do these potentially new types of organisation and interaction, and these new motivations drastically change the working and the dynamics of the economic systems in which we live? Beyond the introduction, our contribution consists of three major parts. We first clarify (part 2) what virtual e-communities are by characterizing their major empirical forms. We also try to show that this apparent empirical variety is compatible with the existence of a more analytical distinction between two different ideal-types of communities: information-based communities and knowledge-based communities. Secondly, we consider (part 3) more carefully the nature of the motivations of ideal-typical members for joining these two types of communities, emphasizing the importance of the notions of individual motivations and reciprocity usually utilised in economics. These questions however concern economists as well as sociologists. This is why thirdly (part 4) we will try to offer new responses, stressing the concepts of we-rationality and, more specifically, collective acceptance. We will conclude showing why these concepts fit more easily with issues concerning the more general relationships between community and reciprocity.",5

Paul,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is no doubt that African statehood is mainly a legacy of European colonialism. It is wrong, however, to assume that there were absolutely no beginnings of African statehood before the Europeans conquered the continent as late as the nineteenth century. And there is considerable quarrel surrounding the question as to what extent the shape and malfunctioning of contemporary African states can be attributed to the colonial experience or whether the precolonial heritage must be taken into account (Young 1994; Herbst 2000). Of course, both, precolonial forms of political organization and the imposition of the colonial state, characterize the modern African state. Yet, it is possible to distinguish more specifically between the two formative influences, to gauge their particular importance and to describe their intermingling. It shall be shown that colonialism only brought about a partial modernization or transfiguration of precolonial forms of political organization. The transfiguration was blocked, inasmuch as most contemporary African states at least empirically cannot be seen as states in the Western sense of the term, i.e., as sovereign, self-sustaining, formal entities above or apart from civil society (Jackson 1990). The result of the colonial transfiguration was, in fact, on the one hand, a subversion and destruction of traditional concepts of political legitimacy and, on the other hand, still is the fact that the final development of market economies and liberal democracies remains unlikely. My aim is neither to blame colonialism or the alleged resistance of Africans to modernization for the deplorable situation Africa is in, nor is it to postulate that the Western road to, and Western form of, statehood is the only way history could have taken, but to explain why African states and their political actors are in a way torn apart by a legacy they cannot overcome and a destiny they did not choose, yet struggle to follow. Of course, it is impossible to say, whether Africans had invented forms of political organization that resemble liberal capitalist states. It is a fact, however, that many precolonial African societies of the nineteenth century were not at all historically frozen and ultra-traditional. In contrast, in some parts of the continent not only incremental, but also profound, systematic political change was under way (Lonsdale 1981). In East Africa, e.g., that is within and around the Great Lakes region, of what today is Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, between the seventeenth and nineteenth century, kingdoms or monarchies developed and prospered, which the first Europeans described as feudal (Chrétien 2003, Chap. 3). Feudal or not, these were early states which were held together and organized not by kinship bonds but by institutionally autonomous, clientelistic forms of government and culture (Claessen and Skalník 1978). Maybe these early states could have one day become territorially defined units in which, to paraphrase Weber’s (1980, p. 29) definition of the state, a central power supported by an administrative apparatus legitimately monopolized the use of force. Ironically, however, even in these East African cases in which the European colonialists endeavored not to interfere with local African politics and not to visibly impose their foreign rule, but instead to support and instrumentalize the indigenous political structures for their basically exploitative purposes, this kind of ‘indirect rule’ led to a subversion and perversion rather than to a strengthening of African statehood. Sticking to the East African example, the questions thus to be raised are, firstly, how much precolonial clientelism can or must be considered as precolonial statehood, and, secondly, why the colonial ‘use’ of clientelism failed to realize the colonial project of state foundation. I deem the choice of the East African example, of societies where protostatal structures already existed when colonialism entered the stage, as appropriate, because for a start, one should expect the change colonialism brought about not to be as deep as where no such adaptive advantages existed. That this is obviously not the case, that there was no smooth transition, hints at the fundamental impact colonialism had on African societies, even if the postcolonial malaise of African states has roots that reach farther down in history than to the colonial situation. Theoretically, I propose to use the notion of reciprocity to describe and analyze three historical forms of African power relations, namely, clientelism, colonialism and cleptocracy. I assume the usefulness and adequacy of reciprocity to outline basic features of societal organization and shall conversely try to reconstruct the historicity and malleability of the concept itself.",6

The first hypothesis stipulates that individuals act to maximize stable preferences. The second hypothesis requires that individuals have accurate beliefs about their environment and that economy-wide stability conditions hold. The focus on individuals as autonomous decision makers distinguishes economics from sociology and anthropology, disciplines that place more emphasis on how norms, conventions, culture, and group membership directly influence behavior. The assumption that economic agents have consistent goals and successfully optimize contrasts with psychology and computer science, disciplines that emphasize that solving these problems is hard in practice and in theory. The joint hypotheses lead to valid criticisms of the methodology of economists. These criticisms may associate goal-oriented behavior with the pursuit of a particular goal: wealth maximization. The standard tools of economics do not require agents to be income maximizers; economics is well equipped to incorporate evidence that people intrinsically care about the consumption and attitude of others. The advantage of the economic framework is a consistent collection of methods that may be applied to a wide range of circumstances. Of particular importance is the ability to assess the efficiency of outcomes. A well-known disadvantage of the approach is that it endows individuals with cognitive powers that exceed theoretical and practical limits. A more subtle disadvantage is that it makes it impossible to pose some questions that have been raised by other social sciences. Specifically, if preferences are stable, then it is not possible to discuss how the interaction between individuals and institutions changes preferences. This essay maintains the hypotheses of greed and equilibrium. It discusses some issues that arise by introducing other-regarding preferences into conventional economic models. When agents have other-regarding preferences, they have an intrinsic desire to sacrifice their narrow self interest to maximize a broad notion of utility.
Footnote 1
 While it is not possible to say whether certain interactions change preferences within the economic framework, it is also not possible to say that preferences have changed. One might observe a change in choice behavior, but one cannot directly observe a change in preferences. A full understanding of the domain of preferences makes it possible to evaluate the welfare implications of changes in the economic environment. Section 2 discusses ways to model other-regarding preferences in markets. Section 3 points out the importance of a separability assumption. When the condition holds, individuals with other-regarding preferences will also have consistent preferences over individual consumption and will act as if they had classical preferences in market environments. Section 4 discusses the welfare properties of individuals with other-regarding preferences in competitive markets. In Sect. 5, I discuss the role of other-regarding preferences in strategic settings. I explain that other-regarding preferences may not be distinguishable from selfish preferences in market settings where trades are anonymous and agents have limited power to manipulate prices. When transactions are not anonymous, other-regarding preferences typically matter and the nature of optimal resource-allocation mechanisms will depend on the preferences in the economy. Section 6 provides concluding comments.",
56,1,International Review of Economics,21 October 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-008-0054-5,Population and economic growth with human and physical capital investments,March 2009,Alberto Bucci,Davide La Torre,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Projections of the United Nations (1998) show that 3 more billion people will be added to the planet before 2050. Within a similar scenario, it is extremely important to analyze the long-run effects of the increase in population on real per capita income growth. Despite the huge body of theoretical and empirical research, economists and demographers still do not have a shared view on the connections between population change and economic growth (see Kelley 1988; Ehrlich and Lui 1997 and Tournemaine 2007 for a survey of this literature). Bloom et al. (2003) p. 17, summarize as follows the available evidence: “…Though countries with rapidly growing populations tend to have more slowly growing economies…, this negative correlation typically disappears (or even reverses direction) once other factors…are taken into account”. By using a two-sector endogenous growth model where individuals may purposefully invest in human and physical capital, in this paper we aim at providing an alternative theoretical explanation of these apparently ambiguous effects of population growth on economic growthFootnote 1 based on a new technology for the formation of skills that emphasizes the presence of a relationship of substitutability/complementarity between physical and human capital (formal education) in the production of new human capital, the source of economic growth. In particular, we find that when physical capital and formal education are substitutes for each other the impact of population growth on income growth is always negative. Instead, when they are complementary for each other the effect becomes ambiguous. The intuition is the following. For given per-capita physical capital stock, an increase of population causes the aggregate physical capital to rise. If physical and human capital are substitutes the larger amount of physical capital now available in the economy deters the demand and, thus, the consequent supply of human capital. Hence, the increase in population size, together with the reduction of the aggregate human capital stock, leads ceteris paribus to an unambiguous decline of the per-capita level of skills and, via this channel, to a lower per-capita income growth rate. On the other hand, if physical and human capital are complements, the increase in the supply of physical capital spurs the demand and, therefore, the consequent production of new human capital. In this situation the final effect of the increase in population size on the per capita level of skills and, hence, on per-capita income growth may be positive, or negative, or else equal to zero. In a recent paper Tournemaine (2007) also attempts at reconciling the ambiguous effects of population change on per-capita income growth within an unified framework. In this regard, he presents a growth model where technical progress, human capital accumulation and population growth are endogenous. In his work economic growth depends positively on technological progress and human capital investment. For a given growth rate of human capital, a larger population drives the rate of technical progress up (this is the traditional scale effect one may commonly find in the innovation-based growth literature). At the same time, however, increasing population size requires to bear more children, which in turn diverts time from education. This implies a reduction in the growth rate of human capital and, ultimately, in the growth rate of per-capita income as well (quality–quantity trade off effect). Unlike Tournemaine (2007), in our model population growth is exogenous (rather than being the outcome of individuals’ fertility choice), there is no purposeful investment in technical progress and new human capital is produced both through formal education and physical capital investment. Hence, while Tournemaine (2007) explains the ambiguous impact of population growth on economic growth by the interaction of the two effects mentioned above (namely, the scale and the quality–quantity trade off effects), we propose instead a different theoretical explanation of the same result based on whether formal education and physical capital are complementary/substitutes for each other in the acquisition of new human capital, and eventually on their degree of complementarity. Our work is probably most closely related to Dalgaard and Kreiner (2001) and Strulik (2005) as, like ours, these papers also analyze the long-run effects of an increase in population on real per-capita income growth by taking population change as exogenous. Unlike Dalgaard and Kreiner (2001), who use a one-sector growth model with human and technological capital accumulation (patents and education are generated by the same production function), we build a two-sector growth model in which technological capital accumulation is replaced by physical capital accumulation (a measure of learning, as we shall specify in a moment) and where it is assumed that the production of human capital is relatively intensive in this factor-input. Instead, unlike Strulik (2005), who considers a purely Lucas (1988)-type per-capita human capital accumulation equation where, besides population growth, an exogenous
depreciation rate of skills operates, in our model the presence of the growth rate of physical capital in the law of motion of per-capita human capital acts as an endogenous mechanism of depreciation/appreciation of (embodied) knowledge. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we set the model. Section 3 analyzes the properties of the model along the balanced growth path equilibrium. In this section we also study the long-run relationship between population and economic growth. Section 4 concludes.",

Das,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Financial globalization has been accelerating. Over the last two decades the rate of increase of global cross-border investment was twice that of rate of growth of multilateral trade in goods and services, which in turn expanded at the rate of global GDP growth (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2006). State-owned and managed, Sovereign-Wealth Funds (SWFs) are special-purpose investment funds that have started playing a decisive role in underpinning, sustaining and expanding financial globalization. While they are not a new group of institutional investors, their role and significance in the global financial markets has precipitously enhanced in the lead up to the on-going credit crunch and the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. They are frequently in the news as major financial institutions. During this period of financial market stress, the SWFs acted as a countervailing force. The term SWF was not in vogue until 2005. They are liquidity-rich funds supporting financial globalization and diversification. These behemoths of the global financial world have been investing in a wide range of asset classes. One problematical facet of SWFs’ investment is the backlash they are provoking from protectionists and nationalists. Threats of financial protectionism have been mounting with rising investment by these state-owned investment funds in the global private sector corporate assets. Although they are an instrument of enhancing liquidity and of financial resource allocation in the international capital market, they have also become a source of a challenging controversy and have threatened an escalation in financial protectionism. Both public and private sector policy conclaves are concerned about the necessary policy measures needed for keeping these ominous threats in check and promoting an open global financial system. SWF operations have emerged as the hottest theme of intellectual curiosity in the discipline of international finance. Their enlarged operations in the last quarter of 2007 raised some honest question-marks. The essential theme of this article is to provide the reader with the basic conceptual strands and institutional dimensions of the SWF, their genesis, coming into prime and recent spurt in their operations. The structure of this article is as follows: Sect. 2 of this article focuses on definition, and tracks the origin and growth of SWFs. Whether they are an aberration of the international financial world is analyzed in Sect. 3. There are different kinds of SWFs, fulfilling different objective and accordingly having slightly diverse management styles. Section 4 delves into these issues. Section 5 explores the present and future market size of the SWFs and Sect. 6 examines the ramifications of this group of large of institutional investors. It also answers the query whether anxieties about their operations are exaggerated. Section 7 attempts to provide answers regarding some of the prickly policy questions.

S. Wang,Ya-Chin Wang,Lihong Zhao,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many empirical surveys show that a large share of international trade has taken place between similar countries. This is so-called intra-industry trade. The theoretical analysis of intra-industry trade can be traced back to the seminal papers by Brander (1981) and Brander and Krugman (1983), who show that intra-industry trade may occur in a quantity competition model where markets are segmented even in the presence of transport costs. Moreover, it is worth noticing that international trade, no matter whether inter- or intra-industry, may generate environmental consequences. Recently, Fung and Maechler (2007) present an analysis of intra-industry trade in a differentiated duopolistic model under price competition to stress the environmental consequences of trade liberalization. They assume that both firms are Bertrand-Nash players; namely, both firms choose price as their strategic variable and make their decisions simultaneously. As pointed out by Pal (1998), whether the firms make decisions simultaneously or sequentially is of great importance, since alternate order of moves often gives rise to significantly different results. However, the extensive literature on international trade and industrial organization has concentrated upon the case where firms move simultaneously and relatively less attention is paid to the sequential move case. Sherali (1984) argues that a single firm is always better off as a Stackelberg leader with all the other firms having declared their strategy. Pal (1998) and Bárcena-Ruiz (2007) studied the endogenous timing of the order of firms’ move under quantity and price competition, respectively. In a (private) duopoly, Pal (1998) proves that it is a dominant strategy to make quantity decisions simultaneously and Bárcena-Ruiz (2007) shows that both firms will set prices sequentially. Hence, it is not unreasonable to allow firms to move sequentially or simultaneously. Ever since Bertrand’s (1883) criticism of Cournot (1838), much debate among economists about the relative merits of quantity and price competition has been witnessed. For example, Brander and Krugman (1983) show that under quantity competition, multilateral free trade may decrease welfare when the increased waste due to transport costs dominates the pro-competitive effect, while Clark and Collie (2003) show that there are always gains from trade irrespective of the level of transport costs under price competition. In addition, Brander and Spencer (1985) prove that the government should subsidize exports under quantity competition since it can shift the rents from the foreign firm to the domestic firm, while Eaton and Grossman (1986) argue that the government should impose a tax under price competition. Accordingly, different modes of firms’ competition are likely to imply reverse results. On the basis of two assumptions about the clean and the dirty country, Fung and Maechler (2007) demonstrate that the environmental effect of trade liberalization mostly depends upon the nature of pollution (i.e. whether it is local, transboundary or global) and upon which country implements trade liberalization (i.e. whether it is from the clean or the dirty country). This contribution extends their intra-industry model by changing both the order of firms’ moves and the mode of firms’ competition. One of the objectives of this paper is to examine whether or not Fung and Maechler’s (2007) results are affected by the change(s) in the order of firms’ moves and/or in the mode of firms’ competition. It is shown that the existing results obtained for the case of simultaneous price competition are robust in quantity competition and sequential move cases. The other objective of this paper is to discuss the likelihood that the environmental effects of trade liberalization occur by cancelling the assumptions about the clean and the dirty country.Footnote 1 This issue is raised because different modes of firms’ competition and different orders of firms’ moves are incorporated into the model. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the intra-industry model and derives the equilibria. Section 3 conducts comparative statics to analyze the effects of both unilateral and multilateral trade liberalization upon output levels and the environment. Concluding remarks are drawn in Sect. 4.",

One of the main issue is to derive the factors that determine the emergence of conflicts. We adopt the framework of Grossman and Kim (1995, henceforth GK). Two agents divide their endowments in time and effort between the appropriation of an exogenous rent and the production. The effort allocated by the prey is used to defend her initial claims to resources. She moves first and takes into account the reaction of the predator. We use this analytical framework to address the following questions: what is the relation between the value of the rent and the type of equilibrium, whether a conflict or a no conflict equilibrium? Under what conditions a conflict equilibrium prevails? Does the existence of an asymmetry with respect to the valuation of the rent influence the probabilities of winning? By our analysis, we first want to explain the fact that natural resources are important factors of conflict between groups. One may then understand the causes of civil wars between a government and rebels. The government can be considered as a first mover player who provides military defense with the objective to protect a primary commodity. Collier and Hoeffler (2004) studied the relationship between natural resources and the risk of rebellion. They show that the level of dependence on primary commodity exports affects the risk of conflict. The present paper builds on GK who distinguish between offensive and defensive activities. They show that security of claims to property does not depend on the size of the contested resource. There is no conflict when the prey has some advantage in that the relative effectiveness of her weapons is greater than a threshold level which is, however, independent of the value of the contested resource. In this paper, by considering a more general specification for the production technology, we show that the relative effectiveness of the prey’s weapons and the value of the rent matter when analyzing the type of equilibrium that obtains. Many authors have adopted the prey–predator framework of GK to analyze the relation between the size of the contested resource and the security of claims to property. Their results rest on strong assumptions. Baker (2003) assumes that the relative effectiveness of the defending group depends negatively on the size of the defended parcel. He shows that larger territories are less likely to be geographically stable. Konrad (2002) adopts a rather different contest success function that allows the prey to win without any effort. He comes to a similar prediction: an increase in the prize under contest increases the likelihood of a conflict. Caselli and Coleman (2006) analyze the role of ethnic cleavage in the likelihood of conflict between a dominant group and a weak group whose members have the possibility to switch to the dominant group. They show that, all other things equal, the probability of conflict is inverted-U shaped in the size of the prize. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we specify the model and notation. Section 3 derives the Stackelberg equilibrium and its properties. Section 4 presents a comparative statics analysis. Section 5 analyzes the case with different valuations of the rent. Section 6 concludes the paper and suggestions for future research are presented.",
56,2,International Review of Economics,10 April 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-009-0067-8,Productivity and profitability analysis of large Italian companies: 1998–2002,June 2009,Alessandro Zeli,Paolo Mariani,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years both economic analysis and the industrial policy debate have paid close attention to large Italian companies (at least 250 employees) (Barca and Trento 1997; Traù 1999, 2004; Istat 2005). The development of Italian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has driven the slow Italian economic growth particularly through industry cluster and the territorial network model (Becattini 1979, 1998). However, large enterprises in industrial districts play a role of “functional competitiveness in order to determinate a positive district effect” (Zeli and Nascia 2007). Moreover, the sustainable competitive advantage model of SMEs remains quite uncertain, especially considering the growing international competition on the one hand and the urgent needs of technological innovation and the full exploitation of returns to scale on the other (Fortis 2005). In particular, the downsizing processes and the exit of several large enterprises from certain industrial sectors may imply a “development deficit” and a “complexity governance loss” of the Italian industry (Traù 1999). The large scope and product diversification of large enterprises make them more adaptable to business shocks. Many small and medium enterprises belong to enterprise groups led by large companies that plan the general industrial policy of the whole group, therefore the close ties between enterprises of different sizes must be underlined. In this framework the coordination role of large companies in terms of financial management can also may be noted. The new investment borrowing capacity of large companies via high leverage ratio is not comparable with that of SMEs (Guelpa 2005). These large enterprise functions imply a high staff ratio (administrative personnel on total employees) and high personnel skill. In fact, the compensation for employees is positively correlated with enterprise size. This causes a flow of skilled employees (even if trained in a SME) towards large companies (Traù 1999). This paper tries to link, in a unique framework, all these complex factors concerning large Italian companies in industry sectors as well as to detect the behavioural pattern in terms of productivity and profitability between 1998 and 2002 (Torrini 2005). Although we want to focus the analysis on large Italian companies in the industrial sector only, we are going to give some figures on large companies as a whole in order to compare all sectors. Although micro and small companies prevail in Italy, large companies amounted to nearly 2,600 in 1998 and approximately 3,100 in 2002 in the industrial and service sectors, representing a significant economic share. For industrial and service sectors the employee distribution by size class does not show any relevant changes from 1998 to 2002. Instead, there was a significant increase in the turnover shares of large companies, while the value added share, in 2002, was around 30%. This is less when compared to that of 1998. In 2002 large companies had a significant economic importance in the industrial sector, where they employed 25% of the total workforce and represented 36% of value added. However, their economic weight decreased in the service sector (18% of total employment and 26.2% of value added) as well as in the construction sector (3.0% of total employment and 5.1% of value added) (Istat 2006). The export tendency of the manufacturing companies (measured by the export turnover on total turnover) in 2002 was 26.0%, showing a significant differentiation among size classes. For companies with one to nine employees the export represented 7.6% of turnover. Companies with 10–19 employees exported 15.1% and finally, companies with over 250 employees reached an incidence equal to 34.6%. The data given above warrant further discussion. The productivity and profitability trend analysis for large Italian companies allows recognition of the productivity and profitability path of the economy as a whole; large companies’ data are important as an explanation of national competitive growth and technological development as well as for the national wage policy. Moreover, the asset financing policies are strongly related to the investment policies driving technological changes toward product and process innovations. Innovation gives better company performance as a result. Finally, the competitive growth of the economic system can be better understood considering these factors jointly. The analysis is focused on industrial sectors only: the importance of big enterprises is greater for the industry than for the service industry, and for industry it is possible to study the competitiveness adopting the turnover exportation ratio. The mutual interconnections of the aforementioned variables make the analysis of the system more complex. A complete and consistent analysis has to consider many variables related to company productivity and profitability, using a methodology which properly describes such variables as well as all their mutual links. The most important productivity and profitability analysis factors are measured by the balance sheet ratios based on account data which represent the economic and financial aspects of a company. Our framework is based on a statistical methodology aimed at detecting latent variables which depict the companies’ productivity and profitability from 1998 to 2002. Such an approach aims, first, to define the industrial and productive system environment and, second, to detect the dynamics of specific industrial divisions. The productivity and profitability ranking of industrial sectors is dynamically compared using different economic and financial ratios according to the factorial methodology (analysis of principal components).",8

The stability of a time series could be graphically examined with a correlogram of its level. More specifically, the rapid (slow) geometrical convergence of the graph of the autocorrelation function towards zero is indicative of a stationary (non-stationary) process. The results of this methodology may, however, turn out to be quite questionable. For example, in the case of a nearly integrated time series, i.e. a time series which converges to its long-run equilibrium value very slowly, its slow decay autocorrelation function may lead to the false conclusion that the considered time series is non-stationary. Other procedures, which might be used to determine the presence of a unit root in a time series, are the ones proposed (1) by Dickey and Fuller (1979, 1981), (2) by Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) and (3) by Phillips and Perron (1988) who drew a unit root test using non-parametric statistical methods. Various Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron test statistics are biased toward the acceptance of the unit root null in the presence of structural breaks, i.e. structural breaks reduce the power of the unit root test. Therefore, Perron (1989, 1990, 1994, 1997), Zivot and Andrews (1992), Banerjee et al. (1992), Perron and Vogelsang (1992a, b, 1998) have developed tests, in the context of which the significance of unit root null is tested, allowing for a break in a time series and choosing the break date either exogenously or endogenously. Moreover, Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) developed a methodology, in the context of which the unit root hypothesis is investigated allowing for two breaks in a time series with the break dates being chosen endogenously. Covering the period between 1858 and 1938 and using annual data, the time series of the decomposition of Greek real GDP (primary, secondary and tertiary sectors), measured in natural logarithms, are tested for the presence of a unit root, allowing at most for two breaks that take place at an unknown point in time. We used the data of Kostelenos (1995). It should be underlined that due to the inherent fragility of the aggregate data, some assessments (especially those concerning the pre-1914 real GDPs) are open to debate and any conclusion is premature and liable to change as data collection advances and the construction of relevant macro-economic variables become more secure. But we have to note that the major findings of Kostelenos’ (1995) study constitute, to our belief, a valuable contribution to the understanding of modern Greek economic history. Major historical events during 1858–1938 (summarized in Table 1), which characterize a unique—and peculiar in a sense—pattern for GDP and its growth rate motivate our interest. The four panels in Fig. 1 depict GDP, its components (agricultural, manufacturing, services) as well as the respective growth rates. Three sub-periods can be recognized with respect to historical events for GDP and its components. With respect to GDP the first period spans from 1858 to 1884. In the Greek economy, the brief (1830s–early 1840s) and rapid recovery from the losses of the War of Independence was followed by a long period of slow growth which ended in stagnation at the end of 1880s. This stagnation was followed by the financial and income crises of the early 1890s. The second sub-period, which ranges between 1884 and 1911, is characterized as a period of upheaval and slow growth. It is marked by the issuance of 11 million gold coins, the new drachma, large-scale borrowing, bankruptcy of the economy and the indemnity to Turkey. The turmoil is also evident in the increased variability in growth rate patterns. The third period is marked by the beginning of the Balkan Wars (1912) after which Greece gradually annexed large parts of modern day Greece including Crete, Macedonia, Western Thrace, Epirus and the North and Central Aegean Islands. It must be noted that the great economic depression of 1929 did not affect Greek GDP to a great extent, mainly because at that time the secondary sector of the economy produced only 6.51% of the country’s GDP. During 1929 the contribution of the primary and the tertiary sectors to Greek GDP was 35.5 and 57.99%, respectively. GDP and GDP growth With respect to the primary sector, the first period spans from 1858 to 1881, which marks the date Greece annexed Thessaly and part of Epirus. The effects are evident only in 1884 after settling, when a spike in both GDP and GDP growth rate is observed. The second period of interest extends from 1894 to 1912. During this period we do not observe any major changes in agricultural output as Greece’s territory did not change. It is however followed by a second major spike in the growth rate in 1912, immediately after Greece’s annexation of Crete. From 1912 to 1938 new territories that where annexed increased agricultural output. In the secondary sector, the first period spans to 1893, when the Greek economy bankrupted, while in the tertiary sector 1882 marks the date when the new monetary system was completed. A brief initial study of the historical events depicted in the diagrams allows us to understand the major social and economic changes that affected modern Greece at the beginning of the twentieth century. We examine these developments so as to infer the pattern of structural changes in GDP and GDP growth rates that shaped modern Greek economy history.",

In very general terms, finance deals with markets of this type. Financial innovation introduces the possibility of exchange on wider time-events sets. In this way market incompleteness should be reduced with an overall advantage for economic agents. The existence of this advantage, nonetheless, also depends on other elements, like the degree of market competition, the level of information, and the presence of inefficiencies generated by moral hazard.Footnote 1
 In the present paper, the influence of several of these factors will be briefly examined, keeping in mind how certain behaviors of financial operators, who benefit from financial innovations, have produced undesirable effects. In particular, I will try to show how considerable uncertainty (ambiguity) regarding certain financial products has been created. Aversion to this uncertainty has reduced liquidity, and this has in turn caused mistrust vis-à-vis the solvency of primary financial operators. Uncertainty and illiquidity have also been fueled by the fact that financial innovation has developed outside the organized markets and has not created standardized products which can be exchanged anonymously under the rules of a stock exchange market. The new financial products have been sold over the counter, often to other banking and financial operators, and sometimes they have not even been sold, but placed in vehicles of the parent company, off its balance sheet. These often were opaque and poor-quality assets due to the presence of moral hazard situations. Moral hazard has also been favored by the structure of incentives for the administrators of investment banks, which are based on short-term results. Furthermore, U.S. financial innovation has developed in an economic and political environment characterized by systemic excess. This has included sizable deficits (foreign, as well as private and public) covered by borrowing; expansionary monetary policy, which has displayed indifference faced with mounting asset price inflation; and inadequate—at times non-existent—regulation, especially for investment banks which were allowed to leverage themselves to unprecedented heights. The disinvestment of existing leverages increased systemic risk, and thus required state intervention.",

Economic opinion, as of spring 2009, appears divided. Some economists and economic opinion leaders argue that the present crisis provides scope for a necessary adjustment after years of tumultuous growth. The trade cycle is not a thing of the past, as some had fancied especially during the roaring 1990s. It stays with us and, on the whole, it is probably not too bad. It is something we can learn to live with, as it performs a physiological function. Things are bound to adjust, though (admittedly) perhaps not as quickly and promptly as, say, the real cycle theory used to predict. It is obvious that in any depression, this particular standpoint has constantly been there and that it embodies, indeed, the most immediate and sensible reaction to a depression. Of course, it is also a kind of reaction, which, as a rule, is likely to be relished by CEOs and politicians alike, both when trying to avert being indicted for the disarray and when aiming at milking the taxpayer’s purse. Some would also argue that, even if doubtfully, it is a good thing to spread the idea of a fundamental stability of the economy, essentially to keep defeatism at bay, as the latter no doubt is a stimulant of the crisis. In particular, when pondering on the view of economists on policy, it is very instructive to recall where and when they got their PhDs, but it is sometimes perhaps even more instructive to keep in mind on which boards they are currently sitting. Indeed, what I am describing here used to be the general optimistic mood behind the whole of economic theory for a long time, an ideal of theory firmly based, sometimes unwittingly, on a principle known as Say’s Law. Things started to change as economists became more interested in the economics of the short period, approximately at the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth century. It is perhaps useful to recall that that was precisely the standpoint, which Keynes meant to challenge. The debate between Hayek and Keynes on the trade cycle, for example, despite the fact that it was largely based on Keynes’s Treatise on Money, is still important today and has something to tell us on the economics of recessions: we see on the one side the optimism of self-adjustment, however painful, and on the other side the pessimism of those who see the economy stuck in a curious type of ‘equilibrium’ and inclined to call the state to the rescue. Much as it happened at that time, the optimistic position seems to be the dominant one also today. Men of finance, in particular, when they are successful and when they go bust, are firmly optimistic as to the stability of the system and on the long-run advantages of financial expansion in creating wealth. After all, to mention a famous case, a major unwitting upholder of Say’s Law was David Ricardo, an extremely and uniquely successful man, both as a theorist and as a loan contractor on the stock exchange market. Ricardo is quoted as saying in an upbeat comment that he had made his money by observing that people in general exaggerated the importance of events. At the same time, there are voices in the wilderness. Some observers try to reconstruct the recent vagaries of economic theory, especially in the macro camp. The Keynesian paradigm trickled down slowly, but steadily at the time and exploded into full triumph only after the end of Keynes’s own lifetime. Admittedly, it was not so much the triumph of pure Keynesianism; it was mainly the success of the so-called Neoclassical synthesis, also called ‘bastard Keynesianism’.Footnote 1 The triumph, and the way it occurred, meant a leap into mechanic or hydraulic Keynesianism. All this produced violent swings in the general scientific mood. The very success of ‘bastard Keynesianism’ was (to a considerable extent) self-defeating and came to be instrumental in paving the way to the demise of the Neoclassical synthesis itself. There was a rapid decline of the Neoclassical synthesis, which was then pushed aside. A monetarist revival was already well under way at the end of the 1960s. The revival, however, ended up in a ‘market mystique’, as Paul Krugman has dubbed it, which appears at the root of the searing excesses and consequent havoc affecting our financial institutions.Footnote 2
 Of course, following this line of thought, the view of the crisis takes a very different shape. After the economic disasters produced by communism in the past century, it seemed difficult to do worse. But here, if we take the situation of some of the ex-socialist economies as an example, we may really be in the face of something even worse. Hayek’s famous argument, on the dire consequences of the ‘pretence of knowledge’, can now be retorted against a whole host of gallant defenders of the free market, who have been all too easily assuming themselves to be immune from that kind of disease. At the same time, the present economic turn produces self-critical concerns on the kind of economic teaching that has become dominant and uniform all over the globe. Such an attitude is sometimes favourably taken, almost as a proof of sound scientific reliability: but it is also increasingly tempting to cast doubt on that widespread belief. Whether sincere or mixed with crocodile’s tears, taken at face value recantations abound.",

It is a shared opinion that the current situation digs its roots back in August 1971 with the termination of dollar conversion into gold and with the opportunity for the US to transform their currency, now in paper, as such “trust-based”, and no longer tied to gold reserves, into a world currency. The problem became more serious in 1987 when, under pressures from the banking environment, the Glass–Steagall law, enforced by the American Parliament after the 1929 crisis to prevent conflicts of interests among banks and companies subscribing shares and bonds, was repealed. This financial liberalization was promoted by Alan Greenspan, who then became president of the FED after being a member in 1987, of the board of directors of J. P. Morgan, the first bank to take profit of this liberalization. The significant and often incautious expansion of credit in the US after the 1992 recession is the third main factor accounting for the current severe financial crisis. American banks, in fact, started to grant countless loans to customers whose creditworthiness was not to be fully relied upon. Such policy was encouraged, and partly even regulated, by the democratic administration of Bill Clinton: with the Community Reinvestment Act, in fact, a bank evaluation principle was introduced, based on the number of loans granted to citizens resident in areas qualified as “low income” to promote the integration of lots of immigrants, the so-called “ninja clients” (no income, no job, no assets), allowing them to obtain a house thanks to the exceptionally low interest rates in force on the US market at the time. In order to promote the purchase of property, loans equal to 100% of the value were offered, with low installments and interests due upon extinction, and—even more uniquely—without any due certainty about the client’s solvency. The “insolvency risk” obviously remained, and was addressed through the adoption of the Originate To Distribute (OTD) model, a true operational technique by which banks could “dispose” of their loan risk by transferring it to third parties. In other words, bank credits were “packaged” into bonds meant for placing on the market. This system produced two effects that were at the origin of the crisis: (1) banks gave up their traditional mediating and monitoring role, evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers, and turned into actual “brokers”; (2) bank assets were subject to fluctuations on the financial markets. With the sale of these loan packages to other investors, financial institutions could recover the loan amounts immediately, but could also grant new loans. This fostered the property bubble while, in parallel, the quality of “subprime” loans declined compared to the “prime” loans. The market realized that several borrowers were not refunding and/or would not be able to refund the borrowed amounts. The subsequent mass insolvency of these particular borrowers forced banks to sell the property guaranteeing the granted loans, seriously affecting quotations on the property market. In a globalized market, characterized by clear information asymmetries, the fear of insolvency ended up with affecting the holders of all bonds—those based on high-risk loans and the safe ones alike—even if it soon became clear that the idea of transferring risk was not limited to property loans, but involved a multitude of other uses (from loans to buy cars to credit cards and loans to perform bank mergers). In order to make up for the decline in profitability, US banks turned to foreign banks with offers of “packages” known as Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) whose sale was, however, subject to rating by companies in charge of estimating the insolvency risk. This gave place to the “Investment grades”, i.e. MBS containing “prime” mortgages, thus less risky, followed by the “Mezzanines”, with a medium risk, and the “Equity”, i.e. the high-risk subprimes. The difficulty in placing the high-risk MBS led banks to create a re-rating, i.e. divide them into groups by default probability, while undertaking to give priority to the payment of the best securities. Thus, an initial mix of expansive monetary policy, combined with ineffective regulation and with the subprime loan crisis, had caused troubles to banks exposed in terms of securitizations, undermining the stability of their accounts. The losses of these investment banks were tied to their high debt–capital ratio: if, for some reason, fund provisions were not constantly replenished and/or fund lenders to the investment banks did not renew their loans, the bank suffered a crisis of liquidity and, thus, of solvency, creating the assumptions for insolvency. Most parties blame the FED for the crisis and, particularly, for a US monetary policy that is judged too expansive. This belief is supported by a number of factors (Barucci and Ferri 2008), first and foremost the fact that the excess debt of American households (internal imbalance) had contributed to the low-rate policy implemented by the FED and that such policy had remained in place despite the depreciation of the dollar and with a deficit of current accounts equal to an average 5% rate of the GDP in the past few years (external imbalance). During the 18-year governance of Greenspan, in fact, the widest expansion of speculative finance in the world history had taken place, and the current emerging problems point out to a world-wide crisis, also considering that American financial and banking groups have placed the “trash” securities in Europe but, particularly, in Asia, where the assets of major banks and financial companies are mainly made up of US securities rated AA as well as AAA by the “independent” agencies, including Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch. The result was the creation of a huge monetary mass, made of fictitious wealth (paper money of the central bank) and of virtual wealth (electronic wealth), which escapes systematic monitoring and brings huge profits in commissions alone, thus undermining the real wealth of a country through its negative impact on consumers, companies, and local entities. By way of example, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Over The Counter (OTC)Footnote 1 financial derivatives, i.e. the ones negotiated outside the regulated markets, amounted to US$595 billion in 2008.Footnote 2
 The opportunity to transfer the risk of the granted loans resulted into a lack of interest of banks in monitoring the possibility for debt reimbursement. Facing the lack of supervision by the monetary authorities, no US authority (government, Congress) had taken measures, not even to ensure compliance with the minimum security standards. Many wondered about the reason for this lack of regulation. According to Zamagni (2008), the American Congress had perceived the severity of the problem as early as in 1994, and had approved a law that forced the Federal Reserve to set standards for loan-granting operators that, until then, lacked any kind of regulation. The law was boycotted by Greenspan, who accounted for his behavior by noting that derivative transactions took place among highly qualified professional operators and that, based on the Black–Scholes–Merton model for determination of the value of derivatives, looking at the price of an asset would have been enough to give the fair value to the combined security, whatever the connected risk. Other signs of a possible financial crisis became visible in 1998, following the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Scholes and MertonFootnote 3 upon the collapse of the Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), sponsored by the two scholars, who were themselves members of its board of directors. “Light American finance” had continued even after the corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom 2001), when attempts were made to patch up with the “Sarbanes–Oxley” law that, incomprehensibly, was extended neither to companies involved in financial brokerage, nor to rating agencies. Too much trust in the self-disciplinary skills of the financial market had persuaded the SECFootnote 4 to allow major investment banks to ignore the traditional cautionary rules to which the debt to net capital ratio was subject, and substitute them with a sort of self-assessment. Following up such decision, their debt–capital ratio had quickly increased to levels five times as high as those enforced by other banks, with disastrous consequences. At that time, in the investment banks exempted from abiding by constraints to accounting reports, several off-balance sheet entities had proliferated, sponsored by one or more banks. These were the Off-balance Sheet Entities (OBSE), independent companies established for “specified” purposes that were not mentioned in the balance sheet of the sponsor banks, but to which very high commissions were paid. The consequences of the birth of these financial companies are now clear. Several questions concern the behavior of the SEC and the FED; the former was responsible for controlling the US investment banks and had supported the ongoing increase of the financial lever in the controlled companies, while the latter had implemented a non-intervention policy. In this aspect, it should be noted that, while Greenspan had often talked about the risks represented by excess securitization by the two semi-public property financial companies—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—then nationalized, full trust in the new financial instruments, the lack of understanding of past experience, rich of recurring crises, and the utter non-implementation of the 1994 Home Owner Equity Protection Act that granted express powers to the Federal Reserve to regulate the loan market at best, had indeed acted as a trigger for the current financial crisis (Margiocco 2008). All the above was supported by the rating agencies that—subject to clear conflicts of interests (being paid by the customers, rather than by the investors)—had (and still have) taken a primary role at a time of bank deregulation and inability of the supervisory authorities to control. The crisis did not only just affects the main American financial and banking groups, the big foundations, the pension funds, and the US insurance companies, but also spreads to Europe, albeit with different peculiarities compared to the American one. The focus was in IcelandFootnote 5; strong repercussions were observed in the UK and France, and the impact on other European countries is still uncertain, particularly for the southeast European ones. Based on an analysis of Kler’s,Footnote 6 structured bank bonds issued by 250 Italian credit institutions in the years 2006, 2007, and the early months of 2008 amounted to 121 billion EUR. In addition, Kler’s drafted a ranking of banks that issued the highest number of structured bonds in the last three years: the UniCredit Capital pair (before their merger) had issued 13.8 billion EUR (2006) and 12.5 billion EUR (2007), respectively, followed by Intesa Sanpaolo with 10.5 billion EUR (2006) and Mediobanca with 3.5 billion EUR (2007) (D’Angerio 2008). At an institutional level, the risks connected with such transactions had been known at least for a few years. They were definitely inappropriate and thus pointed out to a dramatic understatement of the credit risk by the different organizations in charge of supervision, including Consob, Abi, and the Bank of Italy, as shown by some facts reported below. In 2004, Giorgio La Malfa, President of the Finance and Treasury Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, had initiated a survey on the popularity of derivatives in Italy, and the audition of Antonio Rosati, general Official of Consob, had taken place in this context. While admitting that derivatives implied risks attributable to partial understanding of their features, Rosati fully recognized their usefulness, and allowed to transfer risks from those that wished to get rid of them to those that were prepared to manage them professionally. Very interesting data had emerged from the same survey. It turned out, in fact, that “78,000 contracts could be referred to the 10 banking groups under study at June 30, 2004. The overall notional countervalue of the positions at June 30, 2004 amounted to approximately 146 billion EUR. Clients with a negative position (the so-called negative market to market) with respect to banks, assuming a prompt closing of such positions, were above 4 billion EUR.” However, the Consob report hasted to specify that it was indeed a potential liability: “it may simply point out to the fact that a nonexistent risk was covered.”
Footnote 7
 Also from the Consob investigations on the 2003–2005 period, it turned out that the UniCredit group had issued for about 12,700 small and medium enterprises “such sophisticated and complex financial products” as to turn out “inappropriate for the client companies themselves, being genetically deprived of the stated finalization,” i.e. “not useful to cover the financial risks of industrial companies… but rather suited to cover the treasury requirements of the same bank.”
 Consob concluded that the UniCredit group had “collected revenues for 759 million EUR in 2003 and for 427 million EUR in 2004, when the rate decline downsized margins.”
 Just later, however, Consob seemed to have partly changed its opinion: in fact, it had censured the 2006 balance sheet of Banca Italease, for some time going through a crisis and already the object of an inspection by the Bank of Italy and of a court inquiry, particularly due to an inappropriate assessment and accounting of over the counter derivatives, an inappropriate accounting treatment of upfront commissions, and the lack of balance sheet information on the type of derivatives and of the related risks.Footnote 8
 In May 2008, Consob had finally issued new rules to increase transparency in transactions on policies, banking bonds, and derivatives, with detailed instructions to assess the client’s risk profile, particularly for “compound products”, stating that “according to the principle of the client’s best interest, the broker’s recommendation can only concern the cheapest products.”
 The activity of the Bank of Italy in terms of bank “supervision” is also not immune from criticism. In its 2006 report, Bankitalia demonstrated being well aware of the existing situation: “The significant net outflow of savings from funds established under the Italian law reflected an increased preference of Italian households for investments in low-risk financial assets, including treasury bonds…”. It was thus an expected disaster: for months, in fact, news had been circulating on the risk that major American banks could be overwhelmed by the crisis of subprime loans.Footnote 9
 The Italease case is a clear proof of the “inattention” of the supervisory authorities. In April 2007, it turned out that such bank, directed by Massimo Faenza, had sold to its clients hundreds of high-risk derivatives, very complicated products, created in London by big international institutions (including Deutsche Bank and BNP-Paribas) and-resold in Italy. The closing of contracts, upon the early signs of the crisis, had forced Italease to pay 778 million EUR. In July, the Bank of Italy, unusually tough, called for the renewal of the whole board of directors and the recapitalization of the institute, and banned the performance of “transactions with structured financial derivatives.” The court inquiry that started off from the statements of some clients and from the in-house checks provided for by the Bank of Italy had ascertained that, at the time of Faenza, the bank paid very high commissions (up to 20%) to some brokers; these amounts were, thus, much higher than customary commissions, and were collected by a small group of physical entities. Moreover, it turned out that Banca Italease could not sell complex derivatives, in that it had not received the necessary permits from the Bank of Italy. It seems, in fact, that an inspection had been provided for at the time of governor Fazio, and that upon Faenza’s request to place complex derivatives, the Bank of Italy had never provided its authorization (Di Biase 2007).
 At the same time, poorly reassuring news came from the Mediobanca report: in 2006, only 14% of the funds had managed to beat the benchmark, i.e. the yields set by the same funds, whereas in the 2002–2006 period a mere 2% of funds had beaten their benchmark.Footnote 10
 Additional information, in a generally gloomy picture, had also been provided by the Court of Accounts on the use of derivative instruments by the Regions and local entities in 2006: the total debt in bonds was about 25 billion EUR, including at least 5.4 billion EUR “covered” by derivative transactions. The strong growth of the regional debt was clearly stressed, with banks becoming more aggressive and offering complex derivatives with “collar” options, which reduced (Bufacchi 2007) “the probability of an advantage for the same entity.” In the speech before the Center for Financial Studies,Footnote 11 Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy, had praised the “Originate-to-distribute” (OTD) model, a phrase describing the creation of derivatives and the redistribution of risks on the market, particularly through securitization (as it happened with the US loans). While Draghi admitted that the current crisis was “basically a crisis of the OTD model,” he claimed in partial contradiction that securitization could hardly be abandoned. “It can be noticed, that OTD is not a flawless model, but I believe it is too valuable to all the parties to be abandoned”. According to data provided by the Bank of Italy itself, the mark to market (the market value at the date of the survey) of derivatives owned by the local entities in the past few months of 2007 was negative for 1,055 billion EUR. Two-thirds of this value (even if not translated into an immediate loss) belonged to the cities, one-fourth to the regions, and the remainder to the Provinces (Borzi 2007). The banks’ proposal was, in fact, very attractive for the mayors and councillors that, thanks to the interest rate swaps, could redefine debt, extend its expiration, lower rates, and most times, obtain an initial incoming cash flow. Notwithstanding this, the Bank of Italy continued to stress that derivative trading resulted into a moderate exposure to market risk of the banking system as a whole. Early in 2008, the situation seemed to have changed: some operators, including UniCredit Banca, had announced substantial changes in their business strategy, and inspections by the Bank of Italy started in the offices of UniCredit, MPS, and Intesa Sanpaolo, i.e. the three Italian banks that were most exposed to derivatives. With the report of May 2008, Governor Draghi focused on a supervision meant to protect savers, while seeming to challenge the banking system to implement unfair business practices, pointing out to savings protection as a value to be preserved. In fact, in his closing remarks at the meeting of the Bank of Italy, he wrote that Supervision would be in place as of August 1, and that the reform would “protect the Italian banking and financial system from new emerging risks, increase savings protection, and reduce charges on the brokers.”
 Draghi seemed to be wishing to make a change in Supervision, so as to finally close the prior governance period, characterized by three serious episodes of insolvency (Argentinean bonds, Cirio, and Parmalat), and the first part of his own. In fact the Governor wrote that “long before market disturbance started, Supervision had begun reviewing its intervention mode in depth … multiplied focused inspections…and an agenda of checks on derivative operations by major banks was initiated in 2006 and strengthened last year.”
Footnote 12
 Bankitalia, also via the Governor, ensured prompt action both at system and individual level, with monitoring of the liquidity of major banking groups “within the framework of its own responsibilities,” also reminding that “rating agencies have demonstrated being affected by severe conflicts of interests in their dual assessing and consulting role vis-à-vis the issuers and the investors.”
Footnote 13
 Notwithstanding this, turbulence in the US was still claimed to have produced a limited risk for the Italian banking and insurance system: “The Italian financial market and the Italian banks are part of the world financial system, but only shared a minimum number of errors and distortions with it. There is no shadow banking system in our country. The Bank of Italy has construed its mandate assertively, operating in view of not repeating in Italy the errors made in other systems.”
Footnote 14
 Draghi thus stated that, all in all, Italy did not come out too badly from the crisis, even if, indeed, this was one of the few positive notes in an all but reassuring picture. Many repeated that our banking system enjoyed good health anyway and provided as proof such indicators as a comparison of the credit default swaps quotations of the main European financial companies. These quotations represent the premium due to safeguard oneself against the risk of the bank’s default, and since the premium was noticed to be lower for the Italian banks compared to the European brokers (Alletto et al. 2008), the former were judged by the specialized operators as less risky than the European ones. It was claimed, in fact, that the negative impact was mitigated in Italy because (a) Italian banks had only adopted the “OTD” model to a limited extent: according to Bank of Italy data, in the last few months of 2007 the main credit institutions had a 4.9 billion EUR exposure in ABSs and CDOs,Footnote 15 whereas back in 2008 a decrease in loans was observed (Barocci 2008); (b) no risky loans were usually granted in Italy, and the applicants’ solvency was always accurately checked; (c) the Italian rules on the transparency of activities and on the cautionary treatment of securitizations had always been strict; therefore, in practice, the assumptions were not in place for the existence of a “shadow banking system” as the one at the basis of the current world crisis. The “careless” position of ABI (the Italian banking association) with respect to the financial crisis can indeed be perceived “only” in the audition of its president Corrado Fissola at the Finance Commission of the Senate (Faissola 2008), where he stated that derivatives “had aroused lots of rumours. Too concise judgements were expressed,” and added that “financial innovation, if wisely performed, is often good”, stating that “the basic function of financial derivative instruments is to provide protection from risks…”.
 As to the inspections initiated by Bankitalia on the derivative transactions of four Italian banks, Faissola had stated that “the banking system is confident about the outcome of further investigations,” stressing that “this is a general investigation on the whole banking system”, and part of the “check routine.” Apart from reassurance and all kinds of justifications, and without arguing whether this was deliberate or not, the monetary authorities, Consob, and ABI have clearly reported the risk of a world financial crisis too late.",1

Indeed, it is not a local or regional crisis. It is the inevitable starting point of a process which for more than 30 years has changed at its very roots the financial world, thus undermining the very bases of that liberal social order which is at the core of Western civilization. The nature of the causes of the crisis is twofold: those immediate, which speak of the specific characteristics adopted in recent times by the financial markets, and those remote, which blame aspects of the cultural matrix which accompanied the transition from industrial to financial capitalism. From the moment that epoch-making phenomenon which we call globalization began to take shape, finance not only constantly increased its quota of activity in the economic sphere, but it has also progressively contributed to transform both people’s cognitive maps and their value systems. It is to this latter that one refers today in speaking of the financialization of society. ‘Finance’, literally, is everything that has an end; if this escape from its historical riverbed, finance can only produce perverse effects. In what follows, I will briefly, for reasons of space, dwell first on the proximate causes of the crisis and then on the remote ones. I will not concern myself either with the many effects of the actual collapse that is sweeping across the world, or with the ways out of it. On both these issues, the contributions are by now lined up. My intention is not so much to add statistical-economic evidence or further descriptions of the mechanisms to the now vast, detailed literature about the subject (cf. Morris 2008; Prasad 2009; World Bank 2008; Blanchard 2008). Rather I wish to make emerge from the facts which recount the financial disaster that misleading ideology—disguised as apparently scientific—diffused by the school of economic thought, dominant today, known as mainstream economics, from which have drunk market agents, government political authorities and controlling agencies. It is an ideology which, starting from the anthropological assumption of homo oeconomicus—which is an assumption, note, and not a proven proposition—or rational egoism, comes to the conclusion, after a long journey strewn with subtle theorems and econometric investigations, that the markets, including the financial markets, are institutional setups capable of self-regulation, in the dual sense of bodies capable of giving themselves rules for their own functioning as well as of ensuring that they can be enforced. The bridge which links that assumption to such a conclusion is the ethos of efficiency, the real and proper regulative principle of post-modern society. Notwithstanding the conventional view to the contrary, efficiency is not a value-neutral concept. For it postulates Benthamite utilitarianism as an ethical precept. Whether one adopts Pareto’s ordinal version or the cardinal notion of efficiency, defined as a measure of the gap between a given result and the first best solution, utilitarian philosophy is always the frame of reference. Needless to say, there is nothing wrong in proclaiming one’s adherence to utilitarianism, provided one does not pretend to consider it as a positive instead of a normative category of discourse. It is from the pervasiveness in the present-day economic culture of the principle of efficiency that comes that ‘performative myth’ for which to say means to do, and therefore, something becomes real through the mere fact that we do it. It is this general mindset which provided the fuel for the speculative machine which was well able to make use of financial instruments and products with a ‘firepower’ never seen before. Think only of automatisms such as computerised program trading, somewhat analogous to a particle accelerator, which amplifies, in a pro-cyclical way, the rise and fall tendency of the exchange market. However, it is clear that a speculative bubble of proportions like the one we know today would not have been able to happen without that ‘mental bubble’ which made many people believe it was possible to reduce the risk to zero, whenever they might succeed in spreading it in an appropriate way among a sufficiently high number of operators. However, the risk, when it is endogenous in nature, can be moved or reduced, never annulled, as we will see. Such a sense of omnipotence, supplied over the years by financial euphoria, took over the mental habitus not only of the traders and financial institutions, but also of the political authorities, media centres, and not a few university and research circles. The self-referencing of finance—finance which becomes an end to and in itself—has meant that Plato’s maxim has been forgotten: ‘The only good coinage with which it is necessary to change all the others is phronesis, intelligence which remains on guard’. A maxim which the illustrious American economist J. K. Galbraith (date) rendered fairly prosaically thus: ‘It is good that occasionally money is separated from the imbeciles’. And it is good that this happens, because it is many innocent people who have to pay for the hybris of the imbeciles in the sense of Leon Bloy. As history teaches us, the phronos zeon, the anger of the gods which accompanies the hybris, always falls on the last and the most vulnerable, and it is simply scandalous that this can happen in societies which call themselves open and civil.",11

Frey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many economists feel that they work in the PITS. They are subjected to a publication system, which demands extremely hard work, but offers only a minute chance of success. Today, this applies in particular to young scholars who, in many countries, know that they can only obtain a permanent position at a good university if they publish in an “A-journal.”Footnote 1 A conventional list of A-journalsFootnote 2 includes The American Economic Review, Econometrica, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics, and The Review of Economic Studies. Only when a young scholar has had at least one article, preferably two or three, published in these journals, can he or she hope to procure tenure or promotion to a full professorship. A full professor is expected to have articles accepted regularly in these A-journals; otherwise, he or she is considered not up to the task. These “publish in A-journals or perish” requirements are rarely explicit or written down.Footnote 3 That they do, in fact, exist is based on the author’s recent conversations with both junior and senior scholars in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.Footnote 4
 This article argues that it is simply impossible to meet this requirement because the number of scholars trying to achieve publication in A-journals is far larger than the number of slots open for publication. In order to borrow from a famous theory, one can loosely speak of an “Impossibility Theorem” with respect to publishing requirements: For the population of aspiring academic economists, it is in general impossible to meet publishing requirements. Scholars can thus be taken to work in the PITS, i.e., in a “Publication Impossibility Theorem System”. Table 1 shows the number of slots, or the supply, available in A-journals per year. Table 1 shows that in 2007 altogether 275 articles were published in A-journals. More than 40% of those contributions were provided by scholars from the top US universities (Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale, Berkeley, and Stanford); more than 80% of all articles by scholars working in the United States. If this distribution holds in the future (and there is little reason to expect any drastic changes), an academic from any other country (out of the more than 190) in the world can expect to be in the competition for the roughly 50 remaining slots. It is extremely difficult to estimate how large the demand to publish in top economics journals is in any given year. A rough estimate is that there are around 10,000 academics actively aspiring to publish in A-journals. The true figure is probably even larger, as one single outlet, RePec, lists no less than 20,000 scholars presently creating academic writing. Even if two-thirds of them are from the United States, there are around 7,000 scholars from all other countries. However, it may safely be assumed that a considerable number are not listed in RePec, precisely because they have not yet been successful in publishing in one of the journals or other publication outlets included in RePec. What matters is that, by necessity, an extremely low share of aspiring scholars will be able to get published in an A-journal. Publication in these journals is characterized by extreme excess demand.",24

Ghazalian,W. Hartley Furtan,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The concept of home market effect (HME) describes the tendency of an industry producing differentiated products to concentrate in the larger country. This tendency is expressed through the phenomenon where an increase in relative market size of one country leads to a more than one-for-one increase in the size of production of that country (Helpman and Krugman 1985).Footnote 1 The phenomenon of HME was originally formulated in a framework that does not encompass foreign direct investment (FDI) undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs).Footnote 2 Statistical figures show that the activities of foreign affiliates of MNEs constitute a prominent aspect of the international economic landscape. For instance, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reveal that, in 2005, the value of sales of manufacturing foreign affiliates in the United States (US) amounted to 1,002 billions of US dollars while the value of sales of manufacturing US affiliates abroad reached 1,986 billions of US dollars. These figures are considerable when compared to a gross industry output in the US of 4,670 billions of US dollars in 2005. Consequently, the continuous surge in the activities of foreign affiliates of MNEs casts notable implications on the measurement of HME. The production within each country is carried out by domestic firms but also by foreign affiliates of MNEs. Accordingly, the prevalence and the extent of the location-based aspect of HME within each country in the presence of multinational activities become a subject of analysis. Also, an intriguing exercise is to examine whether HME prevails when measured through a nationality-based criterion; that is whether the increase in relative market size of one country leads to a more than one-for-one increase in the global production size by firms headquartered in that country (i.e., holding the nationality of that country). The theoretical framework of Helpman and Krugman (1985) encompasses a set of assumptions. One assumption is that each firm is equivalent to one plant and can serve the foreign market only via cross-border trade. When the FDI mode of accessing a foreign market is considered, a firm becomes equivalent to two plants located in two different countries. The consequence of relaxing this assumption has not been yet analyzed in the literature. This article contributes to the literature on HME by examining the phenomenon of HME in the presence of multinational activities. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section covers the literature review on HME. The following section presents the theoretical model. This is followed by a section that examines the prevalence and the magnitudes of the location-based HME and the nationality-based HME. The location-based HME implies that an increase in relative market size of a given country induces a more than one-for-one increase in the size of production within that country whereas the nationality-based HME implies that an increase in relative market size of a given country results in a more than one-for-one increase in the global production size of firms headquartered in that country. The fifth section presents a set of comparative statics that analyzes the implications of changes in trade and FDI barriers on the magnitude of the location-based HME and the nationality-based HME. The final section concludes.",

S. Wang,Ya-Chin Wang,Lihong Zhao,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The theory of managerial delegation pioneered by Vickers (1985), Fershtman and Judd (1987), and Sklivas (1987) (henceforth VFJS) argues that managerial contracts must specifically allow for some weight attached to dimensional variables such as sales revenue or market share, as this enhances the firm’s equilibrium profit even though the behavior of managers deviates from purely profit-maximizing objectives.Footnote 1 There has been a proliferation of studies on managerial delegation in a partial-equilibrium framework. However, none of the theoretical work on the issue of managerial delegation has been done in a general-equilibrium framework. The partial-equilibrium framework’s lack of capability to explore the concerns associated with the factor market and its subsequent effects motivates us to fill this gap. In this paper, we explore the general-equilibrium effects of managerial delegation in an oligopolistic competition. Owing to the uneven development between the urban and the rural area, many developing economies are still suffering from the unemployment problem. Harris and Todaro (1970) depict a two-sector model which incorporates urban unemployment. Corden and Findlay (1975) extend this model by allowing intersectoral capital mobility. This unemployment model since then has received considerable attention in economic research. It is evidenced by the applications of this model to imported technologies by Batra and Lahiri (1987), to the incidence of pollution control by Wang (1990), and to trade liberalization in oligopolistic competition by Chao and Yu (1997). Therefore, sector-specific unemployment is taken into consideration in this paper. Matsumura (1998) presents the objective function of a partially privatized firm in mixed duopoly. Beladi and Chao (2006) extend Matsumura’s (1998) partial privatization model to a general-equilibrium framework and examine the employment and welfare effects of partial privatization in a developing economy. In the real world, the transfer of shareholdings in the market is being viewed as the privatization method, while managerial delegation that occurs within the organization is focused on the transfer of management rights. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial delegation on outputs, factor returns and the urban unemployment ratio in a general-equilibrium model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches a two-sector, general-equilibrium model in which symmetric managerial firms are located in the urban sector, within such context we examine the effects of managerial delegation on the developing economy. In Sect. 3, the similarity and difference between managerial delegation and partial privatization are provided. Section 4 offers concluding remarks.",2
56,4,International Review of Economics,23 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-009-0068-7,The risk of falling house prices in Italy,December 2009,Tiziana Caliman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In many OECD countries house prices in real terms have been rising sharply since the mid ‘1990s. Given the important role played by the real estate sector in the recent financial crisis and the important effects of the house price bust for the economy as a whole, this paper analyses Italian house price changes at the provincialFootnote 1 level for any evidence of a speculative bubble: in particular, it will assess whether price levels are markedly higher than those compatible with fundamentals.Footnote 2
 Stiglitz (1990) defined “speculative bubble” as a continuing rise in the price of an asset sustained by the belief that the asset’s price will continue to rise, although it is already high in comparison to fundamentals. This irrational exuberance (Shiller 2005, 2008) may lead to an exponential increase in house prices to levels significantly higher than the fundamental ones. The greater the mismatch vis-à-vis the long-term trend, the more likely it is that the bubble will be followed by a sudden and sharp contraction in demand, with an associated price drop. According to the consensus view (Mayes 1979), the creation of a speculative bubble means costs for the economy both during its development phase and when the bubble actually bursts. During the expansionary phase of the bubble, the market price is too high in comparison to the correct equilibrium value and this produces distortions in the behavior of economic agents. Households invest an excessively low share of wealth in other assets. During a speculative bubble, enterprises over-allocate resources to the production of new houses and henceforth they absorb resources, also credit, which could be usefully destined to other sectors. Finally banks, as a result of increased property prices and high demand for mortgages, tend to grant an excessive number of loans to households which, secured by properties over-valued in comparison to their real value, increase the risk, in the event of customer insolvency, of a limited recovery of the capital advanced. After the bubble has burst, a sudden fall in prices may create difficulties not only for those who intended to speculate on the rise in house prices, i.e., investors, but also homebuyers. The former, who hope for profit from the capital account earnings generated by the rise in house prices, have higher debt servicing costs relating to the loan taken out to purchase the property, the sale of which would generate sharp capital account losses. Households, on the other hand, despite high property prices, may have decided to buy a house to live in for several reasons such as the high cost of rents (the rent or buy dilemma) and the low cost of money. Worsening lending conditions may cause enormous financial difficulties for households. When these difficulties lead to insolvency, the banksFootnote 3 may see mortgage repayment flows drop just when house prices have fallen to levels that do not allow them to recover all the money lent. If the situation becomes widespread, as in the case of the Japanese property crisis of the early 1990s, the effects can be long-lasting and damaging for the whole economic system. Falling consumption (due to the wealth effectFootnote 4) is generated by the difficulty of obtaining new loans as banks, in the face of defaults, adopt credit rationing policies. As a result, the economy can be thrown into a long-run depression. The US is also facing the risk of a recession in 2008. The origin of the problem goes back to the end of the property boom, which led to a sharp fall in house building levels, a slump in property prices and a credit squeeze for the sector. The US has been hit by financial crises before; however, these crises were self-contained and therefore had little effect on the real economy. The 2008 crisis is different because of the twin slumps in both the building and credit markets [Goldman (2007) estimated mortgage losses of $243 billion in their baseline scenario and $495 billion in a stress scenario while in 2008 the International Monetary Fund estimated that losses on residential mortgages could total $565 billion]. Securitized loan markets should have distributed risks throughout the world, but it appears that most of them are in the hands of the major US banks. AnalystsFootnote 5 therefore fear that balance sheet difficulties will lead to a tightening of lending to customers and to firms outside the property sector. In order to test whether such a bubble effectively exists, a comparison between current prices and estimates of the presumed equilibrium value compatible with fundamentals is necessary. If the difference is slight, the discrepancy between the two values could be put down to uncertainty in the accuracy of estimates. If there is a big difference, the danger of a speculative bubble is real. Most academic studies on the Italian Real Estate market focus on the analysis of national house price dynamics in order to evaluate the existence of a house price boom; however, house prices are inherently a local phenomenon and, therefore, national-level data may obscure important economic differences between cities. For this reason I consider the Italian house prices recorded from 1995 to 2003/2004Footnote 6 in all the 103 provinces. Even if some authors provide disaggregate information on the influence of some spatial or geographical variables on Italian house prices (see, for example, Cannari et al. 2000), no paper,Footnote 7 to the best of my knowledge, has ever considered the presence of a speculative bubble over time. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian house market exposure to a house price bust. In order to achieve this goal, first of all I will analyze trends in the four parameters (real prices,Footnote 8 the ratio of house price to income—the affordability ratio, and the price/rent ratio—the user costFootnote 9) generally used to evaluate whether house prices are in line with fundamentals. To show that these indicators (in the period 1995–2004) are not greatly misaligned with their long-run trends, a comparison with the US parameters is proposed. Secondly, the smaller Italian exposure is confirmed through an econometric model which regresses Italian house prices (across the country’s provinces from 1995 to 2003) on fundamentals. On average, the model not only explains most of the increase in house prices during the expansion phase (2000–2003), but shows how this increase is mainly justified by fundamentals. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes Italian house price parameters in comparison with the US ones. In Sect. 3 the theoretical model is described and performed, the empirical results are discussed and the model’s predictions are formulated. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper.",5

Some literature examines mixed models with price competition. For example, Bös (1984) considers income taxation and public sector pricing in an integrated control-theory model originating with the work of Mirrlees (1971) and shows that the often alleged separability between income taxation as a purely distributional instrument and public pricing as a purely allocational instrument usually does not hold. Cremer et al. (1991) examine a mixed oligopoly with horizontal differentiation and show how the presence of one or several public firms competing with private ones affects social welfare. Ogawa and Kato (2006) examine price competition in a homogenous product market under a mixed duopoly and show that the equilibrium price in the private price leadership case is higher than the one in the simultaneous case under some cost parameter conditions and always exceeds the one in the public price leadership case. Furthermore, Barcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2007) examine the issue of capacity chosen by firms in a mixed duopoly by considering that firms compete on prices and show that the public firm chooses over-capacity when products are substitutes and under-capacity when products are complements. These studies are price-setting mixed models with domestic firms and do not include foreign firms. The analysis of price-setting competition that includes foreign firms has been ignored in mixed models.Footnote 2 However, international mixed oligopolies are common in developed and developing countries as well as in former communist countries. State-owned public firms compete with foreign private firms in many industries, such as banking, life insurance, automobiles, airlines, steel, shipbuilding, and tobacco.Footnote 3
 Therefore, we examine an international mixed model in which a state-owned welfare-maximizing public firm competes on price with a foreign profit-maximizing private firm. It is shown in many studies that the state-owned firm’s reaction function is downward sloping in domestic quantity-setting mixed competition with substitute goods.Footnote 4 On the other hand, it is shown that its reaction curve is upward sloping in quantity-setting international mixed competition with substitute goods.Footnote 5 We show the slope of the state-owned firm’s reaction curve in price-setting international mixed competition with imperfect substitute goods. We examine both domestic and international mixed models with price setting. The purpose of this study is to show and compare the two equilibrium outcomes of domestic and international mixed models with price competition. In addition, we present the policy implications. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we formulate the domestic mixed model and present its equilibrium outcome. Section 3 formulates the international mixed model and presents its equilibrium outcome. Section 4 compares the two equilibrium outcomes of domestic and international mixed models. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the article.",6
57,1,International Review of Economics,16 January 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-009-0088-3,Endogenous market structures and antitrust policy,March 2010,Federico Etro,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the 1950s and 1960s, the school associated with the University of Chicago has introduced a systematic economic approach to antitrust (see Bork 1993; Posner 2001). Most scholars in this tradition have a laissez-faire view on mergers and exclusionary practices: when there are potential entrants in a given sector, mergers are mostly aimed at creating beneficial cost efficiencies, while aggressive strategies as bundling, price discrimination, and exclusive dealing are not necessarily anti-competitive, but usually have an efficiency rationale. For instance, bundling is typically used for price discrimination purposes and not for exclusionary purposes. Actually, according to the so-called single-monopoly profit theorem a monopolist in one market cannot use tying or any other practice to leverage market power in another market where entry is free. Moreover, according to a widespread view in the Chicago school, there is not such a thing as predatory pricing: the main reason is that, if the predator can sustain the initial losses needed to induce the exit of a rival, also the rival can sustain the induced losses as long as credit markets are properly working, therefore, predatory pricing would not be effective to start with (McGee 1958).
Footnote 4
 The Chicago school provided fundamental insights into many antitrust issues, but it failed to provide a complete understanding of the behavior of market leaders. In particular, it limited most of its analysis to the understanding of how monopolistic and perfectly competitive markets work, and in a few cases it focused on markets characterized by a monopolist facing a competitive fringe of potential entrants.
Footnote 5 Dismissing the useful progress in the applications of game theory, the Chicago school ignored the important role of the strategic interactions between incumbents and entrants. The consequence was that its approach to exclusionary practices has been often biased toward a competitive role of the incumbents without an updated theoretical support, and it has been neglected in practice whenever markets were characterized by imperfect competition. In the 1980s, while the Chicago school was succeeding in reducing the enforcement attitudes of US antitrust law, a (later called) post-Chicago approach started to expand its influence between economists and, in the following decade, also between antitrust scholars. This approach introduced new game theoretic tools to study complex market structures and derive sound normative implications. For instance, with reference to exclusionary practices, the post-Chicago approach has shown that in the presence of strategic commitments to undertake preliminary investments, of asymmetric information between firms (as in the celebrated model of Milgrom and Roberts 1982) or in the presence of limited forms of irrationality or credit market imperfections, then predatory pricing can be an equilibrium strategy for the incumbent, can deter entry and it can harm consumers. Similarly, it has shown that bundling can be used to strengthen price competition and exclude a rival from a secondary market (Whinston 1990). Analogously, many other strategies can have an exclusionary purpose, while mergers have typically an accommodating purpose which again hurts consumers. One should keep in mind that many of the results of the post-Chicago approach (see Tirole 1988) largely depend on a number of restrictive assumptions. For example, predatory pricing has been shown to be exclusionary under extreme circumstances, including forms of irrational behavior (in reputation models) or pervasive market imperfections, and, even when exclusion emerges under more plausible conditions, it is not necessarily associated with a pricing below cost or even with reductions in consumer welfare (in signaling models), which is what should matter for the antitrust implications. Our critique of the post-Chicago approach is not centered on its game theoretic foundation or on its specific results, but on the general applicability of these results for policy purposes. In most cases, the modern game theoretic literature in industrial organization has studied the behavior of incumbent monopolists facing a single potential entrant. To cite the most known theoretical works with strong relevance for antitrust issues, this was the case of the Dixit (1980) model of entry deterrence, of the models by Kreps and Wilson (1982) and Milgrom and Roberts (1982) of predatory pricing, by Fudenberg and Tirole (1984) on strategic investment, by Rey and Stiglitz (1988) and Bonanno and Vickers (1988) on vertical restraints, by Whinston (1990) on bundling for entry deterrence purposes, and many other subsequent works based on analysis of duopolies with an incumbent and an entrant.
Footnote 6 Also most of the standard results on the behavior of incumbents in terms of pricing, R&D investments, mergers, quality choices, and vertical and horizontal differentiation are derived in simple oligopolistic models, where the incumbent chooses its own strategies in competition with a fixed number of competitors (see Salant et al. 1983, Bulow et al. 1985, Deneckere and Davidson 1985). While this analysis simplifies the interaction between incumbents and competitors, it can be highly misleading, since it assumes away the possibility of endogenous entry, and therefore, limits its relevance to situations where the incumbent already has an exogenous amount of market power.

It is not by chance that it is two economists, and not students of another social science, who have recently chosen this statement, taken from John Donne’ Meditation XVII, as the title of a scientific paper (Aslam and Corrado 2007). Indeed the Walrasian description of society, on which so much of economic theory has been based, is precisely an archipelago of one-man islands, connected by an (unmanned) boat service for the transportation of standardised messages and the merchandises exchanged. Surely, since Walras’ times much water has flown under the bridges. In fact, not only do contemporary economic models deal with largely imperfect markets in which the parties meet face-to-face for communicating, bargaining, cheating, … Economics has also increasingly considered various forms of non-market influences: your tax evasion makes mine more likely to remain undetected; your prestigious possessions reduce the pride I take from my possessions; by observing your career choices I derive information that is useful for guiding mine; and so on. Many more examples can be found in the social interactions literature (see e.g. Durlauf and Ioannides 2010). Still, the re-socialisation of economic interactions that is under way in economics has largely left aside their truly interpersonal side. In most accounts of economic life, this crucial isthmus between individual territories is missing; so contemporary economic agents, if not islands, are still peninsulas. But what is it meant exactly, by interpersonal side of economic interaction? Answering this question is neither easy nor uncontroversial. We thus turn for help to the recent economic literature. A few novel notions—novel for economic analysis—are of interest in this regard, as each captures part of what we are searching for. We briefly present them in Sect. 2. The section ends with relational goods. This notion—one that both of us have dealt with in our research work—lends itself fairly well to be used as a catchphrase for all of the above. In Sect. 3, we focus instead on happiness, the other keyword of the title of this special issue, and on the empirical links between the two. Finally, in Sect. 4, we briefly introduce the papers contained in this special issue and outline their respective contributions.Footnote 1

On the one hand, any interpersonal relation is the product of a unique history of interactions between concrete human beings and of their memories of that history. On the other hand, interpersonal relations unfold in a socially constructed mental frame: individuals encounter each other as carriers of traits whose saliency and meaning are to a large extent socially determined. People first meet as men and women, white and black, subordinate and boss, and only after—if their communication deepens—as individualized persons. First encounters
Footnote 1 are governed by the expectations and judgements associated with the social categories—like gender, race, and occupation—that individuals perceive in their social contacts. Those judgements heavily affect the utility derived from interpersonal relations. They may determine whether a first encounter begins with a smile or with raised eyebrows, with deference or disdain, with a handshake or an erected finger. And the quality of a first encounter may determine whether the relation continues and on which track. Since social judgments carry such heavy consequences, people’s search for personal contacts as well as their efforts to avoid them, along with the resulting network of relations, depend on the prevailing stereotypes associated with social categories. This paper considers the case where people’s evaluation of social categories is a matter of choice. Based on a theory of symbolic values proposed by Corneo and Jeanne (2009, 2010), I explore the extent to which parents interested in their children’s welfare will teach them to believe in the superiority of their own nation and to despise immigrants. The model offers an explanation for the emergence of xenophobia without positing adverse economic effects of immigration for natives. Thus, it conforms well with recent empirical findings by Card et al. (2009) on the determinants of attitudes toward immigration in Europe. They find that “compositional amenities”—associated with the non-economic consequences of immigration—are substantially more important in explaining attitudes than concerns over the impacts of immigration on wages and taxes. Those amenity effects are found to be especially strong in case of less-educated natives. The model in this paper captures the idea that parents try to transmit values that serve best their children’s interest both in terms of their economic welfare and self-esteem. By stressing the importance of economic success, parents make their children more willing to exert work effort and increase the probabililty that they will eventually reach a high income level. However, economic success is uncertain, and stressing economic success carries the risk of a loss of self-esteem in case of bad luck. Teaching pride in own nation is an easy way to sustain one’s self-esteem without risk. When parents choose how much value they put on economic success and national pride, they compare the benefits that those values confer upon their children with the costs of instilling values. That trade-off turns out to hinge upon the ability of children—because higher ability increases the probability to have a high income. The model predicts that above a certain threshold, nationalism is decreasing with individual ability. Parents of high-ability children expect them to be successful with high probability; for them, it is optimal to strengthen the achievement orientation of their children thereby increasing further the probability of success and at the same time raising the probability of a high level of self-esteem. Since a heavier investment in achievement orientation increases the marginal cost of further socializing their children, parents of high-ability children optimally decrease their investment in national pride. Conversely, parents of low-ability children anticipate a low probability of economic success and prefer to instill nationalism so as to secure at least some self-esteem to their children. Analysis of this trade-off for very low levels of ability reveals that the opposite pattern—where nationalistic attitudes are increasing with ability—can also exist. In the general case, the relationship between nationalism and ability is therefore hump-shaped. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, I sketch the main ideas of the theory of symbolic values developed by Corneo and Jeanne (2009, 2010). Section 3 applies that theory to nationalism, studies the relations between natives and immigrants and shows the causal effect of ability on nationalism. In Sect. 4, the model’s prediction are confronted with empirical evidence obtained from three large representative surveys. Section 5 concludes.",7

Do not ask it to make you happy as well”. In modern rich societies, the traditional positive correlation between income and happiness seems to have disappeared: even though their income keeps rising, people do not declare themselves to be happier. This problem, which is known in literature as the “paradox of happiness”, has been thoroughly studied. One of the possible explanations is based on the observation that an income increase can sometimes entail the destruction of those relational goods on which happiness largely relies: relationships of family, friendship, love and fellowship. Modern economics cannot explain the paradox of happiness because it only takes instrumental human relations into account, which are thus regarded as a way to obtain goods suitable for the satisfaction of needs. The object of a relationship is a good, not the relationship itself. But according to this theory, as we will see, happiness largely relies on such non-instrumental, pure or genuine relations, called “relational goods”. Hence, the good is the relationship itself, for example, the relation among parents and children, friends, members of an association or a society. Modern or marginalist economics does not recognize the economic nature of non-instrumental relations, thus preventing itself from investigating happiness and explaining its paradoxes; an early theory of relational goods was formulated only in 1986 by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum. This research aims to show how, in the age of Marginalism, the most important attempt at establishing if and in which sense relational goods are economic goods is carried out by the very Austrian economists who led Robbins to write the epistemological statute of modern economic science. This paper is structured as follows. In the next section, I introduce the modern theory of relational goods. In the following sections, I reconstruct in chronological order the history of the Austrian theory of relational goods. In Sect. 3, I introduce Menger’s theory (1871), in Sect. 4, Böhm-Bawerk’s (1881) and the conclusion of both of them. In Sect. 5, Wicksteed and Robbins’s theory is presented. Here, there is a little gap in space and time. Wicksteed shows an incredible similarity to the ideas of the Austrian economists and influences Robbins’s methodology, which becomes mainstream. In the conclusions, I present my point of view on the historiographic meaning of the Austrian theory of relational goods.Footnote 1

Evidence from the United States,June 2010,Thomas DeLeire,Ariel Kalil,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The term “subjective well-being” is often used interchangeably with the more colloquial term “happiness.”Footnote 1 This construct refers to people’s cognitive and affective evaluations of their lives (Diener 2000). In principle, it is the most democratic of evaluations, as it allows each individual to decide for him or herself whether they have had a good and worthwhile life. Among valued life goals, it is the highest-ranked across many countries and among many different demographic groups (Diener 2000). Research suggests that although happiness has a strong genetic component, about 50% of the differences between people in their life happiness can be attributed to external factors (Weiss et al. 2008). While psychologists have long been interested in the external factors that correlate with subjective well-being, only relatively recently has this topic captured the attention of economists. It is perhaps not surprising that a major emphasis in economics studies is on the links between income and subjective well-being (for example, Clark and Lelkes 2005; Dehejia et al. 2007; Easterlin 1995; Layard 2005). Our paper examines the question of whether and how consumption is related to happiness using newly available data from a large nationally representative U.S. data source. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 briefly reviews the existing evidence on income and subjective well-being and outlines the main contributions of our analysis.

While social relations have been studied in economics since Smith (1759/1976), the benefit of today’s occupation with this topic is a systematic, formalized and quantitative approach. In this article, cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey (ESS) are employed to answer the question empirically whether a crowding out of relational goods by material well-being takes place in (richer and poorer) European countries and how social status is related to this phenomenon. One major point of the present analysis is the relation between happiness, relational goods and opportunity costs of time. Time opportunity costs might be crucial for the demand of relational goodsFootnote 1 as relational goods are to be produced and provided by the person or household by spending scarce time. Thus, relational goods cannot be bought on the market for money. With increasing opportunity costs of time, e.g. due to rising wage rates, relational goods will become more expensive (cf. e.g. Becchetti and Santoro 2007). Therefore, the demand for relational goods should decrease. The question is, whether there is empirical evidence for a decline of friendships and other social contacts accompanying the increase in wage rates in developed countries. Since Putnam (1995, 2000) coined the metaphor that Americans today are “bowling alone”, the empirical literature on the decrease of social activities has grown vastly. While leisure time in general has increased in the U.S. over the decades, time spent on socializing (and civic activities) has declined in the same period (Aguiar and Hurst 2007; Krueger 2007). The decline in relational goods even outweighs a parallel increase in income and is responsible for a total decrease in happiness (Bartolini et al. 2008).Footnote 2 Becchetti et al. (2006) investigate the interconnectedness of happiness and relational goods for countries worldwide with data from the World Values Survey (WVS). They show how the consumption of relational goods is related to opportunity costs of time applying one- and two-equation ordered logit estimations. The first focal point of this article is to investigate whether a similar situation can be observed for European countries using data from the ESS. Another major point of the present analysis is considerations about the relationship between happiness, relational goods and so called status goods. Status goods are affected by similar problems as relational goods as their consumption also requires leisure time. They are employed to maintain or increase one’s standing within one’s peer group or to change the peer group. To fulfil this function status goods have to be consumed in a public way, by means of conspicuous consumption (Veblen 1899/1994). The consumption of status goods, therefore, requires both the input of income to buy and leisure time to openly consume them. Sarracino (2008) analysed this phenomenon with data from the WVS. He investigates the relationship between happiness, socio-economic status and relational goods within an ordered logit framework.Footnote 3 The second focus of this article is on the analysis of these connections for European countries. The article is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, empirical testable hypotheses are presented and motivated. In Sect. 3, the empirical setup is described; while in Sect. 4, the results of the estimations are presented and discussed. Section 5 concludes.",9

Using relational goods to predict the trends of subjective well-being",June 2010,Stefano Bartolini,Ennio Bilancini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A lively discussion involving all branches of social science has been fueled in the recent past by the abundance of data concerning subjective well-being (SWB; see Layard 2005; Frey and Stutzer 2002; Ryan and Deci 2001; Kahneman and Diener 1999; Helliwell 2006; Inglehart 2009; Bruni and Porta 2007; and references therein). There is one stylized fact popularized by the so called happiness literature that has attracted the most interest: since the 1950s the well-being reported by individuals living in industrialized countries has not shown significant improvements, notwithstanding the substantial GDP growth rates that have been experienced. This fact is usually referred to as the Easterlin Paradox since it has been firstly documented in the seminal paper by Easterlin (1974). Such an evidence was classified as largely paradoxical not only because it goes against standard economic intuition, but also because the same data showed that at any given point in time people with higher incomes did report higher levels of happiness. The case of US is certainly the most representative instance of the Paradox, as well as the most intensely investigated. Indeed, the US has the longest time series of comparable data on SWB. Available evidence suggests that, during the last 50 years and more, the average American experienced a slight decline in reported happiness (Easterlin 1995; Blanchflower and Oswald 2004), with women’s unhappiness growing more than men’s (Stevenson and Wolfers 2009). This has induced the belief that the trend of SWB in the long run is substantially flat, although SWB is not insensitive to economic growth. In particular, the idea has been put forward that average SWB in a country fluctuates in the short run—generating a positive relationship between GDP growth and SWB—but in the long run it reverts to a fixed level. More precisely, when growth is faster than average then SWB grows too, while when growth is slower than average SWB decreases, so that SWB seems to revert to given level. The prevailing explanations in this regard have focused on the roles of hedonic adaptation and social comparisons. Economists in particular have argued that the dynamics of income aspirations may have offset the positive effect of rising income (e.g. Stutzer 2004). Aspirations can be linked either to the income of one’s own relevant reference group—according to the tradition emphasizing the importance of social comparisons and social status (Veblen 1899; Duesenberry 1949)—or to one’s own past income through hedonic adaptation (see Frederick and Loewenstein 1999; and references therein).Footnote 1 These two characterizations point to different psychological phenomena, which have been regarded as potential explanations (see e.g. Clark et al. 2008). The existence of the Paradox has been recently challenged by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) who provide ample evidence of a positive and significant correlation between subjective well-being and income, using both time series and cross-sectional data. However, Easterlin and Angelescu (2009) have stressed that such a correlation cannot be interpreted as a long-run relationship because Stevenson and Wolfers obtained it by pooling together both short-run and long-run observations. More precisely, Easterlin and Angelescu contend that the positive correlation found between changes in income and changes in SWB is entirely due to the inclusion of a small sample of transition countries with short time series: if data on income and SWB variations over time relative to such countries are excluded from the sample, then the Paradox re-emerges. Easterlin and Angelescu explain this result with the hypothesis that in the short run, income and SWB are positively related; while in the long run, they are unrelated. At any rate, the recent evidence about the trends of SWB suggests that they need not be flat in the long run, but they may well be increasing or decreasing (see data provided by Stevenson and Wolfers 2008; and Inglehart 2009). In the light of this, a natural research question to pose is what predicts the long-run trend of SWB. Income growth, we have seen, seems not to help much in this regard, at least as far as high income countries are concerned. In this paper, we argue that in order to improve our ability to predict SWB trends we have also to take into account the evolution of sociability, i.e. how the quality and quantity of social relationships vary over time. More precisely, we show that there is a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting that sociability is a long-run correlate of SWB. We therefore urge for more research in this direction in order to understand to what extent sociability is among the long-run determinants of SWB. We begin by discussing the available evidence about the role of sociability, as well as some possible theoretical foundations for sociability to affect SWB (Sect. 2). Next, we focus on a few recent papers by ourselves and others that, in our opinion, have shown that sociability is a promising candidate as an explanatory variable of the long-run variability of SWB. In particular, we discuss the potential of sociability as a predictor of well-being, presenting the available evidence at both the within-country and the world-wide level (Sects. 3 and 4). Finally, we conclude our discussion by assessing some open issues and offering a few suggestions for further research (Sect. 5).",24

This seems to be due to reductions in institutional funding, which have brought non-profit organizations to be responsible for services and activities which have traditionally been provided by governments. In this context, the demand for unpaid workers (Dolnicar and Randle 2007) is on the rise. This increase in the importance of volunteer work has thus led to extensive research on the topic. And most attention in the literature has been drawn to the dynamics of attracting and keeping volunteers. In order to address these issues, several studies have explored the consequences of volunteer work for volunteers themselves. Wilson and Musick (2000) examine its effects on physical and psychological well-being, Meier and Stutzer (2008) on life satisfaction and Wheeler et al. (1998) on self-esteem and happiness. However, most of these scholars have failed to establish clearly the causality between goals being achieved and the choice to start and go on with volunteering. Davis et al. (1999), however, prove that satisfaction with volunteer work itself is the main reason for involvement, both in terms of the amount of time regularly dedicated to it and continuing with it over time. This study claims that satisfaction is influenced mainly by the fulfillment of specific motivations. As monetary compensation is absent, these reasons are seen as the perceived social usefulness of the activity itself and the achievement of non economic rewards. Amongst the latter, the outcomes of social interaction within non-profit organizations have been highlighted as playing a central role, which has, however, not been successfully demonstrated so far. This article aims at filling the gap between the above theoretical statements and empirical evidence. Hence, it explores the effects on satisfaction of the relational dynamics of volunteering, i.e., relationships with different structures and contents among members of a voluntary organization. The purpose of the study is then twofold: to test whether social interaction is able to influence volunteer satisfaction and identify which benefits are most valued. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, related studies are presented and the framework in which social capital theories are assumed to be an ideal approach for investigating specific aspects of volunteer satisfaction is illustrated. In Sect. 3, the hypotheses being tested are specified and in Sect. 4.1 the methodology adopted is discussed at length. The various approaches to individual social capital and its measurement are elucidated in detail. Section 4.2 describes the survey design and the original data set used, while Sect. 5 points out the most significant results. It shows that in line with the literature, co-working ties are able to variously influence satisfaction with different aspects of volunteer work, while solidarity ties do not significantly promote satisfaction. Finally, Sect. 6 offers the conclusion.",4

Nelson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economic research projects on happiness and interpersonal relationships are making a number of exciting advances, relative to economic orthodoxy. In many cases, old dogmas are being rejected, and results from cognitive psychology, social psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and related scientific fields are enriching economists’ study of human behavior and well-being. Questions about happiness address the all-important question of why we engage in economic activity, at levels untouched by previous investigations. Research into interpersonal relations reveals issues of sociality that affect virtually all aspects of economic behavior. Disciplinary walls are being knocked down in the interest of gaining a more adequate understanding of human behavior, and outmoded habits of research from previous decades and centuries are being called into question. The traditional neoclassical model based on purely rational, purely autonomous “economic man” is being challenged at many levels. As psychologist Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues have famously pointed out, human decision-making does not follow strict rules of logic. Instead, “[T]his marvelous creation [the human cognitive system] differs in important respects from…the rational agent assumed in economic theory” (2003, p. 1454). Our decisions arise from cognitive processes developed over evolutionary time, through the development of flesh-and-blood bodies with brains and nervous systems. “Twentieth-century science,” neuroscientist Antonio Damasio has said, “left out the body…” (Damasio 1994, p. 39). Behavioral economics (using that term in a broad sense) approaches economics using evidence on what real, embodied humans being do–rather than what abstract axiom-obeying agents would do, if they existed. An empirical and experimental approach to behavior is challenging the former blind faith in deduction from first principles. Brain scans using functional Magnetic Resonancing Imagery (fMRI) or similar machines are being used to look at how different areas of the brain–often roughly categorized as specializing in analytical versus affective processes—react to experiences and participate in decision-making. The Nobel award in economics given to Kahneman for his contributions to behavioral economics was well-deserved. Happiness research, likewise, questions the idea that “economic man” is purely rational. In this field, phenomena such as felt satisfaction with life and experienced affect play a leading role (Bruni and Porta 2007). In some ways, this follows from the insights about less-than-perfect rationality: When we can no longer simply assume that choices lead to the best outcomes, we are forced to reexamine the question of what we mean by “best.” Happiness researchers make important distinctions between the outcomes of choice and the achievement of well-being or between “decision” utility and “experienced” utility (van Praag 2005). While it is, as yet, a newer and smaller field, the economics of interpersonal relations is also breaking important new ground. People are not the autonomous monads assumed in neoclassical theory, but are instead deeply social creatures. In this case too, we could appeal to recent advances in social psychology and neuroscience–such as the discovery of “mirror cells” in the brain (Iacoboni 2008)–to justify opening this new frontier in economics. In addition to being intellectually compelling, research programs in happiness economics and interpersonal relations (henceforth, “HEIR”) also have potentially important implications for how we live. In a time of recession and rapid deterioration of environmental resources, for example, the finding that we tend to be on a “hedonic treadmill” may be crucial. Could we perhaps be made better off by shifting personal and social resources away from materials-using, carbon-emitting activities and toward more relationship and intrinsic-enjoyment-intensive pursuits (Frank 2005; Pugno 2008)? Such a question cannot even be asked within the old paradigm. Once one appreciates the value of these new developments, of course, one may wonder how economists could have been blind to such phenomena for so long. One sees that orthodox theory, while conceptually simple and elegant, is consistent neither with lived experience nor with the findings of many other fields. One can also see that what currently passes for orthodoxy is itself an aberration from important, longer-running themes in economics concerning well-being and the role of emotions and sociality, going back to figures such as Jeremy Bentham and Adam Smith. New horizons for research, and new ways of understanding economic life, are opened up relative to the mainstream of economics in recent decades. The strictly neoclassical approach seems to be not so much characterized by “rigor,” as by “rigor mortis.” The news, however, is not all good. Some of the habits of thought that kept us in the old ruts have not completely disappeared. This essay uses neuroscience and feminist theory to explain how and why certain old, outdated, and damaging ways of thinking may continue to permeate much economic research–including research in HEIR–and to suggest some paths to improving the adequacy, reliability, and generalizability of our created knowledge.",

For instance, a person can be determined not to order dessert and yet, when the decision has to be made, choose to order cake and ice cream. Self-control problems are often connected to a type of behavior with negative health outcomes (such as overeating or smoking) and have been linked also to procrastination (see, e.g., Loewenstein and Prelec 1992; Frederick et al. 2002; Thaler 1981). A recurring theme from these papers is that when evaluating (distant) future outcomes, individuals demonstrate patience and attentiveness to “healthful” lifestyles by making plans, for example, to go to the gym, to stop smoking and to work to obtain a better job. As the future draws nearer, however, individuals engage in binge eating and drinking behavior, choose to light another (last) cigarette and make little effort to change their job. In parallel, a substantial literature in psychology ties self-control problems to willpower. In particular, psychologists have observed that self-control appears to be vulnerable to deterioration over time from repeated exertions, in the same way that a muscle becomes fatigued from repeated use. In this sense, willpower can be thought of as the energy used to control one’s impulses, and willpower depletion can thus leave individuals more likely to succumb to temptations such as procrastination. Recently, this characterization of willpower has found support in a large number of experiments (see, e.g., Vohs and Heatherton 2000; Baumeister et al. 1994; Baumeister and Vohs 2003; Vohs and Faber 2007; Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999; Hinson et al. 2003). For social scientists in general, this characterization of willpower suggests paths for new research on how to improve individuals’ willpower and avoid willpower exertion. For economists in particular, investigating the willpower process might shed important new light on time-inconsistent economic decision making. In this regard, it is crucial to understand how willpower develops from childhood to adulthood. Indeed, measures of willpower for the child may provide useful insights into the nature of willpower, and these may also be reliable predictors of economic outcomes in the adult. In this respect, Mischel and Metzner (1962) and Mischel and Mischel (1983) found evidence that the ability to delay gratification and resist temptation is positively related to age: as children grow older they become more skilled in self-control, and also increasingly discover how to employ self-control strategies to overcome temptations. The idea that willpower is a limited resource that can be trained but also exhausted has important economic consequences. The knowledge that self-control activity requires energy, and that this energy depletion can affect individuals’ behavior in other domains, might affect policy and institution design in all those fields where self-control problems are present. Moreover, ignoring this evidence may produce ineffective policies. For instance, ego depletion is assumed to underpin overeating by dieters (Vohs and Heatherton 2000), prejudicial responding (Richeson and Shelton 2003), underachievement in intellectual pursuits (Schmeichel et al. 2003), inappropriate sexual responses (Gailliot and Baumeister 2007), and impulsive overspending (Vohs and Faber 2007). Being unable to provide willpower effort in these activities may preclude one from achieving a desirable goal. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first review the existing literature on willpower, self-control problems and temptation and we cite initial attempts to model and test these behaviors in economics (Sect. 2). We then argue that it is important to understand the nature of willpower and its development in order to anticipate and prevent self-control problems that can lead to time-inconsistent decision making. Specifically, we concentrate our attention on the relationship between willpower and child development (Sect. 3), and willpower, child development and productivity (Sect. 4). Finally, we draw attention to a set of open questions that could be profitably addressed by future research (Sect. 5).",16

Government deficit, respectively, debt sustainability had become also a matter of theoretical concern several years ago (Chalk 2000; Rankin and Roffia 2003). While in the infinitely lived agent literature fiscal policy was regarded as unsustainable if government’s intertemporal budget constraint is violated (e.g., Blanchard et al. 1990), in Diamond (1965)-type overlapping generations (OLG) models is now being considered “that, even with a constant stock of government debt, fiscal policy may be unsustainable because a steady state of the economy with non-degenerate values of the variables may not exist” (Rankin and Roffia 2003, p. 218; italics in original).Footnote 1 The private capital labor ratio (aggregate capital intensity) associated with this unsustainable government debt level is called an ‘interior maximum’ in contrast to a ‘degeneracy’ in which the capital intensity approaches zero as a consequence of an excessively high government debt level. Rankin and Roffia (2003) find in their log-linear, Cobb–Douglas version of Diamond’s (1965) OLG model that “maximum sustainable debt is generally reached at an interior maximum rather than at a degeneracy” (Rankin and Roffia 2003, p. 220). Rankin and Roffia’s (2003) contribution, although invaluable, is, however, restricted to a closed (or small open) economy setting which precludes the analysis of sustainable government debt in large, open, interdependent economies. At the present stage of international integration dramatically rising government deficits in large open advanced countries make it imperative to explore both limits for national government debt levels in an intertemporal equilibrium under perfect foresight of rational agents and the effects of government debt expansion below those limits on private capital accumulation (economic growth) and international competitiveness as measured by the (external) terms of trade. To the best of these authors’ knowledge limits for government debt in open, interdependent economies have so far not been investigated at all. Although government debt effects on capital accumulation and terms of trade have been dealt with in the established literature (Feldstein 1986; Frenkel and Razin 1986; Zee 1987; Lin 1994), neither the role of maximum sustainable debt for the existence, dynamic stability, and comparative dynamics of steady states has been treated nor the ambiguity of the terms of trade effects of government debt has been resolved. Zee (1987) finds that the terms of trade of the more indebted country deteriorate (improve) if this country is a net foreign debtor (creditor), whereas according to Lin (1994) the terms of trade effect of government debt is independent of the net foreign asset position, and depends only on international differences with respect to production technologies. To close both of these research gaps, we extend Rankin and Roffia’s (2003) closed economy OLG model into a two-good, two-country setting with exogenous growth.Footnote 2 To lend empirical support to the two-country setting, we let one country in the model depict the collection of net foreign creditor countries in reality while the other model country represents the net foreign debtor countries as a whole.Footnote 3 Since both collections of countries comprise advanced and developing countries, respectively, we assume for simplicity that each model country represents an average of more and less developed countries in reality which can be characterized by identical preferences and similar production technologies.Footnote 4
 Given this model setting, we first ask the following questions regarding maximum sustainable debtFootnote 5: Do maximum sustainable government debt levels in both countries always exist? What happens when these limits for sustainable government debt are reached? Are the national limits interdependent and which common factors determine the national debt limits? One main finding is that a world maximum sustainable government debt level (a weighted average of domestic and foreign debt) always exists and is reached at an interior maximum as in Rankin and Roffia’s closed economy. Second, given these limits it is still not clear which role maximum government debt levels play with respect to the existence and characteristics of non-trivial steady state solutions for private capital intensities and with respect to the terms of trade between both countries. Extending Ono’s (2002) existence analysis in a closed economy OLG model into our two-country setting, we will see that the magnitude of an appropriately weighted average of domestic and foreign government debt levels relative to the corresponding average of maximal debt levels is decisive for the existence of a unique or multiple non-trivial steady states for capital intensities. Third, multiple steady state solutions necessitate dynamic stability analysis. From the two approaches to dynamic stability of steady states found in the literature (Gandolfo 1997, p. 334) we adopt that approach which investigates sufficiency conditions regarding preferences, technologies, and policy parameters for dynamic stability.Footnote 6 To highlight the differences regarding dynamic stability between closed and large open economies, we compare (existence and) dynamic stability of steady statesFootnote 7 in autarky to a world market equilibrium in our two-country model, and find only saddle-path stability of the steady state with the higher capital intensities.Footnote 8
 Using the conditions for saddle-path stability of the larger steady state, we reexamine the steady state effects of a unilateral expansion of government debt on terms of trade and domestic and foreign capital intensities. While confirming established OLG wisdom that a unilateral expansion of government debt crowds out private capital in both countries, we do not find that the terms of trade effect depends on the net foreign asset position of the more indebted country. Finally, it is also of interest to know whether the terms of trade along the transition path towards the new steady state also are independent of the net foreign asset position. Here Zee (1987, p. 611) claims that an unexpected expansion of government debt does not impact on the terms of trade in the shock period while their adaptation thereafter depends on the net foreign asset position of the more indebted country.Footnote 9 By thoroughly analyzing the transitional dynamics of terms of trade and capital intensities for similar technologies and calculating the transition path numerically for dissimilar technologies, we are essentially able to qualitatively confirm the steady state results. The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, the existence of non-trivial steady states and the asymptotic stability of one steady state solution in the autarky equilibrium of our two-good, two-country OLG economy are shown. Section 3 presents the world market equilibrium. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of maximum sustainable government debt and to the investigation of the existence of steady state solutions for private capital intensities under government debt levels below maximum. In Section 5 we are concerned with the dynamic stability of the steady state solutions and the comparative steady state effects of shocks in sustainable government debt levels. Section 6 is devoted to closed-form solutions of the transitional dynamics towards the steady state under similar technologies and to a numerical calculation of economic transition under dissimilar technologies. Section 7 summarizes and concludes.",15

Kamerschen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We examine empirically the link of the governance structure of state university systems to the ratio of out-of-state to in-state tuition. We submit that the more centralized the governance of a state university system, the less dependent it will be on tuition and the more aligned it will be with the interests of the state government. This means that (1) universities with centralized governance can afford to offer in-state students a lower price relative to out-of-state students, and (2) they are motivated to do this because that serves the state’s interest, which is primarily to educate in-state students, who are most likely to remain in-state, generating future tax income for the state. In short, the more centralized the governance, the higher the predicted ratio of out-of-state to in-state tuition. Public institutions of higher education (IHEs) have long been known to charge different tuition to different students; in-state students pay lower tuition than their out-of-state classmates. The advertised “sticker” price is differentiated between these two groups of students, while need-based and merit-based financial aids are applied to that price to reduce the cost to each student. The reasons for this differential are straightforward. The state has an incentive to subsidize higher education to produce a higher-earning workforce which will generate increased tax revenue. An individual institution has an incentive to attract more in-state students because college students who graduate in a particular state are more likely to reside in that state after graduation. Alumni living near their alma mater are more likely to provide donations through return trips to campus and to respond more favorably and generously to fundraising campaigns. While these reasons are intuitively appealing and well addressed in the literature, we explore another determinant to this pricing differentiation that provides some additional insights into the pricing behavior and market structure of public IHEs. The governing structure of the state’s higher education industry is important for institutional pricing and horizontal and vertical differentiation of the state’s institutions. For 4-year IHEs, we find institutions operating under a consolidated governing board structure (i.e., the most centralized) have the lowest average in-state tuition and engage in the highest level of price discrimination. Institutions operating under a more decentralized governing board structure have higher average in-state tuition and engage in less price discrimination. In addition, as the governing structure becomes more centralized, the governing body has a greater incentive to control the vertical and horizontal differentiation of the institutions within the state. It will maintain differences between the institutions in order to more closely satisfy the educational demands of the state government. We find institutions in states that adopt a more centralized governing structure are less homogeneous. The data reveal that the percentage of duplicate degrees in an educational field decreases as the governing structure becomes more centralized. This means there is less overlap in a state with a centralized governing structure as the institutions are not competing as aggressively for students for a particular degree program. This paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 defines different kinds of governing structures and discusses previous studies. Section 3 presents a hypothesis of the impact of governance on the higher education market structure. Section 4 develops the argument that the pricing differentiation between in-state and out-of-state students is price discrimination, while Sect. 5 identifies reasons for such price discrimination. Section 6 constructs a theoretical model for nonprofit, public institutions and presents hypotheses for pricing behavior. Section 7 introduces the econometric model and data to test, explain, and analyze pricing behavior. Section 8 provides the results and Sect. 9 offers some concluding thoughts.",7

In this sense, one of the preoccupations of society and international organizations, such as International Monetary Fund and World Bank (2007), is to fight corruption in the public sphere. This type of corruption is considered harmful to economic development, especially of less developed countries. The corruption phenomenon in the public sector, according to Jain (2001), can be defined as the wrong use of discretionary power for personal gain by “bureaucrats” (agents) employed in the government. These agents (politicians, public managers, police officers, inspectors, tax collectors, etc.) perform diverse functions in the public sector. A common characteristic to all these agents is that their jobs give them the opportunity to obtain economic advantages using their position of authority. Despite the widespread acceptance of the perverse effect of corruption on economic growth, there are relatively few theoretical works that analyze corruption in a dynamic context.Footnote 1 The exceptions include Ehrlich and Lui (1999), Sarte (2000), and, more recently, Blackburn et al. (2006), Powell (2006) and Djumashev (2007). All these works use the neoclassical growth structure to analyze corruption, i.e., models in the Ramsey–Cass–Koopman tradition with convex production functions. For the non-convex production functions case, Dimaria and Le Van (2002) analyze the debt, corruption and R&D in a dynamic model with discrete time. All these works recognize that corruption adversely affects economic growth. It is worth to mention that there are works that suggest a positive relationship between corruption and economic growth, and others in which the authors argue that this relationship is not clear. Leff (1964), for example, argues that in developing and transitional economies, government operations are often entangled with corruption that can reduce bureaucracy and be beneficial for growth. As Lui (1996) that considers the corruption as an optimal response to market distortions that reduces the burden of regulations and improves efficiency. Mauro (1995), in turn, does not find a clear relationship between corruption and economic growth. The corruption phenomenon has also been analyzed in other contexts. Rivera-Baitiz (2002), for example, analyzes corruption by the introduction of officials that impose a tax on the profits made by firms engaged in innovation. Barreto and Alm (2003) investigate the corruption effects on the optimal size of government; their results indicate that the optimal size of government balances between the desire of the corrupt public sector for a larger government and so more opportunities for corruption, and those in the private sector who prefer a smaller government. Not surprisingly, the optimal size of government is smaller in an economy with corruption than in one without corruption. In this study, we analyze theoretically the corruption problem of bureaucrats in a neoclassical growth model (Ramsey model) using a non-convex production function. The approach we use differs from those of Powell (2006) and Blackburn et al. (2006), since they utilize a traditional convex production function. We assume that the economic agents live infinitely, which differs from other works that use non-convex production functions in overlapping generations models, such as Dimaria and Le Van (2002). Another difference of this study in relation to Dimaria and Le Van (2002) is that these authors consider that the bureaucrats’ illicit earnings from corruption come from international aid and we consider that these illicit earnings come from public resources and are used by corrupt bureaucrats to finance their confidential consumption. It is worth noticing that the analysis of optimal growth paths with non-convex production functions makes it possible more generality and provides better approximation to the economic reality, mainly of less developed countries. Skiba (1978), for example, asserts that, for less developed economies or those countries that present high capital/labor ratio, production functions are better represented by non-convex structures. Empirical studies (see, for example, De la Croix and Delavellade 2006) also show that the corruption phenomenon is more widespread in less developing economies than in developed countries. The starting point of this study was the optimization models with non-convex production functions as described in Chichilnisky (1981) and Skiba (1978) and the neoclassical growth models as presented in Barro (1990) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2005). In the next sections of this study, we present the model and discuss its main implications.",

Marshall once said that “the Mecca of the economist lies in economic biology”, and Georgescu-Roegen paraphrases him by saying that “biology, not mechanics, is our Mecca”. The concept of evolution, for instance, is often applied by economists of the same idea as Marshall and Georgescu-Roegen. Sometimes biology is not directly mentioned by economists even if they use tools belonging to that field. Let us consider the huge number of applications of the Lotka–Volterra equations in explaining endogenous fluctuations of economic variables. The most famous economic application of the Lotka–Volterra equations is Goodwin (1967), who applied them in a well-known growth model.
Footnote 1
 Recently, from the criticisms of prestigious scientists (among others Amos Tversky and the Nobel laureates Herbert Simon, Daniel Kahneman
Footnote 2), the neoclassical hypothesis of representative agent has become less and less defensible, especially after its failure in preventing and explaining the recent financial crisis. The removal of this unrealistic hypothesis opens a door to the application in economics of further concepts and instruments typical of other fields, one of them is biology. In fact, if you make the more realistic assumption that the economy is made up of people, families, firms, etc. that are in general heterogeneous, then it becomes possible to take into consideration how the different typologies of agents interact. In fact, heterogeneous agents can influence each other, can have different levels of knowledge about their environment, can use (or not use) different learning mechanisms to improve their satisfaction, and so on. The study of how one element of a group influences, and is influenced by, the elements of the other groups is quite standard in biology, so economists may turn to the toolkit of biologists to explain some behavior of groups of agents. For example, Kirman (1993) has shown that the behavior of humans in particular economically relevant situations resembles the behavior of ants that follow (i.e. imitate) the others in searching for food. In this paper, we adopt another instrument typical of other disciplines, biology in particular. We talk about the compartmental approach. In fact, there exists an alternative way between the assumption of the unique representative agent and the assumption of high degree of heterogeneity among individuals that give rise to models with a high number of dimensions. This alternative consists in aggregating agents in (meso)groups characterized by some common feature that the members of the same group share. The partial aggregation will be useful if it is reasonable to think that the characteristic feature of the groups is relevant in the economic situation we are analyzing (i.e. the groups behave differently) and the differences among the members of the same group can be deleted, making admissible the assumption of representative agents of the single group or compartment. Examples are groups of consumers of the same age or belonging to the same social class (in whatever way you define it). Looking at the supply side of the market, firms can be subdivided, for instance, by size. The latter case is the one considered in this paper. A compartmental analysis consists in specifying how the number of members of each compartment changes from period to period and from where (i.e. from which compartment) new members come and to where (i.e. toward which compartment) the exiting members are directed. This means that the modeler has at least to specify one dynamic equation for each possible (i.e. admissible) flow. Compartmental models are widely used in other fields. Let us consider, for example, epidemiology. Since the classic work by Kermack and McKendrick (1927), there are a lot of models in which a fixed population is subdivided into compartments, for instance the compartments of Susceptible, Infected, and Removed. Through compartmental analysis, it is possible to characterize flows, which have a precise epidemiology meaning. The flow from Susceptible to Infected, for example, would be influenced by disease aggressiveness, while the flow from Infected to Removed would depend on the mortality of the disease, and so on. Other examples come from medicine, ecology, chemistry, and pharmacokinetics. There are not, however, so many applications in economic literature. Among these works, we can not forget those of the Nobel laureate Gary Becker. Even if he does not use the word “compartment”, what he does in his works is subdividing people into groups and analyzing the causes of the flows and the sizes of the groups. By subdividing population into criminals and not criminals, he is able to analyze the instruments that permit the deceleration of the flow from the latter class to the former by increasing, for instance, the costs of being a criminal (probability of arrest, severity of punishment, etc.; Becker 1968). He also gives a contribution to the study of the composition of families by subdividing people into single, married, and divorced and by performing a benefits/costs analysis of being in a group or in another (or by moving from one group to another; Becker 1973, 1974). After Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) created a bridge between game theory and economics, the concept of evolutionary game, first applied by John Maynard Smith in studying evolution, began to spread among economists and is now widely used. Evolutionary games are characterized, roughly speaking, by a finite number of classes of agents, and the model explores how the share of the population in each class changes according to some rules.
Footnote 3 Financial markets models in which agents are subdivided into classes according to the behavioral rules they adopt (for instance, chartists and fundamentalists) have permitted to replicate some stylized facts like bubbles and crashes and the persistence of the deviation of prices with respect to the fundamentals (see Hommes (2006) for a survey on this branch of research). Similar models also permit to generate business cycles. Probably, the closest approach is the one of Aoki (1996, 2001). What Aoki calls clusters are conceptually similar to compartments. The main difference consists in the stochastic point of view taken by Aoki that leads to the introduction of quite interesting but also complicated tools like the theory of Markov processes and the Master Equation. The compartmental approach, instead, permits us to build a model described by a completely deterministic system of dynamic equation and to use more simple mathematical instruments. The present paper moves from a work by Bischi et al. (1998) in which the authors subdivide the population of firms into compartments according to their size. Flows of firms from a compartment to another one are determined by the performance of the representative firm of each compartment. A particular compartment is the “out of the market” one, from which new firms come out and to which firms may permanently go. In fact, firms go bankruptcy whenever they become unable to repay the banks for the loans they received. They proved how an exogenous shock may have different consequences on the compartments. We take the same model but use it for a different purpose. We want to show that a compartmental approach can be a good way for the government to operate in order to reach a goal as cost-efficiently as possible. In particular, we analyze what happens in the case in which the fiscal policy authority uses the compartmental structure of the firms in order to avoid bad situations like the exit of the small firms from the market. Some advices on the timing of the intervention are also given. In Sect. 2, we introduce the economic model with a representative firm. Section 3 describes how the compartmental approach can be used if we admit heterogeneity among the firms. In Sect. 4, fiscal policy is introduced, and Sect. 5 concludes.",6

In fact, education endows individuals with the means to improve their skills, knowledge, health, productivity, and so on but also enhances the economy’s ability to develop and adopt new technology for the purpose of economic and socio-political development (Sianesi and Van Reenen 2003). Theoretically as well as empirically, various models have been developed and studies conducted in order to demonstrate the significant relationship existing between education and economic growth and/or development (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004). Growth theories have traced the link between education and growth through the concept of labor productivity. However, it is necessary to understand and see the reasons underlying the firms’ requirement for higher labor productivity in the production process. As in Prokopenko (1987), it is assumed that higher labor productivities are necessary because, among other factors, consumers’ demands have become diversified and complexities have increased, suggesting the need for high-skilled workers to be able to do more complex jobs during the production process. Consequently, in order to fulfill the demands, enterprises need to hire more skilled workers because the appropriate jobs have become more complex. The concept of job complexity, although more or less extensively used, has attracted the attention of a number of labor economists in the sense that, among other factors (such as age, experience, firm size, etc.), it is considered as an important element explaining the earnings’ differentials among workers. For example, van Ophem et al. (1993) show empirically that the higher the job level, the more individuals want to be compensated for further increasing complexity, suggesting that workers as well as firms’ characteristics intervene in the determination of the wage rates. In addition, Pekkarinen (2002) also shows that differences in jobs’ complexity level explain the inter-firm wage differentials in the Finnish metal industry. From the literature (van Ophem et al. 1993; Pekkarinen 2002), it can be understood that the previous studies attempt to answer the following question: “what do workers expect from the firms in terms of compensation when jobs are becoming more complex?” Interestingly, it would be also logical to see “what firms are expecting from workers when jobs are becoming increasingly complex”. The answer to this last query is to be found in workers’ education level. In that sense, Teulings and van Rens (2008) find that, during the production process, better skilled workers are assigned to more complex jobs, suggesting that it is the jobs complexity, among other potential reasons, that explain the requirement of the enterprises for better educated workers. The results of their theoretical model have shown that, ceteris paribus, a one-unit increase in the job complexity level requires one-unit increase in the education level of the workers. This paper is a generalization of Teulings and van Rens (2008). In fact, the results show that not only jobs’ complexity affects the decision of firms to hire and assign workers with higher education levels to more complex jobs (as in Teulings and van Rens 2008), the elasticity of substitution between workers types intervene also as a smoothing factor influencing the relationship. In fact, during the process of production, higher values of the elasticity of substitution (tending to 1) dampen the significant role of the job complexity levels as a determinant of the education levels. In short, the strength of the link between job complexity and education levels is greatly influenced by the value given to the elasticity of substitution. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The second section defines the main concepts and presents the main assumptions underlying the theoretical model. The third section introduces the basic model, which is based on Teulings and van Rens (2008). The fourth section gives the solution of the model showing the relationship between education and job complexity levels. The last section concludes.",
57,4,International Review of Economics,24 October 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-010-0107-4,"Economic growth, Koestler cycles and the lock chamber effect",December 2010,Alessandro Vaglio,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, I propose a dynamic model of the relationship among economic growth, complexity, “maturity” of the population, and propensity to contribute to the stock of a public good. Economic growth is represented as a process that exogenously generates technical innovations: these increase labor productivity, the capital/labour ratio and the division of labor. At each innovation, the social structure changes and becomes more complex, since population is fractioned into an increasing number of groups, corresponding to increased division of labor. The individual benefit from contributing to the public good depends by the structure of interdependence among these social groups. At each time, these interdependencies are given and change exogenously with technical progress. Information about the new structure can only be gathered at a cost, so that in general, knowledge of the “true” structure lags behind the changes of the structure itself. Other things being equal, individuals tend to contribute less to the public good the more uncertain is their knowledge of the interdependence structure. Then increased complexity leads to a reduced “collective” effort. The model is a simple general equilibrium model, whose evolution over time is analyzed by means of a computable model, in the system dynamics tradition (Forrester 1975). Since the stimulus to write this paper came, in a rather unusual way, from a celebrated novel, namely, Arthur Koestler’s “Darkness at Noon” (first published in 1940) I defined as “Koestler cycles” the cyclical movements generated by the model. Koestler wrote “Darkness at Noon” between 1938 and 1940. As the author writes in an introductory note, the life of the novel’s main character, Rubashov, is “a synthesis of the lives of a number of men who where victims of the so-called Moscow Trials”. The novel describes in a masterful way the complex tangle of physical and psychological pressure, sense of guilt, self-persuasion and strategic lying who led many oppositors of Stalin’s rule to plead guilty of crimes which they never committed, in the sinister show-trials in the Thirties. It is against this background of fear, moral and intellectual disruption and impending danger (Rubashov is in jail, falsely accused of a plot to murder Stalin) that Koestler imagines his “hero” writing an essay about what he calls “the theory of the relative maturity of the masses”. The relevant passage is the following one: The maturity of the masses lies in the capacity to recognize their own interests.This, however, pre-supposes a certain understanding of the process of production and distribution of goods.(...) Now, every technical improvement creates a new complication to the economic apparatus, causes the appearance of new factors and combinations, which the masses cannot penetrate for a time. Every jump of technical progress leaves the intellectual development of the masses a step behind, and thus causes a fall in the political maturity thermometer. It takes sometimes tens of years, sometimes generations, for a people’s level of understanding to adapt itself to the changed state of affairs, until it has recovered the same capacity for self government as it had already possessed at a lower stage of civilization: Hence, the political maturity of the masses cannot be measured by an absolute figure, but only relatively, i.e. in proportion to the stage of civilization at that moment.(...) This process might be compared to the lifting of a ship through a lock with several chambers.When it first enters a lock chamber, the ship is at a low level relative to the capacity of the chamber; it is slowly lifted up until the water level reaches its highest point. But this grandeur is illusory, the next lock chamber is higher still, the leveling process has to start again. The implication which Rubashov draws from his theory is that, as long as masses are not mature enough, they should be guided by èlites or dictators who, according to another passage: (...) are damned always to do what it is most repugnant [to them]: to become a slaughterer, in order to abolish slaughtering, to sacrifice lambs so that no more lambs may be sacrificed, to whip people with knouts so that they may learn not to let themselves be whipped (...) On the other hand, as the masses become mature enough, dictators and èlites become superfluous and democratic institutions can work properly. However,in principle, further changes in technology and in the structure of society might make dictatorship necessary again in the future. Given the historical and narrative framework just mentioned, it is clear that Rubashov’s essay is anything but an impartial, academic investigation: after all, Rubashov is making the ambiguous effort of building an apologetics of Stalin’s totalitarian rule. At the same time Rubashov stresses its historically transitory nature, with the immediate aim of persuading his prosecutors of his innocency, and the longer-term purpose of continuing his struggle against the dictator (and yet Rubashov still looks partly fascinated, at least at times, by the tyrant’s determination and ruthlessness, an ambiguity which adds to the fascination of the novel). In writing this paper, my point is that, despite the previous remark, the “lock chamber” hypothesis is a stimulating suggestion that deserves some further inquiry. On the contrary, I am not interested here in discussing Rubashov’s ambiguous defense of dictatorship, which I do not share, first of all on political and ethical grounds. Moreover, such defense looks , in the novel’s formulation, extremely weak from the intellectual viewpoint, so that a detailed analysis would be rather superfluous. One last remark is required about the ambiguity of the relationship between the author (Koestler) and his literary creature (Rubashov). As it often happens with novels, it is not always easy to distinguish what Koestler thinks from the thoughts he attributes exclusively to Rubashov. My impression, for instance , is that while the defence of dictatorship is certainly exclusively Rubashov’s, Koestler supports the lock chamber theory. In the present context, I shall attribute theories,thoughts, etc. to a mixed character called Rubashov–Koestler (R–K) when I think that they agree ; while I shall credit to Rubashov those ideas that, in my opinion, the author attributes to him without sharing them. I leave to literature scholars to judge whether or not I am right in making these attributions. Arthur Koestler (1905–1983) was not an economist nor a professional historian.
Footnote 1 In his youth, he studied science and psychology (both interests show in the novel); in 1938, at the time he began writing “Darkness at Noon” he had worked in a kibbutz in Palestine, had been a journalist in France, a Communist agent in the Spanish Civil War, where he had been captured by Franco’s police and sentenced to death; the novel was written while the author was in an internment camp in France as an undésirable foreigner. From 1940, he lived in the UK. His intellectual interests included, at different stages, psychology , science and history, alongside with active participation to political debates of the Cold War era and to campaigns against death penalty. As a result of this multifaceted intellectual background, some of the ideas exposed in the fictitious essay written by R–K are deeply rooted in the political economy, political science and sociological tradition. The first root is the issue of paternalism, which has been continuously surfacing in the history of economic development. By “paternalism”, in this paper, I mean the view according to which some degree of supposedly benevolent authoritarianism might be instrumental to economic development, at least until people are “mature” enough for freedom. As such, here paternalism must not be understood as a relatively mild form of political domination, as opposed to outright tyranny, but rather as an argument supporting and justifying even very oppressive forms of government, such as the one Koestler was so effectively describing. The idea that a forward-looking, energetic and occasionally ruthless leader (or élite) might push an otherwise reluctant population through the doors of a Golden Age to come, fills the history of the making of modern Russia from Peter the Great to Stalin (Raeff 1982). In other, less authoritarian contexts (like Bismarck’s “revolution from above”) a policy of partial, controlled concessions to modernity represents, in the mind (or in the propaganda) of those leading the process, a wise way of reaping the benefits of modernity without the masses being lured into new ideas which “immature” minds might misunderstand. Even recent developments in formerly planned economies suggest that, according to the political élite in those countries economic development should take place under the stern careful eye of a benevolent watchman. A radical critique of the paternalist view is proposed by Sen (1985): in a perspective of “development-as-freedom” , paternalism is undefendable: paternalism cannot be instrumental to development, since it is itself the negation of development. In Sen’s view, a society is developing if its members experience an expansion in their substantive freedoms and in their “capabilities (...) to lead the kind of lives they value -and have reason to value” (Sen 1999). The opposition between the paternalist view and the “development-as-freedom” view is mirrored in the distinction between commodities and capabilities (Sen 1985): while a benevolent dictator might well want to provide his subjects with commodities (like Dostoevskij’ s Grand Inquisitor), he will be much less willing to develop their capabilities, especially those enabling people to inquire and criticize those in power. The second root is the search for a theory of the economic and social origins of democracy and dictatorship. This theme has been the object of socio-economic research over the last few decades: the two books by Barrington Moore (1966) and by Acemoglu-Robinson (2006) witness of a prolonged effort to improve our understanding of these phenomena by subtracting them to the exclusive realm of political history and political science. R–K theory owes much, at least in my opinion, to Durkheim’s “De la division du travail social” (1893/1960). In his celebrated book, Durkheim stressed the connection between the increasing division of labor and the breakdown of “mechanical” solidarity and its replacement with “organic” solidarity. On his side, R–K establishes a connection between economic growth and complexity: the “new factors and combinations” which technological advances bring with themselves lead to an increased division of labor. Complexity is an externality associated with growth, not unlike pollution or public good congestion. More precisely, it makes it more difficult to take the correct decisions both at an individual level and at the level of collective choices. Even if one (as I do) rejects the paternalistic conclusion by Rubashov, the problem is nevertheless relevant. As Nussbaum (1995) puts it, “Being able to live for and to others; to recognize and show concern for other human beings; to engage in various forms of social interaction;” is an attribute of a fully human life, and as such a goal to pursue. R–K emphasizes the lack of “understanding” as the explanation for the breakdown in solidarity: without a clearer understanding of the social process, according to R–K, individual cannot take part in a collective effort, even if this would be beneficial to all. Again, here one must distinguish between the requirements of the Stalinist rethoric (the obsessive opposition between (virtuous) collective effort and (evil) private goals) which Rubashov is eager to meet for “strategical” reasons, and the legitimate issue of social cohesion. As a third root, R–K suggests the existence of a cycle (more precisely “a swing” as it is defined elsewhere in the book) generated by a problematic relationship between institutions and the economy. Interrelations between economic trends and cycles on the one hand and cycles in the political environment are one of the most studied subjects (see for example Alesina et al. 1997). The specificity of Koestler cycles is their very long run nature (the tens of years, sometimes generations of the passage quoted above) and the stress on influences running from economic development to political variables, rather than the other way around. Needless to say, the representation of the cycle provided by R–K is far from a theory of the cycle as it is normally meant. Just to cite two weaknesses , it is not clear what happens between turning points, i.e. the process by which people slowly “catch up” with complexity and fall behind in “maturity” when discrete changes occur in technology and social structure. If at all, R–K concentrates on the “downward” movement from consciousness and freedom toward immaturity and despotism,rather than on the upswing, when paternalism is replaced by increased maturity and freedom. Moreover, R–K’s model leaves undiscussed the problem of how democracy replaces despotism and viceversa (which is instead one of the central points of Acemoglu-Robinson (2006) book). These flaws stimulated me to try and make some of R–K’s intuition clearer, to specify an economic model generating the “swings” and to concentrate on the factors that enhance or hamper the growth of “maturity”,and therefore make the cycle possible, and influence its length and amplitude.",1

Sweidan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The most agreed upon proposition in the modern monetary economics is that policy rules have greater advantage over discretion in improving economic performance. There are strong benefits when the actions of the central bank are easily understood and predictable by the private sector. Under discretion, the policymaker could always deviate to satisfy some short-run objective, time inconsistency. Hence, it would be harder for individuals to form expectations about policy decisions in the future. Barro and Gordon (1983) find that, under discretion, the monetary policymaker picks a rate of money growth that is high, and as a result, inflation rates become high as well. The historical record of conducting monetary policy in the US economy illustrates that the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) has switched its operating targets many times. In the early 1990s, the Fed shifts to using the federal fund target as a monetary policy instrument. The question was how we should choose the policy rate. Taylor (1993) has come up with an answer. His reaction function is known as Taylor’s rule. Taylor succeeds in presenting an accurate model with a precise numerical estimation of the relationship between the federal fund rate and both inflation rate and output gap. The rule can be used to test the commitment of the monetary authority to achieve its main goals: macroeconomic stability and low inflation rate. During the last two decades, central banking has experienced considerable changes toward improving the performance of monetary policy. The recent pattern in monetary policy is to have independent, transparent, credible central banks and effective monetary policy. Despite that, the global economic and financial crises open an important question about the ability of central banks to control the economy and to achieve its targeted inflation rate. In a recent study, Taylor (2008) provides empirical evidence which shows that easy monetary policy, which is adopted by the Federal Reserve Bank, caused prolonged and worsened the financial crisis of 2008. Taylor (2008) illustrates that actual interest rate fell well below what past knowledge would recommend policy rate should be. He explains that the unusual low interest rate is based on a careful consideration of the monetary authority and usual macroeconomic variables, which is set to combat deflation in the US economy. Therefore, we claim that an aggressive easy monetary policy leads to diminish future output and boosts up future inflation rate. Moreover, the evidence from the US economy proves that the different types of interest rate for different financial instruments do not respond equally to the policy rate. This evidence confirms that monetary policy decision makers might have wrong decisions or they are unable to achieve their announced goals. If this is the case in a developed economy equipped with a massive database and well-educated economists, what we should expect about the ability of monetary policy in developing or emerging economies? In these countries, central bankers conduct inappropriate monetary policy that has had a significant impact on the financial position of the central bank itself. The recent evidence from the world economy supports the hypothesis that central bankers are unable to achieve their goals. Cecchetti and Ehrmann (2000) examine a sample of 9 countries moved to inflation-targeting policy. They seek to assess the performance of the new policy. They find just only one country, New Zealand, which succeed to decrease inflation variability. Additionally, Roger and Stone (2005) conclude the central banks of a group consists of 22 countries from both industrial and emerging market countries missed their inflation targets in a range of 30–60%. Literature, based on our knowledge, lacks studies that concentrate on the ability of central banks. In a recent theoretical study, Sweidan (2008) uses the standard approach of monetary economics and model central bank ability in the central bank loss function. His work concentrates on central banker ability, preference, and their influence on the economy. He finds chronic central bank’s losses in developing countries reduce the ability of the central bank to control the economy, particularly to manage money supply and inflation rate. As a result, central banker is unable to achieve her goals and preferences. His outcome proves that both central bank ability and preference in developing countries are fundamental to explain inflation bias and the movement of monetary policy instrument. Further, Cincibuch et al. (2008) state in recent decades, numerous central banks have faced substantial losses that have deteriorated their balance sheet and eroded their capital. Therefore, they develop a framework for evaluating the ability of a central banker to keep her balance sheet sustainable without having to default on her policy goals. They apply the derived framework on Czech Republic National Bank (CNB).Footnote 1 They find CNB will be able to repay its current losses in about 15 years without any transfer from public budget. The current paper concentrates on understanding the future macroeconomic consequences of a restriction on conducting monetary policy, i.e. central bank losses, in a developing country. For the purpose of the current study, we define the ability as the capability of a central banker to respond directly to offset unfavorable fluctuations of some macroeconomic variables and achieve the announced targets. The definition is essential because it determines the limits of the modeling process and the interaction among the variables. The current paper seeks to accomplish two goals: first, model mathematically the concept of the central bank inability by using Taylor rule within the perception of a New-Keynesian model. In addition, use the model to inspect the consequence of central bank inability on the expected current inflation rate. Second, examine the path of the macroeconomic variables of New-Keynesian model. Specifically, we will find the path of expected future real output, expected future nominal interest rate, and expected future inflation rate in the model. Furthermore, the paper will utilize two definitions of inflation rate type adjustment. We would like to confirm that, based on my knowledge, there are no previous studies made this connection. The contribution of the current paper is to add a new strand of central banking research by modeling the central bank inability in a New-Keynesian macroeconomic system, particularly in Taylor rule. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents literature review regarding monetary policy of developing countries, central bank losses, and the central banks’ inability. Section 3 introduces the model of the current paper. Section 4 presents the mathematical solution of the model. Section 5 explores the path of the macroeconomic variables of the model. Conclusions are presented in Sect. 6.",2

57,4,International Review of Economics,23 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-010-0110-9,Optimal pricing of a two-sided monopoly platform with a one-sided congestion effect,December 2010,Chokri Aloui,Khaïreddine Jebsi,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"When any consumer visits a commercial fair or a souk,Footnote 1 he certainly feels good when there is a few numbers of visitors. But, when this later increases, his satisfaction decreases because the visit becomes difficult and he must pass more time to satisfy his needs. When a patient has to be treated at a clinic, the treatment tends to be ‘boring’ when the number of patients is more and more increasing. Commercial fairs, souks, clinics, and other platforms, for which consumers share a fixed amount of capacity, are characterized by negative direct network externalities: consumers’ utility decreases with the number of users consuming the same good or service because of the development of congestion or crowding. According to Caillaud and Jullien (2003), and Rochet and Tirole (2003, 2006), these congested platforms are considered to be two-sided because they cater for two distinct groups of agents: buyers and sellers in the case of a commercial fair or a souk; patients and doctors in the case of a clinic.Footnote 2 For convenience, we call these two sides of agents: buyers and sellers. The congestion only affects the buyers’ side, and it is linked to the overuse of the capacity share (“corridors” for commercial fairs and “rooms” for clinics) that the platform devotes to the buyers. Indeed, the increasing adhesions of buyers (whether visitors or patients) affect the quality of visits, or consultations, because of crowding. Hence, each buyer bears a delay cost, due to congestion, when he trades with the other side. Actually, these platforms can be either regulated by a planner or private and not regulated. The regulated ones can be the case of public hospitals. However, the majority of platforms are private and not regulated. Hereafter, we term these latter by just private platforms. The main scope of our paper is to model the impact of a one-sided congestion on the pricing strategy of a private two-sided monopoly platform. We compare the results with that found in Rochet and Tirole (2003) [hereafter R&T (2003)] in order to analyse the so-called divide-and-conquer pricing strategy (henceforth D&C) in the case of a one-sided congestion. We complete the analysis by finding out the à-la Ramsey two-sided monopoly pricing rule when a one-sided congestion matters. Our analysis is related to that of R&T (2003) concerning the pricing strategy of a private monopoly platform without congestion and which can be viewed as benchmark. These authors are among the first to introduce the main features of two-sided credit market. They assume that a private monopoly credit card platform levies charges purely on a per-transaction basis and there is a multiplicative demand between the two sides. R&T (2003) show that the pricing structure (the allocation of the total price between the two sides), given by the equality of the elasticity ratios, teaches that the more elastic side pays the highest per-transaction price. The same result is obtained in Rochet and Tirole (2006), Armstrong (2006), Hagiu (2004). Such a finding is obviously new, and it violates the textbook (one-sided) private monopoly third-degree price discrimination. The key outcome resulting from the analysis of the R&T’s (2003) pricing strategy is the Caillaud and Jullien’s (2003) D&C pricing strategy. This strategy helps the platform to solve the “Chicken and egg” problem by subsidizing the participation of one side (“divide”) and recovering the loss on the other side (“conquer”). Rochet and Tirole (2006) call this strategy the “skewed pricing” strategy, and they relate it to the opportunity cost the monopoly platform incurs on the “opposite” side. Bolt and Tieman (2007) show that in the case of a “corner” pricing with constant demand elasticities, the skewed pricing does not violate the textbook (one-sided) private monopoly third-degree price discrimination. In addition, R&T (2003) study also a Ramsey pricing without taking into account an intra-side congestion effect. At the social optimum, R&T find a cost allocation condition embodying each side’s contribution to the other side’s surplus. Negative direct network externalities, in the two-sided markets context, have been studied by Anderson and De Palma (2007) in the case where congestion reaches one side (the advertisers’ side) of an open access platform. The congestion, in their setting, is linked to the fact that the messages senders send via such a platform cannot be all examined by the receiver, implying congestion cost on senders. They seek for the optimal number of senders leading to the efficient use of the platform capacity. In order to implement the social equilibrium, they suggest charging only the congested side an access price equal to the social cost. A sort of a one-sided congestion is studied by Belleflamme and Toulemonde (2009). These latter qualify congestion between agents of the same side as a certain “rivalry,” meaning that they compete between each other. Belleflamme and Toulemonde (2009
) analyze the pricing policy of a potential entrant in a two-sided market. In our paper, we are interested in studying congestion reaching one side of both a private and a Ramsey-regulated two-sided monopoly platform. More precisely, we assume that only the buyers suffer from congestion that implicates them a delay cost, interpreted as a congestion cost, which depends on the total number of buyers and on the capacity amount devoted to their side. The monopoly platform takes into account this congestion cost when it charges per-transaction price for each side (per-act-of sale for commercial fair platform and per-treatment for clinic platform).Footnote 3 Compared with the private monopoly benchmark framework (R&T 2003), we show that the elasticity ratio of the buyers’ side is adjusted by the marginal congestion cost that a buyer imposes on the others. This result is in line with the traditional principle of the textbook congestion pricing, which allows the efficient use of the platform capacity. Furthermore, the monopolistic platform allocates the congestion cost between the two sides. Although the sellers are not concerned by congestion, the per-transaction price levied on the sellers’ side is affected by the marginal congestion cost; this result is different from the Anderson and De Palma’s (2007) according to which the monopoly charges the marginal congestion cost only on one side. We show that the D&C pricing strategy has changed when one side suffers from congestion: it depends not only on the relative magnitude of the sides’ price elasticities of demand but it also depends on the marginal congestion cost that an agent imposes on the others. This pricing strategy gives rise to three interesting features that violate the results of R&T (2003, 2006). First, in the case of equal price elasticities of demand, we show that sellers are charged the highest per-transaction price. Compared with the benchmark pricing, the D&C strategy becomes possible. Second, in the case of different price elasticities, the platform congestion pricing depends on a certain threshold of the marginal congestion cost. We show that, when buyers are more elastic than sellers, if the marginal congestion cost is strictly higher than the threshold, sellers are more charged than buyers. This outcome violates the R&T’s pricing structure and it becomes in line with the textbook (one-sided) private monopoly third-degree price discrimination. The D&C strategy is then reversed. Finally, although buyers are more elastic than sellers, if the marginal congestion cost is at the threshold, the monopoly platform sets the same per-transaction price on the two sides. In social context, the optimal pricing structure by a Ramsey planner with a one-sided congestion effect implies a modified R&T cost allocation condition showing that the congestion does not only affect the buyers’ contribution to the sellers’ surplus but it also affects the sellers’ contribution to the buyers’. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. In Sect. 3, we present R&T’s (2003) model as a benchmark framework.

This, we believe, can be thought as the methodological starting point of many leading economists, including J. S. Mill, V. Pareto, A. Marshall, J. M. Keynes, and F. von Hayek. Robert (or, as all we say, Bob) Sugden (b. Morley, West Yorkshire, UK, 1949) is not an exception. He has given relevant contributions to economics over his 30-year career by adopting a very extensive perspective, grounded, we daresay, on his uncommon capacity of communicating with scholars from other disciplines. After gaining a degree in history (main subject) and economics (subsidiary subject) at the University of York, and an MSc in economics at Cardiff, Sugden was appointed lecturer in economics at the University of York, where he worked with Alan Williams, later a leading health economist, but at the time a specialist in cost–benefit analysis (CBA). Sugden then started getting interested in social choice theory, especially Sen’s impossibility of a Paretian liberal, which he thought was based on a defective formulation of liberty. James Buchanan read a draft of his paper on this topic and invited him to spend, in 1977, a summer at the Buchanan’s Center for Study of Public Choice. That visit had a big influence on Sugden. Buchanan’s rejection of the benevolent despot model of government—which underlies so much of welfare economics and social choice theory—and his idea that economics is not just a game for mathematicians to play, but a way of trying to understand the world as it is, gave to Sugden’s work a new sense of direction. As he confessed some years ago: “I have spent a considerable part of my life building economic models, and examining the models that other economists have built. I believe that I am making reasonably good use of my talents in an attempt to understand the social world. I have no fellow-feeling with those economic theorists who, off the record at seminars and conferences, admit that they are only playing a game with other theorists. If their models are not intended seriously, I want to say (and do say when I feel sufficiently combative), why do they expect me to spend my time listening to their expositions? Count me out of the game. At the back of my mind, however, there is a trace of self-doubt. Does the sort of models that I try to build really help us to understand the world? Or am I too just playing a game, without being self-critical enough to admit it? My starting point is that model building in economics has serious intent only if it is ultimately directed towards telling us something about the real world” (Sugden 2000, p 1). Without denying that models necessarily describe imaginary worlds, something similar to Galileo’s worlds of paper, this confession emphasizes what their role, often misunderstood, should be: contributing to the comprehension of reality. It is worth noticing that this confession also sheds some light on a key feature of Sugden’s scientific production—something he has in common with other renowned economists such as Robert Akerlof or Thomas Schelling—that is, its aptitude to provide analyses that are formally simple yet able, nonetheless, to catch the basic aspects of complex social phenomena. How Sugden’s good intentions have been put into practice is, on the other hand, witnessed by his 1986 book, The economics of rights, cooperation and welfare. Written with an elegant and enjoyable prose—another characteristic of Sugden’s scientific production and one of the reasons for his success in the academic community—this book is, inevitably, the reference point of any of the articles contained in the present issue of the International
review of economics, which collects some of the papers presented at a workshop held in honour of Sugden in May 2010 at the University of Naples “Federico II”. To provide the interested reader with the basic knowledge to fully appreciate the papers collected in this issue, in what follows we provide an hitchhiker’s guide for understanding Sugden’s contribution both to economics and to social sciences more generally. We will pay particular attention to two core ideas that have deeply characterized his research enterprise: the idea that it is more valuable to focus the attention on social orders compatible with the real distribution of knowledge in society; the idea that the market is better seen as a network of opportunities for mutual advantage.",2
58,1,International Review of Economics,06 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0114-0,"Mutual advantage, conventions and team reasoning",March 2011,Robert Sugden,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The text for this paper is taken from the final paragraph of Antonio Genovesi’s Lectures on Commerce, or on Civil Economy (2005[1765–1767]). These lectures were delivered at the University of Naples, where Genovesi was the world’s first professor of economics. Having taught his students how a commercial society works, he concludes: Here the idea of the present work. [We should study civil economy] to go along with the law of the moderator of the world, which commands us to do our best to be useful to one another (p. 890; translation by Bruni and Sugden). 
The key idea here, and a recurring theme throughout the lectures, is that in a well-ordered commercial society the motivation for economic relationships is mutual assistance, or being useful to one another. By viewing economic relationships as reciprocal, Genovesi assimilates them to other relationships of civil society. This way of seeing markets is different from the one that most economists have taken. The usual view is encapsulated in one of the most famous passages in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens (1976 [1776], pp. 26–27). On Smith’s account, when individuals engage in market transactions, they are motivated by self-love, although subject to the constraints of justice. There is an explicit contrast between self-love on the one side and ‘benevolence’ and ‘humanity’ on the other. The same contrast appears in an even more famous passage from the same book: By… directing that industry in such a manner as may be of the greatest value, [the merchant] intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that is was no part of it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the publick good. (1976 [1776], p. 456). The socially useful merchant, we are told, is motivated by ‘his own gain’; this is contrasted favourably with the ironic picture of the benevolent merchant who intends ‘the publick good’. Of course, Smith does not deny the reality of benevolence; his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1976 [1759]) offers a psychological and sociological explanation of both justice and benevolence. Nevertheless, the market is understood as a system of ‘natural liberty’ in which individuals act on self-love. Taken as a whole, the workings of that system tend to produce socially beneficial outcomes; and the explanation of how this comes about involves the assumption that economic agents pursue their own interests. Further, as the remark about the beggar encourages us to think, transactions which express self-interest on both sides are compatible with individual independence and dignity in a way that transactions of benevolence may not be.
 The main features of Smith’s account of market motivation are now part of the conventional wisdom of economics (perhaps with the neoclassical proviso that economic agents are assumed only to be ‘non-tuistic’—that is, not to take any interest in the welfare of those people with whom they trade). Against this background, Genovesi’s text stands out as suggesting a different understanding of economic relationships, as motivated neither by self-interest nor by benevolence, but by joint intentions for mutual advantage. In a recent paper, Luigino Bruni and I have presented a sketch of what it might mean to view market relationships in this way (Bruni and Sugden 2008). In this paper, I offer some further thoughts—still regrettably provisional—about how this sketch might be developed into a more formal theory. I shall suggest that this account of mutual advantage can be integrated with two other lines of thought on which I have been working for many years—the idea that individuals can reason ‘as teams’, and the idea that norms of cooperation can emerge and reproduce themselves spontaneously. Intuitively, team reasoning seems a promising way of representing a motivation directed at mutual advantage, since team reasoning itself is neither self-interested nor benevolent; instead, it represents individuals as reasoning together about the achievement of common goals. However, the theory of team reasoning, at least in the form proposed by Bacharach (2006), has developed as an offshoot of classical game theory and has inherited that theory’s focus on rational agency (while allowing rational agency to be attributed to groups). As a co-editor of Bacharach’s unfinished magnus opus, I was drawn into his way of thinking about team reasoning, but my own inclinations are to be more sceptical about the role of reason in economic life. Those inclinations are better expressed in my work on the evolution of conventions and norms (Sugden 2004), which draws on ideas from David Hume (1978 [1739–40]) and David Lewis (1969). One of the main themes of this work is that processes of social evolution tend to select conventions that can be construed as embodying principles of reciprocity. These conventions require individuals to play their respective parts in practices that are mutually beneficial, but assessments of benefit are made relative to customary expectations which may themselves be conventional. Thus, the moral codes that form spontaneously around such conventions may not be capable of rational reconstruction as the imaginary outcomes of ideally rational deliberation. I would like to find a way of understanding the motivation of mutual advantage as conventional in this sense.",30

That is, each individual categorizes others as in-group or out-group members, favouring the former over the latter, and in-group cooperation tends to be strengthened.
Footnote 1 This paper reports an experimental investigation of this hypothesis in the context of voluntary contributions to public goods. The theory of team reasoning offers an explanation for the hypothesized link between group identification and cooperation: when an individual identifies with a group, he or she looks for the combination of actions by group members which best achieves the collective goal of the group and then plays his or her part in that joint action. In some versions of the theory, each individual’s commitment to team reasoning is conditional on the belief that other group members are similarly committed (Sugden 2003; Bacharach 2006; Gold and Sugden 2008). Zizzo and Tan (2002) and Bacharach (2006) suggest that the link between common fate and group identification may be an instance of a more general mechanism, by which group identification in games depends positively on the degree of game harmony (that is, positive correlation between players’ payoffs). Intuitively, one might expect perfect positive correlation of payoffs (as in a pure coordination game) to make thoughts about what is best for us particularly salient: the players are ‘all in the same boat’, and there is no way for any player to gain at the expense of any of the others. Conversely, if there is perfect negative correlation (as in a zero-sum game), each player can gain only if others lose, and so thoughts about what is good for me might be expected to come to the fore. The game harmony hypothesis fills in the gap between these two extremes by postulating a monotonic relationship between payoff correlation and group identification. Experimentally, only Brewer and Kramer (henceforth BK; 1986) have tested the effect of common fate on behaviour in linear public good games.
Footnote 2 In BK’s experiment, points accumulated by subjects during the experiment were then converted into cash according to an exchange rate determined by the outcome of a lottery. BK manipulated the degree of common fate by using two different lottery structures. In the common fate treatment, an “all win or all lose” group lottery was used. In the independent fate treatment, there was a separate and independent lottery for each subject. The common fate hypothesis implies that group identification is stronger, and hence cooperation is more likely, in the former treatment. BK found slightly higher contributions in the common fate treatment when both treatments were applied to small groups. BK’s design is subject to three qualifications. First, it was based on deception: subjects were given feedback about the supposed behaviour of their co-players, but in reality all feedback was predetermined. Second, subjects made all their decisions before experiencing any realization of the lotteries that differentiated the treatments. This may have reduced the salience of the common fate manipulation. Third, BK report only data about total contributions without looking at differences in reciprocity between treatments. In this paper, we report a new experiment which is similar to BK’s, but not subject to the limitations we have described. We use common fate (CF) and independent fate (IF) treatments similar to those of BK, but also arival fate (RF) treatment in which the lottery has a “one wins, others lose” structure, inducing a negative correlation between players’ payoffs. The game harmony hypothesis implies that group identification should be even weaker in RF than in IF. Our prior expectation was that, because of the common fate mechanism, contributions would be lower in IF than in CF, as in BK’s experiment. Since reciprocity (that is, the tendency for each player’s contributions to depend positively on the previous contributions of other group members) reveals a group-oriented attitude, we also expected reciprocity to be weaker in IF than in CF. Because of the group harmony hypothesis, we expected contributions to be still lower, and reciprocity still weaker, in RF.",2
58,1,International Review of Economics,13 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0118-9,"Prune or cut down: salience and Sugden’s The Economics of Rights, Co-operation and Welfare",March 2011,Pelle Guldborg Hansen,David Rojo Arjona,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"While the theory treating social conventions as a phenomenon in its own right originates with David Hume’s Treatise (1740), it was given a most powerful and systematic interpretation by David Lewis in his Convention: A Philosophical Study (1969). Along lines first suggested by Thomas Schelling (1960), Lewis devised a theory of convention utilizing the tools of classical game theory holding that:Footnote 1
 A regularity R in the behavior of members of a population P when they are agents in a recurrent situation S is a convention if and only if it is true that, and it is common knowledge in P that, in any instance of S among members of P, C1 everyone conforms to R; C2 everyone expects everyone else to conform to R; C3 everyone prefers to conform to R on condition that the others do, since S is a coordination problem and uniform conformity to R is a coordination equilibrium in S. 
This definition effectively characterizes a social convention in terms of three elements assumed to be common knowledge between the parties involved: (C1) a behavioral regularity, related somehow to (C2) a mutual concordant system of expectations plus (C3) a recurrent configuration of preferences characterizing conformity to the regularity as an equilibrium outcome in a recurrent situation S of social interaction. In particular, it is important to notice that conformity to such a regularity will, in game theoretical terms, instantiate a strict Nash “coordination” equilibrium in a recurrent coordination problem, i.e. a recurrent game featuring multiple such equilibria.Footnote 2
 To illustrate the basic idea, it is sufficient to state one of the simplest two-player coordination games: the so-called Driving Game. Player 2 Right Left Player 1 Right 1,1 0,0 Left 0,0 1,1 In this game, two players face the symmetric decision problem of choosing between strategies “left” and “right.” If they both choose “left” or both choose “right,” they succeed in coordinating on one of the game’s two pure strategy equilibria, both of which are strictly preferred to other outcomes which are then referred to as coordination failures. Taking this game to capture the strategic structure of the recurrent decision problem faced everyday by pairs of automobile drivers on the road, the two pure strict coordination equilibria of the game—(“right,” “right”) and (“left,” “left”)—may be taken to represent the recurrent outcome observed as a result of drivers conforming to the conventions of “keep left” or “keep right” depending on which one of these conventions prevails in their society.Footnote 3 By this representation, the game also gives structure to Lewis’ claim that everyone prefers to conform to a given convention on condition that everyone else does, as well as suggest why everyone seemingly has reason to conform to the prevailing convention despite its contingency as soon as these preferences for general conformity and the convention are matters of common knowledge within the population in question. If read closely, though, the definition itself does not make explicit the way the elements—behavior, expectations, and preferences—are taken to relate to each other. An obvious suggestion would be that the behavior described by C1 results from the expectations stipulated by C2 and the preferences of C3 coupled with instrumental rational agency as studied in classical game theory. However, as most game theorists know quite well, conformity to coordination equilibria may not be explained solely from the premises of classical game theory due to the Nash equilibrium selection problem inherent to any coordination problem. Even if the prevailing convention and the shared preferences for general conformity are facts of common knowledge, the kind of strategic rationality assumed by the game theoretic framework is ultimately purely forward looking. Thus, though a strategic rational player would surely want to play his part in any coordination equilibrium if other agents would play their part, he would also know that they would only play their part if they knew that he is about to play his—but, of course, this is exactly what any forward-looking agent is still trying to figure out in any instance of the Driving Game faced by him. Seemingly recognizing this problem, Lewis added an account of the psychological mechanism by which conformity is maintained. Inspired by Schelling (1960), this account held that conformity and thus coordination results from the psychological salience bestowed upon the relevant equilibrium by past conformity (salience by precedent), plus common knowledge of this in the population for which the convention prevails. In particular, Lewis took precedent to project a self-fulfilling focal point for expectations about future behavior to converge upon given common knowledge of the precedent pattern of conformity, shared inductive standards, and each agent’s ability to act and form inductive expectations rationally; see Cubitt and Sugden (2003). However, while Lewis’ theory may readily explain the persistence of social conventions, it says nothing about how conventions emerge, or get established in the first place. Present and future conformity is explained on the basis of past conformity, plus the psychological mechanism of salience-based action. Thus, the theory would be explicitly circular if understood as a generic account of social convention. But then again, Lewis never claimed that his theory was aimed to devise an analysis of anything else than our prevailing concept of convention as applied to existing phenomena.Footnote 4 But obviously, that does not exempt one from questioning whether the notion of “convention” in the end is not just a mere conceptual illusion convenient for describing a more complex reality. Thus, besides a long series of other objections made to Lewis’ theory of convention, see (Hansen 2009: 5–6), it has often been argued that the missing account of the emergence or genesis of convention is a crucial weakness for any Lewisian theory of convention; see e.g. Gilbert (1989), Verbeek (2002). After all, there is obviously an element missing in this theory if it does not allow for a non-circular account of how actual conventions as well as the phenomenon of convention itself may arise in the first place. In reaction ensuing work in the tradition of Lewis has been deeply concerned with producing such an account (especially since this would simultaneously provide a non-circular solution to the general equilibrium selection problem in game theory). One of the most prominent answers is found in Robert Sugden’s The Economics of Rights, Co-operation and Welfare (1986)—henceforth ERCW. In this Sugden gives an account of social order as convention, in the spirit of David Hume and Adam Smith, but using a non-rationalistic evolutionary approach to game theory inspired by the work of evolutionary biologist John Maynard-Smith and colleagues; cf. Sugden (2004: ix). But despite a reception often to the contrary, ERCW is not only prominent since it presents one of the seminal studies of the emergence of social phenomena taking evolutionary dynamics as a model for understanding aggregate outcomes of individual-level learning models. It is just as prominent because it seeks to integrate the evolutionary approach with Schelling and Lewis’ original theories of convention and coordination by explicitly positing an empirical theory of salience at its foundation. Thus, while there has been a long-standing tendency for later theories of social phenomena based on evolutionary game theory to defer attention as to how evolutionary models actually relate to actual social interaction, cf. Sugden (2001), Sugden’s theory puts forward concrete hypotheses about this relation based on the idea of salience; both as to how salience may explain (1) how learning by experience works, (2) why one possible convention emerges rather than another, and (3) how certain asymmetric features come to guide correlated conventions, rather than others. However, in his Instrumental Rationality and Moral Philosophy (2002), Bruno Verbeek has criticized the explanatory force of all three roles ascribed to salience in ERCW. The crux of the criticism may be reconstructed as a disjunctive syllogism holding as its general premise that theories of salience in general fall into either of two categories: psychological salience or conventional salience. Verbeek then argues that if Sugden’s theory belongs to the former, it neither fits experimental findings that Sugden later has been part of carrying out, nor explains how learning by experience work. Hence, it cannot explain either why one convention emerges rather than another or how certain asymmetric features come to guide correlated conventions, rather than others. However, if Sugden’s theory belongs to the latter category, Verbeek then claims that though salience could explain all of these aspects of convention as well as would fit the experimental findings, it could not do so without circularity or vicious regress. Consequently, Sugden’s theory in ERCW does not provide a sound generic account of convention. In this paper, we reject Verbeek’s criticism of the role that salience can play in a theory of convention in general, as well as his criticism of the role played by salience in Sugden’s theory in particular. Section 2 gives the specific background of Sugden’s theory of convention in ERCW before summarizing this. Section 3 presents Verbeek’s criticism of the explanatory force of salience as applied by Sugden in his theory. Section 4 first examines and rejects Verbeek’s particular premise that Sugden’s psychological theory of salience neither fits the experimental findings in one-shot coordination problems, nor may explain how learning by experience works. It then addresses and rejects Verbeek’s general premise that a theory of salience necessarily falls into either of his two categories and then argues for the possibility of a third kind of salience—Schelling salience—that avoids the supposed circularity or regress. Thus, in Sect. 5 we conclude that Verbeek’s argument of the explanatory role of salience as applied in the theory of convention in general, and in Sugden’s theory in ERCW in particular fails to establish its conclusion.",1
58,1,International Review of Economics,18 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0113-1,Good standing and cooperation,March 2011,Sergio Beraldo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last decades, a massive effort has been made to investigate how cooperation can evolve by natural selection, a problem recognized by Darwin (1859) himself as crucial for his theory of the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. A by-product of such an effort has been the development of a game-theoretical paradigm that both natural and social scientists have found particularly apt to address the problem. The development of a common paradigm has certainly contributed to cultivate the dream of identifying a key mechanism to explain cooperation in any possible situation, thus providing a general theory applicable, in principle, to both natural and social contexts. This dream has vanished. Current knowledge indeed does not provide any good reason to suppose that cooperation is a single phenomenon with a unified causal explanation. It seems indeed more plausible to view cooperation as a family of loosely related phenomena that may have multiple causes (Beraldo and Sugden 2010). It is now clear, for example, that as far as cooperation is concerned, there are substantial differences between humans and animals. In animal societies, where some apparently cooperative behaviours are indeed forms of mutualism, cooperation is mostly based on kin, being therefore quite rare in groups consisting of genetically unrelated individuals (Clutton-Brock 2009). Among humans, who are endowed with higher cognitive capacities, genetic relatedness plays a minor role and cooperation seems better explained by some form of reciprocity. It is known, for example, that fear of retaliation carried out by one’s partner may provide sufficient incentives for cooperation to emerge in dyadic long-term relationships (e.g. Trivers 1971; Axelrod and Hamilton 1981; Sugden 1986/2004). In large groups, where interaction with a given partner is occasional, reciprocity still provides the grounds for plausible explanations. For example, third parties observing an individual’s conduct might condition theirs to the actions he/she performed in previous interactions with others, what is usually termed indirect reciprocity (Alexander 1987); decentralized altruistic punishment may enforce adherence to cooperative social norms, an hypothesis known as strong reciprocity (e.g. Gintis et al. 2005). Each of the aforementioned forms of reciprocity, and others that one might refer to (e.g. Nowak 2006), is candidate to explain cooperation in given environments, without being excluded that different forms of reciprocity may at the same time be at work. In this paper, the focus will be on indirect reciprocity. It is plausible to believe that the evolution of language—which might have found the selective mould in its contribution to the emergence of cooperative practices (e.g. Nowak and Sigmund 2005)—allowing the transmission of greater and better (more reliable) information, has played a decisive role in equipping humans with the ability of achieving cooperation via this type of reciprocity. Many social institutions and practices, such as gossiping (e.g. Sommerfeld et al. 2007), have then evolved (or coevolved) to allow that any individual in a community be continually and effectively assessed and reassessed (Alexander 1987). The good-standing model, developed by Robert Sugden (1986/2004), elegantly describes the role that status or reputation may play in ensuring the emergence of cooperative practices. Although this model has become one of the current theoretical paradigm to explain how cooperation might evolve via indirect reciprocity, it is often questioned whether it does provide a sensible account of how things realistically go, as it seems to require an implausibly large capacity of processing recursive information (e.g. Milinski et al. 2001; Bolton et al. 2005; Engelmann and Fischbacher 2009). A competing model, based on image scoring, has been then suggested as a more reliable basis for the analysis (Nowak and Sigmund 1998a). In this paper, I analyse the properties of both the standing and the image scoring models, showing that the former does not actually require processing recursive information. In doing this, I will refer to a recent strand of biological literature that has provided useful insights to assess the role that status or reputation can play in ensuring the adoption of cooperative practices. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the main characteristics of both the standing and the image-scoring model. Section 3 sets the scene, whereas Sects. 4 and 5 formally derive the informational requirements for both models to work. Section 6 provides some discussion of the literature and concludes.",

When we say “we are all in the same boat” we mean that, in a particular situation, we share the same predicament: the shipwrecked characters of Crane’s story believe that they shall all die together if their boat sinks or they cannot find land in time; footballers, and their most enthusiastic supporters, share in the success and defeat of their team; team workers in a company may know that they will share in the success or failure of their team, with potential direct and indirect implications for each of them individually; to a lesser degree, workers in the same company might feel to share a common fate in the success of their company at the expenses of other companies; and strong national or religious identities (i.e., being a Palestinian or an Israeli, or being a Northern Ireland Catholic or Protestant) may also be associated with feelings of common fate. A large number of bilateral transactions occur both within groups and between members of different groups sharing some degree of common fate. Perceptions of common fate may have a role to play in team design within organizations and also within an economy and society at large. From a more theoretical viewpoint, they correspond to what Zizzo and Tan (2007, forthcoming) and Tan and Zizzo (2008) label as a condition of greater game harmony, and they may act in turn as a trigger for the team reasoning discussed by Bob Sugden and Michael Bacharach in their work (Sugden 1993, 2000, 2003; Bacharach 1999, 2006). The objective of this experiment is to try to capture the effect that these perceptions of common fate have on behavior. In circumstances where common fate implies that by choosing cooperative actions agents can achieve a mutually superior outcome, it is no surprise that we should expect intra-group cooperation. It is, after all, in the self-interest of each of the characters in Stephen Crane’s boat to row hard and to follow orders by the captain as the most competent seaman onboard. What Crane’s text appears to imply, however, is that his characters underwent “more than a recognition” that cooperation is required out of self-interest. They felt “a subtle brotherhood” which had “a quality that was personal and heartfelt”. A line of experimental research has combined both the strategic dimension and the purely framing dimension from inducing a common fate, and so, while very important, it has not isolated the pure effect of the framing (as opposed to the strategic) dimension (e.g., Riechmann and Weimann 2004). Tan and Bolle (2007) did design a public good contribution experiment, which isolated the psychological effect of having inter-team comparisons from strategic incentives to contribute more to gain more money. They found higher contribution simply as a result of the possibility of inter-team comparisons. Wit and Wilke (1992) found that a common fate manipulation increased cooperation in later game play of three social dilemma variations, based on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Chicken, and the Stag-Hunt game. This was a pure framing effect, with no strategic explanation. This experiment lacked proper financial incentives and employed deception, however. Common fate, even in its pure framing dimension, may have a darker side. There may be cooperation toward ingroup members (people in the group, sharing the common fate), but also negative discrimination toward outgroup members (people outside the group, not sharing the common fate). In one of the conditions of Rabbie and Horwitz (1969), subjects were arbitrarily divided in Greens and Blues; the experimenter announced that a radio would be given to each Green member or to each Blue member depending on the outcome of a roll of a die. This was sufficient to induce an ingroup bias as measured by some questionnaire ratings. The experiment in this paper considers a coordination game, a Nash demand game, an ultimatum game, a bargaining game with unilateral power by own part (“unilateral power game”) and a dictator game. We aim to find out whether, due to non-strategic perceptions of common fate, there is discrimination favoring insiders relative to outsiders, and, if so, whether this discrimination is positive (insiders are treated better than they otherwise would) and/or negative (outsiders are treated worse than they otherwise would). We can isolate the nature of the discrimination, i.e. whether it is positive or negative, by running control conditions where no common fate is induced, and so comparing behavior when common fate is induced with behavior when it is not. In addition, by using a new experimental technique based on the elicitation of similarity evaluations between games, we get suggestive evidence about what underlies discriminatory behavior. From a practical perspective of team design, it clearly matters whether common fate simply implies more cooperation than would otherwise be observed toward some other agents (positive discrimination) or alternatively whether common fate can act ‘aggressively’, by with-holding cooperation toward outsiders (negative discrimination). In the former case, cooperation is increased overall; in the latter, it is reduced. Section 2 presents the experimental design. Section 3 contains the result. Section 4 has a brief discussion and conclusion.",17

The appeal to evolutionary processes in social science has become commonplace over the last 20 years, making this a plausible candidate as one of the seminal books from the 1980s. It is not just that Maynard Smith’s evolutionary game theory is developed to show how conventions, for example, regarding property ownership might arise spontaneously through an evolutionary process, Bob Sugden’s book also showed how difficult is the spontaneous emergence of cooperation in interactions characterized by the free rider problem. I consider both insights to be crucial, and I consider each in the following two sections, drawing on some of the experimental evidence that has emerged over the last 20 years. The book was also important because, unlike many evolutionary theorists, it anticipated a key weakness in such accounts of social institutions. They can explain the origin of patterns of behaviour but not why people attach normative significance to these behaviours. By this, I mean that people believe these behaviours are not just pragmatic, they are also the ‘just’, ‘honourable’, ‘moral’, etc. thing to do. The book, following Hume’s account of justice as an artificial virtue, attempts to show how normative ideas might attach themselves to conventions through feelings of resentment (that one has when expectations are not confirmed). I am not entirely persuaded by this argument. I find an account based on the insights of cognitive dissonance theory more compelling. Nevertheless, the fact that people do attach these normative beliefs to conventions is important for what the evolutionary approach brings to the study of society. One implication of the discussion of the evolutionary approach to conventions around property rights and the like in Sect. 2 and behaviour in free rider settings in Sect. 3 is that people are likely to belong to groups and that there are likely to be tensions between people who belong to different groups. This is not something the book draws out but it seems to be entailed by it, later evolutionary analysis and the experimental record. In part, this is because groups often follow different conventions and (and here is the importance of the attachment of normative beliefs to these conventions) they hold different normative beliefs; with the result that interaction between groups is difficult because it entails a collision, as it were, between moral universes. It is also because evolutionary solutions to the free rider problem seem to turn on the existence of inter-group conflict/competition. To put this slightly differently, groups are part of the social landscape and, on evolutionary grounds, one should expect relations between them to be prone to tension. Finally, Sect. 4 picks up on another enduring Sugden theme: the virtue of the market. In particular, I join him in this paean to the market because, I argue, the market is rather well suited for mediating relations between groups. It encourages individuals to be treated equally, and it is also rather good for this same reason at eroding some of the normative beliefs within groups that attach to conventions and which treat people unequally.",2

58,2,International Review of Economics,12 May 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0124-y,The political determinants of liberalization: do ideological cleavages still matter?,June 2011,Filippo Belloc,Antonio Nicita,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the distinguishing features of the last three decades has been the common wave of market-oriented policies experienced worldwide (Conway and Nicoletti 2006; Armstrong and Sappington 2006; Guriev and Megginson 2007; Pitlik 2007; Castaldo and Nicita 2007). In particular, in network industries, which cover crucial sectors for national economies such as passenger air transport, telecommunications, electricity, gas, post, rail, and road, privatization and liberalization are among the market-oriented policies which registered the largest convergence across OECD countries. Besides the analysis of economic determinants (Vickers and Yarrow 1991; Levy and Spiller 1996; Newbery 1997, 2002; Armstrong and Sappington 2006), a large group of scholars have investigated the role of institutional and political determinants of market-oriented policies in network industries, following the ‘political economics’ approach (Alesina 1988; Alesina and Rosenthal 1995; Perotti 1995; Garrett 1998; Persson and Tabellini 2000; Persson 2002; Besley and Case 2003; Besley 2007; Besley et al. 2010). The vast array of ‘market-oriented policies’ typically include liberalization (i.e., the reduction in administrative barriers to entry and to market mobility), privatization, deregulation, and so on. They are generally implemented in network industries, but they are also extensively adopted in labor markets, in the health care and education sectors as well as in many institutional environments previously reserved to the public governance domain. Here, we focus on the political determinants of market-oriented policies in network industries. While the political economy of privatization in network industries has been largely investigated and measured, little of this literature addresses the role of political parties and institutions as determinants of liberalization policy (i.e., those policy interventions aimed at reducing economic, institutional, and legal barriers to entry in sectors previously dominated by legal state-owned monopolies). The main result of this budding empirical literature is that right-wing governments have been more active than left-wing ones in liberalizing selected OECD network industries (e.g., Pitlik 2007; Potrafke 2010). These findings, however, apparently contrast with some stylized facts suggesting a relevant role for left-wing governments, at least in Europe and in the US, in adopting liberalization over the last two decades. The activism of left-wing parties in office in adopting market-oriented policies has actually been so pervasive to induce political scientists to coin the new term ‘second-wave neoliberalism’—as opposed to the first wave of Thatcherism and Reaganomics—in order to indicate the bulk of new pro-market policies launched by President Clinton’s ‘market globalism’ and Prime Minister Tony Blair’s ‘third way’ (Roy et al. 2006). This left-wing ‘second-wave neoliberalism’ is generally deemed to have started precisely in the 1990s and to have pursued the principle of ‘strengthening social solidarity without dropping the neoliberal ideal of market-oriented entrepreneurship’ (Steger and Roy 2010). This principle has then been rapidly embraced by the new left-center agenda of the leaders of traditional social-democratic European parties, such as the Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, Italian Prime Ministers Romano Prodi and Massimo D’Alema, French Prime Ministers Pierre Beregovoy and Lionel Jospin, and the German Chancelor Gerard Schröder. As argued by Conway and Nicoletti (2006), many liberalization initiatives in OECD network industries occurred precisely in those years and constitute the main result of the new impetus driven by the center-left neoliberalism. The puzzling conclusion reached so-far by the empirical literature is that, contrary to what we should expect to find as a result of the ‘second wave neoliberalism’, no progressive convergence is found—between right- and left-wing governments—in the decision to liberalize network industries. In this paper, we try to explore this empirical puzzle and investigate—through an econometric analysis—whether traditional ideological cleavages still matter in the decision to liberalize OECD network industries. Our specific focus on liberalizations reverses conventional wisdom, as liberalizations choices do not appear to follow, as generally argued, the standard right-led ‘partisanship drift’. Indeed, we find a substantial bi-partisan path in the adoption of liberalization policy. If any, a stronger role in reducing barriers to entry in network industries shall be assigned, at least in recent years, to left-wing governments, thus confirming the impact of the second-wave neoliberalism. We perform a dynamic panel analysis on a sample of 30 OECD countries over the 1975–2006 period. On liberalization, we use data obtained from the latest release of OECD’s economic indicators for entry barriers reduction (OECD 2009), while, on political orientation of governments, we use data obtained from the political indicators of the World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions (World Bank 2009). The data we use allow us to consider a larger group of countries and a longer period of time with respect to previous empirical studies. Our findings, moreover, are shown to be robust to different measures of the government’s political ideology and are confirmed when controlling for the existing regulatory conditions that executives find when elected. As a secondary achievement of our paper, we introduce an index of policy diffusion, by which we try to measure the country’s exposure to the other countries’ policy initiatives. We take into account trade openness, EU membership, the adoption of the Euro, and foreign direct investments (FDIs). We find that the ‘policy diffusion’ we measure exerted a positive stimulus for liberalization policies. We conclude that contrary to conventional wisdom, liberalization policies in OECD network industries are not determined by partisanship. The growing convergence toward the liberalization agenda we measured for OECD countries is indeed independent of the political color of the parties in office. According to our findings, much of this outcome depends on the relevance of the so-called policy diffusion, which trespasses national boundaries. However, our investigation also reveals a stronger role, at least for the last years covered by our sample, for left-wing governments’ liberalizations, consistently with the relevance of the second-wave left-led neoliberalism pointed out by several political scientists (Roy et al. 2006; Steger and Roy 2010). Our analysis does not allow to further investigate the nature and the meaning of this apparent ‘dominance’ of left-wing parties on recent liberalization policies. In other terms, we did not investigate whether and to what extent it was due either to a political shift in the left-wing agenda or merely to the impact of policy diffusion or both. Nonetheless, we believe that our results highlight the relevance of this issue, and they may encourage further research on it. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly review the existing empirical literature on the political determinants of liberalization. In Sect. 3, we outline some stylized facts on the liberalization patterns in selected OECD countries. In Sect. 4, we carry out the econometric analysis, while in Sect. 5, we discuss our findings. Section 6 concludes.",18
58,2,International Review of Economics,06 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0115-z,What can econophysics contribute to financial economics?,June 2011,Christophe Schinckus,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past decade, a considerable number of physicists have started applying concepts from physics to understand economic phenomena. The term “Econophysics” is now mainly used to describe these works. According to Kutner and Grech (2008), econophysics as a field of research dates back to 1991, when Mantegna published a paper about Levy processes in finance. However, Jovanovic and Schinckus (2010) can trace the roots of econophysics to papers by Benoît Mandelbrot (1963), Mandelbrot and Taylor (1965), who saw an analogy between the evolution of financial markets and the phenomenon of turbulence. Despite these and papers on Levy processes in finance written in the mid-sixties (Fama 1965; Samuelson 1965), this statistical approach has not been pursued, essentially because of its incompatibility with the theoretical framework used by the economic mainstream.Footnote 1
 Econophysics, as a specific label and conceptual practice, was first coined by the physicist H. Eugene Stanley in 1996 in a paper published in Physica A (Stanley et al. 1996). As the name suggests, econophysics is a hybrid discipline that can be defined in methodological terms as “a quantitative approach using ideas, models, conceptual, and computational methods of statistical physics” applied to economic and especially financial phenomena (Burda et al. 2003, p. 1). The influence of physics on financial economics is nothing new. A number of writers have studied the “physical attraction” exerted by economists on physics (Mirowski 1989; Ingrao and Israel 1990; Schabas 1990). But, as McCauley points out (2004), in spite of these theoretical and historical links between physics and financial economics, econophysics represents a fundamentally new approach that differs from preceding influences. Its practitioners are not economists taking their inspiration from the work of physicists to develop their discipline, as has been seen repeatedly in the history of economics. This time, it is physicists who are going beyond the boundaries of their discipline, studying various problems brought to light through social sciences methods. Econophysicists are not attempting to integrate physics concepts into financial economics as it exists today, but rather are seeking to ignore, even deny this discipline in an attempt to replace the theoretical framework that currently dominates it with a new framework derived directly from statistical physics.Footnote 2
 Econophysics can be seen as an autonomous emerging field (Gingras and Schinckus 2010) that has generated several methodological debatesFootnote 3 with its own annual conferencesFootnote 4 and its own academic teaching and Ph.D.Footnote 5 (See Jovanovic and Schinckus 2010 for a historical analysis of the emergence of econophysics.) The development of this new discipline raises some questions about its differences and its potential contribution to financial economics. How can physicists who explicitly reject financial theory contribute to a better understanding of financial phenomena? This is the kind of question I will deal with in this article. Because financial economics and econophysics study the same kind of reality, one might think that these disciplines are very similar, but by presenting the main differences, I show in this paper that econophysics and financial economicsFootnote 6 are different but complementary approaches. Neoclassical finance cannot be indifferent to the emergence of econophysics because this new field offers explanations about the economic reality. Since models from econophysics often provide better predictions, they may take the place of financial models in the future (see Artemi (2009), for example, for the first reflection on the potential contributions of econophysics to politic decision making). In the first part of the paper, I will expose the main differences between financial economics and econophysics by emphasizing the methodological gaps between these two “false sister disciplines” (Schinckus 2010a). In the second part, I will show that these gaps can actually be considered as complementary aspects of these two disciplines. In this perspective, econophysics could be a source of inspiration for financial economists to broaden their theories.",13

The vicarious role of competition in social responsibility,June 2011,Becchetti Leonardo,Giorgio Federico,Solferino Nazaria,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fair trade is a product chain created by importers, distributors and retailers of food and textile products, which have been partially or wholly manufactured by poor rural communities in developing countries in accordance with specific social and environmental criteria. To obtain the “fair trade” label, products must comply with a series of criteria defined by the Fair Trade Labeling Organisation (FLO)Footnote 1: they must (1) pay a fair wage in the local context; (2) offer employees opportunities for advancement (including investment in local public goods); (3) provide equal employment opportunities for all people, particularly the most disadvantaged; (4) engage in environmentally sustainable practices; (5) be open to public accountability; (6) build long-term trade relationships; (7) provide healthy and safe working conditions within the local context; (8) provide technical and financial assistance (price stabilisation insurance services and anticipated financing arrangements that reduce financial constraints) to producers whenever possible.Footnote 2
 Most of these criteria may be seen as bottom-up solutions to specific market failures (Becchetti and Rosati 2007; Becchetti and Huybrechts 2008). The fair wage/price criterion states that, in the price paid to producers in the South, a much higher share of the value of the product must be transferred to them than has usually been the case. If we assume, as it often occurs, that agricultural or textile commodity producers in the South have very low bargaining power and are often paid a subsistence wage, fair trade wage may be conceived as a non-governmental minimum wage provided by private citizens in developed countries. Becchetti and Costantino (2008) also show that using prices as a policy instrument to transfer resources to the South cannot be considered a market distortion but rather a market creation because fair traders open a new market in the North in which “contingent ethical” products (combining physical products and values) are sold.Footnote 3 While this paper focus mainly on FT effects on producers in the South, several contributions focus specifically on consumers in the North (Becchetti and Rosati 2007; Becchetti and Huybrechts 2008) looking at FT as a specific example of theoretical models dealing with the more general phenomenon of socially responsible products by which some producers “retail public goods” (Besley and Ghatak 2007; see also Sect. 2.4). Fair trade products are beginning to achieve non-negligible market shares. The 2005 European Fair Trade Report illustrates that fair trade sales have grown by 20% per year in the last 5 years and that they have achieved significant market shares in some specific segments (i.e. 49% of bananas in Switzerland and 20% of ground coffee in the UK).Footnote 4
 There is plenty of evidence that a fundamental contribution to the growth of Fair Trade market shares has been provided by traditional profit-maximising producers which started to “imitate partially” Fair Trade pioneers by including fair trade products in their product range. To quote just an example, on 7 October 2000, the BBC announced that “Nestle has launched a fair trade instant coffee as it looks to tap into growing demand among consumers.” The BBC commented on this news by saying that “Ethical shopping is an increasing trend in the UK, as consumers pay more to ensure poor farmers get a better deal” and reported the comment by Fiona Kendrick, Nestle’s UK head of beverages, that “Specifically in terms of coffee, fair trade is 3% of the instant market and has been growing at good double-digit growth and continues to grow.” Following a series of similar moves towards fair trade by many other multinationals, more recently (in 2007) the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain has converted 100% of its own brand bananas and tea to fair trade, raising the UK’s fair trade market share for the two products to 25 and 10%, respectively.Footnote 5
 Fair trade mainstreaming caused by these dramatic changes has attracted the increasing interest of international institutions. The EU Commission, in a communication to the European Parliament on May 2009, declared that “Fair Trade has played a pioneering role in illuminating issues of responsibility and solidarity, which has impacted other operators and prompted the emergence of other sustainability regimes. Trade-related private sustainability initiatives use various social or environmental auditing standards, which have grown in number and market share” (European Commission 2009). A FAO’s research on agricultural commodities regards fair trade as the most effective ways to promote inclusion of marginalised producers.Footnote 6
 Based on this evidence, the theoretical analysis developed in our paper aims to investigate (1) why and how the fair trade pioneers have triggered imitative practices by traditional corporations; (2) whether competition between pioneers and “imitators” may play a vicarious role in the provision of global public goods in globally integrated economies in which there is a deficit of global governance. We try to provide an answer to these research questions by using a simple model to illustrate the essential mechanisms of competition between a fair trade pioneer and a profit-maximising competitor. Our discussion starts from the observation that the compression of distances induced by innovations in the fields of electronics and telecommunications has heightened the perception among consumers of the interdependence among countries and that they have made it more urgent to solve problems related to “market failures” and the insufficient provision of global public goods.Footnote 7
 It is within this framework, we believe, that competition for social responsibility (SR) has arisen. The process may be divided into two stages. In the first, the growing sensitivity of public opinion to social responsibilityFootnote 8 generates a series of “bottom-up” welfare initiatives usually classified under the general heading of (zero profit) socially responsible (or socially concerned) saving and consumption. This phenomenon has given rise to a first generation of pioneers selling SR products. These pioneers have acquired positive market shares and made traditional producers aware of the existence of consumers who choose not only according to price, quality and “ads induced” status symbols, but also on the basis of the social or environmental values incorporated in the products. In a second step, the entry by pioneers has triggered a competitive reaction by traditional producers, which is based not only on prices but also on partial imitation in the field of social responsibility. Within the above-described framework, the model outlined in this paper analyses the structure and consequences of the “social responsibility game” between a fair trader and profit-maximising producer. In this respect, the paper represents an original contribution in the theoretical literature on CSR competition (Besley and Ghatak 2007; Mitrokostas and Petrakis (2008); Manasakis et al. 2007) to the specific case of fair trade. According to our model’s characteristics, as described in the following section, the SR feature coincides with the application of the set of specific FT criteria along the value chain. These criteria promote a series of actions to foster the inclusion of South producers with low bargaining power in international markets. Hence, SR is related to what happens in the productive process and in the overall value chain behind the product more than to the intrinsic features of the product sold. In our framework, we also take into account the possible differences between a more radical and a more pragmatic approach to the FT (and we discuss them in Sects. 5 and 6). An example of why this may be relevant can be easily obtained from the comparison between the Charter of Fair Trade criteria approved by the 2005 Assembly of Italian world shops and the 10 international Fair Trade criteria established by IFAT, the international organisation that gathers producers and Fair Trade organisations (see “Appendix”, Sections A1 and A2).Footnote 9
 The article is divided into eight sections (including the introduction and conclusions). In the second section, we briefly describe the basic features of the model, this being a product differentiation duopoly in which physical distance is reinterpreted as “social responsibility” distance. In section three and four, we analyse the sequential entry version of the model in which a profit-maximising incumbent reacts to the entry of a socially responsible player. We analyse equilibria under the two different cases of incumbent fixed ethical location and incumbent joint reaction in prices and ethical location, outlining the conditions under which the latter decides to partially imitate the entrant. In the fifth and sixth sections, we describe solutions of a simultaneous game in prices and ethical location played by a profit maximising and a zero profit socially responsible player. In the seventh section, we compare equilibria of the previously mentioned versions of the model with the socially optimal price and locations fixed by a social planner, which maximises the welfare of consumers with heterogeneous preferences on social responsibility. The eighth section of the article concludes by highlighting what we consider the main results of the analysis. First of all, we find that, under reasonable parametric conditions, the optimal reaction of the monopolist incumbent (from now on also profit-maximising producer or PMP) to the entry of socially responsible producers is ethical imitation
. Neverthless, the FT’s location choices may have a different impact in fostering PMP’s ethical imitation depending on whether he maximises total transfers to the South or his own transfers. While in the first case, the FT will be more radical in social responsibility, in the second one he will be more pragmatic and reduce his own activity in order to elicit more imitation from the PMP. When we compare the optimal prices and locations of the two players with those of a social planner maximising the welfare of consumers in the North, we find that all equilibria in the game exhibit excessive social responsibility from a domestic welfare perspective. Such result is crucially affected by our assumption of a duopolistic product market and by the complementarity between prices and ethical location. Too much social responsibility at domestic level may turn into adequate social responsibility at international level if we consider that an international social planner, by incorporating the preferences of South producers, would aim to achieve a higher level of SR than the domestic one. The experience of fair trade therefore shows that an (oligopolistic) market mechanism based on the strategic complementarity between prices and social responsibility may compensate with entirely private and voluntary mechanisms the absence of an international social planner.",9
58,2,International Review of Economics,01 April 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0121-1,"Uncertainty, trust, and the regulation of the banking industry",June 2011,Enzo Dia,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The role of financial intermediaries has been explored along several dimensions in the last three decades, and a careful study of the problems caused by asymmetric information and incomplete contracts has brought a far deeper understanding of many of their basic features. In particular, we now have a better picture of how financial intermediaries help agents to cooperate, by providing several different services that share some common characteristics: These services reduce transaction and information costs, helping agents to share information, and allowing them to pool different risks, and to get insurance against several kinds of shocks.
Footnote 1 Cosimano (2004) discusses another important dimension of the role of financial intermediaries, suggesting that “the financial institution’s role in this world is to provide information and enforce contracts so that the parties to the business deal act cooperatively.”
Footnote 2 Cosimano builds his argument on the theory, proposed by Dixit (2003), that economic governance is often based on private intermediaries that supply both information and enforcement, which improve upon no governance. Intermediaries can thus help cooperation when the lack of trust prevents agents from exploiting relevant gains from trade and can do so independently of the role that the legal system, and efficient state organizations, play. Understanding trust relationships in financial transactions is important. Although the legal framework is fundamental to reduce uncertainty, and reinforce unwritten rules of conduct, many financial transactions are not supported by sophisticated contracts, and very large sums of money are continuously moved by means of telephone calls, with contracts sealed by trusting the word of other agents. Moreover, many bank-lending contracts are not backed by collateral, and lenders largely rely on trust and reputation to price the risk of these transactions. For example, relationship-lending practices, based on subjective valuations of the reliability of the borrowers, are widely diffused and represent the main source of finance for small and medium firms in most banking systems. Moreover, in several countries, “name lending”, where credit is supported by the reputation of the family of the borrower is common, and not only in countries where informal credit institutions are the main provider of finance.
Footnote 3 Finally, financial crises are characterized by confidence crises, driven by the collapse of trust relationships among agents, and are ultimately solved only when trust is restored. In this paper, I further develop Cosimano’s approach, by suggesting that financial intermediaries help cooperation by building trust relationships, whenever the impact of uncertainty on individual choices makes it very difficult to obtain the benefits from trade. My original contribution is focused on four main arguments. The first is that while diversification benefits can sharply reduce risk, in presence of uncertainty these benefits can become very hard to achieve, and, in some cases, diversification can even become counterproductive. When this is the case, the presence of intermediaries becomes necessary. The second, related point, is that when uncertainty is ubiquitous and individual choices are made on the basis of subjective evaluations, the transmission of information is too expensive, so that the decision-making process must be based on other agents’ knowledge, and must be based on trust. The third point is that trust, in this respect, does not simply mean the expectation of a low probability of being cheated, but a more far reaching appreciation of the capabilities and knowledge of the other cooperating agents. Finally, I stress that the relationships of mutual trust that allow agents to pool each others’ subjective valuations and individual knowledge and capabilities, represent an important component of social capital. This kind of capital, however, is subject to sudden depreciation when negative shocks bring the collapse of mutual trust, generating confidence crises. Section 2 of this paper discusses the role of uncertainty and trust for a theory of financial intermediation and the banking firm. Section 3 draws some implications for the market structure and the regulatory framework of the banking industry. I suggest that too narrow a focus on information may obscure the importance of trust for financial transactions, so that a regulatory framework devised on the assumption that information disclosure can always improve the efficiency of financial markets may be exposed to some weaknesses. In particular, an important issue still open following the financial crisis is why and how have the incentives of bankers changed so widely during the past two decades, so that they have abandoned traditional prudential rules of conduct for aggressive risk taking. The diffusion of managerial compensation schemes, such as stock options, has been largely blamed for these developments. However, this is a very partial answer, since the question then becomes why and how managerial incentives rewarding risk taking more than prudence have become widespread. A second answer is that bank creditors, such as depositors or bond-holders, did not impose a large enough price for risk, because the price for risk was distorted by explicit or implicit state guarantees. Price distortions have certainly played an important role; however, they cannot be the only answer, since virtually all of the banks that did not get too strained during the crisis, because still adhering to old-fashioned basic principles of prudent banking, were largely funded by means of deposits, so that they were benefiting particularly from these guarantees.
Footnote 4 Most of the problems, on the contrary, came from the innovative financial tools, such as securitization or structured products, that have allowed the extremely fast growth of several intermediaries. This work suggests that these innovative financial contracts were not backed by trust and reputation mechanism as traditional banking activities, since they were apparently based on publicly available information and the disclosure of private knowledge. The shadow banking system emerging from these market-based transactions was thus much more risky and fragile than the traditional one, based on private information and unwritten rules of conduct. Virtually everybody was convinced that the opposite was true, namely that a financial system where intermediaries would originate and distribute risk was inherently safer since it increased diversification. The deregulation process of the financial industry of the 1990s was based on the principle that information disclosure would make the market for securities more efficient, allowing a better pricing and allocation of risk. Several innovations in the regulatory regime that followed, such as mark to market rules, or the possibility to use risk assessments provided by rating agencies, or by valuation models based on past performance of securities (as with the VAR), to price the risks undertaken, were all built on the assumption that information disclosure, by allowing more risk diversification, would make the financial system safer. This paper challenges these broadly held opinions.",5

Gazi Salah Uddin,Abdullah M. Noman,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"With the advent of globalization, the flows of remittances worldwide have increased drastically. Remittances worldwide were less than US$ 2 billion in 1970 and slightly over US$ 70 billion in 1995 (Taylor 1999). However, in 2006, 150 million migrants worldwide sent more than US$ 300 billion to their families in developing countries (IFAD 2010). Developing countries have attracted the major share of remittance inflows whose contribution to the respective economies has been an area of publicity and attention. However, the volume of research examining the relationship between remittances and output in those countries is not encouraging yet. Despite a number of cross-country exercises, country-specific studies on this aspect have remained deficient. Our goal is to fill out that gap with one of the fastest growing Asian countries, Bangladesh, which is one of the “top 10” remittance-recipient countries in the world as well. Bangladesh’s position in 2008 was ninth in that “top 10” list after India, China, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Nigeria, Egypt, and Romania (Ratha et al. 2008). Between 1976 and 2010, a total of 6.8 million people emigrated temporarily from Bangladesh (BMET 2010). While globalization has augmented trade volume and capital flows, labor mobility has still remained limited due to various reasons such as unemployment concerns and nationalism issues in work-place countries. Given this reality, Bangladesh’s emigration figure is quite respectable. Income from remittances has recently exceeded the 10-billion dollar mark, which has been 11.8% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 (BBS 2010; GOB 2009). Revenues from remittances now exceed various types of foreign exchange inflow, particularly official development assistance and net earnings from exports. The growth rate of this source is also spectacular. Remittance inflows to Bangladesh are increasing at an average annual rate of 19% in the last 30 years from 1979 to 2008 (Hussain and Naeem 2009). Bangladesh is registering an average annual growth rate of more than 5% over the last two decades (WB 2009). An upward movement in both output and remittances has raised some questions in Bangladesh’s perspective such as: (1) Is there any long-term relationship between GDP and remittances? (2) Is the relationship between remittances and output, if any, unidirectional or bidirectional? (3) What are the short-run relationships between these variables? Our study attempts to answer these questions in the context of Bangladesh. Despite the conventional belief that remittances are highly beneficial to output, the existing literature does not point out any conclusive result in this respect. Chami et al. (2003), in a study covering 113 countries, find that remittances have a negative effect on growth. The authors conclude that income from remittances allows receiving families to decrease their own work and productivity, which then translates into a reduction in the labor supply for the developing country. Contrary to Chami et al. (2003), Pradhan et al. (2008) in a work with 39 developing countries over the 1980–2004 period, find that remittances have a positive impact on growth. In a work with 73 countries, Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz (2009) shows that remittances have positive effects on growth only in countries with small financial sectors, because remittances provide an alternative way to finance investment and reduce liquidity constraints. An IMF (2005) study with 101 developing countries finds no statistical link between remittances and per capita output growth. This inconclusive result is attributed to measurement difficulties arising from the fact that remittances may behave countercyclically with respect to growth (see also Frankel 2009). A study by Adams and Page (2005) using 71 developing countries finds that remittances significantly reduce the level, depth, and severity of poverty in the developing world. Jongwanich (2007) examines the impact of workers’ remittances on growth and poverty in Asia–Pacific developing countries and finds that remittances have a significant impact on poverty reduction and a trivial impact on growth. Working with 114 countries, Catrinescua et al. (2009) confirm that their research has not come to consensus over whether remittances have positive or negative impact on long-run growth. Thus, big panel or cross-country studies often contradict to each other in their findings. These differences in results on the relation between remittances and output are mainly attributable to institutional differences such as economic and political idiosyncrasies across countries (see also Catrinescua et al. 2009). Stark and Levhari (1982) discuss different spending patterns of remittance income in LDCs. Over the period 1969–1998 and using data from Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, and Portugal, Glytsos (2005) shows that the impact of remittances on output varies over time and across countries. Hence, country-specific studies are warranted, and our study is an attempt towards filling that gap. While Stark and Lucas (1988), Taylor (1992), and Faini (2002) find a positive impact of remittances on consumption and income, most country studies reflect that result. As Zarate-Hoys (2004) shows, Mexican migrant families invest a significant part of their remittance income in productive activities. He claims that expenditures originating from remittances benefit the national economy as the multiplier effect works through labor and goods markets across Mexico. Ang (2007) finds that remittances influence economic growth positively and significantly in the case of the Philippines. Ahmed and Walmsley (2009) find a net increase in welfare and real income due to increasing inflows of remittances to India. By using the ARDL approach, Qayyum et al. (2008) find that remittances affected the economic growth of Pakistan positively and significantly over the 1973–2007 period. They also find that the short-term effect of remittances on GDP is negative. Although we notice a number of studies particularly with reference to South Asian countries, a long-term approach, as seen in Qayyum, with Bangladesh’s remittances and output is either absent or deficient. Some of the early studies focused on the macroeconomic impact of overseas remittances in Bangladesh (Ali 1981; Salim 1992; Matin 1994). Ali identified that remittances help Bangladesh achieve a favorable balance of payments, as well as create a new resource base for the country. Salim discusses how remittances are used to make import payments and for other productive investments by the Bangladesh government. Mahmud (1989) discusses the impact of remittances on the consumption patterns and the economy of Bangladesh. Hussain and Naeem (2009) find the short-run countercyclicality of remittances over the 1979–2008 period. None of the studies in the past attempted to examine the long-term relationship between these two variables. However, an ARDL approach was attempted in Rahman (2009) that studies the contribution of remittances along with exports and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to GDP for the four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, over the 1976–2006 period. But the long-term relationship between remittances and output is still unclear in that study due to two reasons: (1) No joint significance of the F statistics with exclusively remittances and output was tested and (2) output was always placed in the LHS ruling out the possibility of the reverse causation from output to remittances. Our study fills out that gap by exclusively including remittances and output, and attempting to find their short-run as well as long-term relationships in the Bangladesh economy over a longer period of time than before. We use the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) models with bounds testing approach in this work. This technique, a relatively new approach to cointegration developed by (Pesaran et al. 2001), has comparative advantages over other existing cointegration methods, as detailed in the next section. Now we briefly preview the results. Contrary to conventional belief, it is output that determines long-run movements in remittances in a positive direction in the Bangladesh economy over the last 35 years from 1976 to 2010. However, remittances do not appear to be a long-run forcing variable to the explanation of Bangladesh’s output. While examining the channels of this output–remittance mechanism remains an area of research for the future, we hypothesize that the rise in remittances in response to increased income occurs through higher import demand and greater investment opportunities. The coefficients to reflect short-run dynamics between output and remittances are not significant yet. This finding has policy implications in influencing Bangladesh’s remittances through its national output in the long run. The remainder of this paper comprises three sections. Data and methodology are described in Sect. 2. Section 3 includes all ARDL model estimations and bounds testing results. And Sect. 4 concludes.",19

If so, how? The answer to these questions is neither easy nor uncontroversial. Indeed, as observed by Cronby (2007, p. 149), “between neuroscience and social science there has been something of a history of mutual distrust, a reluctance within each discipline to engage constructively with the others’ theories and research, and a lack of comprehension of each others’ assumptions, methods, goals and findings.” This paper provides an introduction to a special issue of the International Review of Economics dedicated to these questions. We argue that an interdisciplinary approach bridging the gap between the different theoretical approaches and methodologies of social sciences and neurosciences may provide the basis for more accurate models of decision making and a better understanding of social phenomena. In order to illustrate this point, we focus on the recent economic literature on reciprocal fairness as a paradigmatic example of the potential synergies between social sciences and neurosciences. Theories of intention-based reciprocity rely on three key assumptions. First, agents derive utility from responding in kind to the actions of other agents. Second, in order to assess the kindness of an action, agents need to interpret the intentions of other agents, thus being able to view the interaction from the other agents’ perspective. Third, agents must explicitly take into account the effects of their own actions on others. How does all this happen in practice? Building on a large body of behavioral evidence in the social sciences, neuroscience has recently provided important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying our concern for reciprocal fairness and the capacity to take other agents’ perspective and share their feelings. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the definition and relevance of reciprocal fairness. Section 3 reviews the behavioral evidence on reciprocity, identifying several unanswered questions regarding, in particular, what determines the perceived kindness of an action. Section 4 discusses some of the recent neuroeconomic evidence about reciprocal preferences, mind reading and empathy. Section 5 introduces the papers contained in this special issue and briefly outlines their respective contributions.",2
58,3,International Review of Economics,11 June 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0129-6,"Can cognitive neuroscience give rise to satellite disciplines, such as neuro-economics?",September 2011,Carlo Umiltà,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, a number of supposedly new disciplines have emerged. They are all characterized by the prefix “neuro” added to the name of a traditional discipline from the fields of social sciences or humanities. (see, e.g., Beck 2010; Legrenzi and Umiltà 2011) As a result, we now have “neuro-sociology,” “neuro-politics,” “neuro-ethics,” “neuro-philosophy,” and so on, even “neuro-esthetics,” “neuro-theology,” and “neuro-marketing.” The discipline of “neuro-economics” figures prominently among these (new?) disciplines, to which I will collectively refer with the term “neuro+” disciplines. An obvious question to ask is whether the flourishing of “neuro+” disciplines is an index of a true and fruitful cross-fertilization between the fields of social sciences and humanities in general (and of economics, in particular) and the field of (cognitive) neuroscience. I suspect that the answer to this question should be in the negative, on several grounds. The first reason for providing a negative answer is that the “neuro+” disciplines rest on the assumption of “modularity.” I will argue that modularity is not the only possible way to conceive of the relations between mental functions and brain areas. The second reason is that the assumption of modularity becomes useful for exploring the relations between mental functions and brain areas only on condition that the researcher has at his/her disposal ways for determining with precision which brain areas are active at a given moment, while a human being is performing a given task (customarily, human beings who take part in an experiment are referred to as “participants”). I will argue that in spite of the vast popularity modern brain-imagining techniques enjoy (Beck 2010), that is not (yet?) the case. The general procedure of brain-imagining studies is that of asking healthy participants to perform experimental tasks and simultaneously to record brain activations (see, e.g., Posner and Raichle 1994; Van Horn and Gazzaniga 2002). If we assume that the mental functions required for performing the experimental tasks are known and that we are able to isolate the brain activations that are specific to those mental functions, then it will be possible to map mental functions into selectively activated brain areas. That might become feasible in the future. As of now, however, that is nothing more than a long, and, as such, rather uncertain, shot. The third reason for providing a negative answer to the opening question I asked is that the experimental task that is performed by a participant, while the researcher is trying to map mental functions into brain areas, must be known in detail (I will use the term mental functions rather than cognitive processes because the latter term would leave out emotional processes). That is, the researcher must know precisely what mental functions are required to perform the experimental task and what is the time course of these functions. I will argue that, in spite of the great advances of modern psychology, for very few tasks, if any, we have the type of knowledge that would be necessary. Indeed, psychological research has not yet clarified with any degree of certainty the mental functions that are necessary to execute even simple experimental tasks, not to speak of the time course of those mental functions. The fourth reason is that, even assuming that the conditions listed previously are met, what we would have achieved is simply to map mental functions into brain areas. That is, we would be able to “localize” mental functions in the brain. However, localizing does not mean explaining. Even if it were possible to map-specific mental functions into well-localized brain areas, which presently is not, the explanatory value of brain localization is doubtful. Localizing a mental function in the brain would not explain that function. In order to explain why and how a given mental function occurs, knowing where in the brain it takes place is of little help. A true explanation requires being precise and explicit about the mechanisms that cause that mental function. I will conclude by arguing that, before welcoming the fruits of collaboration with cognitive neuroscience, social sciences in general, and economics in particular, should wait for new and decisive advances. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and new techniques for recording the activity of large populations of single neurons are, hopefully, first steps in that direction (see the end of the present paper).",2

How are economics and neuroscience brought together in neuroeconomics? As two indispensable, equally important sources of knowledge and tools for addressing particular issues? Or are economics and neuroscience supposed to mutually enrich and inform each other in neuroeconomics? If so, what does such a form of cross-fertilization look like? Or is neuroeconomics a one-street affair in which neuroscience enriches and informs economics? Or, finally, does neuroeconomics amount to a reduction of economics to neuroscience? Is the guiding idea that in the end a fully mature neuroscience will tell us everything we want to know about decision-making so that there is no need any more for a separate economic decision theory? In this paper, I tackle these questions not by surmising what neuroeconomics could be in principle, but by having a close look at how neuroeconomics is actually practiced. I start with a discussion of how neuroeconomics emerged as a new field with two very different camps. I will dwell on the many differences between them—some substantive, having to do with different views on how the brain functions, and others more directly related to the very understanding of the new field of neuroeconomics and of what it ultimately aims to accomplish. I will illustrate one major substantive disagreement between the two camps with a discussion of neuro-imaging studies of intertemporal choice. Subsequently, I argue that the two camps seem to be converging now on many different counts. I conclude the paper with a discussion of what economics, given its traditional concerns and subject matter, can expect to gain from neuroeconomics.",

Levine,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The point of departure for most neuroeconomics is what has come to be called behavioral economics. A reader of this literature might rightfully conclude that the old rational man of economics has been rejected in favor of more realistic models of human behavior that incorporate insights from psychology. The old model supposes hyperrationality of individuals, and as a consequence, existing economic theory is useless. We can complete the behavioral revolution in economic thought by peering into the brain in order to build far more models of decision making. Unfortunately, this assessment of the nature and state of modern economics is false. In this paper, I will document the basic strength of existing theory. It is only by understanding its true weaknesses—which revolve around preferences far more than decision making—that can we understand what if any role there can be for neuroeconomics. I proceed in several steps. In Sect. 2, I document that modern economic theory works well for the problems that economists are most interested in. In Sect. 3, I consider results from ultimatum bargaining games that are widely considered to be inconsistent with theory—showing that in fact the quantitative departure from the theory is not large. The key problem—as I indicate in Sect. 4—is not that the theory is wrong, but rather that the theory is weak. Section 5 considers an important modern theoretical construct—quantal response equilibrium—and shows how this predicts the “winner’s curse” phenomenon. I then illustrate in Sect. 6 the theoretical concepts of approximate equilibrium and quantal response equilibrium along with the role of altruism in the difficult setting of a one-off game in which it is necessary to randomize. These tools enable us to pinpoint in a useful way what is and is not anomalous about the experimental data. Up until this point, I have focused on experimental data. The crucial issue, however, is whether the theory works well outside the laboratory. Did it somehow fail to predict the recent economic crisis? I address this issue in Sect. 7 where I explain how the common perception of failure is based primarily on a misunderstanding of the theory. Then, in Sect. 8, I turn to behavioral economics as an alternative to traditional theory. While existing theory clearly needs strengthening, I indicate how many behavioral models instead attempt to remedy the theory where it is already strong—pointing in directions that are often be misleading. Finally, I wrap up by considering what we might hope neuroeconomics—brain scanning, for example—can and cannot contribute to economics. The general theme of this discussion is not that economic theory is perfect, but it does work well in a variety of circumstances, and without a clear understanding of where the theory is weak and where it is strong, there is little hope of strengthening it—through neuroeconomics or any other means.",10

Whether setting out to explain an institution like marriage, an organization like a political party or a practice such as cheerleading in sport, the starting point is always the same: to understand the significance of such phenomena for the individual and how, beginning from a single action, they have been generated or could be generated through the aggregation or interaction of multiple actions. Consequently, one of the most important concerns of contemporary philosophy of social sciences is the relationship between the researcher and human behavior, specifically the modality employed by the social researcher to understand or predict the actions of a social agent through the identification of her mental states. This is not a new theme. Weber (1949) had already been influential in describing the main problems in the relationship between the researcher and social action. The researcher attempts to identify empathetically with the agent’s mental life, pinpointing the reasons and motivations that caused him to act in a certain manner. In so doing, he also requires essential information about the setting in which the agent acted. Contextual information, together with specific psychological information about the agent, permits a more precise, more realistic process of verstehen,Footnote 2 or understanding of the action. This investigative approach is adopted for both predictive analysis and retrodictive analysis. In predictive analysis, of particular interest to economists, the researcher attempts to predict the agent’s behavior by identifying with the agent’s mental life, determining his beliefs and goals and inferring his choice of action from them. In retrodictive analysis, favored in particular by sociologists or anthropologists, the researcher uses the action as a basis to reconstruct the possible underlying beliefs and desires, in other words, the meaning of the action. What principle guides the researcher in inferring a choice of action from particular beliefs and desires of the agent or in reconstructing the beliefs and desires that caused an action? Through the identification process, the researcher should be able to intercept the inferential principles guiding the agent, even when those principles differ from his own. As when dealing with members of other cultures or other psychic groups, like the immature or deviants, the researcher should quarantine his own principles of inferential rationality and identify those of the agent. Cognitive identification and simulation is the necessary premise to understand an action and generalize it into an ideal type representing aggregate social behavior or a social phenomenon. The paper will analyze the consequences of brain studies on mind reading about the main theories of social action (this paper will refer to Viale 2009).",1
58,4,International Review of Economics,05 November 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0139-4,Reaching for the stars: the appointment of celebrities to corporate boards,December 2011,Stephen P. Ferris,Kenneth A. Kim,Emre Unlu,Male,Male,Male,Male,"When Gateway Computers announced the appointment of Elizabeth Dole to its board of directors, its stock price jumped 13.66% that day. The Disney Company’s stock price went up 4.24% when actor Sidney Poitier was announced as a director. Why do firms appoint O.J. Simpson, Evander Holyfield, Billy Jean King, Deepak Chopra, Lynn Swann, and other celebrities to their boards? The objective of this study is to examine the effect that the appointment of celebrities to a board of directors has upon the firm’s stock price and its visibility in the marketplace. This issue is especially interesting since celebrities generally lack business or previous corporate experience, and it is often unclear what skills they bring to their appointment. We pose five research questions regarding the appointment of celebrities to the boards of U.S. corporations. Our first question investigates the effect on shareholder wealth by the appointment of celebrity directors. On the whole, we find that such appointments enhance firm value. These findings lead to our second research question. How does the appointment of celebrity directors improve firm value? We propose as an explanation that these appointments enhance a firm’s visibility to investors. Celebrities on boards can enhance the public prestige and standing of a given board. A celebrity can make a corporate board more visible to both consumers and investors. Elberse (2007), for instance, notes how a celebrity provides free advertising for an organization. She further argues that this increased prominence due to the celebrity’s presence can increase the ability of the organization to secure more resources. In the case of a corporate board, this might mean the recruitment of high ability directors. Podolny (1993) contends that the presence of celebrities within an organization can provide it with an advantage in its competition with others. That is, the development of a board with high ability directors might provide a firm with a competitive advantage over rivals with less talented boards. Groysberg, Polzer, and Anger-Elfenbein (2010) study Wall Street equity analysts and conclude that groups benefit from having members who achieve high levels of individual performance or renown. They argue that the contribution of star individuals can drive organizational success indirectly by enhancing the group’s perceived status among critical external constituencies. Hence, celebrities on boards might improve a firm’s ability to attract new customers, find business partners, or obtain new capital from investors. We recognize, however, that some celebrities might bring relevant experience to their board assignments. For example, Martha Stewart holds a seat on the board of Revlon. While Martha Stewart is a celebrity, she is also a capable business person who successfully operates her own corporation. Therefore, we identify Martha Stewart’s board appointment as a “related” one since the celebrity also brings associated business knowledge or skills. Thus, our third research question inquires whether there is a differential effect on firm value based on the levels of business skills that a celebrity possesses? Not surprisingly, we find that “related” celebrity director appointments generate larger announcement returns than “unrelated” celebrity appointments. However, the announcement period returns of unrelated celebrity appointments are still significantly larger than the announcement returns of related non-celebrity appointments. Further, the announcement returns for related celebrity appointments are larger than announcement returns for related non-celebrity appointments. These two latter findings imply that relatedness by itself does not explain the positive market reaction to celebrity board appointments. Indeed, we conclude that there is a pure celebrity effect associated with the announcement of such individuals to corporate boards. After finding that the market reacts positively to the appointment of celebrity directors, we then ask what are the long-run returns for these appointing firms. For holding periods of 1, 2, and 3 years following celebrity director appointments, we find that the firms’ abnormal returns are positive even after controlling for the Fama–French three factors. We observe that the long-run returns for related celebrity appointments are larger than for unrelated celebrity appointments, but the long-run returns for both types of celebrity appointments are generally positive and statistically significant. The last research question we pose in this study is whether there is any evidence of an increase in visibility following the appointment of a celebrity director. If celebrities enhance firms’ visibility, then these firms should subsequently experience increases in analyst coverage intensity and institutional ownership.Footnote 1 Indeed, we find that analyst coverage intensity, proxied by the total number of earnings forecast revisions during the year, increases after firms appoint celebrity directors. We find this to be true for both related and unrelated celebrity director appointments. This is not true for firms that appoint related but non-celebrity directors. Institutional ownership, as measured by the number of institutional owners and also by the percent of shares held by institutions, also increases following celebrity director appointments. These findings are robust to the inclusion of alternate explanatory variables in our multivariate analysis of visibility. All of these results are consistent with the visibility hypothesis. The importance of these findings resides in their implications for a broader set of issues in corporate governance. Most critically, this study offers insights into factors that influence the quality and effectiveness of corporate governance as it is currently exercised. Further, our results highlight the significance of social networking in both the development of a board of directors and its operations. It suggests that networking serves as a critical process by which boards are created and make decisions. Our study also illustrates the importance of demographic analysis for an understanding of board effectiveness and behavior. It makes important extensions to the nascent board demographic literature of Agrawal and Knoeber (2001) and Fich (2005). Our sample of directors is different from those of either Agrawal and Knoeber or Fich. Agrawal and Knoeber examine only outside directors with backgrounds in politics and law while Fich analyzes those outside directors with first-time appointments. Our sample consists only of outside directors who have celebrity status. This focus allows us to ask a set of research questions regarding the valuation effect of these celebrity board appointments that have not yet been examined in the board literature. Further, we provided new findings regarding the ability of outsider directors to bring value to a firm through a new channel: corporate visibility and public awareness. Finally, this study explores a sample of appointments over the period 1985 through 2006, which includes a post Sarbanes–Oxley Act period. The preceding studies use a more limited and dated sample period that excludes the effects of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 on U.S. corporate governance. Agrawal and Knoeber examine firms over the 1987–1999 period, while Fich limits her analysis to 1997–1999.",6
58,4,International Review of Economics,30 September 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-011-0134-9,Wage inequality in developing countries: South–South trade matters,December 2011,Julien Gourdon,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The relationship between trade liberalization and inequality has received considerable attention in recent years. Integration with world markets bears the promise of prosperity in developing countries. Predictions by economists concerning inequality suggest that lower tariffs and transportation costs will push each country to specialize in the production of goods for which it has a comparative advantage. Since unskilled labor is abundant in the developing world and skilled labor in the developed world, globalization should, therefore, increase the relative demand for unskilled labor in poor countries, thereby reducing wage inequality. Empirical evidence, however, does not support these predictions. Studies on income distribution have not found clear cut answers, and studies on wages have mainly found an increasing wage inequality during trade liberalization (often in Latin American countries). In light of these unexpected results, several studies have attempted to explain wage inequality during trade liberalization (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2004). The main explanation provided in such studies is that the skill-biased technological change that accompanies trade liberalization favors the wages of skilled workers in Northern and Southern countries. In this study, we investigate a different explanation for wage inequality following trade liberalization: the direction of trade. A developing country might trade with another developing country. Hence, the impact on wage inequality in this case may not correspond to the classical Stolper-Samuelson result. Davis (1996) was the first to formalize the idea that developing countries that are labor-abundant relative to developed countries, but are skill-abundant relative to other developing countries may see an increase in wage inequality after trade liberalization. Taking into account South–South (S–S) trade, we revisit the effect of skill-biased technological change in considering a sector-biased, rather than factor-biased, technological change. Pursuing this reasoning, globalization not only leads to increasing North–South (N–S) trade, but it also changes the direction and composition of trade. Today, more trade is carried out between developing countries, and more developing countries are exporting manufactures. Indeed South–South trade now accounts for about two-fifths of all developing country merchandise trade and around 12% of global merchandise trade. Trade liberalization has underpinned this development, with average tariff levels around one-third of their 1985 levels. As the developing country markets become more important for other developing countries, and future trade liberalization will mainly involve South–South trade,Footnote 1 a better understanding of developing country trade policies and their impact on inequalityFootnote 2 becomes crucial. This analysis examines two predictions in order to better understand the impact of South–South trade on wage inequality in developing countries. First, when accounting for heterogeneity among developing countries, we might discover as Davis (1996) and Wood (1997) stated that upper-middle income countries are the “Northern” countries among developing countries and South–South trade will increase wage inequality in those countries. In this case, trade liberalization effects are only a transposition of classical North–South trade theory. In order to estimate wage inequality, the analysis includes two trade ratios; the first one measures trade liberalization with developed countries and the second one measures trade liberalization with developing countries.Footnote 3 In including them successively and together in the estimation, we find that increasing wage inequality is more due to the South–South trade liberalization than to the classical North–South trade liberalization. Clustering our sample of developing countries according to their income makes it possible to observe if this effect is more important in middle-income countries given that in South–South trade the comparative advantage of middle-income countries shifts to goods of intermediate skill intensity. The second prediction is that trade liberalization with Northern or Southern countries could also bring inequality among workers if those who have the skills needed to adjust to the new technologies benefit from increased economic integration while the others are left behind. The question here is how to link trade liberalization, technological change, and wage inequality. Studies that link trade liberalization and technological change assume that increasing imports of machinery increases wage inequality in developing countries by introducing skill-biased technological change (SBTC). Using this machinery requires skilled workers, which in turn increases the relative demand for skilled workers. This potentially leads to increased productivity and the remuneration of those skilled workers. Nevertheless, Haskel and Slaughter (2002) demonstrate that in many cases, it is the sector bias of SBTC that determines SBTC’s effect on relative factor prices, not its factor bias. Rising (falling) skill premium is caused by SBTC that is concentrated in skill-intensive (unskill-intensive) sectors. Hence, we investigate whether in developing countries, S–S trade increases the total factor productivity (TFP) in skill-intensive sectors more than in unskill-intensive sectors compared to N–S trade. Concerning inequality, this study focuses only on wage inequality that is closest to the predictions of Stolper-Samuelson. Most previous studies on wage inequality have only dealt with country case studies—mainly in Latin America—because of the lack of comparable wage data across countries. It should be noted, however, that developing countries are heterogeneous and it is difficult to obtain results that can be generalized from country case studies. Studies on panels of developing countries use Gini coefficients that measure inequality in income and thus include the revenue from capital and natural resources. A homogeneous dataset on inter-industry wage inequality that has become available recently enables us to examine wage inequality across industries rather than among workers as it has been the usual practice in the literature on wage inequality. A brief overview of our results shows first that increasing the share of S–S trade increases wage inequality for all developing countries. Second, a part of the increasing wage inequality due to S–S trade comes from the development of N–S trade relationship within developing countries, which increases wage inequality in middle-income developing countries. Third, the fact that S–S trade leads more to a technological change biased toward skill-intensive sectors increases wage inequality for all developing countries. Fourth, this indirect effect is more important in low-income countries. The remainder of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review on trade liberalization and wage inequality in developing countries. Section 3 provides an overview of the methodology adopted to carry out this analysis. Section 4 presents the results concerning our assumption on the impact of S–S trade and N–S trade on wage inequalities with an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator and some robustness check. Section 5 presents the results with a generalized method of moments (GMM) system estimator. Section 6 concludes.",10

Besides economic growth, SC has a critical influence on facets of socioeconomic outcomes. Investigation of the relationship between health status and SC is a major topic in economic policy research. Empirical analyses have presented evidence that SC has a critical influence on health-related behaviors and related outcomes (e.g., Costa-Font and Mladovsky 2008; Islam et al. 2008; Laporte et al. 2008; Scheffler and Brown 2008; Yamaoka 2008; Ichida et al. 2009). Although positive relationships between health status and SC have been observed in some studies (e.g., Kawachi et al. 1997, 1999; Islam et al. 2006; Petrou and Kupek 2008), others do not report a positive association (Iversen 2008). Most existing literature has failed to consider the reasons why the relationship between SC and health status varies, at least from the point of view of economics.Footnote 2 An individual’s decision to accumulate SC can be explained by a standard optimal investment model (Glaeser et al. 2002). Putnam (2000) notes that the extent to which people volunteer or take part in neighborhood activities is considered SC; that is, participation in such activities is an investment in SC. Therefore, the economic conditions confronting people are thought to have an influence on health outcomes through SC accumulation. Consideration of the constraints under which people make a decision to accumulate SC would be important when analyzing the effects of SC on health. If time can be allocated to work and leisure, time for investing in SC can be considered a part of one’s leisure time because people participate in neighborhood activity when they are not working. Furthermore, non-workers are more likely to rely on the mutual assistance provided by SC when they are sick, because under budget constraints they are not able to use assistance supplied in the market. Few researchers, however, have attempted to investigate empirically the extent to which the condition of the labor market is associated with SC, and in turn health status.Footnote 3 This paper aims to examine how and the extent to which the effect of SC on health status differs between workers and non-workers by using individual-level data from a Japanese sample. As well, two-stage estimations are employed to control for an endogeneity bias of SC. This paper is the first to compare the influence of SC on health status across different work statuses. The data set used in this paper is cross-section in structure and was conducted in 2000. In this paper, 3, 991 observations collected from all around Japan are used. Respondents were adult males and females over 20 years of age. The crucial finding in this paper is that SC improves health status for non-workers but not for workers. The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows: In Sect. 2, the data, method of analysis, and estimation strategy are described. The results of the estimation and their interpretation are provided in Sect. 3. The final section offers concluding remarks.",6

(1994) and Chari and Kehoe (1999) for theoretical work. However, the government can affect economic fluctuations also by other instruments of which an important one is the publicly provided social insurance program. This program has increasingly attracted the attention of research. Past research, however, either has put all these sources of governmental impact into one overall variable to elaborate on the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy or has been directed toward estimating program specific effects on the microeconomic level. So far, the investigation into the macroeconomic effects of specific public social programs has been left untouched. In the United States, the unemployment insurance program constitutes one of the major social security systems. It provides payments and income protection for those who have involuntarily lost their jobs. During normal times, unemployment benefit payments are provided through the regular unemployment compensation program, which is administered and funded at the state level. Regular benefit payments occur on a weekly basis and replace 50–80% of the pre-unemployment earnings. In the majority of the states, this insurance lasts for 26 weeks. During economic downturns, however, the federal government often provides additional support by extending unemployment insurance benefits—both the duration as well as the replacement rate. The US government has repeatedly made use of this practice in order to combat the surmounting joblessness. For instance, within the last financial crisis, unemployed workers who reside in states with relatively high unemployment rates are entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits up to 99 weeks, that is, 26 weeks of regular payments and 73 weeks of extended benefits
Footnote 1 (see for instance Fujita 2010; Whittaker 2008; Whittaker and Isaacs 2011a, b; Whittaker et al. 2011). Given the painful nature of job losses, the merits of unemployment compensation benefits are often taken for granted in public discussions, in particular, because as an insurance against unemployment, they provide welfare gains to those workers who lost their jobs. However, the question which arises immediately is: are these gains produced at a cost since they induce a redistribution of resources away from their efficient use? Hence, the study of unemployment benefits is important for at least two reasons. First, they affect not just a single market but several ones immediately; next to their instantaneous effects along the demand side of the economy by increasing the income of unemployed people, they also have an impact on the labor market by crucially affecting the wage bargaining process between workers and firms. The second argument is related to one common question addressing fiscal policy, namely to what extent do unemployment benefits act as an accelerator of economic fluctuations? The government provides an insurance against job loss by means of unemployment compensation payments. There is, however, a concern that it might produce an adverse effect on the incentive to look for a job. That is, unemployment insurance could cause job seekers to put less effort into searching for a job, consequently raising the unemployment rate. Now, if the government provides additional support by extending unemployment insurance benefits in economic downturns, then the unemployment insurance system could severely increase the persistence as well as the level of unemployment. The important thing to notice is that in the latter case, the government implements discretionary policy: it carries out expansionary fiscal policy by extending the regular unemployment compensation program. These discretionary changes are at the core of the current analysis. On their own, unemployment benefits have been analyzed in great depth at the microeconomic level. Studies by Gruber (1997), Hamermesh (1992) and Browning and Crossley (2001), to mention a few, find that there is strong evidence that unemployment benefits smooth individual consumption and that the magnitude of such consumption smoothing is nontrivial. They emphasize the importance of unemployment insurance provided by the government due to both adverse selection problems with private unemployment insurance systems and potential capital market constraints faced by workers who try to smooth their lifetime consumption. Thus, publicly provided unemployment insurance may raise welfare by filling the missing market for a state-contingent payment (Gruber 1997). Apart from the effects of unemployment benefits on individual consumption, research has also focused on the effects of the duration of unemployment on an individual’s decision whether to work or rather draw unemployment benefits. Nickell (1979), Lancaster (1979) and Atkinson and Micklewright (1991), to mention a few, found that higher benefits are associated with longer unemployment spells. However, there is criticism to this finding since, as Pellizzari (2005) argues, changes in the generosity of unemployment benefits have no significant effect on the level or duration of unemployment. Regarding their macroeconomic influences, Hamermesh (1992), Auerbach and Feenberg (2000) and Dunson et al. (1991) among others emphasize their importance as a source of automatic stabilizer. Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the automatic increase in benefit payments that accompanies cyclical declines in aggregate demand will at least partly maintain consumer confidence spending and hence dampen the reduction in aggregate demand. Apart from this stabilizing effect, Hamermesh (1992) argued that aggregate output might be affected negatively from unemployment insurance programs since these programs shift resources away from their efficient use. The argument is that unemployment insurance programs subsidize risky activities which leads to their relative expansion. At the margin, resources are diverted from their best uses such that aggregate output is diminished. This paper seeks to understand the discretionary effects of changes in unemployment compensation, both from an empirical and from a theoretical perspective. The theoretical part is motivated by a standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model comprising the New Keynesian and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model. The analysis considers unemployment benefit payments both from an exogenous definition and from an endogenous one. The results show that higher unemployment benefit payments affect consumption positively on the one hand; however, on the other hand, they trigger negative effects on output and unemployment. These findings are supported by the empirical model. Specifically, I specify a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model using, among others, consumption, the real wage, aggregate output and unemployment as core variables. Based on the identification of a surprise innovation in unemployment benefits, I trace out the effects on aggregate variables triggered by discretionary changes in unemployment compensation. The results suggest that after an expansionary shock unemployment and real wages respond in a hump-shaped pattern peaking after about one and a half years, output responds in a hump-shaped pattern too; however, it reaches a trough after about two and a half years. Moreover, consumption increases and falls back to its preshock value after about three years. The policy shock accounts for a nontrivial fraction of the variation in unemployment, real wages and consumption. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 motivates the DSGE model and discusses the theoretical results. Section 3 presents the empirical part and ends with a discussion of the nature of the shock. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes.",1

Sometimes, the possibility of entry is taken under consideration in order to analyze the incumbents’ actions to avoid it. Symmetrically, free entry is usually treated with reference to price-taking producers.Footnote 1 One of the first economists considering a market regime characterized by both collusion and free entry was Pareto (1906, Chap. 6, §§ 10–18 and Chap. 9, §§ 3–15). Pareto, who associated competition to free entry rather than to price-taking, called it parasitic competition: firms collusively fix the price of products they make, but they cannot avoid the entry of competitors.Footnote 2
 Pareto linked this situation to that of shopkeepers (he was in favor of the department stores that were successful in France even during his time). More commonly though, the market regime with price collusion and free entry can approximately characterize the activities of professional bodies. For instance, in Italy, certain activities, like those of lawyers, engineers, physicians, taxi drivers, are regulated as public services. Prices are fixed by the statutes of corporationsFootnote 3 and/or by public authorities. However, they reflect the intentions and desires of producers. There are controls to limit entry, although the success of these in preventing entry varies from circumstance to circumstance. For instance, such controls are mostly ineffective in Italy to limit access to the profession of lawyers, while they are effective for notaries. (Corporations often justify their existence on the quality of the services, which their members provide: a cheap service cannot provide good quality and new producers have to prove their expertise. However, this also means high prices and limitation of entry). This situation of explicit price collusion reflects the heredity of the corporatist system. Productive organization by means of corporations is very old. It derives from the economic arrangements prevailing before the Industrial Revolution and dating back to at least the Roman Empire (e.g., De Robertis 1973; van Nijf 1997), even if subject to historical evolution in several of its aspects. The corporatist system largely dominated Europe from the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages was revisited by the Fascist regime and approved by Pope Pius XI. As indicated above, it still persists in partial forms today. The presence of prices fixed by corporations or by public authorities denotes explicit collusion. Another case of explicit collusion, although weaker than the preceding ones, is represented by the presence of norms against price competition. Even antitrust experience in the US reveals some provisions that are contrary to full price competition (for instance, on the issue of the predatory pricing, Giocoli 2010). In all these cases, there is price collusion even if tacit collusionFootnote 4 is not sustainable. The limits to price competition and market entry by means of trusts and cartels or vertical and horizontal integration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century have been explored in depth by many historians (e.g., Chandler 1977) and economists (e.g., Marshall 1890). Pareto (1906, Chap. IX, §§ 10–15) also discusses this topic. Although this argument mainly deals with oligopolistic (and monopolistic) situations, some remarks are also relevant for parasitic competition. For instance, fairness or the gentlemen’s way of doing business is a sociological aspect, which matters both in oligopoly regimes and in parasitic competition. It matters also for workers, providing an counteracting factor to wage competition among workers. This kind of cooperation among people of similar condition may not allow for price competition, which nevertheless is useful for society as a whole. Therefore, price collusion derives from many complementary factors, among which the persistence of some old historical institutions and fairness among colleagues (there is also, particularly for professional services, the influence of asymmetry between provider and consumer). There are also factors that hinder the shelving of price collusion, even if price collusion generates no profit. It will be shown in this paper that parasitic competition maximizes the number of firms (under the constraint of nonnegative profits). Consequently, the dismantling of price collusion implies a social cost since it reduces the number of firms. The main aim of this article is to present the market equilibrium that is generated by both price collusion and free entry. The analysis is presented under a partial equilibrium setting. Both the case of a homogeneous product and the case of differentiated products are taken under consideration. The outcomes of this market regime are compared with those of other regimes, including competition (or monopolistic competition), monopoly, fixed price with collusive entry limitation. The case with a homogenous product is analytically simpler, but the case of differentiated products fits better to real situations of price collusion with free entry. However, their analysis leads to similar results, no relevant difference emerges. Some welfare implications of the market regime of price collusion with free entry are examined, with respect to the maximum social welfare allocation and the allocations of other market regimes, so to highlight the inefficiency of price collusion with free entry.Footnote 5 Since collusion is explicit, the main question does not concern the emergence of collusion (which is, on the contrary, the theme of the analysis on tacit collusion), but its persistence in spite of its inefficiency. Arguments supporting the social stability of the market regime of price collusion with free entry are indicated in the last section.",1

His focus on real agents’ behaviour led him to question the explanatory relevance of normative concepts such as rationality, utility maximization and rational beliefs. This has, to a certain extent, laid Sugden open to criticism on the part of other behavioural economists. In particular, he has been accused by Donald Ross of eliminativism. The latter notion describes the stance of refuting the above-mentioned normative concepts that, according to Ross, define the agent’s autonomy in rational choice theory (RCT). Sugden is accused of considering the individual’s characteristics (namely, preferences and beliefs) the result of an evolutionary process that eliminates the agent’s autonomy as a decisional centre. Therefore, Ross’s critique of Sugden pursues the aim of preserving the agent’s autonomy by recovering the explanatory relevance of rationality, utility maximization and rational beliefs within an ecological approach.Footnote 1
 In what follows I claim that Ross’s critique is misguided since nowhere does Sugden state in his analysis that any real agent is an automaton whose preferences and beliefs are mechanically determined through an evolutionary process. The problem with Ross’s critique is that it transposes to an empirical level the kind of assertion whose validity is restricted by Sugden to a methodological level. Indeed, Sugden’s main claim is that it is not methodologically correct to conceive the empirical phenomenon of the evolutionary process in terms of rationality, utility maximization and rational beliefs, because these are normative concepts, whose empirical relevance is far from unproblematic. In brief, Sugden highlights the methodological problems that arise when economic theorists try to use normative concepts in an ecological approach without providing an adequate empirical foundation. However, this does not entail—at the empirical level—elimination of the agent’s autonomy. On the contrary, Sugden conceives social evolution as the process by which social orders emerge as (mostly unforeseen) consequences of the individuals’ choices (Sugden 1998: 389). The agent’s behaviour is explained in terms of inductive reasoning, adaptive beliefs, salience and pattern recognition. The latter concepts are intended as credible features of the agents’ psychology—with direct empirical relevance—that describe the way they manage to self-determine their own actions. Indeed, these features are not effects of an evolutionary process at the social level, but, on the contrary, they are crucial causal factors of social evolution. For this reason, Sugden’s theory disproves Ross’s critique of eliminativism at the empirical level. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I illustrate Ross’s critique within the context of his research programme. In Sect. 3, I claim that Sugden’s methodological concerns on early EGT research programmes do not entail, at the empirical level, elimination of the agent’s autonomy. In Sect. 4, I will show how Sugden’s theory, being based on inductive reasoning, salience and pattern recognition, preserves the agent’s autonomy in EGT. From these argumentations, I draw the conclusion that Ross’s critique is wide of the mark both at the methodological and empirical level.",

Only in an imaginary world of zero transaction costs does parties’ trade end up achieving the same outcome whatever the initial allocation. This conception puts the focus on transaction costs, including those related to parties’ information on the initial allocation of rights, whatever such allocation is. Therefore, efficient outcomes are not conditioned by allocation itself—that is, who holds which right—but by information on it—that is, knowledge about who holds which right. In this context, public intervention may reduce transaction costs by enacting default law, providing third-party enforcement, and clearly defining the initial allocation of rights—that is, by unambiguously establishing who holds each right. This conception implicitly assumes that parties’ transactions have no consequences for future transaction costs. This assumption is realistic when the transacted rights are rights on assets that are valid only against specific people, what in law are called in personam or “contract rights.” However, it is unrealistic for rights on assets that are valid against everybody, what in law are called rights in rem or “property rights” (rem comes from the Latin word res, thing). This work expands the Coasean framework by analyzing contractual problems and institutional solutions for in rem rights. These are important because, by granting priority for using rights among conflicting claimants, in rem rights provide added enforcement, which is mainly valuable when some claimants may be judgment-proof. Therefore, only in rem rights enable truly impersonal trade to the point that parties can allow themselves the luxury of being totally ignorant of each others’ personal attributes, greatly expanding their opportunities for trade and specialization. The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the argument that, to be fully impersonal, contractual performance must be independent of parties’ characteristics, including not only their reputation and wealth but also their legal authority to contract. Such fully impersonal trade therefore requires contractual enforcement to be based on enforcing rights against assets instead of against persons. Section 3 identifies the meaning of in rem rights on assets by considering legal remedies. Property rights are the foundation of economic incentives and prosperity. It therefore makes sense to enforce them strictly, so that in case of conflict, goods are always returned to their legal owners unless they had granted their consent—therefore treating them as rights in rem. But such in rem enforcement would increase transaction costs by worsening the information asymmetry suffered by acquirers of all sorts of rights, who would always have to gather the consent of the legal owners. Enforcing rights in rem might therefore endanger trade. It would also endanger specialization, because specialization is often based on having agents acting as owners’ representatives, and acquirers would have reasons to doubt the legal authority of sellers. Economic development therefore requires this conflict between property enforcement and transaction costs to be overcome, so that both owners and acquirers are protected. Owners’ rights need to be protected to encourage investment, and the transaction costs faced by acquirers need to be lowered to encourage them to trade and thus improve the allocation and specialization of resources. This conflict between property enforcement and transaction costs may seem puzzling, as explained in Sect. 4, because the economic literature on property rights has been interested in problems such as violence, externalities, and the tragedy of the commons, which can be successfully analyzed using a simplified view of property enforcement. In particular, these problems are independent of the legal remedies that are made available to the rightholder in case of a dispute or, in particular, the type of protection—real or personal—the law gives to different entitlements. Section 5 generalizes the analysis by considering that most transactions are interrelated sequentially. In the most simple sequence, with only two transactions, one or several “principals”—such as owners, employers, shareholders, creditors, and the like—voluntarily contract first with one or several economic “agents”—possessors, employees, company directors, and managers—in an “originative” transaction. Second, the agent then contracts “subsequent” transactions with third parties. These sequential exchanges offer the benefits of specialization in the tasks of principals and agents—between landowners and farmers, employers and employees, shareholders and managers, and so on. But they also give rise to substantial transaction costs, because, when third parties contract with the agent, they suffer information asymmetry regarding not only the material quality of the goods or services being transacted but also the legal effects of the previous originative contract. In particular, third parties are often unaware whether they are dealing with a principal or an agent, or whether the agent has sufficient title or legal power to commit the principal. This constitutes a grave impediment, especially for the impersonal transactions that are necessary to fully exploit the advantages of specialization. Moreover, principals also face a serious commitment problem when trying to avoid this asymmetry because their incentives change after the third party has entered the subsequent contract. Before contracting, principals have an interest in third parties being convinced that agents have proper authority, but, if the business turns out badly, principals will be inclined to deny such authority. This is why the typical dispute triggered by sequential transactions is one in which the principal tries to elude obligations assumed by the agent in the principal’s name, whether the agent had legal authority or not. Judges can adjudicate in such disputes in favor of the principal or the third party. I will refer to favoring the third party as enforcing “contract rules,” as opposed to the seemingly more natural “property rules” that favor the principal.Footnote 1
 The effects of these rules are clear. Take the simple case in which an agent exceeds his legal powers when selling a good to an innocent third party (i.e., a good-faith party who is uninformed about the matter in question). If judges apply the “property rule” that no one can transfer what he does not have, they rule to have the sold good returned to the “original owner,” and the innocent third party wins a mere claim against the agent. Owners will feel secure with respect to this contingency, because this outcome maximizes property enforcement, but it worsens the information asymmetry suffered by all potential third parties with respect to legal title. Conversely, judges can apply an indemnity or “contract rule” so that the sold good stays with the third party and the principal only wins a claim against the agent. This will minimize information asymmetry for potential third parties, but will also weaken property enforcement, making owners feel insecure. Enforcing contract rules thus obviates the information asymmetry usually suffered by third parties and encourages them to trade. In so doing, contract rules transform the object of complex transactions into legal commodities that can be traded easily, thus extending the type of impersonal transaction that characterizes modern markets. However, contract rules weaken the principals’ property rights, endangering investment and specialization in the tasks of principals and agents. Section 6 explains that the law overcomes this conflict between in rem property enforcement and transaction costs by selectively applying property or contract rules depending on conditions that provide proper safeguards. In essence, for judges to apply property rules, which favor owners, owners must have publicized their claims or rights, which should protect acquirers. That is, principals can opt for a property rule to make their rights safer, but, thanks to publicity, third parties suffer little information asymmetry. Conversely, for judges to apply contract rules, which favor acquirers, owners must have granted their consent, which should protect them. That is, when principals choose a contract rule, third parties’ rights are safe, whereas principals’ rights are weaker. But this weakening of property is limited, since principals choose the agent whom they entrust with possession or appoint as their representative, this being the moment when they implicitly “choose” a contract rule. Smooth operation of this conditional application of rules poses varying degrees of difficulty for different transactions. The difficulty is minor when the originative transaction inevitably produces verifiable facts, such as the physical possession of movable goods or the ordinary activity of an employee. For these cases, judges can base their decisions on this public information, which is produced informally. What judges or legislatures have to do is to clearly define efficient contract rules to be applied. The difficulty is greater when the originative transaction produces less verifiable facts, making informal solutions harder to apply. Such informal solutions may even be impossible if the contract remains hidden and its consequences are not verifiable. Consider, for example, the difficulties for clearly establishing by purely private contract the existence of a corporation, distinguishing the corporation’s assets from the personal assets of its shareholders. In such contexts of harder verifiability (verifiability referred here not to the parties’ performance on the contract, as it is usual in the economic analysis of contracts, but to the content of the contract itself), defining contract rules is not enough because applying them requires information on originative contracts, which, in principle, are not always verifiable. To make them verifiable, it is necessary to enter and preserve at least some information on them in a public registry, which is costly to start up and operate, and must enjoy independence and public access.

Smith,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"What is a transaction cost and why does it matter? Coase (1960) provided a path-breaking answer to the latter question, why transaction costs matter, while leaving some tantalizing ambiguities about the notion of transaction costs itself. In this essay, we explore an ambiguity in the scope of the concept of “transaction costs” in order to draw out some further implications of the Coase Theorem for the constituents of transactions: property and contract. Coase’s argument has been subject to widely different interpretations, and Coase would say misinterpretations. Coase complains that people have taken the Coase Theorem as a description of the world designed to advocate indifference to entitlement allocation—because costless “Coasean bargaining” will save the day. This is in fact antithetical to the point Coase was trying to make. (Coase 1988; see also Farber 1997; McCloskey 1998) Coase identified the zero transaction cost world with the models of perfect competition and a style of economics he dubbed “blackboard economics,” and he lamented that “[t]he world of zero transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave” (Coase 1988, 174). In this essay, we identify a central tension in Coasean analysis, between the technique of the analysis and its ultimate purpose. On one of the most widely accepted interpretations of “The Problem of Social Cost” (Coase 1960), Coase’s analysis of transaction costs, whether formulated as a theorem or an extended argument, works as followsFootnote 1: it begins by hypothesizing a world without transaction costs. Then, it is shown that in such a world something is implausibly invariant: the total value of production, or the pattern of production—depending on which further assumptions are made. One can think of this as a reductio ad absurdum: assume transaction costs are zero and you get a absurdly ideal result. So the assumption of zero transaction costs must be faulty, “a very unrealistic assumption” (Coase 1960, p. 15). The moral is that non-zero transaction costs are an important feature of our actual world; we must go back and figure out the role of transaction costs in the working of the economic system. By showing the importance of transaction costs in the real world, the argument thus points to the need for comparative institutional analysis to tell us what configuration of institutions will maximize wealth net of transaction costs in our world. On this reading then, the argument’s technique is to hypothesize away transaction costs and to observe the absurdity of the consequences that follow; the argument’s purpose is to highlight those costs’ importance to empirical work in economics. However, the Coasean argument and versions of the Coase Theorem are often left ambiguous in several respects. One is the domain of the analysis. Is Coase making a point about markets and the price system? Or is his argument the key to a style of institutional analysis that would encompass not only the market but also non-market institutions like the law, courts, legislatures, and the like? Hints at both domains can be found in Coase’s work itself, and either domain makes some sense depending on one’s purpose. Coase himself claimed to be interested only in the “influence of the law on the working of the economic system” (Coase 1988, p. 10) and the use of the price system in particular, suggesting a narrow domain. But Coase also draws lessons about wider comparative institutional analysis, and Coase has inspired an avalanche of analysis in law-and-economics and the New Institutional Economics that endogenizes—and seeks to explain—much more than the workings of the price system in a decentralized market based on private property. The latter type of extended Coasean analysis sweeps in law, norms, regulations, and, harking back to Coase (1937), organizations like firms. The domain question in the Coase Theorem can be usefully examined through the lens of one of Coase’s key notions, “transaction costs.” Transaction costs are the linchpin of the Coase Theorem, figuring both in the technique of the Coasean argument and in the type of empirically driven comparative institutional analysis toward which the argument points. The narrowest understandings of the Coasean domain, focused solely on markets and the price system, naturally pair with a narrow understanding of “transaction costs” as the costs of contracting—the costs of identifying contractual partners and the subject of the bargain, making the contract, and enforcing it. On the other hand, broader Coasean domains, which include many types of institutions, lead to an expansive—some would say too open-ended—class of costs. These include the costs not just of contracting but also of assigning entitlements, shaping them, policing property rights violations, organizing groups that create further rules, and so on. We will argue that if the Coase Theorem is truly institutional, we have to give up the thin notion of “entitlement” as a relatively empty notion of “property right.” In the zero transaction cost world, the nature and scope of property rights might seem not to matter: any deficiency in the allocation of those rights can be made up for by contracting (or by any other hypothetically costless institutional mechanism). However, in the actual world, we face not just a substitution relationship between either assigning an “entitlement” by fiat or trying to let it be reassigned by contract—both of which are costly institutional procedures—but also another substitution relationship between contract and property as institutions with scope and structure. That is, there are substitutes for contracting not only as a means of determining who gets certain entitlements but also as a means of determining how those entitlements themselves are delineated. In the zero transaction cost world, each actor could have rights to control the narrowest use of the smallest chunks of resources, and then these ultra-thin entitlements could easily be assembled in the hands of whoever would most value them. In our world of positive transaction costs, however, this procedure is a non-starter, because the costs of transactions do not neatly scale with the value of the individual entitlements that are the subject of those transactions. For example, even if one entitlement is worth only one-tenth as much as another entitlement, the cost of finding someone with whom to exchange the entitlement and the cost of enforcing any resulting contract of exchange may be very similar for both the low-value and the high-value entitlements. As a result, in a world of entitlements that are ultra-thin (and therefore have sharply limited individual value), transaction costs quickly become a prohibitive barrier to entitlement transfers.Footnote 2 Thus, in the real world, the thin atomized notion of entitlement—a right to take an action with respect to a resource and a corresponding duty in another to permit it—would be overwhelmingly costly. To avoid this inefficiency, property law initially creates packages of rights that are chunkier in terms of the resources covered and the domain of control they provide their holders, thereby providing a massive shortcut over this theoretical baseline of myriad ultra-thin entitlements and innumerable transactions.Footnote 3 The institution of property is itself a mechanism that enables us to avoid these costs. To get a clearer sense of why this is, and how Coase’s strategy of argumentation in “The Problem of Social Cost” ironically made this implication of Coase’s argument easier to overlook, we shall begin by taking a closer look at Coase’s original presentation of the “Coase Theorem.”",8

The motivation was “for his discovery and clarification of the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy”. According to the motivation, two main fundamental ‘stages’ of the Coasean research should be recognised: a ‘first stage’ referred to theThe Nature of the Firm (Coase 1937) and a ‘second stage’, referred to The Problem of Social Cost (Coase 1960). The two ‘stages’ share the general intuition that the ideal-type of perfect competitive markets, usually incorporated in standard microeconomic analysis, neglects the role played by different types of transaction costs in shaping economic choices in the real world economies. In order to provide economic theories with a better understanding of real economic systems, “Coase paved the way for a systematic analysis of institutions in the economic system and their significance”.
Footnote 1 While the two Coasean ‘stages’ differ in their specific focus (respectively, the explanation of the firm and the internalization of social cost), they both attribute a central role to the notion of transaction costs. As Coase (1988, p. 6) outlines:
 [\(\ldots\)] in order to explain why firms exist and what activities they undertake, I found it necessary to introduce a concept which I termed in that article [the Nature of the Firm] ‘the cost of using the price mechanism’, ‘ the cost of carrying out a transaction by means of an exchange on the open market’, or simply, ‘marketing costs’. To express the same idea in my article on ‘the Problem of Social Cost’, I used the phrase ‘the costs of market transactions’. I have described what I had in mind in the following terms: ‘in order to carry out a market transaction, it is necessary to discover who it is that one who wishes to deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on what terms, to conduct negotiations leading up to a bargain, to draw up the contract to undertake the inspection needed to make sure that the terms of the contract are being observed, and so on’. The above long quotation from Coase outlines that a unique framework falls behind the two Coasean ‘stages’: the role of transaction costs in governing agents’ choices and the institutional arrangements needed to overcome them. In this article, we claim that, despite this common feature being widely recognised (Hodgson 1988), each Coasean ‘stage’ has generated two parallel, and independent research paths in the economic theorizing about, respectively, firms and externalities, without analyzing the implications deriving from their reciprocal interdependence. Following Coase (1937, 1960), transaction costs have been analyzed as a constraint on efficient contractual agreements over a joint surplus: when the ‘use of the price mechanism’ is costly, second best arrangements might be reached through vertical integration (in the case of firm) or regulation (in the case of externalities). The main consequence is that ‘transactions’ have been mainly investigated through the lens of ‘contracts’, while the domain of ‘property’ has been largely neglected (Merrill and Smith 2001). The exclusive emphasis on the contractual side of transaction costs has largely ignored that the same argument used toward ‘contractual rights’ could be applied to property rights (Alchian 1965, 1998; Demsetz 1967, 1998, 1988; Barzel 2003). This paradox is fairly even in the New Institutional Economics theory of the firm (Williamson 1985; Hart 1995). For instance, Hart and Moore (1990) provide a theory of vertical integration under the framework of incomplete contracts, through the optimal assignment of ‘complete’ property rights. Similarly, the wide literature on incomplete contracts and governance design has generally been based on the idea that transaction costs affect parties’ bargaining over a joint surplus that remains unaffected by the nature and content of proprietary assets (Merrill and Smith 2001, n.d.; Lueck and Miceli 2007; Nicita 2006; Brousseau and Nicita 2010). One evident weakness of these approaches is that if the source of transaction costs relies on the agents’ inability to foresee and verify each possible state of the world in their contract, there is no reason why other institutional settings—as property rights—should be in principle always immune to the same source of transaction costs. According to Coase (1960), reciprocal externalities do emerge when property rights are ex-ante poorly defined and/or weakly enforced, precisely because prohibitive transaction costs are needed to define and enforce every use of those rights. Comparing thus the two Coasean ‘stages’ (Coase 1937, 1960) would easily reveal that even property is a (transaction cost-minimizing) institution (Merrill and Smith 2001, 2012) and that when the ‘activities’ undertaken within a transaction involve incomplete contracts and incomplete property rights, the cost of using the price mechanism affects not only the governance of contracts but also that of property rights. To put it in another way, we suggest that the missing step in the Coasean legacy is a theory of the firm as a transaction cost-minimizing institution with reference both to incomplete contracts and to incomplete property rights. The resulting picture would be one in which the complementary use of human capital and proprietary assets within the firm is determined, respectively, by hold-up deterrence and externality prevention. An ‘externality’ could be here defined as the joint claim of ‘presumptive’ rights holders over rival uses. When some uses of assets in a given transaction are exposed to potential externalities, the cost of ‘governing’ property rights may increase ex-post. Thus, under given circumstances, it might be more efficient that, in order to prevent ex-post transaction costs due to externalities, all the potential rival uses fall under the same ownership structure. As a consequence, ‘expanding’ the domain of ownership over uses could be interpreted as a transaction costs minimizing strategy. Indeed, when property rights are incomplete, in order to minimize the transaction costs associated with bargaining over an externality, one way to prevent potential externalities is to expand the property domain over all those rival uses that contrast with the core activity of the firm. Here, we have an important result. In a world of both incomplete contracts and incomplete property rights, the property rights combined with ‘contractual activities’ performed within the firm also determine the nexus of property rights owned by the firm (and vice-versa). While in the standard approach to incomplete contracts, the property and the contractual dimensions have been generally assumed to be independent, we argue that as property rights are incomplete to some extent, both property and contracts affect the dimension of the transactions carried out within the firm. When incompleteness is also referred to the property domain, the ‘Coasean firm’ would not only centralize incomplete contracts under a unified governance system, but it will also aggregate incomplete property rights under a unified ownership structure. In this respect, the ‘make-or-buy’ decision will be affected by, and will in turn affect, the market for property rights. We believe that the unified framework we propose between the two Coasean ‘stages’ may enrich our understanding of the institutional nature and the dimension of the firm, as well as the relationship between the firm, the market and the law. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we outline the main lessons deriving from the two Coasean ‘stages’ quoted above. In Sect. 3, we present a simple model of incomplete contracts with weakly defined property rights (externalities). In Sect. 4, we discuss the main implications of a theory of the firm as a nexus of incomplete contracts and incomplete property rights. Section 4 concludes.",3

In his long life, he has sharply criticized the economic for the neglect of the profession for its own subject matter. According to Coase, the economic approach lies in the rational choice explanations of the interactions which they examine and “while it may ultimately rejuvenate the study of law, political science and sociology had nonetheless… serious adverse effects on economics itself” (Coase 1988, p. 3). “What has been developed is—according to Coase—an approach divorced (or which can be divorced) from its subject-matter. Indeed since Man is not the only animal that chooses, it is to be expected that the same approach can be applied to the rat, cat and octopus in the same way in which a man does” (Coase 1988, p. 3). However, in spite of its imperialism outside its traditional subject matter, economics is dramatically losing its own field. Indeed, “one result of this divorce of theory from its subject-matter has been that the entities whose decisions economists are engaged in analyzing have not been made subject of study and in consequence lack any substance” (Coase 1988, p. 3). The undesirable consequence of this state of affairs is that in current economic theory, we have “consumers without humanity, firms without organization, and even exchange without markets” (Coase 1988, p. 3). In his long life, Coase has tried to readdress this situation. However, while his contributions have been very much appreciated, the overall harmony of his theoretical building has often been missed. Coase has even appeared to show some inclination for schizophrenia—a disease that could forgiven only considering that his two major contributions are located at distant points of his long life. In the words of  Calabresi (1991, p. 1211), the trouble with the Coasian personality could be described as follows: Some fifty-five years ago, in a seminal article called The Nature of the Firm, a young socialist named Ronald Coase sought to explain the existence of firms, of organizations within which markets were replaced by hierarchy and command. Twenty-five years later, in The Problem of Social Cost, Ronald Coase, by then a middle-aged libertarian, indicated how markets could replace hierarchy and command structures to the perceived benefit of those who organized them. However, in spite of this superficial impression of divided personality, Calabresi (1991, p. 1212) points out that: As Professor Coase recognized, the underlying point is the same. In this short paper, we will try to show that this latter statement of Calabresi is correct. However, we will take a different route and will not only claim that Ronald’s deconstruction into “Young Ronald” and “Old Ronald” is unjustified but also that reconstructing the unity of his self allows us to understand the power of his theory and the strength of his challenge to orthodox economics. In the next section, we will examine the motivations underlying the deconstruction hypothesis of Ronald Coase. In the third section, we will show how Ronald can be properly reconstructed following his own self-analysis. In Sect. 4, we will claim that some fundamental propositions of orthodox economics cannot meet the challenge of a properly reconstructed Ronald. His fundamental message may sound obvious. It can be even expressed in a short sentence: no institution is a free lunch! However, its implications are really far-reaching and—we argue in the concluding section—they have major implications not only for the ontology of economics (or its subject matter) but also for its methodology.",12
59,2,International Review of Economics,21 March 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0155-z,Coase (1937) revisited: Endogenous fiat in firms and markets,July 2012,Giorgio Zanarone,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the last two decades, a strong body of empirical evidence has emerged, suggesting that agency conflicts conduce to integration. For instance, franchisors own retail outlets that generate spillovers on the common brand (Yeap 2006); motor carriers own trucks whose poor maintenance would harm the carrier’s service and reputation (Nickerson and Silverman 2003); airline companies own regional carriers that serve routes between bad weather airports, where frequent flight rescheduling preserves the network’s reputation but causes short-term losses to the regional (Forbes and Lederman 2009)Footnote 1; and local governments provide in-house those services to whose quality citizens are especially sensitive (Levin and Tadelis 2010). The relations described in these and other studies are all plagued by a similar type of agency problem: principals (franchisors, motor carriers, major airline carriers, and governments) rely on agents (outlet managers, truck drivers, managers of regional carriers, and service providers) to perform onerous tasks (serving customers, driving efficiently, rescheduling flights, and providing public services of high quality), which benefit the principal, but generate both benefits and costs for the agent. Importantly, agency is present independent of whether the agent is an employee or an independent contractor: for instance, restaurant chains need local managers to serve customers according to the brand’s standards irrespective of whether these are franchisees or employees.Footnote 2 Moreover, it is often the case that employees and contractors receive similar incentive contracts (Nickerson and Silverman 2003), or incentive contracts that do not depend on the critical tasks at issue (Forbes and Lederman 2009). This raises an obvious question: How does integration induce opportunistic agents to perform? As a possible explanation, Coase (1937) has suggested long ago that, within firms, “in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur–coordinator, who directs production” (Coase 1937, p. 388). Coase further defines the relation between an employer and his employees inside the firm as a master-and-servant one, whereby the employee “agrees to obey the directions of an entrepreneur within certain limits” (Coase 1937, p. 391). A problem with the Coasean view is that the relations between independent firms—for instance, franchisors and franchisees, or large retailers and small suppliers—can also be strongly hierarchical. In fact, 35 years after Coase’s articles, Alchian and Demsetz (1972) countered that “The firm has no power of fiat […] any different in the slightest degree from ordinary market contracting. […] He [the employer] can fire or sue, just as I can fire my grocer by stopping purchases from him” (Alchian and Demsetz 1972, p. 777). This article acknowledges that fiat exists both in firms and in markets and clarifies what conditions make firms or markets the optimal organizational form to achieve it. To do so, it develops a simple agency model where a principal relies on an agent to implement a non-contractible decision—for instance, the cleanness and comfort of a retail store. Efficient decisions optimize between three components: the principal’s private benefit, which increases in the value of the decision; the agent’s private implementation cost, which decreases in the value of the decision; and the per period change in the value of an asset used by the agent in the production process, which increases in the value of the decision up to a critical level and decreases thereafter. This environment is suitable to model franchise networks, supply chains, transportation networks and, in general, relationships where the values of central and local assets are imperfectly aligned, due to externalities. The model shows that fiat arises in equilibrium both under integration, where the principal owns the asset and the agent is an employee, and under separation, where the agent owns the asset and hence is a private contractor. Specifically, fiat takes the form of relational contracts where the agent routinely implements the principal’s decisions, and the principal pays her an implicit bonus covering her opportunity cost of performance. However, the size of the bonus necessary to make the agent obey—and, consequently, the extent to which the principal can credibly order her what to do—depends in an intriguing way on whether the agent is an employee or a contractor. The argument is simple: unlike an employee, a contractor does not only care about saving effort (the private implementation cost), but also care about raising the value of the asset she owns. Hence, a contractor is less (more) tempted to disobey—and, therefore, requires a smaller (greater) bonus to obey—decisions close to (far from) the one that maximizes the asset’s value. This implies that, when the optimal decision is close to the level that maximizes the value of the asset used by the agent—for instance, because the decision has a moderate impact on the principal’s profits, or monitoring the agent is costly—the principal can more successfully give orders to a contractor than to an employee, and viceversa. This result has three important implications. First, the relation between integration and the principal’s power of fiat is non-monotonic: when the optimal decision is not too far from the one that maximizes the value of the asset used by the agent, the principal can exert greater control over the agent by hiring her as a contractor than as an employee. Second, and consistent with the evidence cited at the beginning of the article, changes in the environment that move the optimal decision farther from the one that maximizes the value of the asset used by the agent—such as an increase in the positive externality from the agent to the principal, or a decrease in the principal’s cost of monitoring the agent—favor integration over separation. In Sect. 6, this result is applied to revisit Williamson’s notions of market, hybrids and hierarchies, and to the choice between in-house production and outsourcing of public services. Third, integration tends to be optimal when the parties expect to be in a relationship for longer. The reason for this result is that, when the parties are more patient, it is easier to enforce relational contracts. This, in turn, induces the principal to order the agent decisions that are farther from those that maximize the value of the asset she uses, and the model predicts that this type of orders can be more easily sustained under integration. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 relates the article to the literature. Section 3 introduces the model’s definitions and assumptions. Section 4 discusses the choice between integration and separation when the principal and the agent are in an arm’s-length relationship (spot governance). Section 5 studies the same choice when the principal and the agent are in a long-term relationship (relational governance) and presents the main result of the article. Section 6 discusses additional results and implications for the theory of the firm. Section 7 concludes.",2

Without the article he published in 1960 (Coase 1960), law and economics would likely not exist the way we know it today. The Coase conjecture has been the economic concept most influential in law over the last 30 years. Controversial, debatable, and often misunderstood, the work of Coase has shaped two or three generations of economists and lawyers. However, he has never written about law and economics in Europe or, more generally, in civil law jurisdictions. Yet many of Coase’s insights on the same discipline in the United States are important to our understanding of the methodological and practical challenges that law and economics in Europe face today. Although there is only one field of law and economics, the US law and economics scholarship has grown to be a fundamental, if not the dominant, provider of legal methodology. Some love it, some hate it, but no one is indifferent to it. Yet the field of law and economics has not enjoyed the same success in EuropeFootnote 1 as it has in the United States and Israel. I discussed this issue in an earlier article: Although there is disagreement over what actually explains the skeptical reception of law and economics outside of the United States, the entire body of literature provides systematic evidence of the following well-known facts: law and economics is influential in American and Israeli legal scholarship but it has little impact elsewhere; law and economics is dominated by legal scholars in the United States and in Israel but by economists elsewhere; the rate of acceptance of law and economics in American and Israeli courts is not impressive, but nevertheless significant, whereas the field is virtually ignored by courts elsewhere, albeit with some occasional references (Garoupa 2011, at 1517). Many legal economists have provided complex explanations as to why law and economics have been so coldly received in Europe, from the civil law tradition to the structure of legal academia and the market for legal ideas (Garoupa and Ulen 2008). Unfortunately, there is no current consensus among legal economists as to why law and economics have failed to influence legal policy and scholarship outside of the United States (Garoupa 2011). In fact, as I have argued elsewhere (Garoupa 2011), the skeptical reception of law and economics in Europe is neither unique to the fields of law and economics nor to Europe. There are deep issues in the market for legal doctrines to explain the lack of enthusiasm for foreign legal methodologies. Still, as law and economics scholars, we are more concerned with the lack of impact that economics has had on legal scholarship than with the lack of references made to other methodologies (i.e., critical legal studies, law and psychology, etc.). The reading of Coase’s views on the future of legal scholarship in the United States certainly provides for further reflection on the potential role of legal economists in Europe. These are insights that are important to an understanding of the future of law and economics in Europe and beyond. These insights also provide for new ways to expand the discussion of the potential for success or failure of law and economics in Europe. This paper is divided as follows: Sect. 2 provides for an overview of Coase’s insights; and Sect. 3 concludes with my final remarks and a brief discussion of the significant implications of Coase’s work.",2

Cebula,J. R. Clark,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As the global economy largely manifests a trend toward either recovery/expansion in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008–2009, there is a significant variation across nations in economic performance. For instance, consider the unemployment rate in the OECD nations (OECD 2011, Table 2). On the one hand, the majority of OECD nations have shown signs of improvement in the unemployment rate, that is, a pattern of declining unemployment; most notably, Germany has shown an especially strong improvement in this regard. On the other hand, the unemployment rate in the United States, although showing an initial downward movement, shows signs of continued stagnation, that is, the U.S. recovery has lost some of its momentum. Furthermore, in several cases, including nations such as the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, and Greece, either stagnating or even very slowly rising unemployment rates have been observed. Within the context of the global economic and financial crisis, several distinct policy concerns of the OECD have surfaced. One of these concerns is reflected in the words of the OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria (OECD 2009a, p. 1), who has stressed that “We must ensure that today’s policies to manage the crisis not be the source of tomorrow’s problems….” The OECD has been working with its own members and, to a degree, with non-member governments and other organizations, to get economies back on the path of economic stabilization and expansion. Interestingly, as a central part of this effort, the OECD (2009a, p. 1, b, p. 1) advocates the position that governments must be cautious not to jeopardize or sacrifice economic freedoms as they pursue policies to strengthen and revitalize their economies. This study begins from the perspective that, in the spirit of Smith’s (1776) Wealth of Nations, the basic institutions that protect the liberty and freedom of individuals to pursue their own economic interests will tend to result in a greater prosperity for society as a whole. In both the protection of and promotion of economic freedom in its various forms, not only will the individuals with greatest initiative receive the market/economic rewards they have earned, that is, to which they are entitled, but also the economy of which they are a part will benefit as well. Similarly, in a fashion that is compatible with and has its roots in the work of Smith (1776), the Heritage Foundation (2011, p. 11), which has developed a methodology by which it has computed ten economic freedoms, recognizes that “…individuals in an economically free society would be free and entitled to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please under a rule of law, with their freedom at once protected and respected by the state.” Within this context, the present study empirically investigates the impacts on per capita real economic growth of each of the ten measures of economic freedom computed annually by the Heritage Foundation (2011). The background for the empirical framework and for the focus of this study on OECD nations is presented in the following section (Sect. 2) of this study. The basic empirical model and data for the period 2004 through 2008 are described in Sect. 3 of the study (Heritage Foundation 2011, p. 16). Following that model, in Sect. 4, the results of the formal empirical analysis are provided. The analysis takes the form of panel least squares (PLS) estimations using recent data for the OECD nations. An overview with concluding remarks is provided in Sect. 5 of the study.",12
59,3,International Review of Economics,12 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0166-9,Voting with the wallet,September 2012,Leonardo Becchetti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The standard textbook economic theory generally represents individuals as adopting purely self-regarding behavior, or, more specifically, as maximizing their own monetary payoffs. This simplified paradigm has been strongly criticized by Sen (1978), among others, who argues that homo economicus is a “rational fool,” and that the reductionist assumption that individuals are driven only by their own monetary self-interest disregards the importance of two additional drivers of human behavior—moral commitment and sympathy.Footnote 1
 Do people really behave like homines economici? Empirical findings from Ultimatum Games (Güth et al. 1982; Camerer and Thaler 1995), Dictator Games (Andreoni and Miller 2002), Gift Exchange Games (Fehr et al. 1993, 1998), Trust Games (Berg et al. 1995; Ben-Ner and Putterman 2006), and Public Good Games (Fischbacher et al. 2001; Sonnemans et al. 1999; Fehr and Gächter 2000) provide evidence that contradicts this simplified paradigm. Results from this research have documented, in fact, that the vast majority of the individuals participating in the experiments follow a broadened preference pattern (Bruni and Porta 2005; Bruni 2008) that includes elements of (positive and negative) reciprocity (Rabin 1993), inequity aversion (Fehr and Schmidt 1999; Bolton and Ockenfels 2000), other-regarding preferences (Cox 2000), social welfare preferences (Charness and Rabin 2002) and various forms of pure and impure (warm glow) altruism (Andreoni 1989). For the more skeptical, who believe that laboratory behavior is an imperfect proxy for what people do in reality, the preferences revealed by actual consumer choices are a more reliable proof for the existence of other-regarding preferences. From this point of view, quasi-natural experiments on consumer purchases and the actual market shares of “ethical” products, which are generally sold at a positive price differential compared with equivalent “non-ethical” products (see Sects. 2, 3), represent the most important evidence for rejection of the anthropologically reductionist paradigm of the “rational fool”. Even more importantly, this theoretical and empirical literature documents that the presence of asymmetric information, contract incompleteness and limits to the enforcement of legal obligations make social dilemmas an everyday feature of economic life. These dilemmas, which are conventionally represented in Prisoner’s Dilemmas, Trust Games and Public Good Games, are typical situations in which pecuniary self-interest is not just uncommon from an empirical point of view, but is also suboptimal in terms of the creation of economic value. This is because, in most of these dilemmas, team or other-regarding preferences and high levels of trust and trustworthiness may allow players to reach equilibria that are superior from both an individual and an aggregate point of view.Footnote 2 On the basis of these considerations, economists are becoming increasingly interested in studying the law of motion of crucial values which induce people to accept “social risk,” such as trust, and, more generally, social capital, which is considered to be the ‘glue’ that holds the socioeconomic system together.Footnote 3
 This increased attention to invisible pillars of economic life such as social capital confutes the widespread belief that values are unimportant for, if not actually harmful, to, economic life. This belief has been fueled by a simplistic extrapolation of the famous passage in Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations,” which explains how market mechanisms act as an invisible hand which magically transforms the pursuit of individual self-interest by each economic agent into something which is also socially desirable. As well known, the exceptions to the coincidence of private and social optimum are so numerous that they have become the rule. Natural or imposed limits to competition, negative externalities, public goods and asymmetric information are so widespread and pervasive that they severely limit the benefits of the invisible hand, and make the coincidence of private and social optimum an ideal situation which cannot be attained, just like the benchmark of frictionless motion in physics. Another well-established metaphor in support of the optimistic view of the sufficiency of self-interest may be found in Mandeville. In the bee story, socioeconomic systems prosper like beehives simply because of the spontaneous coordination of self-interested actions by their inhabitants, while the introduction of values may even prove harmful and endanger this spontaneous equilibrium. Even Keynes indirectly refers to this idea when he admits that “for at least another 100 years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.”Footnote 4
 However, the increased economic interdependence generated by global market integration and the complexity and growth of financial markets provides quite the opposite picture, according to which a lack of ethics on the part of a single financial trader in a “too big to fail” financial institution may trigger a worldwide catastrophic event (a quite different position from that of Mandeville’s libertine who, with all his vices, only creates positive economic effects).Footnote 5 If we return to Mandeville’s metaphor, it is as if the bees (or at least some of them) were now transporting small nuclear weapons with their tiny legs, so that their lack of moral and civic values may endanger the survival not just of their own hive, but also of all the neighboring ones. If we now take this into account and add the fact that the global financial crisis has demonstrated how important trust is among and within financial institutions for the survival of the market economy, we might rephrase our quotation from Keynes by arguing that in globally integrated markets, foul is dangerous, while fair is becoming useful, since it contributes to the creation of economic value (as we shall see in the sections which follow). On the positive side, the potential contribution of values and ethics to the increased prosperity of economic life in globally integrated markets has only just begun to be explored. The imbalance generated by the interaction of globalized companies with institutions and rules which have remained largely national in nature has triggered a bottom-up reaction from a minority of “concerned” individuals who have started to “vote with their wallets.” These individuals use their consumption and savings choices to vote for those products and companies which are at the forefront of a three-sided efficiency which consists of creating economic value in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. The spread of this practice has been supported by the fact that socially responsible consumption and savings impose only very weak conditions on individual preferences. We do not need a strong dose of altruism to vote with the wallet, merely a form of enlightened or long-sighted self-interest. This is because purchasing products from firms which are at the vanguard of environmental sustainability means supporting innovation toward more environmentally responsible productive processes, or providing incentives for a reduction in environmental degradation and its harmful consequences which produce negative effects not just for future generations but also for the concerned consumers and investors themselves. In parallel, choosing a socially responsible product implies supporting those firms that are more efficient in reconciling the creation of economic value with the well-being of their workers: a goal which, in the end, is in the interests of concerned consumers who wish to maximize their surplus, but whose satisfaction is affected even more by the enjoyment of decent working conditions. This grassroots action has successfully triggered a reaction from corporations which have found it optimal to imitate partially the behavior of socially responsible pioneers. This reaction has been termed “corporate social responsibility” (CSR). The main questions here are what the consequences of CSR might be for a company’s shareholders, and whether companies can afford CSR while at the same time having to survive and remain competitive in the market arena (see Sect. 4). The aim of our paper is to reflect on these new features in economic systems by analyzing in depth the interaction among the three “new” actors: corporate ethical pioneers, concerned economic agents who vote with their wallets, and profit-maximizing incumbents who are moving toward CSR. The paper is divided into five sections (introduction and conclusions included). In the second section, we examine the idea of the bottom-up action of the wallet vote in general by considering its potential and the threats it might pose. In the third section, we consider its application to the fields of trade (fair trade) and finance (microfinance, ethical banking and ethical finance), stressing the isomorphic nature of certain crucial elements of the economics of social responsibility in the two domains: in both cases, the emergence of small market shares enjoyed by new-entry ethical pioneers (whose products are purchased by “concerned” consumers voting with their wallets) triggers partial imitation on the part of profit-maximizing incumbents, thereby generating important contagion effects. In the fourth section, we analyze the phenomenon of CSR as a reaction triggered by the existence of the socially and environmentally responsible consumers and investors described in the previous sections. In the final section, we draw some conclusions.",6

Sometimes, somewhere, someone comes back: a general model of return migration",September 2012,Alessio Emanuele Biondo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Migration is a deeply investigated issue. International and intra-national movements of workers are presented in many investigations, both theoretical and empirical. However, an important component of migration flows derives from the search of an occupation. From a labour economics point of view, it is possible to distinguish between two different typology of emigration (e.g. Chiswick 2011): (a) High-skilled emigration (brain drain) occurs when relatively high qualified workers decide to move from their own country to a foreign (more developed) country, since they are relatively over skilled but (nonetheless) they have no possibility to obtain a job position that could fit their advanced skills at home. However, they could have the option to accept either less qualified or less lucrative job positions in the domestic labour market (e.g. a brilliant Namibian graduated in engineering decide to move to Germany to work as engine designer for BMW having the alternative option to remain in South Africa working as a mechanic in a car service centre); (b) Low-skilled emigration, instead, occurs when workers are induced, by the adverse economic scenario that characterizes their domestic economy, to migrate from the country in search of job opportunities abroad. Differently from the high-skilled emigrants, low-skilled emigrants have no valuable options in their own country (e.g. a low-educated farmer from Senegal who used to work in the agricultural sector now hit by a strong famine who choose to move to Spain to work in the fields without having any alternative option in his own country). More specifically, as Kwok and Leland (1982) say, (p. 91): «the ‘brain drain’ is an expression of British origin used to describe […] skilled professionals who leave their native lands in order to seek more promising opportunities elsewhere». At a macroeconomic level, this definition is often referred to movements of agents between developing and developed countries, as in Beine et al. (2001), Commander et al. (2003), and Beine et al. (2006), just to mention a few. Consequences of these flows are generally analysed referring to the accumulation of human capital as one of the most relevant engines for economic growth. In fact, many contributions focus on the consequences of migration flows, in terms of medium-long-term growth implications. Among many examples, Lucas (1988), (2004),  Azariadis and Drazen (1990), Haque and Kim (1995), Cox Edwards and Ureta (2003), Poutvaara (2004) can be easily cited. The microeconomics of this phenomenon follows a completely different approach, since it focuses on individual elements that can inspire decision about migration. These elements are usually preferences and wage differentials. Also in this field, literature is wide and well known. Some examples are Glytsos (1988), Dustmann (1994, 1995), Borjas and Bratsberg (1996), Bell (1997), Friedberg (2000), Dustman and Weiss (2007), Mayr and Peri (2008). The analysis of several aspects and consequences of migration flows (both kind, outgoing brain drain and ingoing return migration) are already widely described in so many contributions. Here, a new result is to be found. More precisely, a detailed analysis of the decision-making process is needed to understand formally all of the reasons that induce people to go abroad and possibly come back home. Both of these two decisions are affected by individual preference, differences in utility levels and earned wages. In fact, these aspects influence the departure decision, as much as the return one. This rationale must be referred to brain drain migration, which has peculiar characteristics that make it a social process different from traditional migration. This paper aims to obtain two results: the first is to present the law of determination of the return moment, which ‘brains’ choose to come back home; the second is to study how difference in terms of individual satisfaction evolves in time. Once these goals are achieved, the analysis will generalize conclusions in order to discuss possible ‘corner’ solutions, that is, when the worker decides either to remain abroad forever, or not to migrate at all. Since brain drain and return migration are two faces of a unique social problem, which influences dynamics of population and the accumulation of human capital, any policy-maker should have serious concerns about them, because they act as key factors influencing both wealth and development of a country. Moreover, the exact recognition of reasons that ignite these migration flows can help in choosing adequate policies to build incentives that induce agents to select policy-consistent behaviours. Section 2 presents the model; Sect. 2.1 presents the case of uncertainty; Sect. 3 concludes.",1

The ‘slippery slope’ framework was born in the field of Economic Psychology to explain the high level of tax compliance rather than the high level of tax evasion, thus highlighting that: (a) some tax compliance is voluntary and depends on trust in tax authorities and (b) the standard mechanism of enforced compliance (monitoring probability and expected penalty)Footnote 1 alone cannot explain the overall tax compliance (Kirchler 2007; Kirchler et al. 2008a, b; Muehlbacher and Kirchler 2010).Footnote 2
 This theoretical work captures the importance of the interaction of power and trust for tax compliance. Also, it shows that the firm’s decision to evade taxes also depends on trust in tax authorities and affects one of the most important macroeconomic variables: the unemployment rate. The main result of this paper is that with the ‘right mix’ of policy tools of deterrence, trust in tax authorities is maximised, tax compliance increases and a reduction of tax evasion may also decrease unemployment. The ‘right mix’ of policy tools of deterrence is defined as the level of authorities’ power that is high enough to foster belief in the effectiveness of their work but not so high that exertion of power corrodes trust.",8

As a result, the economic effects of changes in government spending have once again become the subject of extensive research.Footnote 1 However, very few of these studies, if any, have addressed the question of how the potency of fiscal policy may depend on a country’s trade openness, even though openness is widely recognized as one the prime determinants of the size of fiscal multipliers.Footnote 2
 Theoretically, the answer is straightforward: greater openness to international trade is generally predicted to reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy. This is obviously true in standard Keynesian models in which government spending has maximum potency when the economy is relatively closed and its effects are largely contained in the domestic economy; on the other hand, if the economy is very open, a large portion of a fiscal expansion will “leak out” on imported goods, reducing the overall effect on domestic aggregate demand. Overall, the more open the economy, the lower the predicted value of the fiscal multiplier. Such mechanisms will be generally more complex in non-Keynesian models, but even there, if the issue is modeled, trade openness is also found to play a role in determining the effects of fiscal policies (see Monacelli and Perotti 2008, for a recent example). The practical importance of this issue in an era of active fiscal policy is difficult to exaggerate—not only because countries still differ substantially in how open they are to foreign trade but also because trade openness has been increasing in most economies in the last few decades. Despite its obvious importance, however, empirical evidence on the influence of trade openness on the potency of fiscal policy has been virtually nonexistent. A recent exception is the influential study by Ilzetzki et al. (2009), which finds that fiscal expansions are much more effective in “closed” economies than they are in “open” economies. A limitation of this finding, however, is that such a binary classification is usually unrealistic: very few countries are adequately described as fully “closed” or fully “open”; instead most economies occupy different points in a continuum of trade openness. The goal of the present paper is to contribute to the empirical side of this issue adopting a widely used definition of “trade openness” that is much more continuous: an economy’s total trade (the sum of exports plus imports) as a fraction of GDP. Using a panel methodology that analyzes annual data from the 1951 to 2007 period for a sample of 62 developed and developing economies, our empirical findings show that fiscal expansions are indeed more effective for economies that are less open to international trade. In fact, the quantitative influence of trade openness is quite substantial: the estimates suggest that a 10% increase in trade openness reduces the magnitude of the long-run fiscal multiplier by 5–6%. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the sources of the data and defines the variables to be used in the estimation. Section 3 outlines the estimation methodology, derives the main empirical results, and implements a number of robustness checks. Section 4 discusses the findings and concludes.",12

Sorge,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last decades, corruption issues have gained a prominent position in the development and political economy debate. Since the seminal contribution of Mauro (1995), the literature on the causes and the consequences of corruption on social welfare and growth has in fact become a large chapter of public economics, as reviewed in Jain (2001). In this respect, a few theoretical studies have investigated corruption in a dynamic context (e.g., Ehrlich and Lui 1999; Sarte 2000; Blackburn et al. 2006). Recently, Pereira and da Cruz Vieira (2010) (P-dCV henceforth) analyzed the issue of bureaucratic corruption in a neoclassical growth model using a concave production function. The authors claim that their approach differs from previous studies in that the latter typically exploit a convex production function with productive government spending. Moreover, the non-convex intensive technology representation used in their model is derived from a (presumptive) strictly convex function in levels. In this note, we show that both these claims are uncorrect. Indeed, while the general function is neither convex nor concave, it also fails to be linearly homogeneous, which prevents from converting it to per capita terms. Nonetheless, in the presence of an inelastic labor supply, the two functions lead to equivalent—up to a constant—optimality conditions. Accordingly, all the results derived in P-dCV as to the link between corruption and growth are not peculiar to non-convex production functions. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly review P-dCV model setup. In Sect. 3, we present a simple argument against the claimed strict convexity of the general production function entailing productive public expenditures, which is rather shown to be pseudoconcave, whereas the claimed derivation of a concave intensive form function from the previous one is disproved due to the failure of linear homogeneity.

59,4,International Review of Economics,29 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0172-y,Introduction,December 2012,Luigino Bruni,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to the philosopher Tzvetan Todorov (2001): “Studying the broad currents of European philosophical thought regarding the definition of what it means to be human, one reaches an unexpected conclusion: the social aspect, the element of life in community, is not generally considered necessary for humankind. However, this thesis is never presented as such; it is rather a presupposition that is never formulated” (1998, 15, emph. add.). In fact, the social and relational dimensions of human life in the modern cultural tradition are considered a real or existential given (i.e. we do not live in isolation). At the same time sociality, or interpersonal relationships, are essentially a problem: they are, in other words, a necessary evil. The other person is primarily an unchosen bond, a ‘wound’, and thus something to be avoided, if we possibly can. Modern humanity does not see the ‘blessing’ associated with the ‘wound’ of personalized and communitarian relations. That is why we try to escape from facing the other, and prefer to set ourselves in search of beata solitude (Bruni 2012). This long cultural process of the appearance of the individual (separate from the other), began with Renaissance Humanism, starting in particular with the second half of the fifteenth century. The brief digression of civil humanism having ended, which was an important cultural phenomenon in central Italy, European culture again developed a fascination with the Neoplatonic tradition and reasserted the ideal of escaping from cities and from too close links with the others for a happy life. Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino and many other thinkers were the leading figures in that ‘second’ humanism emphasizing solitude as the certain prescription for happiness without risk. Lorenzetti’s frescoes on the Allegory of Good and Bad Government and the civil frescoes for the Santa Maria della Scala in Siena of XIV century, gave way to mythological, rural and Epicurean representations of the Medici villas of the sixteenth century. Beginning with the Renaissance of the late Quattrocento, city life and civil and economic engagement were no longer contexts for a good life; rather, they began to be seen as less desirable pursuits that could no longer be recommended to the ‘good Christian’. In the Seventeenth Century this process became more pronounced, accompanied by a re-feudalization of Europe (and of the South in particular) that placed the possession of land, and the titles of nobility and status connected with them (counts, barons, dukes, marquis, and so forth), at the center of the social hierarchy, which resulted in a devaluation of the social value of civil and economic life. Even the flowering of a literature on various utopias and on the ‘ideal state’, typical of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, should be understood within that same process. That literature acquired particular importance in the period going from the twilight of the humanist era to the dawn of modern political economy in the second half of the Eighteenth Century. That was a time of deception and pessimism, which led to dreams of ideal states and societies as an escape from political realities that were anything but ideal, as well as a reaction against the individualistic and asocial thought of the second humanism. The ‘happy city’ is an expression which appears in the titles of several works of these authors (Anton Francesco Doni and Francesco Patrizi, for example), but by then such cities were only descriptions of distant imagined realities, a disappointed hope: “At the same point in which human society is at its most divided and bitter, the need for a peaceful and serene city becomes all the greater and more vivid. The illusion having passed of a possible coincidence of the two cities, real and ideal, the reality of the one ceased to refer to the ideal nature of the other.” (Eugenio Garin 1988, 93–94). A rift developed between civil humanism and modernity: the Renaissance thus represents, in Henri de Lubac’s felicitous phrase, ‘an unfinished dawn’. The experiment in social coexistence of the Italian cites did not continue into the Renaissance, a period characterized instead by bitter fights and wars between various factions. As a result civil life turned out to be too fragile to withstand the assault of historical reality, marked by civil wars and barbarism. Niccolò Machiavelli’s (1952) work must be located in this setting. His thought closely reflects that phase of European culture in the area of political and civil ideals. The human person as an individual for Niccolò Machiavelli, and later for Thomas Hobbes, is wicked, fearful, brutish, and cunning, words which became the anthropological vocabulary of modernism.Footnote 1 We find in fact a radical anthropological pessimism at the core of Machiavelli’s political theory—influenced by the historical events in Italy to which he was a witness—that permeates and explains his entire work: “One can say this of men in general: they are ungrateful, fickle, deceitful and dissembling, cowardly, and covetous for gain; as long as you do well for them they are wholly yours, offering you their blood, property, life, and children… when need is distant; but, when it approaches, they turn against you” (Prince, Ch. XVII). If this is how human beings really are, then the basis for a common life cannot be love, but fear: “Men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails” (ib.). The ‘prince’ then is one who, thanks to his political virtue, frees his subjects—no longer citizens—from destructive conflicts that the brute animal unleashes if left free to act within the city; such a prince would find a close resemblance with Hobbes’s Leviathan. The Machiavellian revolution was then essentially anthropological, and his arguments on political theory depend on that. In a clean and explicit break with Christian anthropology and ecclesiology (which, for Machiavelli, had rendered humanity incapable of constructing the city of man, because they were too preoccupied with the city of God), Machiavelli repositioned history under the dominion of Fortune (or Fate), suggesting to the prince and the political person the means of attracting Fortune to one’s side: with political virtue the prince makes it such that Lady Luck pours out on him the gifts of her cornucopia. The transition from fifteenth century civil humanism to the sixteenth century Machiavellian theory was also anthropological and cultural; social life was no longer considered a place for happiness, following along the lines of Aristotle, but essentially a ‘valley of tears’. In order to understand some of the reasons that led to the assertion, even in modern political economy, of this individualistic and asocial vision of the human being. A strong philosophical continuity exists among individualistic humanisst, Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith, about how to conceptualize life in common. We will find that the emergence of economic science represents an important stage in the march toward an individualistic, non-communitarian and immunizing humanism in Western modernity.",4
59,4,International Review of Economics,23 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0168-7,"Who is the happy warrior? Philosophy, happiness research, and public policy",December 2012,Martha C. Nussbaum,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Psychologists often talk about pleasure and also about subjects’ hedonic state. Too rarely, however, do they ask some very obvious questions about it that greatly affect any research program involving the concept. Two central questions are as follows: Is pleasure a single thing, varying only in intensity or duration, or Is it plural, containing qualitative differences? And, is it a sensation, or is it something more like a way of attending to the world, or even a way of being active? Jeremy Bentham famously held that pleasure was a single sensation, varying only along the quantitative dimensions of intensity and duration.Footnote 1 Modern psychology follows Bentham. Indeed, Kahneman explicitly traces his own conception of “hedonic flow” to Bentham.Footnote 2 And yet, Is Bentham correct? Does his account correctly capture the complexity of our experience of pleasures of many sorts? We speak of pleasure as a type of experience, but we also refer to activities as “my pleasures,” saying things like, “My greatest pleasures are listening to Mahler and eating salmon.” We also use verbal locutions, such as “enjoying” and “taking delight in.” (The ancient Greeks used such verbal locutions much more frequently than they used the noun.) Such ways of talking raise two questions as follows: Is pleasure a sensation at all, if such very different experiences count as pleasures? And is it single? Could there be any one thing that both eating a nice piece of salmon and listening to Mahler’s Tenth, that harrowing confrontation with grief and emptiness, have in common? These questions were subtly discussed by Plato, Aristotle, and a whole line of subsequent philosophers.Footnote 3 Bentham simply ignores them. As Mill writes in his great essay “On Bentham,” “Bentham failed in deriving light from other minds.” For him, pleasure simply must be a single homogeneous sensation, containing no qualitative differences. The only variations in pleasure are quantitative. Pleasures can vary in intensity, duration, certainty or uncertainty, propinquity or remoteness, and, finally, in causal properties (tendency to produce more pleasure, etc.). The apparent fact that pleasures differ in quality that the pleasure of salmon-eating is quite different from the pleasure of listening to Mahler’s Tenth bothered Bentham not at all; he does not discuss such examples. Perhaps the reason for this problem is that Bentham’s deepest concern is with pain and suffering, and it is somewhat more plausible to think of pain as a unitary sensation varying only in intensity and duration. Even here, however, qualitative differences seem crucial: The pain of a headache is very different from the pain of losing a loved one to death. Perhaps, it is because Bentham is far more concerned with bodily pain than with emotional distress that he fails to discuss this problem. As Mill says, Bentham’s view expresses “the empiricism of one who has had little experience”—either external, he adds, or internal, through the imagination. Nor was Bentham worried about interpersonal comparisons, a problem on which economists in the Utilitarian tradition have spent great labor, and one that any program to use subjective satisfaction for public policy must face. For Bentham, there was no such problem. When we move from one person to many people, we just add a new dimension of quantity. Right action is ultimately defined as that which produces the greatest pleasure for the greatest number. Moreover, Bentham sees no problem in extending the comparison class to the entire world of sentient animals. One of the most attractive aspects of his thought is its great compassion for the suffering of animals, which he took to be unproblematically comparable to human suffering.Footnote 4 This attractive aspect, however, is marred by his failure even to consider whether animal pains and pleasures are qualitatively different, in at least some respects, from human pains and pleasures. What is appealing about Bentham’s program is its focus on urgent needs of sentient beings for relief from bodily suffering and its determination to take all suffering of all sentient beings into account. But Bentham cannot be said to have developed anything like a convincing account of pleasure and pain, far less of happiness. Because of his attachment to a strident simplicity, the view remains a sketch crying out for adequate philosophical development. Modern philosophers starting off from the Greco-Roman tradition have noticed that already in that tradition there is a widespread sense that Bentham’s sort of answer will not do. A proto-Benthamite answer is familiar, in views of hedonists such as EudoxusFootnote 5 and the title character in Plato’s Philebus, who represented Eudoxus’s position. But there is an equally widespread sense among the Greek thinkers that this view will not do. The young interlocutor Protarchus, in the Philebus, is quickly brought by Socrates to reject it: He sees that the sources of pleasure color the pleasure itself and that the pleasure of philosophizing is just not the same qualitatively as the pleasure of eating and sex. (The name “Philebus” means “lover of young men,” and the character is represented as using his unitary view of pleasure to seduce attractive youths.)Footnote 6
 Aristotle takes up where the Philebus left off. Throughout his work, he insists on the tremendous importance of qualitative distinctions among the diverse constituent parts of human life; he later suggests that these distinctions affect the proper analysis of the concept of pleasure. Notoriously, however, he offers two very different conceptions of pleasure, one in book VII and one in book X of the Nicomachean Ethics. The first identifies pleasure with unimpeded activity (not so odd if we remember that we speak of “my pleasures” and “enjoyments”). The second, and probably better, account holds that pleasure is something that comes along with, supervenes on, activity, “like the bloom on the cheek of a young person.” In other words, it is so closely linked to the relevant activities that it cannot be pursued on its own, any more than bloom can be adequately cultivated by cosmetics. To get that bloom, you have to pursue health. Similarly, one gets the pleasure associated with an activity by doing that activity in a certain way, apparently a way that is not impeded or is complete. It would seem that what Aristotle has in mind is that pleasure is a kind of awareness of one’s own activity, varying in quality with the activity to which it is so closely linked. In any case, pleasure is not a single thing, varying only in intensity and duration (the Eudoxan position). It contains qualitative differences, related to the differences of the activities to which it attaches. J. S. Mill follows Aristotle. In a crucial discussion in Utilitarianism, he insists that “[n]either pains nor pleasures are homogenous.” There are differences “in kind, apart from the question of intensity,” that are evident to any competent judge. We cannot avoid recognizing qualitative differences, particularly between “higher” and “lower” pleasures. How, then, to judge between them? Like Plato in Republic book IX, Mill refers the choice to a competent judge who has experienced both alternatives. This famous passage shows Mill thinking of pleasures as very like activities (with Aristotle in Book VII) or, with Aristotle in Book X, as experiences so closely linked to activities that they cannot be pursued apart from them. In a later text, he counts music, virtue, and health as major pleasures. Elsewhere, he shows that he has not left sensation utterly out of account: He refers to “which of two modes of existence is the most grateful to the feelings.” Clearly, however, the unity of the Benthamite calculus has been thrown out, to be replaced by a variegated conception, involving both sensation and activity, and prominently including qualitative distinctions. It is for this reason that philosophers today typically find Mill more subtle and conceptually satisfactory than Bentham. Modern philosophical discussion of pleasure follows Aristotle and Mill. In one of the best recent accounts, J. C. B. Gosling’s book Pleasure and Desire,Footnote 7 Gosling investigates three different views of what pleasure is: the sensation view (Bentham/Eudoxus); the activity view (Aristotle’s first account); and what he calls the “adverbial” view (pleasure is a particular way of being active, a view closely related to Aristotle’s second account). Uneasily, with much uncertainty, he opts, with Aristotle, for the adverbial view. Now, it is obvious that such debates influence the ways in which one would study pleasure empirically. If Aristotle, Mill, and Gosling are correct, it would not make sense to ask people to rank all their pleasures along a single quantitative dimension: This is just bullying people into disregarding features of their own experience that reflection would quickly reveal. People are easily bullied, particularly by prominent psychologists, and so they do answer such questions, rather than responding, “This question is ill-formed.” (This docility is probably related to the general subservience to scientific authority that Stanley Milgram’s experiments so disturbingly demonstrate.) If Mill and Aristotle are right, however, they would quickly agree on reflection that qualitative differences matter. Moreover, any experiment that simply assumes pleasure to be a hedonic state, something like a sensation, would also be inadequate, say Mill and Aristotle, to the complexity of human experience, since people agree that activity matters: They would not think—and do not think—that the pleasure derived from being plugged into Robert Nozick’s “experience machine” was equivalent to a pleasure associated with actually doing the activity oneself.Footnote 8
 Some of the most influential experiments ask not about pleasure or hedonic flow, but about satisfaction with one’s life as a whole. Typical is the question posed by Kahneman, “Taking all things together, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days? Are you very satisfied, satisfied, not very satisfied, not at all satisfied?”Footnote 9 Notice here the bullying we encountered before: People are simply told that they are to aggregate experiences of many different kinds into a single whole, and the authority of the questioner is put behind that aggregation. There is no opportunity for them to answer something plausible, such as “Well, my health is good, and my work is going well, but I am very upset about the state of the economy, and one of my friends is very ill.” Not only is that opportunity not provided, but, in addition, the prestige of science—indeed of the Nobel Prize itself—is put behind the instruction to reckon all life-elements up as a single whole. The fact that people answer such questions hardly shows that this is the way that they experience their lives. If we bracket that difficulty, however, we arrive at another one. There is a deep ambiguity about the question being asked. The psychologists who pose this question take the question to be a request for a report of a subjective state of satisfaction, which is at least closely akin to the feeling of pleasure. (Kahneman treats this question and the hedonic-flow question, on the whole, as different ways of getting at the same thing.) One might indeed hear the question that way. But one might also hear it in a very different way, as a request for a reflective judgment about one’s life, which judgment might or might not be accompanied by feelings of satisfaction, contentment, or pleasure. Consider J. S. Mill’s last words: “You know that I have done my work.”Footnote 10 I would say that this is in one way an answer to the overall-satisfaction question: Mill is reporting, we might say, satisfaction with his life as a whole. He has done what he aimed to do. And yet it seems highly unlikely that Mill, on his deathbed, suffering from physical pain and from the fear of death that he acknowledges not being able to get rid of, is experiencing feelings of satisfaction or pleasure. (Mill once reports that the one great attraction of a belief in a life after death—which he finds himself ultimately unable to accept—is the hope it yields of being reunited “with those dear to him who have ended their earthly life before him”—a loss, he continues, that “is neither to be denied nor extenuated.”Footnote 11 So he would no doubt be struggling, on his deathbed, with the eternal loss of Harriet in addition to his own demise.) While judging that his life has been on balance successful, he is almost certainly not experiencing feelings of satisfaction or pleasure. Since the psychologists who work with this question do not notice this ambiguity, they do nothing to sort things out, so we do not really know which question their subjects are answering. Probably some are answering one question, some the other. What would be needed to progress would be conceptual work to separate the feeling-conception from the judgment-conception and then a set of questions designed to tease apart those distinct notions. In my own case, the ambiguity produces something like a contradiction. That is, my own conception of a good life attaches a great deal of value to striving, longing, and working for a difficult goal. So, if I ever notice myself feeling feelings of satisfaction, I blame myself and think that, insofar as I have those feelings, I’m like Mill’s “pig satisfied” or Aristotle’s “dumb grazing animals,” and thus, reflectively, I report dissatisfaction with my life as a whole. Nor do I think that I am an unusual case. As I’ve indicated, Mill’s contrast between Socrates and the pig reveals similar values, and anyone whose culture is deeply influenced by romanticism, with its exaltation of longing and yearning (or, indeed, by the more romantic varieties of Christianity, such as Augustine’s), would have the same difficulty: Insofar as one is feeling satisfied, thus far one’s life is not a success. That is what Nietzsche is getting at in my epigraph: Having feelings of satisfaction as a goal, he thinks, is a rather base thing, something that he associates with the impoverishment of English culture, as contrasted with German romanticism. Zarathustra, asked whether he is happy, responds, “Do I strive after happiness? I strive after my works.”Footnote 12 Schiller, Beethoven, and Mahler might have said that they were satisfied with their life as a whole—in the reflective-judgment sense. They probably, however, did not report many feelings of satisfaction, and they would have worried about themselves if they had had such feelings. (Indeed, Mahler’s Resurrection Symphony revolves precisely around the contrast between the herdlike feeling of satisfaction and the more exalted judgment that one’s whole life is rich and meaningful—because it is governed by an active kind of love. The former is represented by the swoopy, aimless clarinet phrases of the third movement and the latter by the passionate heartbeat that the final movement associates with the wings of the soul.Footnote 13) Bentham simply identifies happiness with pleasure. Kahneman on the whole agrees with Bentham. Some psychologists are more subtle. Seligman’s conception of authentic happiness, for example, involves both positive emotion and valuable activity.Footnote 14 But (to return to my question about Socrates and the pig), how are these two constituents related? Are they both necessary for happiness and jointly sufficient? Is one more important than the other? And must the positive emotion be suitably linked to the good activity, a kind of taking delight in one’s good activity? Here is what Aristotle thought: that activity is far and away the main thing and that pleasure will normally crop up in connection with doing good activities without struggle, the way a virtuous person does them. Pleasure accompanies activity and completes it, like, he says, the bloom on the cheek of a healthy young person. That example implies, too, that it would be totally mistaken to pry the pleasure apart from the activity and seek it on its own: for it would then not be the bloom on the cheek of a healthy person, it would be the rouge on the cheek of a person who has not bothered to cultivate health. And Aristotle also thought that sometimes the pleasure will not arrive: For example, the courageous person who is about to lose his life in battle is happy, but has no pleasant emotion, because he is losing everything. Wordsworth’s very Aristotelian poem, “Character of the Happy Warrior,” tells a similar tale, describing the “happy warrior” as “happy” because he is active in accordance with all the virtues; and yet he has little if any pleasure and a good deal of pain.Footnote 15
 Wordsworth is a useful interlocutor at this point, because we can see that the Aristotelian conception of happiness was dominant until Bentham’s influence dislodged it, changing the very way that many people, at least, hear the English word “happiness.” So powerful was the obscuring power of Bentham’s oversimplification that a question that Wordsworth takes to be altogether askable, and which, indeed, he spends eighty-five lines answering—the question what happiness really is—soon looks to philosophers under Bentham’s influence like a question whose answer is so obvious that it cannot be asked in earnest. Thus, early twentieth-century philosopher Henry Prichard, albeit a foe of Utilitarianism, was so influenced in his thinking about happiness by Bentham’s conception that he simply assumed that any philosopher who talks about happiness must be identifying it with pleasure or satisfaction. When Aristotle asks what happiness is, Prichard argued, he cannot really be asking the question he appears to be asking, since the answer to that question is obvious: happiness is contentment or satisfaction. Instead of asking what happiness consists in, then, he must really be asking about the instrumental means to the production of happiness.Footnote 16 Nietzsche, similarly, understands happiness to be (uncontroversially) a state of pleasure and contentment and expresses his scorn for Englishmen who pursue that goal, rather than richer goals involving suffering for a noble end, continued striving, activities that put contentment at risk, and so forth. Apparently unaware of the richer English tradition about happiness represented in Wordsworth’s poem, he simply took English “happiness” to be what Bentham said it was. So, much later, did Finnish sociologist Erik Allardt, when he wrote an attack on the idea that happiness was the end of social planning, entitling his book Having, Loving,
Being—active things that he took to be more important than satisfaction, which Finns, heir of Nordic romanticism, typically think quite unimportant.Footnote 17 Like Nietzsche, he understood the “happiness” of the social scientists to be a state of pleasure or satisfaction. (He is correct about the social scientists, if not about “happiness.”) Aristotle’s richer conception is still present in our lives, and we can see that ideas like Seligman’s idea of authentic happiness capture something of its spirit.Footnote 18 According to this Aristotelian tradition, what we all can agree about is that happiness (eudaimonia) is something like flourishing human living, a kind of living that is active, inclusive of all that has intrinsic value, and complete, meaning lacking in nothing that would make it richer or better. Everything else about happiness is disputed, says Aristotle, but he then goes on to argue for a conception of happiness that identifies it with a specific plurality of valuable activities, including activity in accordance with excellencesFootnote 19 (valuable traits) of many sorts, including ethical, intellectual, and political excellences, and activities involved in love and friendship. Pleasure, as I have said, is not identical with happiness, but it usually (not always) accompanies the unimpeded performance of the activities that constitute happiness. Something like this is the idea that Wordsworth is relying on, when he asks, in each of the many areas of life, what the character and demeanor of the “happy warrior” would be, and answers that question. As J. L. Austin memorably wrote in a devastating critique of Prichard on Aristotle, “I do not think Wordsworth meant …: ‘This is the warrior who feels pleased.’ Indeed, he is ‘Doomed to go in company with Pain/And fear and bloodshed, miserable train.’” As Austin saw, the important thing about the happy warrior is that he has traits that make him capable of performing all of life’s many activities in an exemplary way, and he acts in accordance with those traits. He is moderate, kind, courageous, loving, a good friend, concerned for the community, honest,Footnote 20 not excessively attached to honor or worldly ambition, a lover of reason, an equal lover of home and family. His life is happy because it is full and rich, even though it sometimes may involve pain and loss. So, would Seligman agree with Aristotle and Wordsworth that the happy warrior is indeed happy? Or does he require pleasant emotion in addition to the good activity? If even Seligman’s conception is underspecified, however, Kahneman does not get to the point of noticing a problem at all and simply goes along with Bentham. (I note that the happy warrior is happy, even in painful battle, because he is still able to act well; Aristotle believed, however, that more extreme calamities could “dislodge” one from happiness, by removing one’s sphere of activity. His example is Priam at the end of the Trojan War, who lost his children, his political freedom and power, and his personal freedom.Footnote 21) When we notice that happiness is complex, we are prepared to face yet a further question in connection with its proper analysis as follows: Does happiness require self-examination? All the ancient philosophers take issue with some of the popular accounts of eudaimonia in their cultural setting, by arguing that no life is truly happy unless it is accompanied by reflection. As Socrates says in the Apology, “The unexamined life is not worth living for a human being.” One sees clearly in Plato’s dialogues how controversial this emphasis is. When people are asked to define a virtue (seen as a putative part of happiness), they never include this element of knowledge or reflection—until Socrates patiently shows them that any definition that leaves it out is inadequate. On reflection, however, they always agree with Socrates, and I’d say that my contemporary students do as well when they think about it for a while. Aristotle gives a little more room than Plato does to the non-intellectual elements in virtue, including emotions as at least one part of what each virtue involves. But he, too, sticks to the Socratic commitment, saying that each and every virtue of character requires the intellectual virtue of practical wisdom. Much later, as we saw, J. S. Mill insists that it is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. Wordsworth, as you can see, agrees with the Socratic tradition: The happy warrior’s “law is reason.” He “depends/Upon that law as on the best of friends,” and he strives to become ever “More skilful in self-knowledge.” The commitment to reflection is also a commitment to the ceaseless critical scrutiny of cultural beliefs and cultural authorities. Well in advance of modern psychological research on deference to authority (Milgram) and peer pressure (Asch), Socrates knows that these endemic human failings disable democratic life. Therefore, he interrogates everyone he meets, and nobody does very well, especially not received cultural authorities. Socrates himself does best only in the sense that he is aware of the incompleteness and fallibility of his knowledge of happiness. Although later Greek philosophers are more willing than Socrates to pronounce on what happiness is, they are no more trustful of their culture, and all are relentless critics of their cultures’ dominant understandings of happiness. Aristotle excoriates the undue attention given to the accumulation of wealth, to pleasure, and to manly honor. The Stoics have similar criticisms. And yet, they hold, not implausibly, that if people give it enough thought, they will agree with their proposal, because it honors something that people will understand to be deep in themselves, the source of their human dignity. The omission of this reflective element in happiness is one of the most disturbing aspects of the conceptual breeziness of contemporary subjective-state psychology, insofar as it is laying the groundwork for normative recommendations. Our democracy has many of the vices Socrates identified in his: haste, macho posturing, an excessive deference to wealth and honor. We badly need the element of reflection, and if prestigious psychologists simply tell us again and again that reflection is not a necessary element of the happy life, we may begin to believe it. The part of subjective-state measurement that focuses on moment-to-moment hedonic flow assumes that some emotions are “positive” and others are “negative.” Seligman makes a similar assumption and tells us somewhat more about what he is assuming, in keeping with his rather greater interest in philosophical matters. For Seligman, positive emotions, to put it somewhat crudely, are those that feel good. So, love would be positive, anger and grief negative, and so forth. The ancient thinkers adopt a very different account. Again, this issue deeply affects any normative recommendations that may ultimately be based on the conceptual assumptions. Since the Greeks and Romans (along with the best work on emotions in contemporary cognitive psychology) believe that emotions embody appraisals or evaluations of things in the world, they think it is very important for those appraisals to be correct. Fear, for example, involves (in Aristotle’s view) the thought that there are serious damages impending and that one is not entirely in control of warding them off. Anger (again in Aristotle’s view) involves the thought that a serious and inappropriate damage has been willfully inflicted on me or someone or something one cares about, and also the thought that it would be good for that damage to be made good somehow. So, we can see that there are a number of things that can go wrong here. One might get the facts wrong, thinking that a danger was present when it was not or that a wrong had been done when it had not. One might blame the wrong person for the wrong or might wrongly believe that the damaged was blameworthy when it was in fact accidental. Finally, one can get the seriousness of the good or bad event wrong: One may get angry over trivia—Aristotle’s example is when someone forgets your name, so you see the world has changed little. Or, again Aristotle’s example, one might fear a mouse running across the floor. Because emotions embody appraisals, one can only get them to be appropriate by getting appropriate appraisals. Thus, in the Rhetoric, Aristotle gives the aspiring orator recipes for provoking anger in an audience—by convincing them that their enemies have wronged them in some illicit way, for example—and also recipes for taking anger away and calming people down—by convincing them that they had not in fact been wronged in the way they thought or that the thing was not of much importance. For all the ancient thinkers, a necessary and sufficient condition of an emotion’s being truly positive—in the sense of making a positive contribution toward a flourishing life—is that it be based on true beliefs, both about value and about what events have occurred. This is as true of good-feeling as of bad-feeling emotion. Many instances of good-feeling emotion are actually quite negative, inasmuch as they are based on false beliefs about value. Pleasure is only as good as the thing one takes pleasure in: If one takes pleasure in harming others, that good-feeling emotion is very negative; even if one takes pleasure in shirking one’s duty and lazing around, that is also quite negative. If one feels hope, that emotion is good only if it is based on accurate evaluations of the worth of what one hopes for and true beliefs about what is likely. By the same token, many negative-feeling emotions are appropriate and even very valuable. Aristotle, like Wordsworth, stresses that the courageous person is not free from fear: Indeed, he will appropriately feel more fear and pain at the prospect of losing his life in battle than the mediocre person, because his life, which is at risk, is a valuable life and he knows it. Anger is a sign of what we care intensely about and a spur to justice. Aristotle does not urge people to be angry all the time; indeed, he thinks that the appropriate virtue in this area should be called “mildness of temper,” in order to indicate that the good person does not get angry too often. But if someone did not get angry at damages to loved ones or kin, he would be “slavish,” in Aristotle’s view. Again, compassion is painful, but it is extremely valuable, when based on true beliefs and accurate evaluations of the seriousness of the other person’s predicament, because it connects us to the suffering of others and gives us a motive to help them. Grief when a loved one dies is extremely appropriate (although Plato, admiring self-sufficiency, tried to deny this). The ancient philosophers also stress that happy and sad emotions are conceptually interconnected: To the extent that you value uncertain things that are in the control of chance, you cannot help having both fear and hope about them, since their prospects are in fact uncertain. Where you have love, you will also have anxiety—and, very likely, anger. Where you have gratitude (when someone does something importantly nice for you), there is also conceptual space for anger (if that same person should decide to treat you badly). The Stoics saw clearly that the only way to get rid of painful emotions was not to value the uncertain things of human life at all and to care only for one’s own inner states. But Aristotle and most modern readers of the texts reject that solution. Aristotle is correct here. That is, emotions are positive or negative, in the sense relevant to normative thinking, according to the correctness of the appraisals or evaluations they contain. And since human life contains, in fact, many bad accidents and much bad behavior, there is no way a person who values friends, loved ones, work, and political action can avoid having many painful-feeling emotions, such as grief, fear, and anxiety. These emotions are valuable in themselves, as expressions of correct evaluation, and also spur to good action. Can one imagine a struggle for justice that was not fueled by justified anger? Can one imagine a decent society that is not held together by compassion for suffering? Can one imagine love that does not assume the risk of grief? C. Daniel Batson’s excellent research on compassion (which, I note en passant, has a rare philosophical sophistication and precision) has shown that the painful emotion leads to helping; so, it is extremely important not to set out to avoid painful emotional experiences.Footnote 22
 Seligman, in particular, thinks that it is good to promote good-feeling emotions and to minimize bad-feeling emotions, often by thinking hopeful thoughts. But sometimes having a hopeful “take” on the bad thing that has happened seems to trivialize it. The Stoics urged people to respond to the death of a loved one with constructive sentiments, such as “Everyone is mortal, and you will get over this pretty soon.” But are they correct? Is this really the way to take the measure of love?Footnote 23 It is very interesting to see how Cicero, who in his voluminous correspondence consoled his friends with positive sentiments like Seligman’s, rejects them utterly when his beloved daughter Tullia dies. Among the most moving letters in history are his outpourings of desperate grief to his friend Atticus, to whom he says that he feels that he is in a dark forest, and whose injunctions to put an end to his mourning he angrily rejects, saying that he cannot do it, and moreover, he thinks that he should not, even if he could.Footnote 24
 Today, Americans are often are embarrassed by deep grief and tend to give Stoic advice too freely. A colleague in my university lost his son: a young man, troubled, who died either of a drug overdose or by suicide. I wrote him saying that I thought this was the worst thing that could happen to someone and he had my sympathy. This man, whom I don’t know very well, wrote back immediately, thanking me and saying, “I really dislike this American stuff about healing.” (He is an American.) I inferred from that response that many other messages he had received had talked about healing, and he had gotten fed up with them. I’m with him: It seems a deeply inappropriate way to think of the tragic death of a child. So, I’d like to see psychology think more about positive pain, that is, the grief that expresses love, the fear that expresses a true sense of a threat directed at something or someone one loves, the compassion that shares the pain of a suffering person, the anger that says, “This is deeply wrong and I will try to right it.”",24
59,4,International Review of Economics,24 January 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0146-0,Well-being and war,December 2012,Bruno S. Frey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the last years, research on happiness has produced great advances. We know much more now about what factors raise people’s subjective individual well-being.Footnote 1 Happiness research is perhaps one of the “hottest,” and perhaps even revolutionary, developments in recent social science. One of the open questions in well-being research is how military conflict affects subjective individual well-being. The reader may be surprised that this is even an issue at all. Is it not obvious that wars make people unhappy, and even drastically unhappy? I also used to think that everyone accepted that wars reduced the happiness of all the people involved—and I still do. After all, the psychic costs of military combat are well known, and the suffering of the civilian population is evident. Wars cost enormous numbers of human lives. For example, the Second World War resulted in the death of between 50 and 70 million people (Sommerville 2008). Moreover, war hampers economic activity; cities and whole landscapes are devastated, and irrecoverable cultural sites destroyed.Footnote 2
 On the other hand, some factors raise the well-being of people experiencing war, at least in retrospect. That wars may be “ennobling” and hence beneficial to warriors has always been a topic in literature. One need only think of the Greek heroes in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey who seemed to enjoy combat. War may also intensify the feeling of solidarity, shared purpose, and national pride in the civilian population. The research results relating to well-being and war discussed below are revealing but incomplete: There is little systematic and empirically compelling evidence on how military conflict affects happiness.Footnote 3 This paper argues that whether war raises or lowers well-being cannot persuasively be answered without knowing how the people killed in war should be treated in empirical happiness research.Footnote 4 The basic problem can be understood best by considering the following case: A person is badly wounded during a war. That person’s happiness therefore will strongly decrease. It may recover after some time, but, on average, it will not reach the same level of well-being previously enjoyed.Footnote 5 Even if the person fully recovers, there is still a period of time during which that person experienced a drastic loss of happiness. The happiness indicator for that particular country therefore is lower than it would be without this war incident. Compare this to a person killed in war. That person is no longer among the living and cannot be asked about the level of happiness nor can any other measurement technique be applied.Footnote 6 That person’s happiness is totally neglected although the fate of dying is clearly worse (in most cases) than surviving even if gravely wounded. The fact that the person was killed does not directly affect the aggregate happiness indicator of the respective country.Footnote 7
 The difference made in the calculation of happiness between the two situations is shocking: The worse situation (death) is reflected in a higher aggregate happiness level than the relatively better situation in which the person survives. What solutions are there to deal with this problem? How should we treat people killed in war who therefore are no longer a living part of society? Two solutions come to mind. The first endeavors to calculate the happiness forgone by the influence of the war. The second seeks to solve the dilemma by definition, by excluding the dead, that is, by only considering the happiness of the living. Happiness researchers are reluctant to deal with the effect of war activities on happiness for several reasons: It is difficult to deal with the many different types of military conflicts ranging from international, national, and all kinds of civil wars. Wars have many different and indirect consequences, making it difficult to account for them. Thus, during military conflicts, the health achievement of states decreases, thus negatively affecting the well-being of the population (Iqbal 2006).Footnote 8 In wars, democratic rights are curtailed often leading to authoritarian rule. A reduction in democratic rights is known to impair happiness (Dorn et al. 2005; Frey and Stutzer 2000; Graham and Sukhtankar 2004; Inglehart and Klingemann 2000). There is a serious data problem. During a war, surveys are not normally undertaken on how happy people are. Causality may be difficult to establish. War not only affects well-being, but well-being also may affect the propensity to engage in war. Unhappy individuals may be more prone to support conflict resolution by military means. The existence and intensity of the two directions of causality can only be isolated if good data (in particular panel data) are available, which is not generally the case for military conflicts and well-being. The next section of this paper deals with the loss of well-being experienced during military conflicts. The following section discusses the crucial issue of how the well-being forgone of the persons killed is, and should be, treated. Next, I consider in what respect wars may raise the well-being. The last section concludes.",8
59,4,International Review of Economics,10 April 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0156-y,The status of happiness,December 2012,Graeme Garrard,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ever since the advent of advanced commercial economies in the West, writers and thinkers have speculated upon and theorised about the relationship between status and happiness.  For example, in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Swiss writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, author of the Encyclopedie article on ‘Political Economy’ (1755), argued that the principal source of human unhappiness was our tendency to make invidious comparisons with each other when we were forced by circumstances to cooperate, against their natures, to solve life-threatening ‘collective action problems’ in the presocial state of nature. This increased proximity transformed humanity’s benign and natural self-love into a rapacious and destructive new form of selfishness, which fuelled a growing competition for standing in the eyes of others. This insatiable desire for status and relative position, Rousseau held, is the source of the deep and pervasive unhappiness that he believed was one of the principal hallmarks of modern Western civilisation. In what follows I argue that Rousseau account of this relationship between status and happiness is partly correct and partly incorrect. On the one hand (I argue in part 3), there is now substantial credible (if not wholly conclusive) evidence that tends to support the view that relative wealth and position matter much more to individuals than do absolute levels of wealth or material possessions, at least above a certain level. The pervasive competition for relative rank and status that Rousseau claimed was one of the defining features of the modern West has left the vast majority of people much less happy than they would otherwise be by fostering costly and often futile expenditure arms races focused on ‘positional goods’ that diverts resources from other goods, reduces objective welfare and significantly increases stress and anxiety. On the other hand (I argue in part 4), there is also mounting evidence (again inconclusive, although persuasive and highly suggestive) that Rousseau was wrong that this situation is unnatural. According to some evolutionary biologists, human beings evolved over many millennia in an environment of scarcity and intense resource competition, where each individual’s position was closely linked to his/her prospects for survival and reproductive success. The lower one was positioned relative to one’s immediate rivals, the less access one typically had to scarce resources, which in turn limited the likelihood of producing offspring and thereby passing on one’s genes. For most of human history, having high relative standing was instrumental in helping individuals to achieve the objectives they instinctively care most deeply about, namely survival and reproductive success. On this view, we are adapted by evolution to compete for status and relative position, which leads to a situation in which most people end up less happy.",2
59,4,International Review of Economics,12 May 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0160-2,Ethics and social capital for global well-being,December 2012,Patricia Illingworth,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There are well-established criteria for identifying the moral sphere and distinguishing it from the non-moral (Singer 1993). To say that a concept, principle, or judgment is ethical is to say that it is regarded as good and is worthy of pursuit, and that it would be better to have than not to have. The concept of social capital meets the standard criteria for an ethical concept. First, ethics usually concerns conduct toward others (Singer 1993). Baron, Field, and Schuller make the point that “One of the key merits of social capital is the way it shifts the focus of analysis from the behavior of individual agents to the pattern of relations between agents in social units and institutions” (2000). Since social capital evolves from the relationships between and among people, it easily satisfies this criterion of the ethical. Generalized reciprocity also reflects a concern with other people. Simply focusing on reciprocation is a step away from the self and toward others. Generalized reciprocity, the willingness to help others without demanding immediate or direct reciprocity, is an additional step. The values inherent in generalized reciprocity imply that people ought to give to others even when they cannot anticipate in kind, immediate, and direct reciprocation from the recipient. It counts as reciprocity because reciprocation takes place, even if someone other than the original giver is the beneficiary. In some quarters, generalized reciprocity is referred to as paying forward. In other quarters, and depending upon interpretation, it could be understood as the Golden Rule, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” (Matthew 7:12). Second, ethical judgments and decisions are universal: If a judgment is an ethical one, then it will be true for everyone (Singer 1993). Universalization can be understood in a number of ways. The concept of liberty can be instructive. As with liberty, social capital seems to be important for everyone. Though people possess different amounts of social capital (as they do liberty), and different psychological capacities to take advantage of it, access to social capital seems to be universally valuable. There is another sense of universal according to which we should treat people impartially. With respect to creating social capital, impartiality would require us to fashion norms and networks impartially, without regard to race, gender, religion, and other personal characteristics. This is crucial for the ethics of social capital and is one of the strongest reasons for treating social capital as a moral concept. Because of the tendency toward homophily, people often form ties and networks with people who are just like them (McPherson et al. 2001). The preference for people similar to oneself can lead to prejudice and discrimination against other people. In turn, social capital reservoirs can be concentrated within homogenous groups that exclude “strangers.” When we understand social capital as a moral concept, the option to favor those who are similar to oneself is a violation of impartiality, and therefore morally wrong. Given the social benefits associated with social capital, including access to important opportunities, impartiality may be required by the principle of equal opportunity advocated by Rawls and others. Generalized reciprocity is similar to the Golden Rule. It states simply, “give even when you cannot anticipate immediate reciprocity,” or simply “give.” In this respect, giving is universalized. Here, giving should be understood broadly to include giving of money, time, consideration, and other forms of help. Third, ethical statements are prescriptive. If a concept is an ethical one, then to say that it is ethical is also to say it is good, or go ahead and do “it.” Social capital also satisfies this condition. Although social capital may have a dark side, overall, it is a good thing, and it is regarded as such. Social capital is a form of capital; it has value for those who create it, as well as for others. Fourth, ethical statements are normative. They are not descriptive statements, but state what ought to be the case. Insofar as social capital is used to promote good ends (and not, for example, to promote the racist goals of the Ku Klux Klan), it makes sense to encourage it. Social capital used for bad does not qualify as the kind of social capital that is morally valuable. Very often, it would violate the requirement of impartiality. This is so with groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Social capital also has some important substantive moral qualities. It is communitarian, or social. It is of the people, and for the people. Social capital cannot be produced by one person; it is not the stuff of rugged individualism, but rather the stuff of social relations in which people act for each other and together. A society with a strong commitment to negative liberty may find it difficult to cultivate social capital. Social capital is most easily nurtured by putting people together. Participation in group activities takes effort, and above all adequate regard for the other. When people value social capital, and view its creation as morally important, they are more likely to promote it even when they may not feel inclined to do so, or are tempted to act for self-interest. Social capital carries with it a particular vision of responsibility. Consider again a comparison with the concept of liberty. Individual liberty implies that individuals are responsible for their actions. This is encapsulated in the notion of personal responsibility, and the idea that people are free to act otherwise. Social capital seems to suggest that many outcomes, which we typically associate with individual action, may more accurately be understood as the result of social networks, collaborations, or cooperative actions. For example, the good health that some people experience may not be the result of only biology, individual lifestyle, or genetic makeup, but also the social networks available to them, or the green environment they have collectively created. Similarly, if global warming were to be reduced, it would be the result of collective action. To have substantive impact on greenhouse gas emissions, people need to change their behavior, and if they do change it, it will be in part because others have done so. An appreciation for the role of social capital in community life may lift some outcomes out of the moral paradigm of individual and personal responsibility and place them in the paradigm of collaborative or collective responsibility. Were we to take social capital into account in policy, ethics, and law, some of our assumptions about causation and responsibility may be challenged. In tort law, for example, causation is primarily analyzed in terms of “but for” causation; “but for” a particular action, a particular injury or harm would not have taken place (Keeton 1984). This causal framework is better suited to individual events and actions than to collective ones. In fact, it invites the finder of fact to distinguish one event or action from all of the others that may play a causal role in an outcome. Consider the case of health again. Two kinds of causal explanations can be given for heart disease: one that focuses on biological factors, and one that looks to the social determinants of health, such as inequality, race and poverty. If our conception of causation asks us to identify just one event or action, as “but for” causation does, it predisposes us to identify factors such as genes and cholesterol levels, while it would be blind to collective and cooperative factors, such as inequality, race and poverty. “But for” causation ignores the impact social relations and social networks have on health.
 In the economic sphere, Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon made a similar point in his essay entitled, “A Basic Income for All.” There he argues that an important source of the difference in incomes both within one society and between societies is the presence of and access to social capital. By “social capital,” Simon has in mind “knowledge and participation in kinship and other privileged social relations” (2000). Peter Singer in his book, The Life You Can Save, makes this point as well (2009). When we include social capital in our conceptual repertoire, it will often be more accurate to use “we” where we now use “I.” Justice is concerned with the distribution of burdens and benefits in society. Because social capital is both a benefit to be distributed and a mechanism for distributing prized benefits, it is important for justice. As Putnam points out, people with a more extensive Rolodex enjoy greater social capital and the benefits it creates. Because of the substantial gains associated with social capital, and the dependence of the poor on it as a means to secure many benefits, it is important, for the sake of justice, to be mindful of the impact of policy on social capital. As mentioned earlier, a Rawlsian commitment to equality of opportunity and to benefit the worst off might well dictate a consideration of social capital (Rawls 1971). The harms associated with a deprivation in social capital are exacerbated by the fact that wealthy people have more social capital than poor people while the poor appear to need it more than the wealthy (since they do not have access to mechanisms that might compensate for its absence). When social capital is treated as a moral concept, networks are likely to flourish and to be more evenly dispersed in society, with the result that network poverty is reduced. Social capital is an essential resource for the poor who, unlike the rich, cannot gate their communities to ensure their safety or rely on lawyers to protect their agreements. As with other ethical principles, there are times when social capital conflicts with other values—all morally worthwhile pursuits—and we will sometimes need to make choices among them. The moral principle of social capital should be taken into account when it is relevant. It provides people with reasons for acting one way rather than another; it carries some moral weight, but is not all or nothing (Dworkin 1967). The obligation to promote social capital requires us to consider the consequences of our actions, policies, and law on social capital, and where possible to act to foster and protect it. Social capital is like the concept of liberty: It is an enabler concept, valuable for what it enables. Liberty, as we know from John Stuart Mill’s discussion in On Liberty, is important because among other things, people know themselves best, and should be given the liberty to choose their life plans (1975). Mill seems to believe that if we want to maximize happiness, it is best to give people freedom. Here, liberty is not valuable for its own sake, but for what it can enable. Similarly, when there is abundant social capital, people are in a better position to secure the benefits that accompany social networks, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity both for themselves and for the sake of others. But those who create social capital are not its only beneficiaries. Social capital has a rainmaker effect, which means that it confers good things on people outside the group of people who create it.",7

59,4,International Review of Economics,20 April 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0159-8,The price of the market: pursuit of self-interest as annihilation of self,December 2012,Robert Urquhart,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The idea that the market provides uniquely well for the well-being of the individual, already put forward by Adam Smith, remains a mainstay of contemporary neoclassical economics. It is also having a remarkable resurgence in public debate, especially in the United States, with its proponents holding that the imperative to adhere to market principles—a moral imperative, it seems—outweighs all other considerations.Footnote 1 The market provides by leaving each individual “perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way” (Smith 1976b: IV.ix.51), in Adam Smith’s famous phrase. So the pursuit of self-interest is the primary means for securing individual well-being and happiness; freedom, defined as the absence of external barriers, is its primary condition; and the market provides that freedom to the highest possible degree. Two especially important parts of this idea need to be emphasized. First, because of what the individual is, what characteristics it has, the market is uniquely qualified to provide for it. The market is in some sense the natural habitat of the individual, the right place for individuals given what they are. Second, the specific way in which the market provides for the individual is that it is the field in which the individual’s own private interest may best be pursued. That is, each individual has a self-interest of its own: I have interests that are mine alone, you have interests that are yours alone, and so on; and the market is the place where each one of us can pursue our own interests best. Although we all have different interests, the market answers to them all, giving us the means to pursue them as we choose—in our own way. Some may fail in this pursuit for one reason or another, and to one degree or another. But nowhere else than the market can provide such a field. These two points may then be put together: the market is the natural habitat of the individual because it allows each individual to pursue its own private interest, as it chooses, with the best hope of success. I am going to argue that this idea of market and individual is not only untenable; it is disastrously mistaken. But although I am going to offer an alternative eventually, I am first going to argue that even on its own terms, the idea does not hold, and in fact, points toward the alternative. Before beginning, however, I want to be clear about some things that I am not arguing. I am not arguing, for example, that market outcomes are often unfair or that the self-interested pursuits of some harm others. Nor am I arguing that the pursuit of self-interest becomes an unlimited pursuit of greed and that this is necessarily destructive of economic stability and social order. I do in fact think that all of these arguments can be substantiated, but I am not defending them here. More broadly, my argument is not a moral one, concerned with what ought to be; it is, rather, concerned with what individuals are, and with what conditions are necessary to secure their well-being and happiness given what they are. My central claim is that the pursuit of self-interest—in the normal understanding of the phrase as used in economic theory and public debate—is destructive of the individual engaged in that pursuit, and destructive, precisely, of the self. Generally, also, the more successful the pursuit, the more destruction to the self. The idea that the market does well by individuals in giving them the best field for the pursuit of self-interest is disastrously mistaken because it is wrong about what individuals are. As we will see, the damaging effects of the pursuit of self-interest on the individual are surprisingly obvious (if usually unnoticed) in neoclassical economics itself. However, if the only result was the claim that the neoclassical account of the individual, self-interest, and the market is mistaken, it would be of relatively little interest. It would simply join the already long list of ways in which neoclassical economics fails to be of value in attempting to understand how the economy actually works. But this is not all. First, this idea of individual, self-interest, and market has real influence not only in public debate, but in actual decisions made by actual individuals: so it is not only of more than academic concern, it is doing actual harm. Second, although I argue that it is a mistaken view of what the individual is, it is mistaken in an odd way. The standard and justified criticism of neoclassical economics is that its assumptions are unrealistic and have little to do with the things the theory is supposed to be analyzing. This is indeed true of the neoclassical idea of the individual. However, the odd thing is that although it is a completely inadequate idea of the individual, it is surprisingly accurate as a description of the way in which individuals are damaged by the normal operation of the modern economy. In this instance, neoclassical economics is all too realistic. It is mistaken about what individuals are, but right about what is happening to them now. I will consider two primary accounts of the idea that the market does well by the individual: first, the canonical version given by Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations, paying particular attention to Smith’s enrollment of individuals in the three great social orders of landlords, laborers, and merchants and master manufacturers; and second, that given by neoclassical economics in its depiction of the individual and consumption, perfect competition, and human capital.Footnote 2 Both accounts, though in very different ways, will bear out the claim that far from showing the value for individuals of the pursuit of self-interest in the market, they show, rather, how it destroys individuals. I will then ask whether this is necessarily so: whether the market must damage the individual. The answer will be somewhat equivocal, but it will point toward an alternative account of the individual, and, thus, to an idea of what the market would have to be like so as not to be destructive of individuality. Such a market would be very different to the current system, however, and would have lost most of its specifically capitalist characteristics.",4

Anthropologists have contrasted the rules relevant to the autonomous functioning of the market in industrial societies (consider, for instance, Polanyi’s concept of self-regulating market), with those relevant to the social organisation of traditional societies in which markets were embedded (Polanyi [1944] 1957, 1977; Polanyi et al. 1957). Historians have traditionally developed another opposition between the open market or market-place, where small, local trade was regulated by public authorities, and the free or private market, where big merchants acted autonomously on long distances (Pirenne [1933] 1963; Everitt 1967; Braudel 1979; Kaplan 1984). More recently, historians have begun to analyse the genesis of the modern market in the context of the formation of a coherent institutional system in European towns, beginning from the middle ages (Capitani 1974, 1987; Todeschini 1994, 2000, 2004, 2005; Prodi 2009). Of course, the roots of the market are earlier and not only European, but the medieval turning point is crucial for understanding the modern market. The analyses of the above-mentioned historians go beyond the former oppositions between market and society, and between public and private market. They show that market regulation in the medieval and early modern age was part of a wider institutional design of civil life, which was based on the primacy of the common good, typical of organicistic and hierarchical societies. In other words, the market was not simply regulated, but rather constructed. These origins are still recognisable in present-day economic and social public policies, and knowledge regarding them proves useful in the current debate on economic versus social development. The reason why the kind of exchange peculiar to the market was considered potentially dangerous for the overall social organisation comes from its comparison with another kind of exchange, which was based on reciprocity. We can define the latter as a connective, relation-based exchange. As pointed out by Marcel Mauss ([1923–1924] 1950), this kind of exchange is aimed at creating and maintaining links by means of reciprocal obligations between groups (families, clans, and tribes). Here, things have a secondary importance: they are not significant in themselves, but because they symbolise the link created through their transfer. Mauss referred to this kind of relations as total, as they involve the whole of society and its institutions: these relations are not only economic, but also social. Market exchange, on the other hand, can be defined as an acquisitive, thing-based exchange. It is aimed at obtaining goods (including money) in exchange for other goods. In this kind of exchange, relations, instead of things, are secondary: even preferential relations based on reputation and trust are instrumental to obtaining goods. Hence, such relations are not total, but simply contractual: the contract defines the performances of both parties, and when these are fulfilled, the parties have no further reciprocal obligations. Market exchange is not necessarily impersonal or short-term, yet it can exhibit these features, because of its acquisitive, rather than connective nature. At the same time, an acquisitive aim and the legal form of a contract are not sufficient for defining market exchange. For a market to exist, acquisitive exchanges must be coordinated in a system of acts of exchange. The market may thus be defined as a subsystem of the system of society, devoted to the coordination of acquisitive and contractual acts of exchange through the intermediation of money (Clerici 2001, pp. 13, 21–22, 24). The idea of the market as a peculiar sphere of society has existed since the middle ages in the process of market structuring in European towns. This process was based on the presupposition that what I have called acquisitive exchange could be directed to the pursuit of the common good only if it was harmonised with the basic principles on which society was built (Todeschini 2005, pp. 187–191, 203–210; Prodi 2009, pp. 64–68). Reciprocity, far from being limited to the so-called primitive or archaic communities, still had an important place in medieval and early modern European societies (Duby 1973; N. Z. Davis 2000; Algazi et al. 2003; Krausman Ben-Amos 2008). It represented a benchmark of sociality, which was kept in mind when structuring acquisitive exchange within the market subsystem of society. The market was thus designed so that acquisitive exchanges were carried out in a way consistent with social cohesion. Since unrestrained particularistic tendencies could be favoured by the practice of acquisitive exchange, the defence of social cohesion was realised through the establishment of the market as a public space for this kind of exchange, or, in functional terms, as the subsystem devoted to their coordination. It is, however, worth stressing that, by establishing such a public space, public authorities did not aim to control and (possibly) neutralise the undesired social effects of an exogenous form of economic organisation, incompatible with the foundations of the social order. Rather, they aimed at guaranteeing that acquisitive exchange be carried out in accordance with those foundations and in such a way as it was advantageous for all: the market was seen as part of society. The process of market structuring and the development of theologico-ethical doctrines on society and economics were relevant in the context of towns, and intersected. Since the early Christian age, and especially after the foundation of the mendicant Orders in the first quarter of the thirteenth century, the market was conceived of as the sphere of society devoted to the collective assessment of the value of goods (the so-called communis aestimatio or common estimation) and to the fruitful and legitimate use of wealth, for the benefit of the whole society. This was to be achieved through their constant circulation, based on the principle of the charitable donation of unnecessary goods. These features were opposed to an arbitrary evaluation of goods, and to a fruitless and illegitimate use of wealth (that is, their subtraction from circulation and their unproductive accumulation, driven only by the aim of individual benefit and undermined by greed for earthly goods). Thus, arbitrary evaluation and unproductive accumulation were regarded as usurious diversions from fair trade practice, and attributed as a feature peculiar to unbelievers (that is, those who were outside of the believers’ community) (Todeschini 2005, pp. 155, 158–160, 163, 180–181). Their condemnation was even more severe in the case of foodstuffs and other goods essential for the daily life of common people. The legal ban of such practices—matters of principal concern for public authorities—was widespread in European towns (Pirenne [1933] 1963, pp. 142–144). This was a manifestation of the non-written, ancient pact between rulers and people, based on the assurance of subsistence (Thompson 1971, pp. 78–79, 83–84; Martinat 2004, pp. 30–36, 94, 119).",2

Frey,Paolo Pamini,Lasse Steiner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In 1959, UNESCO launched a spectacular and successful international campaign to save the Abu Simbel temples in the Nile Valley. In 1966, UNESCO also spearheaded an international campaign to save Venice after disastrous floods threatened the survival of the city. At its 17th session in Paris in November 1972, the General Conference of UNESCO adopted the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural heritage. To date, 190 state parties have ratified this Convention, and the World Heritage List currently has 962 Sites, 745 (or 77 percent) of which relate to culture, 188 to nature, and 29 are mixed combining cultural and natural heritage.Footnote 1 The World Heritage List has become very popular, and most World Heritage Sites are major attractions for cultural tourism as well as being icons of national identity (Shackley 2006:85). Many regard the UNESCO List as “the most effective international legal instrument for the protection of the cultural and natural heritage” (Strasser 2002, p. 215). The List is the result of actions by state parties that nominate the Sites, the World Heritage Committee that formally decides on inclusion on the List, and three advisory boards. Member governments must propose sites to be included on the List. Mayors or district governments may only make proposals for inclusion on a tentative list. The official nomination of a Site occurs when a country hands in a complete nomination document. The World Heritage Committee meets once a year and consists of representatives from 21 of the member countries. The General Assembly of the members of the Convention elects this committee for terms of up to 6 years. The intention of the Convention is an equitable representation of the world’s regions and cultures. Sites for inclusion on the World Heritage List are selected according to 10 criteria, which are covered in detail in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention (UNESCO 2005). Nominated sites must meet at least one of the 10 criteria, six of which refer to Cultural and four to Natural Sites. The Committee, which is the final decision-making body, is advised by the International Council on Museums and Sites (ICOMOS), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). It has been claimed, “The scrutiny of these systems … [is] rigorous…” (Cleere 2006:xxii). Accompanying the increasing popularity of the List, a large social science literature on World Heritage and the UNESCO program has developed (see especially the collections of Leask and Fyall (2006), Harrison and Hitchcock (2005). In economics, there are noteworthy recent contributions by van der Aa (2005) Bertacchini et al. (2011), or Frey and Steiner (2011). General heritage issues are also well discussed in Peacock and Rizzo (2008) or Rizzo and Towse (2002). The contribution most noteworthy within the context of this article is the paper by Bertacchini and Saccone (2012), which focuses on the behavior of states within the World Heritage system. The main findings concern the positive impact of membership on the World Heritage Committee on the nomination activity and the success of an application. Our article intends to broaden this intra-organizational perspective by including political and economic factors within member countries and investigating the cultural and natural potential to obtain Sites. Although the relevant literature agrees that the UNESCO List constitutes a great advance, the List also has negative aspects, in particular, the highly unequal distribution of Sites across countries and continents. Other factors than the 10 “objective” and “official” criteria by UNESCO presumably play a role. Section 2 discusses the unequal distribution over countries and continents of the Sites included on the World Heritage List. In Sect. 3, we show that the number of years a country has been a member of the Convention, the size of a country, the number of years that it has been part of a civilized culture, as well as historical GDP and population size are positively and significantly correlated with the number of Sites a country has on the List today. In Sect. 4, we estimate several models to identify political and economic determinants of getting on the List. The econometric estimates suggest that the relative size of the tourist and the media sectors, federalism, and being a member of the UN Security Council are the most robust determinants of the number of Sites a country has on the UNESCO List.

This proposition derived by Chamley (1986) is considered to be theoretically robust, and Judd (1985) also shows the zero optimal tax rate on capital income in the classical framework where there coexist capitalists and workers. As Mankiw et al. (2009) survey the optimal taxation problem, research on the optimal taxation problem has come to occupy an important position in macroeconomics and public economics.
Footnote 1
 How much is the optimal tax rate in a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model? Under the assumptions of perfect competition market, free mobility of production factors (capital and labor) across two sectors, and efficient production on the production possibility frontier, the reader may as well predict that the optimal tax rate on capital income become zero on the analogy of the result from one-sector model by Chamley (1986). The prediction is correct. We confirm that the optimal capital tax rate is zero even in the two-sector model. Why does the tax rate on capital income become zero? The reason is as follows: An initial capital stock is fixed, and the tax imposed on the fixed initial capital does not generate distortionary taxation because the tax imposed on the initial capital plays a role on the lump-sum tax. The initial capital given historically cannot escape from taxation. On the other hand, the capital at every time except for the initial capital stock can escape from taxation by reducing the savings of the households, and the tax imposed on capital income in the long-run results in generating distortionary taxation. Because households can reduce their own savings and the payment of tax on capital income in the future, the tax policy of the government results in involving distortion. Since distortionary taxation leads to inefficient, the taxation on capital income ought to be avoided in the long run, and to be imposed only on the initial capital. Consequently, the lifetime government expenditure is financed by the labor income tax as well as the initial capital income tax. Then, we are interested in the optimal labor income tax in the long run. How much is the optimal labor
Footnote 2 income tax rate? Who has answered the important question accurately? Labor cannot be mobile in an one-sector model by Chamley (1986) because of the existence of only one industry and the assumption of perfect employment. Households can only choose labor supply and leisure. On the other hand, labor can be mobile across industries in the case of a two-sector model. It is the labor intensity across sectors that determines the initial wage rate, and therefore the optimal labor income tax rate in the two-sector model. That is to say, the optimal labor income tax rate in the long run depends on the labor intensity. This is why it is significant to consider the two-sector optimal taxation problem. In our paper, its motivation and its value added to the literature are to verify the optimal labor income tax rate which has been considered less serious until now. The main strength of this paper is the novelty of its approach to the two-sector optimal taxation problem. By using the Cobb-Douglas GDP function, we can derive the optimal labor income tax rate accurately. This paper considers the optimal taxation problem in the two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model developed by Uzawa (1964)
Footnote 3. We derive the positive optimal tax rate on labor income at a steady state by using the Cobb-Douglas GDP function, and we analyze the comparative statics properties of the optimal tax rate on labor income. Ljungqvist and Sargent (2004), Mankiw et al. (2009), and Kocherlakota (2010) provide recent survey of the dynamic optimal taxation problem.
Footnote 4
 In recent ambitious papers, Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) considers the optimal taxation problem in a two-sector model with sector-specific tax rates. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) shows that the optimal capital income tax rate in the investment sector is zero but the optimal capital income tax rate in the consumption sector is in general different from zero in a steady state. Selim (2009) presents the optimal taxation problem in a two-sector neoclassical growth model with infinitely lived identical agents. Selim (2010) studies the optimal taxation problem in a two-sector neoclassical growth model with infinitely lived heterogeneous agents. Selim (2011) extends the Judd (1985) model to a two-sector model by Uzawa (1961) where the classical framework where there coexist capitalists and workers. There are four types of tax rates in the Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) models. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) distinguishes labor income in the sector producing consumption goods and labor income in the sector producing investment goods, and the government imposes on the sector-specific tax on labor income. In other words, there are the tax rates on labor income in the sector producing consumption goods and the tax rate on labor income in the sector producing investment goods in the Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) model. At the same time, Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) distinguishes capital income in the sector producing consumption goods and capital income in the sector producing investment goods, and the government imposes on the sector-specific tax on capital income. In other words, there are the tax rate on capital income in the sector producing consumption goods and the tax rate on labor income in the sector producing investment goods in the Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) models. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) shows that the optimal capital income tax rate in the investment sector is zero but the optimal capital income tax rate in the consumption sector is in general different from zero in a steady state. Note that Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) does not consider the immobility of production factors across industries. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) does not consider any adjustment cost of capital or labor. In his model, the after-tax returns to factors become equal in a competitive equilibrium. In his model, the initial allocation of capital can create an allocation of factors that may not be consistent with the production efficiency condition. Since the initial allocation of capital may violate the production efficiency condition, the government can correct it by introducing a tax on capital income in the long run. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) uses the sector-specific tax rates for normative analysis. On the other hand, in our model, according to the definition of the GDP function, firms can always accomplish the production efficiency condition. In other words, production is carried out on the production possibility frontier in our model. Moreover, the labor income tax is common to two sectors, and the capital income tax is common to two sectors. Furthermore, the wage rate is common to two sectors, and the rental rate of capital is common to two sectors. Therefore, the before-tax as well as after-tax rental rates are equalized across sectors in our two-sector model. The before-tax as well as after-tax wage rates are also equalized across sectors. Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) focuses only on the optimal capital income tax rate. He adopts the traditional approach while our paper uses the GDP function approach. If Selim (2009, 2010, 2011) did not consider the sector-specific tax rate, his model would generate the zero optimal tax rate on capital income. But he does not derive the optimal labor income tax rate. Therefore, our paper is complement to Selim (2009, 2010, 2011). The focus of our paper is on the difference in the optimal tax rate on labor income, depending on whether the investment goods sector is labor-intensive or capital-intensive. According to the Stolper–Samuelson theorem, we can understand the economics behind the relationship between optimal labor tax rate and the factor intensity. Let us summarize the main results in our paper. First, we verify that the optimal tax rate on capital income at the steady state becomes zero in the optimal taxation problem in two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. Second, we show that the optimal tax rate on labor income at the steady state becomes positive, and that it depends on the initial labor, the parameter weighted on leisure in the utility function, the discount rate, and the degree of distortion of taxation. Third, we show that an increase in the initial relative price of a consumption good in terms of investment goods decreases the optimal tax rate on labor income in the case that the sector producing consumption goods is capital-intensive, while it increases the optimal tax rate on labor income in the case that the sector producing investment goods is capital-intensive. We describe the policy implications from the result we obtain. A standard two-sector neoclassical growth model by Uzawa (1964) shows that the saddle path becomes horizontal, and therefore, the relative price of consumption goods in terms of investment goods seems to be constant over time in the case of the sector producing consumption goods is capital-intensive, while the saddle path becomes upward sloping, and therefore, the relative price of consumption goods in terms of investment goods tends to rise over time in the case of the sector producing investment goods is capital-intensive. Now, let us reinterpret consumption goods as services, and investment goods as manufacturing goods in the Uzawa (1964) model. In this case, the standard two-sector neoclassical growth model shows that the relative price of service to manufacturing goods price seems to be constant over time in the case of the services sector is capital-intensive while the relative service price tends to rise over time in the case of the manufacturing sector is capital-intensive. Thus, given that the ratio of service price to manufacturing goods price has been rising consistently, the standard two-sector neoclassical growth model by Uzawa (1964) concludes that the manufacturing sector must be always capital-intensive; in other words, that the service sector must be always labor-intensive. Most of the OECD countries have experienced the uprising of service price over time as the economy develops. Given the sharp rise of the relative service price over time which we have observed recently, the case that service sector is labor-intensive in our model is valid for modern economy. Then, the result from our paper (proposition 3) concludes that an increase in an initial service price increases the tax rate on labor income. We explain the mechanism. Suppose that the service industry is labor-intensive (that is, manufacturing sector is capital-intensive). Then, since an increase in the initial relative price of service decreases the supply for services at time 0, the demand for capital is less than the demand for labor in the service sector. Therefore, an increase in the initial relative service price increases the initial wage rate according to the Stolper–Samuelson theorem. The increase in the initial wage rate can increase the lump-sum tax on labor income at time 0, and it decreases the degree of distortion of tax. The decrease in the degree of distortion of tax can increase the optimal tax rate on labor income because if the degree of distortion of tax is lower, the government should not impose on the initial tax on capital income so much. The organization of this paper is as follows: Sect. 2 develops our model. Section 2.1 describes the supply side in our economy by introducing the Cobb-Douglas GDP function. Section 2.2 expresses the behavior of households. Section 2.3 exhibits the problem the government faces. Section 2.4 derives the implementability condition. Section 2.5 presents a primal approach to the Ramsey problem. Section 2.6 solves the Ramsey problem. Section 2.7 shows the zero optimal tax rate on capital income. Section 2.8 derives the optimal tax rate on labor income. Section 2.10 describes the relationship of the optimal tax rate on labor income, the degree of the distortion of taxation, the initial wage rate, and the initial relative price of a consumption good.

With regards to banks, the legal framework is particularly important. For example, in case of borrower’s default, the bank often has the right to seize collateral. However, in practice, the enforcement of this right depends on the judiciary efficiency. According to Laeven and Majnoni (2005), an efficient judiciary provides sufficient protection of creditors’ rights and guarantees larger amount of recovery within a shorter time in the event of loan default. Figure 1 shows two financial depth indicators (Private Credit/GDP and Liquid liability/GDP) in the period 2000–2004 versus the judicial efficiency (JE) for 76 countries divided in quartiles according to their “level” of judicial efficiency.Footnote 1 It is clear that the two indicators of financial development increase with the judicial efficiency. This positive relationship is not surprising in light of the empirical studies showing that the legal framework is crucial for the development of the credit markets. Djankov et al. (2007) argue that the weak legal system is an impediment to the functioning of credit markets in many developing countries. Bond et al. (2008) and La Porta et al. (1998, 2008) show that that enforcement of “law” and proper “regulation” are prerequisites for the improvement of credit markets. Detragiache et al. (2005) show that better contract enforcement and information about borrowers are associated with more private credit in low-income countries. According to Besley (1994), the poorly developed property rights in rural areas of many developing countries constitute one of the major factors behind the absence of the private banks’ services. Besley (1994, p. 2) argues that “it seems fair to say that rural credit markets in developing countries have rarely operated on a commercial basis. Substantial subsidies are often implicit in the regulation schemes.” Financial depth and judicial efficiency for 76 countries per quartile over 2000–2004.

Source The authors’ calculus based on Laeven and Majnoni (2005) and World Bank (2010) The emergence of the banking system is rarely analyzed in the theoretical literature. To our knowledge, the only exception is Tressel (2003), who models the emergence of banks after a first stage of development where the economy is endowed with an informal credit market. However, his analysis ignores the role of the limited enforcement of credit contracts. In our model, we analyze whether the emergence of a banking system at an early stage of economic development might be influenced by the credit market imperfection. The latter is defined by two components: the cost of credit contract enforcementFootnote 2 (judicial inefficiency) and the cost of state verification. The first component is defined as in Matsuyama (2000, 2004) in relation to an enforcement problem: The borrowers are willing to honor their payment obligations vis-à-vis the bank only if they are inferior to the cost of default. The same default mechanism is considered in Kehoe and Levine (1993) where the households’ default depends on the severity of the punishment: Agents repay their debts if it is less costly than the punishment for default. The second component is defined as in Townsend (1979): Banks are not able to verify if the modern projects have succeeded or failed without supporting a cost. Besides, contrary to Tressel (2003), in our model, the economy develops due to self-financed projects before the emergence of the banking system. We show that the banking system emerges once the economy reaches a particular stage of development. The higher the cost of credit contract enforcement (judicial inefficiency), the later this emergence occurs. The second contribution of this paper is the analysis of the effect of banking on growth when the enforcement of credit contracts is costly. It is related to the theoretical studies analyzing the relationship between financial development and economic growth which began with Gurley and Shaw (1955), Goldsmith (1969) and McKinnon (1973). After the emergence of the endogenous growth theory, more convincing models were constructed (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990; Bencivenga and Smith 1993; Boyd and Smith 1996; Blackburn and Hung 1998). Their common approach consists in the integration of a microeconomic model of financial contract theory in a dynamics general equilibrium model. These studies demonstrate the importance of financial development for economic growth. However, these models do not explain the weak impact of the banking system on growth in many countries (Demetriades and Hussein 1996). Krasa et al. (2008) argue that a weak enforcement system dampens the ability of firms to obtain outside finance, forcing them to primarily self-finance. In consequence, the start up of new projects becomes more difficult and production and welfare lower. Rocha et al. (2011) analyze the status of bank lending to SMEs in MENAFootnote 3 countries. They show that banks lend more to SMEs in the countries where it is easier to recover collateral and reduce losses given default. Laeven and Majnoni (2005) find that improvements in judicial enforcement of debt contracts lower the cost of financial intermediation for households and firms. Bond et al. (2008) show that the Colombian entrepreneurs are subject to severe enforcement problems that deter the expansion of their investments. Besides, their study reveals that enhancing the functioning of credit markets would be beneficial mainly to the modest-wealthy households with promising business opportunities. Our model explains the countries’ discrepancies relatively to the banking effect on economic growth by their different levels of credit contracts enforcement. Indeed, it shows that the economy develops more quickly after the banking emergence. However, it remains under its growth potential due to a credit rationing brake. This credit rationing may disappear in a third region of development where there is no credit contract enforcement problem but may persist due to the banks’ behavior. We show that the lower the enforcement cost is the faster the economy reaches the third stage of development. To simplify the analysis, this work considers identical agents who can be entrepreneurs of primitive projects, borrowers (entrepreneurs of modern projects) or depositors. The borrowers default if their projects fail or if they have an incentive to do it even if their projects succeed. The first stage of development is characterized by the undertaking of “primitive” projects. The latter are self-financed and less productive than the modern projects that need an indivisible investment. For the modern projects to be undertaken, entrepreneurs need to borrow from banks (when they exist), since the investment amount is superior to the agents’ wealth. The emergence of a banking system is related to its ability to attract depositors with the alternative to invest their wealth in primitive projects. This is the case if the lending interest rate equals the return of the “primitive” projects. Banks are assigned two roles in our model: diversifying the idiosyncratic risks of the modern projects they finance and enforcing the debt contracts. Throughout the second stage of development, banks take in account when they choose their interest rate strategy the potential of entrepreneurs’ default. In this stage, all agents request bank loans but only a proportion effectively receive them. The remainder ones are credit rationed and become depositors. In the third stage of the development, the entrepreneurs’ self-financing becomes sufficiently high so that the cost of default exceeds the loan repayment. Throughout this stage, competitiveness between agents to get a loan tend to raise the interest rate to a threshold that makes them indifferent between undertaking a project or depositing their wealth in the bank. However, the banks’ lending strategy may prevent the interest rate from reaching its higher threshold resulting in the persistence of the credit rationing brake. Whatever the stage of development, it is shown that the credit rationing deprives the economy of additional capital that would finance more modern projects: the economy grows below its potential. Two main economic insights come out of this analysis. Firstly, the economy may be trapped in the first stage unless the “primitive” projects are sufficiently productive. Secondly, the higher enforcement cost is, the later the emergence of a banking system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 develops the theoretical model. Section 3 exposes some concluding remarks.",3

Within the broad array of feasible contracts in a foreign country, we focus on the trade-off between international outsourcing and foreign direct investment (FDI),Footnote 1 in a context of contractual incompleteness (CI). When expanding abroad, firms take crucial decisions about the most appropriate mode of entry into a foreign country. This implies a critical consideration of ownership and location strategies to define which activities are better performed within firms’ boundaries and which are better externalized; which activities call for a domestic location and which for a foreign one. For the sake of simplicity, consider a multinational enterprise that is willing to produce a final good abroad; assume that final good production requires two activities—input manufacturing and final good processing—and that the MNE is responsible for processing. How does it secure the needed components? It is clear that either the multinational can manufacture inputs within its boundaries or it can purchase them from an independent supplier: this is what we call ownership decision. Moreover, the MNE can decide to make-or-buy inputs either in the home or in the host country: this is the location choice as referred to in the present paper. The boundaries of the multinational thus result from the intersection between ownership and location concerns, as depicted in Fig. 1. Depending on whether the input supplier is a domestic or a foreign enterprise, and whether it belongs to the MNE or not, four contractual arrangements may emerge: domestic integration, FDI, domestic outsourcing and international outsourcing (Antras and Helpman 2004).Footnote 2 For the purpose of the present research, we are particularly interested in the foreign dimension of the make-or-buy trade-off. Therefore, when discussing about MNEs’ boundaries, we focus on the relative profitability of foreign direct investment versus international outsourcing. The boundaries of the multinational enterprise OWNERSHIP This is quite a novel and urgent issue in international economics, both from an academic and a policy perspective. Yet, more than 40 % of US imports of goods have taken place within the boundaries of multinational enterprises since the 1990s (Zeile 1997), and every third transaction in the world now occurs intra-firm (Antras 2003; Helpman 2006; Bernard et al. 2010). What accounts for these changes in the nature of trade and investment patterns? In theoretical terms, one candidate explanation behind the international outsourcing/FDI trade-off stems from the wish to mitigate hold-up concerns in a context of contractual incompleteness. According to Grossman and Helpman (2003), Antras (2003), Antras and Helpman (2004) and Ottaviano and Turrini (2007), an increase in CI affects the relative prevalence of the two organizational forms, shifting MNEs towards foreign direct investment. On the contrary, the most recent contribution due to Antras and Helpman (2008) reverts this finding by showing that greater contractual incompleteness may favour either international outsourcing or FDI depending on whether relation specificity characterizes the input controlled by the final good producer or the input supplier. Since the theory does not provide any conclusive result about the sign of CI in shaping the boundaries of the MNE, there is ample room for empirical investigation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few attempts at testing the impact of contractual incompleteness on firms’ organizational decisions, and results are not clear-cut. This probably depends on the lack of suitable data and the difficulties in finding good proxies for CI. For instance, Antras (2003), Yeaple (2006), Tomiura (2007), Nunn and Trefler (2008) and Corcos et al. (2008) provide some evidence on the topicFootnote 3; nonetheless, their approach is quite indirect, since no measure of CI is included in the econometric analysis. Moreover, their findings are not conclusive, and support to the models is rather weak. In the light of the above discussion, this paper is intended to add some empirical evidence on the topic, to see (a) whether contractual incompleteness plays any role in orienting Italian firms’ decision of FDI versus international outsourcing and (b) whether its impact on FDI is positive (as suggested by Antras 2003; Antras and Helpman 2004, 2008; Grossman and Helpman 2003; Ottaviano and Turrini 2007) or negative (as compatible with Antras and Helpman 2008). In doing so, we aim at contributing to the existing empirical literature in terms of both the specification and the type of data. As for the former, we build alternative measures of CI and include them as core regressors in the international outsourcing equation, to properly deal with their sign. As for the latter, we provide fresh evidence of Italian operations worldwide, differently from a literature very much focused on the United States. Our estimates reveal that Italian enterprises belonging to highly relation-specific environments are more prone to international outsourcing than FDI, meaning that CI has a negative effect on foreign direct investment, despite the prohibitively high transaction costs associated with cross-border operations. Although some data limitations, discussed later in the paper, make this study quite specific and prevent us from generalizing results too much, our evidence is robust to different econometric specifications and alternative measures of CI and international outsourcing. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature on the international outsourcing/FDI trade-off under contractual incompleteness, to discuss the theoretical and empirical foundations of hold-up and CI. Section 3 is entirely devoted to the empirical analysis, with a detailed description of the data, the econometric specification and our main findings. Section 4 then concludes and sets future lines of research.",
60,2,International Review of Economics,27 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0169-6,Markets wanted: expectation overshooting in transition economies,June 2013,Frank Neher,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the present paper, individual beliefs about the effect of market competition in transition economies (TEs) and experienced market economies (EMEs) are analyzed and compared. It is argued that overly optimistic beliefs about the performance of markets prevailed in TEs as compared to EMEs at the onset of transition and allowed for the implementation of far-reaching reform policies. However, market results did not fully meet these optimistic expectations, resulting in belief adaption and convergence of beliefs in TEs toward those held in EMEs.Footnote 1
 There is a growing body of economic literature which seeks to understand the interaction between reform policies, policy outcomes and the reform path. Using a political economy approach, a number of theoretical contributions establish that adverse reform outcomes might lead to policy reversals or abolition of ongoing reforms.Footnote 2 In fact, public support for market reforms was widespread in most post-communist countries when strong reform policies were introduced. While policy measures and resulting outcomes varied greatly (Svejnar 2002; Milanovic 1999), all transition countries experienced a reduction in output, rising inequality, inflation and unemployment (World Bank 2002; EBRD 1999). Economists and most politicians have been aware that adaptation processes are likely to lead to a temporary economic downturn, resulting in a J-shaped evolution of output and employment over the course of transition. Still, a lot of relevant actors were taken by surprise when public support rapidly diminished, reforms stalled, and in some countries parties opposing market reforms were soon voted into power (Wyplosz 1993; Fidrmuc 2000). Empirical contributions analyzing survey and election data complement theoretical approaches to understand the determinants of public support for market reforms. Using data from the Russian elections in 1995, Warner (2001) exploits regional variation in reform effort and finds that more intense reforms result in higher public support. For Bulgaria, Valev (2004) presents the rather surprising finding that personal unemployment results in stronger support for reform. He uses survey data and argues that the majority of the population is aware of the necessary short-term cost of reforms, expecting future benefits. Doyle and Fidrmuc (2003) use opinion surveys from the Czech Republic from 1991 to 1998 to document political preference change in the constituency over time. While reforms had broad support at the onset of transition and political preferences mostly varied over age and education, economic outcomes got more decisive in later years. Private economy jobs and high incomes increased, the experience of widespread unemployment in the social environment decreased reform support. Another survey-based analysis for Russia is presented by Eble and Koeva (2002). They find that education has a positive effect and age has a negative effect on the support for reform. In addition, ideology, private sector participation and regional characteristics play a role in shaping reform preferences. Focusing on political constraints in the reform process, Doyle and Walsh (2007) find that voting in 1990, in the Czech Republic, was forward-looking and voters’ expectations largely correct. Next to theses single country studies, some authors have studied groups of transition countries. Fidrmuc (2000) analyses election outcomes for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, exploiting regional variation in population composition. He finds that private entrepreneurs, white-collar workers and university-educated voters are pro-reform, while the unemployed, retirees, blue-collar workers and agricultural workers oppose reform. Hayo (2004) uses two data sets to separately perform a macro- and microeconomic analysis. On the macrolevel unemployment, inflation, privatization and enterprise restructuring are found to reduce public support for market reforms, while democratization, foreign aid per capita and the creation of working financial markets increase support. On the microlevel, labor market status, education, age, gender, the economic status of a person and ideology affect support for the creation of a market economy. Specifically, higher education and younger age are found to increase reform support; individual unemployment decreases the acceptance of reforms. Kim and Pirttila (2006) use the Central and Eastern Eurobarometer Survey, also used by Hayo (2004), to examine the linkages between political constraints and economic reform. They show that support for reforms depend on past macroeconomic conditions and the perception of individual consequences of future reforms. The present study uses a difference-in-difference estimation approach, to add to the understanding of public support for reform. However, instead of directly analyzing survey questions on reform or election results, competition beliefs are analyzed. It is argued that beliefs about the desirability or non-desirability of competition are fundamental to individual attitudes toward a market economy and accordingly shape attitudes toward systemic reform. We find that at the onset of transition, beliefs in competition are far more optimistic in TCs than in EMEs, contributing to the acceptance of wide-ranging economic reforms. Competition beliefs in TCs ex post seem overly optimistic and are later revised. This phenomenon will be called overshooting of competition beliefs.Footnote 3
 This paper also connects to the literature on the socialist legacy, that is, how do institutional differences under a socialist system affect individuals’ preferences and beliefs (Murthi and Tiongson 2008 and references therein, Corneo and Grüner 2002; Alesina and Fuchs-Schündeln 2007). The investigation of capitalism aversion by Landier et al. (2008) is also closely related.Footnote 4
 In the next section, potential determinants for competition beliefs are evaluated. In Sect. 3, the data and sample used in the empirical analysis will be introduced. Section 4 describes the overshooting and convergence of competition beliefs and shortly considers potential explanations for the phenomenon. Section 5 will then lay out a thorough econometric analysis of competition beliefs. Alternative measures of pro-market attitudes will also be considered. In Sect. 6, the importance of competition beliefs will be substantiated with some empirical evidence on the linkage between competition beliefs, support for economic reforms and measures of reform progress. Section 7 finally concludes.",

In particular, Durlauf et al. (2005) provides a comprehensive survey of the main results, showing strong interrelationships between social capital and economic variables: from growth (Knack and Keefer 1997; Corrado et al. 2009) to generalised trust (Migheli 2012a, b). In the present work, I would like to stress the relevance of a component of social capital—that is, relational capital—on the probability for a firm to run profits and on the accessibility to credit lines. The relational capital (Zamagni and Sacco 2006) is a sub-sample of social capital (see Putnam 1993; Hitt et al. 2002 and Durlauf et al. 2005, for a detailed discussion of the concept): It refers to the set of relationships that link a subject (person, firm, etc.) to other subjects. Following the discussion of Zamagni and Sacco (2006), Migheli (2011) interprets this form of capital as a network, where the nodes are the subjects and the relational capital of each of them is represented by the number of links with other nodes.Footnote 1 So far the extant literature has focused especially on the link between relational capital and technological change. For example, the interpersonal relationships between employees within the same firm and/or in different firms favour spillovers of knowledge and technology (Capello 2002; Capello and Faggian 2005; Collins and Hitt 2006). In this sense, the relational capital is fundamental for the creation and for the diffusion of human capital (Coleman 1988); the technology-based firms benefit from this process more than the non-technology-based enterprises (Liao and Welsch 2003). Furthermore, Collins and Hitt (2006) show how tacit knowledge is transferred between allied firms, using relational capital. Villalonga (2004) and Wu (2008) point out that the “intangible capital” (of which the relational is part) sustains the firms’ competitive advantages. This idea of intangible capital is, however, not new in economics. Since the 1980s, it is a well-known concept. In particular, Nussbaum (1986), Donati (1986), Gui (1987) and Uhlaner (1989) are among the pioneers to use and conceptualise it. Their studies propose a vision that goes well beyond the traditional homo oeconomicus and his materialistic conception of the world. The relationships between human beings and between economic agents have not only social value: the diffusion of knowledge, the senses of trustworthiness, of reciprocity and of solidarity, all depend on relationships and work as lubricants of any economy. Between the components of the intangible capital, the relational part is fundamental as catalyst and lubricant also in other fields than technological transfer. Chang and Gotcher (2007) show how suppliers without bargaining power can exploit their relational capital to create value in asymmetric international subcontracting partnerships. Cousins et al. (2006) finds that the informal socialisation processes between firms (whose resulting ties we can call “relational capital”) improve the supplier relationship outcomes, while, when the socialisation is formalised, the effects are less positive and less evident. Similarly, Lee and Tamer Cavusgil (2006) and Wu and Cavusgil (2006) find that informal relational-based governance in business alliances is more effective and more profitable than contractual-based governance.Footnote 2 Carey et al. (2011) analyse a sample of 163 buyer–supplier relationships and find that relational capital is the “glue of buyer–supplier exchange through its facilitation of cooperation and collaboration.”Footnote 3 Petersen et al. (2008) finds analogous evidence using a sample of 111 UK firms. The relational capital is then fundamental in all the cases in which “non-contractible rights” are involved. Therefore, it entails relation-based agreements, such as the commitment of managers to create as much value as possible in the exclusive shareholders’ interest (Baker et al. 2002). However, Granovetter (1973) identifies two types of relational capital: good (bridging) and bad (bonding). The first type is generally considered of good type, as it fosters cooperation and exchange of knowledge and is flexible (i.e. ties can be cut and/or modified at low costs). The second type is detrimental, since it bonds the agents reducing their decisional and functional autonomy so that, in the end, its performance is hindered. While the extant literature has deeply focused on some relevant contributions of the relational capital to the development of firms, several areas remain uncovered. In particular, it would be interesting to understand whether this form of capital has also some pay-off in terms of profitability and access to credit. Indeed in a market situation, characterised by shrinking credit and difficulties on the demand side of the market, relational capital could improve the chances of survival for firms and their competitiveness. Actually, Dufhues et al. (2012) finds that bonding social capital is an obstacle for rural firms to access credit in Thailand, while bridging social capital increases the chances to get credit. In this paper, I will define relational capital following Hans and Nilsson (2005) notion of “external capital.” In other words, I will consider all the relationships of a firm with external agents, from suppliers to customers, from local governmental bodies to the national government and from universities to other research centres. Last but not least, I would like to stress that social capital is a form of capital in the sense stated by Solow (2000) who requires two conditions: reproducibility and the ability of generating productive services continuously for a certain span of time. Does social capital (and above all relational capital) fulfil these requirements? The answer is positive: Social capital is reproducible by maintaining and creating relationships; moreover, as the cited literature shows, it produces valuable services for the holders. In this light, Bruni (2006) claims that relational capital is an asset for the economic agents and for the economy itself. Indeed, transactions rely on reciprocal trust, which is also built on and enforced by the relationships established by agents between them. The inquiry presented in this paper is based on 136 Italian small firms, as the literature highlights that are especially the small firms to benefit the most of relational capital (Macpherson and Holt 2007). The main results of the article are that: (1) relational capital helps the small firm to access credit and the lenders to diversify the risk and (2) some components of the relational capital have a positive link with profits. I would like to stress in particular the first result: In the current adverse situation for the credit market, the presence of resources that facilitate the access credit and allow to diversifying the risk is of extreme importance.",

The idea of efficiency wages in macroeconomics goes back to the work of Akerlof (1982). In his work, equilibrium unemployment arises due to the optimal response of firms to workers behavior, viz. the wage is above the market-clearing wage in order to receive a higher level of effort, and hence, labor demand falls and unemployment arises. The aim of this paper is to analyze the importance of efficiency wages and matching frictions for labor market dynamics and—in particular—for the cyclical patterns of unemployment and vacancies. The paper therefore combines search frictions with efficiency wage frictions, that characterize the wage setting process within firms. In the words of Olivier Blanchard (2008): “The next stage appears to be an integration of the market frictions that characterize the DMP model with those of efficiency wage models, which can explain wage setting within firms […].” A justification for the efficiency wage theory can—for instance—be found in the empirical work of Bewley (1998), showing that firms do not use pay cuts because they are afraid of the negative effects on morale. Along this line, Fabiani et al. (2010) use European data from the Wage Dynamics Network and show that firms prefer to separate from a worker rather than to cut his pay. Furthermore, they confirm that the rationale for firms to avoid wage changes is the fear that workers would reduce effort. Since Shimer (2005) many papers have been written to overcome the so-called Shimer Puzzle. This puzzle describes the inability of the search and matching model to replicate several volatilities in response to a productivity shock. Moreover, we know that the endogenous separations matching model has problems in generating the Beveridge curve—the negative correlation between unemployment and vacancies—and observed volatilities jointly. To address the potential role of efficiency wages to overcome the Shimer puzzle, we build an endogenous separation search and matching model. Within a general equilibrium real business cycle model (RBC, for short), efficiency wage frictions follow the approach in de la Croix et al. (2006). However, the basic idea of an effort function goes back to Akerlof’s (1982) contribution. He formalizes his idea of gift exchange by suggesting the existence of an effort supply function. This function links effort to the current and the reference wage. Here, we follow the assumption of an effort function in a more general specification. In contrast, Danthine and Kurmann (2003) assume that the effort function can be written in log terms. This implies that effort does not vary over the cycle, which is a rather questionable assumption.
Footnote 1 By using the specification suggested by de la Croix et al. (2006), we allow effort to vary over the cycle. The paper has two main contributions. First, we derive the Solow condition in a search environment and discuss the interactions of search and efficiency wage frictions. We show that search frictions create a wedge between the optimal wage/effort solution in the search and the competitive equilibrium. This wedge is also a main driver of our second contribution. Second, we find that the efficiency wage model is able to replicate the empirically observed volatilities of key labor market variables and outperforms the standard Nash bargaining model in terms of replicating second moments. The efficiency wage model adds an additional channel to the firms decision problem. Namely fluctuations in the effort level over the business cycle have an impact on unemployment and vacancies, i.e., on the labor market adjustment process. They create additional profits along the job creation margin, which can be collect by the firm through optimal wages. Our paper is related to the papers by Malcomson and Mavroeidis (2007, 2010) and Zaharieva (2010). In Malcomson and Mavroeidis (2007), the authors incorporate a shirking model of efficiency wage frictions into an otherwise standard matching model and estimate the model on US and UK data. They establish the result that the interaction of these two types of frictions is indeed relevant to match the data. Matching frictions have a larger effect on the long-run unemployment rate in the US than in the UK. However, they show that the contribution of efficiency wages in both countries is substantial (roughly half of the total). Malcomson and Mavroeidis (2010) test three wage determination models, the Nash bargaining model, the credible bargaining model, and the efficiency wage model. They show that only for the efficiency wage model, the (over-identifying) restrictions are statistically acceptable. Moreover, they find that the efficiency wage model fits US data better as the other two models and gives a more plausible value of non-work activity. Overall, both papers show that the data call for a combination of efficiency wage and matching frictions. In those search and matching models with shirking type efficiency wage frictions, the model endogenously creates a high opportunity cost of working because it does not only contain the value of non-working but also the disutility of providing effort to avoid shirking. While those paper focus on the empirical fit of the efficiency wage approach, we focus on the ability of the model to fit second moments and business cycle fluctuations. Along this line, Zaharieva (2010) considers moral hazard in an endogenous separation matching model and stresses that agents want to increase match stability. The unobservable effort decision affects the match separation rate, and hence, heterogeneous productivity creates a match-specific, endogenous separation rate. However, while our paper also combines efficiency wage frictions with matching frictions, we focus on the role played by this interaction for the business cycle and the ability of the model to explain second moments, which is the unique characteristic of this paper. The remainder is structured as follows. The next section derives our model. Section 3 discusses the response of the model economy to an aggregate productivity shock and compares the efficiency wage model with the standard Nash bargaining model. Section 4 provides a robustness analysis of effort function parameters, while Sect. 5 concludes.",

The difference between team reasoning and classic individual rationality is that the former induces the statement: “it would be good for us if we did…” while the latter one says “It would be good for me if I did…”. In other words, when a decision has to be taken, an agent who follows team reasoning logic wonders “what should we do?”, instead of “what should I do?” The aim of this paper is to look at two factors that may facilitate the adoption of team reasoning in social dilemmas. The first is the “common reason to believe” (Sugden 2003), and the second is the reduction of social distance. The concept of common reason to believe was introduced by Sugden to explain how subjects know when to implement team reasoning (Sugden 2003). The main idea is that team reasoning has a conditional nature. Members of groups are not committed to reasoning as a team unless there is a common (reciprocal) reason to believe that other members are doing the same. Social distance refers to perceived nearness and affinity among persons or groups (Ahmed 2007). Experimental contributions in economics essentially manipulate social distance by varying the degree of anonymity under which subjects take their decisions (for example, Isaac and Walker 1991; Frohlich and Oppenheimer 1998; Bohnet and Frey 1999a, b; Rankin 2006). We discuss the relation between social distance and team reasoning by considering the effect of a reduction in social distance on the emergence of empathy (Bohnet and Frey 1999a, b) and compliance with social norms of cooperation and fairness (Roth 1995; Hoffman et al. 1996; Bohnet and Frey 1999a). We carried out experimental analysis based on a Traveler’s Dilemma game (Basu 1994) where: (a) the role of common reason to believe in the emergence of team reasoning is studied by eliciting players’ beliefs in others’ behavior, and (b) the reduction of social distance is implemented by introducing a meeting—either voluntary or compulsory—after the game (see Sect. 3). The Traveler’s Dilemma, introduced by Basu in 1994, is an example of a social dilemma game in which both the full rationality hypothesis and the purely self-interest hypothesis have been disputed (Basu 1994). The game replicates a situation in which two travelers returning from a remote island lose their luggage, which contains the same type of souvenir. The fault is of the airline company’s, and it decides to refund the travelers, but only according to a specific rule: The travelers must declare the value of the souvenir, which may range between 2 and 100 (in the original Basu 1994 paper). If the travelers declare different numbers, they are reimbursed the minimum amount declared. A reward equal to 2 is also paid to the traveler who declares the lower value, while an equal penalty is paid by the traveler who writes the higher value. In the event that the two claims are exactly the same, the two travelers receive the declared value, without either reward or penalty. If they both wish to maximize their monetary payoffs, the (2,2) outcome is the only Nash equilibrium of the game, independently of the size of the penalty or reward. The payoff structure of this game makes it particularly suitable for the study of team reasoning (as extensively discussed in Sect. 4, we say that a player adopts a team reasoning behavior if his/her declaration is equal to the declaration s/he believes will be made by his/her opponent). It is characterized by a large sub-optimality of the Nash equilibrium with respect to the cooperative outcome. As Basu stresses in his 1994 contribution, “it seems very unlikely that any two individuals, no matter how rational they are and how certain they are about each other’s rationality, each other’s knowledge of each other’s rationality, and so on, will play (2,2). It is likely that each will play a large number in the belief that so will the other, and thereby they will both get large payoffs […]. there is something very rational about rejecting (2,2) and expecting your opponent to do the same. This is the essence of the traveler’s dilemma.” (Basu 1994, pp. 392–393). The limited predictive capacity of the Nash equilibrium in the Traveler’s Dilemma has been confirmed by experimental studies (Goeree and Holt 2001; Capra et al. 1999; Rubinstein 2007). This leads us to believe that the Traveler’s Dilemma may be very useful for investigating the emergence of team reasoning and, more specifically, the role of common reason to believe within the theory. In fact, following Basu, it is plausible to hypothesize that the incentive structure that characterizes the game may induce many subjects to believe that their counterpart will use a strategy different from the non-cooperative one (note that our data confirm this tendency). We are also interested in investigating the role of team reasoning in explaining subjects’ behavior in a game which has never been used for this purpose, and which is characterized by a higher degree of complexity compared with other social dilemmas. Our evidence shows that: the adoption of team reasoning is significantly correlated with the belief that the counterpart will adopt the same reasoning; reduction of social distance does not have any significant effect on the adoption of team reasoning. In fact, even though reduction of social distance increases the percentage of subjects who declare a number in the game equal to the number they believe will be chosen by their opponent,Footnote 1 in particular when the meeting is compulsory, the effect is not statistically significant. In Sect. 2, after stressing the common thread that typifies the theory of team reasoning, we (a) discuss the idea of common reason to believe (Sugden 2003) and (b) analyze the possible relationship between social distance reduction and endorsement of team reasoning. In Sect. 3, we illustrate the rationale of our experiment and describe its design. In Sects. 4 and 5, we present and discuss the empirical evidence. Section 6 concludes.",1

60,4,International Review of Economics,19 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-013-0186-0,Effect of regulated user fee on quality of healthcare for the poor and the non-poor,December 2013,Eugenia Amporfu,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"User fee as a method of healthcare financing has received a lot of attention in the literature. It has been documented to reduce moral hazard and provide the funds needed for the provision of care and hence improve quality of care (Akin et al. 1987; Nolan and Turbat 1995; Pearson et al. 2011). Funds from user fee are used to motivate staff and supplement insufficient and late disbursed government revenue (Ir and Bigdeli 2010). On the other hand, user fee has been described as an obstacle to the achievement of universal health coverage. Marriot (2012) recommended the removal of user fee from the healthcare market because it is inequitable and impoverishing. Other studies (e.g., Dao et al. 2008; World Health Organization 2005; McIntyre et al. 2005) have shown that user fee prevents access to healthcare for the poor and have contributed to driving millions of people into severe poverty. Countries such as Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Haiti witnessed significant increase in healthcare utilization after the removal of user fee from primary healthcare (Marriot 2012). Nevertheless, user fee continues to be used extensively in developing countries especially where there is no social health insurance. Even in countries like Ghana where there is social health insurance, user fee is used to for services that are not covered by the social health insurance. The continual use of user fee could be due to the inability of governments to provide adequate funding for health care. For instance, health facilities in Niger were faced with delays in government reimbursement of care after the removal of user fee for children under five (Ridde et al. 2011). As long as countries are crippled by lack of funds needed to meet the health needs of the poor, user fee is likely continue to remain in health systems to supply the needed funds. Studies have therefore examined how to minimize the problems caused by user fee. Ir and Bigdeli (2010) argued that user fee need not impede access to healthcare if fees are set at affordable levels and changes in fee are discussed by the community before implementation. Vian (2008) recommended that in order to ensure efficiency, user fee should be used with government regulation. Thus, even though user fee is the direct payment of care to the health facility, government involvement is important to ensure that patients’ welfare is not compromised. Government involvement in the operation of user fee is needed to ensure that for a given quantity and quality of care, the poor does not pay the same fee as the rich. In Cambodia, e.g., the poor are exempt from user fee and are subsidized for other out of pocket payments incurred (Ir and Bigdeli 2010). However, Ponsar et al. (2011) examined the health sectors of several developing countries and found that government intervention through fee exemption and/or fee reduction for the vulnerable was not effective and helped only a small percentage of the population. The question then is to what extent does the ineffectiveness or inadequacy of government intervention affect the welfare of patients. Studies in general condemn user fee because of the negative effect it has on the poor than on the rich. However, in a theoretical study, in a cost-shifting framework, Amporfu (2010) showed that user fee, under government regulation, does not only deteriorate the quality of care received by the poor but that of the rich as well. Under this method, the government mandates the proper treatment of care regardless of ability to pay and then enforces it through investigation. Patients pay for services directly to the physician, according to their income status with the rich paying more than the poor for high treatment and both the rich and poor paying the same for low treatment. The results showed that the physician randomly used wrong treatment (referred to in the paper as cheating) and government investigated randomly to reduce incentive for cheating. The results also showed that the tendency to cheat was driven by the costliness of investigation. The paper did not, however, examine the factors affecting mandated cost shifting’s ability to improve or deteriorate the quality of care received by patients. The purpose of the current study is to use the model in Amporfu (2010) to find the conditions under which regulated user fee could affect quality of care for both rich and poor patients. Quality of care refers to all aspects of healthcare services that are beneficial to the health of the patient (Chalkley and Malcomson 2000). When a patient receives less care than what is health improving, the literature refers to it as under-provision of care (Evans 1984). Increasing or intensifying treatment in this case is quality improving since it would be beneficial to the patient’s health. However, when treatment intensity does not improve the health of the patient the literature refers to the care as flat of the curve medicine (Fuchs 2004). The unnecessary use of high intensive care, e.g., cesarean section, could have a negative effect on health of the patient because a patient that has delivered through cesarean section in a previous birth becomes high risk in the next delivery as she may require another cesarean section (Baby center, http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/labourandbirth/labourcomplications/vbac/). Even if the unnecessary use of intensive care is flat of the curve medicine and hence has no benefit to the patient, the patient is made worse off because of the high user fee that is attracted by high intensive care. The fee paid then can influence the physician’s choice of treatment for the patient. It is therefore important to find the factors that affect the physician’s choice of treatment and hence the quality of care received by the patient. To do this, the study extends Amporfu (2010) by examining how the available treatment technology, the type of economy, patient characteristics, as well as the conditions surrounding the regulations of user fee affect the quality of care and the effectiveness of the user fee in protecting patients’ welfare. The government in the model regulates user fee by fixing a fee for treating poor patients regardless of the intensity of treatment. The government also mandates the doctor to charge the same fixed fee for treating rich patients with low severity of illness. The doctor is obliged to use the proper treatment regardless of patient’s income type. The regulation is enforced through investigation of doctor’s choice of treatment given the severity of illness. Obviously, the government’s commitment to investigation is important in providing the incentive for the physician to choose the right treatment. This implies that all factors that affect government’s ability to investigate in turn affect patients’ welfare. The effects of such factors as well as patient characteristics provide important policy information. These effects were, however, not examined by Amporfu (2010), and so they are the focus of the current study, hence the need for the current study. The results showed that regulated user fee can deteriorate quality of care for both the rich and poor patients. The regulation is difficult to enforce when investigation is costly, institutions are poor, the poor are not likely to be severely ill, the rich are likely to be severely ill, and the percentage of high-income earners is small. Regulated user fee then is ineffective and deteriorates quality of care under those conditions depending on patients’ income status. While the poor may be made worse off due to deterioration of quality, the rich are made worse due to poor quality of care and high fee. The optimal user fee reduces with improvement in treatment technology. Previous studies have examined the strategic behavior of physicians in their provision of care. Leger (2000) models a physician under capitation payment method by an insurance company and showed how the asymmetric information between the physician and the insurance company on the severity of illness helped the physician to under provide services. Brekke et al. (2005) show the conditions under which price regulation affects the role of gate keeping on hospital quality and specialization. The usefulness of the model in Brekke et al. stems partly from the extensive comparative statics done to show changes in the various parameters affects the ability of gate keeping to induce the desirable hospital quality and specialization. Biglaiser and Albert Ma (2003) model the strategic behavior of the physician in a two-tier (public and private) health system where the physician can moonlight (i.e., work in both sectors). The study showed how various forms of regulation of the fee in the public or private health facilities could affect the quality of care and hence patient’s welfare. While all three models examined regulation of fee, they did not examine how the income status of patients could affect the quality of care chosen by the physician. Since patient’s income status affect their ability to pay for treatment, especially where there is no insurance, physician are likely to take patient income status into account when choosing treatment. According to the theory of bribery in healthcare, high-income patients are more likely to bribe physicians than lower income of patients (Hunt 2007). Bribery models then are likely to categorize patients according to income. However, the theory predicts a reduction in bribery as competition increases. Since Amporfu (2010) assumes perfect competition in the health sector and so the physician cannot engage in bribery, but the model is able to show that the physician still chooses the treatment type strategically. Such a study could inform government that implement regulated user fee, on the right policy tools to use under various circumstances to improve the quality of care. Under mandated cost shifting, the physician charges the rich a higher fee than the poor, for a given treatment provided (Morrisey and Sloan 1989). Thus, the physician shifts the cost of treating the poor on to the rich. It is a form of income redistribution that does not pass through the government. Under regulated user fee, the government typically mandates health facilities to charge a lower fee or no fee to the poor. The government would be expected to pay for the services provided to the poor while the rich paid the market price for their own services. However, as in the case of Niger and many other developing countries, government subsidies often delay and so health facilities would have to use their internally generated funds, which typically come from the fee paid by the rich, to provide care to both the rich and poor. Thus, the mandated cost-shifting framework is similar to that of regulated user fee system. It is often difficult to identify the poor especially in developing economies where there is large informal sector. This often makes the user fee exemption programs for the poor ineffective. However, governments use several methods to target the poor, for example, demographic targeting (children under five in Niger, pregnant women in Ghana), geographic targeting, as well as household expenditure (Domelen 2007). These methods are not without flaws but are used nevertheless. Thus, the poor in the model would refer to those that are certified as poor according to the government’s poverty assessment tool. The model has three agents: the physician, the patient, and the government but the patient is passive. There are two types of patients: rich (R) or poor (P) and two types of illness to be treated: low severity (θ
L) or high severity (θ
H). High treatment is the proper treatment for high severity of illness, while low treatment is the proper treatment of low severity of illness. The physician uses high effort (e
H) for high treatment and low effort (e
L) for low treatment. A patient is better off when treated with the proper treatment given the fee paid. As already explained, the poor refers to those certified by the government as poor. The certification could be according to the area of residence, age, gender, or whatever criterion used by the government. The patient’s utility function is \( U\left( {y - C^{i} ,h\left( {\theta^{i} ,e^{i} } \right)} \right) \) with U
1 > 0, U
11 < 0, U
2 > 0 where i = L or H, y is income, C
i is treatment fee, and h is health status. Both patient and illness types are observable to the physician. The government can observe the patient’s income type and treatment received but can only observe type of illness through investigation. If government’s investigation reveals that the physician used the wrong treatment type, the physician pays a fine, \( \phi \). The government collects taxes from the rich to fund its investigation. Revenue collection is assumed to be costly: For every dollar collected, ω is lost due to corruption and other inefficiencies. The healthcare market has free entry and exit. The fee for e
H is C
H and that for e
L is C
L. Given free entry and exit, the fee in equilibrium is such that \( V\left( {C^{{{\text{H}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) = V\left( {C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{L}} } \right) = 0 \), where V(·) is the physician’s utility and V
1 > 0, V
11 < 0, V
2 < 0, and V(0,0) = 0. However, it is further assumed that, without income redistribution, the poor cannot afford \( C^{{{\text{H}}^{*} }} \). The poor can only afford \( C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} \). To make healthcare accessible to the poor, the government mandates proper treatment for all patients regardless of income and that the poor pay \( C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} \) for both low and high treatment. The rich pay \( C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} \) for low treatment and C
S for high treatment. The government enforces the regulation by investigating the physician. Since \( V\left( {C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{L}} } \right) = 0 \) and e
L < e
H, it follows that \( V\left( {C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) < 0 \). The physician can only make profit if \( V\left( {C^{{{\text{S}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) > V\left( {C^{{{\text{H}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) = 0 \) implying that \( C^{{{\text{S}}^{*} }} > C^{{{\text{H}}^{*} }} > C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} \). After observing the patient, the physician would choose the treatment type to maximize the physician’s expected utility. Simultaneously, the government maximizes patients’ expected utility subject to its budget constraintFootnote 1 by choosing to investigate or not to investigate. Two cases were examined: the costless and the costly investigation case. Under the costless case, both the physician and the government can costlessly observe the patient’s illness type. Under the costly case, only the physician observes at no cost, while the government has to investigate before observing the illness type. The model was solved by backward induction, and the resulting mixed strategy equilibrium is explained below. The government equilibrium strategies were as follows: where the definitions of the symbols used are shown in Table 1. The government investigates with positive but less than one probability when it observes a rich patient with high treatment and a poor patient with low treatment. The probability of investigating the poor with high treatment and that of investigating the rich with low treatment were zero. The physician’ strategies are: The definitions are as shown in Table 1. In equilibrium, the physician does not cheat when treating a poor patient with low severity of illness and a rich patient with high severity of illness, but with positive but less than one probability he/she uses low treatment for a poor patient with high severity of illness and uses high treatment for a rich patient with low severity of illness. Mixed strategy equilibrium results because if the government chooses a pure strategy of always investigating, the physician will never cheat; but if the physician will never cheat, the government will not always investigate. Similarly, if the physician always cheats, the government will always investigate and if the government always investigates, the physician will never cheat. The free entry and exit ensures that \( C^{{{\text{S}}^{*} }} \) is determined in the market such that the physician’s expected utility for e
H is zero: \( r\left( {1 - \pi_{\text{R}} } \right)V\left( {C^{{{\text{S}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) + (1 - r)\left( {1 - \pi_{\text{P}} } \right)V\left( {C^{{{\text{L}}^{*} }} ,e^{\text{H}} } \right) = 0 \), where r is the proportion of the rich in the population, π
R is the probability that the patient is rich, and π
p is the probability that the patient is poor. The current study extends this model by taking derivative of the strategies in (1) and (2) with respect to the parameters, to help draw important policy implications for quality of care.",

60,4,International Review of Economics,24 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-012-0170-0,Remittances and investment nexus in Bangladesh: an ARDL bounds testing approach,December 2013,A. K. M. Nurul Hossain,Syed Hasanuzzaman,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Remittances are an important source of foreign exchange for most of the developing countries. In 1970, for example, the level of remittances for the world was 2.05 billion US Dollars which reached to 443 billion US Dollars in 2008. World Bank’s estimates show that the migrant workers from the Least Developed Countries sent home an estimated 22.9 billion US Dollars in officially recorded international remittances in 2008. The data also indicate that total remittances to the South Asia region amounted from 5.29 billion US Dollars in 1970 to 71.7 billion US Dollars in 2008 representing 16 % world’s total remittances flow. The true size of remittances, including unrecorded flows through formal and informal channels, is believed to be even larger. Although the share of remittances on GDP for the world has been steady for a long time, from an estimated 0.42 % in 1980 to 0.76 % in 2008, this statistics masks the importance that remittances have for many developing countries. For example, for the subset of least developed countries, the share of remittances on GDP rises from 2.02 % of GDP in 1986 to 5.08 % in 2008 suggesting that remittances are potentially a good source of finance for economic development, especially for the poorest countries. In 2008, the top two recipients of remittances: India and China each received nearly 50 billion US Dollars but smaller and poorer countries tend to receive relatively larger remittances in proportion to the size of their economies. For example, although Tajikistan received 2.54 billion US Dollars as remittances, it represents about 49 % of the country’s GDP. Many African nations like Tonga, Lesotho, and Moldova are heavily dependent upon remittances (World Development Report 2008). For the entire South Asia, remittances amount for about 5 % of member countries’ GDP of which Nepal is ranked top as remittances-dependent nations in this region occupying about 16 % of total size of the economy. In 2008, Bangladesh, which is the main focus of this study, was both the second largest recipient and second largest heavily dependent (11 % of GDP) of remittances in these region behind India and Nepal, respectively. Bangladesh is the 8th largest remittance recipient country in the world (US$10.5 billion in 2009), and the country is listed among the world top thirty (30) recipients of remittances measured as a share of GDP. As a percent of GDP, remittances increased from 1.87 % at the end of 1980 to 11.77 % at the end of 2009. As a share of FDI, remittances amounted to 205 % at the end of 2006 from 37.4 % at the end of 2000. Remittances as a share of exports rose to 60 % at the end of 2009, from 34 % at the end of 1980. In the literature, there are at least three views on how remittances are spent and the impact of these monies on economic development. The first, and probably most widespread, view is that remittance is treated by the household just like a dollar of wage or farm income, and the contribution of remittances to development will be the same as that from any other source of income. The second view argues that receipt of remittances can cause behavioral changes at the household level that may lower their development impact relative to receipt of income from other sources. A third and more recent view argues that remittances increase investments in human and physical capital at the margin, relative to other forms of household income (Fig. 1). Remittances, exports, and aid (as a percentage of GDP) in Bangladesh A study on remittances from a development perspective in Bangladesh is paramount since these flows are substantial. Remittance inflows to Bangladesh are increasing at an average annual rate of 13 % in the last 30 years from 1980 to 2009 (World Bank 2010). Bangladesh is registering an average annual growth rate fixed capital formation of more than 8 % during these periods (ibid). There is empirical evidence that remittances lead to positive economic growth, be it through their positive impact on consumption, savings, or investment. Lucas (2005) cites several case studies that show remittances may indeed have served to accelerate investment in Morocco, Pakistan, and India. In Fig. 2, an upward movement in both capital formation and remittances has raised some questions regarding the relationship between these two variables. But whether remittances truly represent flows of investment capital is an open question and requires careful investigation because of the significant implications for development policy (IMF 2005). Remittances and investment flows (in million US dollars) in Bangladesh There is neither any study regarding the effect of remittances on the level of investment issue nor many studies based on cointegration technique have been reported as far as Bangladesh is concerned. Specifically, in Bangladesh, no known study has used the autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL) to examine the stability of this relation. There is the need to fill this gap in the literature. Hence, the objective of this paper is to shed light on the cointegrating properties of remittance and level of investments using the ARDL approach to investigate the linkage between domestic investment and remittances in the context of Bangladesh. The benefit of the use of such an approach lies in its ease of application for policy makers in developing countries like Bangladesh. The balance of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides brief literature review on this issue followed by the brief description of data and the ADRL approach in the methodology part. Section 4 provides empirical results of the model. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and conclusions (Fig. 3).

Although a higher wage is assumed to motivate employees to work hard in traditional economic theory (i.e., pecuniary factors play a primary role), recent works have challenged this theory. Laboratory experiments provide evidence supporting the importance of non-pecuniary factors in the choice of effort. Fairness concerns affect agents’ effort level (Fehr et al. 2007; Falk et al. 2008), and employees attain a stronger sense of self-fulfillment after realizing the value of their efforts, which motivates employees to work harder (Ariely et al. 2008). This paper presents an examination of the degree to which non-pecuniary factors affect work incentives and compares their relative importance with pecuniary factors of human resource management. Although the importance of non-pecuniary factors has been acknowledged, the degree to which they affect work incentives is still uncertain. We monetize the value of non-pecuniary factors by referring to the methodology in happiness research [i.e., from van Praag and Baarsma (2005) for the cost of airport noise; Frey et al. (2009) for the cost of terrorism]. Our analyses examine survey data collected from employees working for Japanese multinational companies in Malaysia and Thailand. The usage of surveys is intended to elicit aspects of work relations that are difficult to assess in the laboratory. The limitations of laboratory experiments have been recognized (Fehr and Gächeter 2000; Charness et al. 2004; Pereira et al. 2006). Specifically, some field experiments have yielded results that differ from those obtained in laboratory experiments (Gneezy and List 2006). Our analyses can complement laboratory experiments and enable us to examine the degree to which non-pecuniary factors affect work motivation in the real labor market. We examine the determinants of work effort in terms of observed pecuniary factor of the wage level and unobserved factors related to subjective work-related evaluation. For our analysis, subjective evaluations of human resource management are utilized to derive non-pecuniary factors. Upon the estimation of the model, we calculate the monetary value of improved human resource management using the concept of compensating surplus. This enables us to examine whether non-pecuniary factors have sizable effects on work motivation in the real labor market. Our analyses underscore the importance of favorable non-pecuniary factors as affecting work incentives. Specifically, self-motivated instruments turn out to be more effective for motivating employees rather than hospitality-related instruments are. Among several human resource management strategies, the opportunity of skill acquisition motives employees most effectively in both countries. Skill acquisition is about three times as important as company management, irrespective of the country. On the other hand, cultural differences are observed regarding the degree to which employees evaluate non-pecuniary factors. Employees in Thailand evaluate non-pecuniary factors more highly than Malaysian employees do. Employees in countries with higher GDP value non-pecuniary factors higher than employees in countries with lower GDP do. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a description of data used for the analyses and introduces the model. Results of the analyses are discussed in Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes the paper with an explanation of the future lines of research.",
61,1,International Review of Economics,26 February 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-014-0194-8,Identitarian passions: the overwhelming power of the human recognition need,April 2014,Nicolò Bellanca,Giancarlo Pichillo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper argues that a very powerful and persistent way of imagining the specificity of human beings, based on the ancient notion of thymòs ,Footnote 1 still persists in the cultural and philosophical landscape of contemporary “Western” societies.Footnote 2 We will also discuss how and why this vision, notwithstanding its undeniable bonds with the cultural traditions of our society, has remained alien to the conceptual horizon of the professional economists of the past and present era. According to us, indeed, the explanation lies in the fact that the subject itself of the classical political economy, and therefore of economics as a scientific discipline, has been defined in such a way to cut-off the above-mentioned vision since its very beginning. Moreover, one can also add that—consciously or not—economics as both a discipline and a language acts as a kind of redressive mechanism (Turner 1957) aims at reducing the potentially destructive characteristics incidental to social dramas caused by thymotic passions.Footnote 3
 In addition, this paper reveals the conditions upon which the establishment of thymòs among the social actors is facilitated. The aim is to suggest a sound conceptual framework through which social sciences are allowed to include this peculiar aspect of the human activity. In order to introduce our topic, we will consider one of the most important and widespread founding myths of the classical European culture: the story of Odysseus and the Sirens narrated by Homer (around 850 BC). The enchanting music performed by the Sirens symbolises the entry of those who are subjected to their influence in the sphere of the ungovernable and fervent passions: the sailors who are caught by their chants while navigating close to the Sirens’ island will not be able to recover the ordinary route as soon as they will retrieve a full domain of rationality and self-control. According to the classical myth, despite being aware of the deadly risks he is going to face, Odysseus opts for being swept away by the flows of unconstrained passion generated by the Sirens voice.Footnote 4 Indeed, he seems to adopt a challenging strategy that, at first, does not consider the pay-offs associated with any of the branches of the game he is performing. Rather, Odysseus arranges a kind of design allowing him to regain his wrecked rationality in the second stage of the challenge. Thus, at the end of the process, he is still able to opt for rational solutions as logical responses to different impulses, whatever these are.Footnote 5
 His design consists of three steps: to let his sailors fasten him to the mast; to put wax in his men’s hears; to order them not to obey him as soon as he asks to be freed in order to join the Sirens. It must be emphasised that Odysseus chooses to get involved into an uncomfortable situation intentionally. It will cost him suffering and distress because, being temporarily unfit to govern himself and his life, he finds himself bound, powerless and thus unable to dive into the sea to reach the island. Furthermore, the more Odysseus twists his body, the more his sailors are forced to tighten the loops of the string that impedes him to give into temptation. In other words, the more he desires, the less he is allowed to achieve the object of his passion. Now: why does Odysseus opt for undergoing such a dramatic experience? We venture five different hypotheses: He is motivated by purely instrumental and pragmatic reasons. For instance, he is willing to be dispensed with rowing for some time. Then, he takes advantage of his crew’s fear of being entrapped by the Sirens in order to convince his sailors to row harder. Obviously, by this speculation, we assume that Odysseus considers the whole staging of his performance—being tied to the mast; putting wax into his men’s hears; suffering for not being allowed to dive into the sea; temporarily devolving his power and authority over his sailors as well as over himself—more convenient than being busy at rowing. He is elaborating a kind of indirect rationality as a tool for managing complex problems he is not fit to solve in a more direct or coherent way. In particular, Odysseus does not trust the strength of his own willpower against the Sirens’ provocation. This is why he decides to lose his freedom for a while: he knows that once he overcomes the crisis, he will be free and totally rational forever (see Elster 1979). He simply wishes to be delighted by the Sirens voices, without any further goal. He thinks that the best and more valuable condition for appreciating the Sirens chants is to be the only person allowed to enjoy that magic experience. Thus, we can read his performance as a kind of trick: the true, functional stratagem is that of putting wax into his sailors’ hears, in order to prevent them from joining his privilege. He aims at preserving his authority over the crew in a moment of crisis. In order to achieve this result, he wishes to give credit to behaviours that would normally not gain any ascendancy over his men (See Frank 1988). For instance, he may be the only one knowing that the ship is going to face one of the most dreadful and difficult phases of the trip: the Strait of Scylla and Charybdis. Therefore, Odysseus is perfectly aware that he is called to an extremely hard challenge: that of governing his crew with confidence and authority in a risky context. Hence, it is just in order to strengthen the faith of his sailors in his power and rationality that he decides to perform his drama. The more powerful is the enemy he chooses to face (in this case, he even deals with the domain of the supernatural), the more his credibility would potentially increase among the crew.Footnote 6
 He confronts himself with a need for recognition. Needless to say, this is the perspective assumed in this paper. Odysseus yearns for being acknowledged as the only person able to circumnavigate the Sirens’ island and survive their voices. This ambition may arise from contingent circumstances—as already pointed out in the previous comma: he needs to be acknowledged as the absolute leader of the crew in a moment of crisis—or from something completely different. We argue that we are dealing with what we call “need for recognition” or thymòtic passion or, moreover, with a tangible example of “social drama”. When such a necessity is satisfied, the entire framework of Odysseus identity changes. By performing his drama,
Footnote 7 and according to the three-stage ritual structure, after the crisis he becomes the epic author of several heroic deeds: he is The One of the Trojan Horse; The One who deceived and defeated the Cyclops; The One who received support from Aeolus, the Lord of the Wings; The One who survived the fury of the Laestrygonians; yet, he is The One who made Circe fall in love with him. Now, he is also The One who faced and endured the Sirens. Following the suggestions outlined in point 5, we understand how Odysseus succeeds in changing, strengthening and even improving his identity, his social profile. In fact, we can read this transformation on a twofold ground: (A) Odysseus experiences what social anthropologists call a “social drama”; therefore, he goes through a rite of passage (See Turner 1957, 1969); (B) Odysseus can be compared to an actor who enters the game in its second stage, playing therefore with more and/or better resources. Such consideration fully justifies the strategic importance of the first part of the game, symbolised by his performance. These suggested interpretations are not in contradiction one another: both foresee a plurality of stages or steps, the last of which presents a transformed Odysseus. The social group he belongs to now differently acknowledges his social identity. However, Odysseus cannot be aware of the final result of the transformation he has been experiencing. Indeed, he ignores how his identity is going to be transformed after the trial and the entire performance.Footnote 8
 On the other hand, the main difference between A and B is, while in A the performance takes place in a second (liminal) stage of the process—the first stage is symbolised by Odysseus’s crisis: his need for recognition—, in B the performance itself is the first stage of the game. In the first case, we are dealing with a three-phases process (Odysseus’s new identity being the third step of the process), while in the second, we are dealing with a simpler, twofold structure. Following ground A, we can also add that while Odysseus’s subjugation to thymotic passions is a liminal condition (signalled by the rite of passage determining the third phase of the social drama), his new status after the performance (the third stage of the rite of passage he undertakes) is that of a reshaped and renewed authority. In other words, homo timoticus is a liminal man. Following ground B—that is, taking into consideration that Odysseus ignores what the final result of his process of identitarian transformation will be—we question whether our protagonist should be classified within either the category of homo oeconomicus or in that of homo reciprocans or, yet, within an original combination of the two types. Furthermore, we are also called—together with Odysseus—to analyse whether Odysseus’s future strategies aim at maximizing his personal pay-offs (either his own only, or also those of his crew), or at driving back any possibility of maximizing any potential variable. What counts for Odysseus, at the end of the first stage of the process, is that he is commonly acknowledged as the hero—The One—who has faced and survived the Sirens. Odysseus is The character who never loses his self-control. If he gives into temptation, it will only happen after he sets a rigid framework of rules and checks upon which he is subjected. The impact of his passion is already calculated and governed; rather, it generates the satisfaction related to his need for recognition from his subordinates. Therefore, Odysseus is a man animated by calm feelings. What happens, however, when somebody really loses his self-control? We shall now direct our attention to this question by distinguishing between two different—yet linked—elements: passion and recognition. Paragraph 2 is dedicated to the peculiar characteristics of what we have called “the overwhelming force of passion”, while Sect. 3 more closely examines the specificity of the “need for recognition”.",1
61,1,International Review of Economics,27 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-013-0187-z,Government spending under non-separability: a theoretical analysis,April 2014,Luigi Marattin,Arsen Palestini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"How can economic theory rationalize the link between non-separable public and private consumption and the magnitude of government spending multipliers? Using the simplest neoclassical general equilibrium model, we provide analytical conditions explicitly connecting the use of non-separable preferences with the effects of an increase in government purchase on economic activity and private consumption. By doing so, we suggest that cross-country differences in the sign and magnitude of consumption multipliers (Perotti 2007) can be accounted for by the presence of different non-separable preferences structure over private and public consumption. The policy discussion on the effectiveness of budget consolidation plans is triggering a large literature about true magnitude of government spending multipliers (Hall 2009; Christiano et al. 2011; Corsetti et al. 2009; Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012; Eggertson and Krugman 2012; Iwata 2013; Blanchard and Leigh 2013). This policy-led research interest builds on a consolidated theoretical effort aimed at reconciling models’ predictions with the observed government spending’s impact on real activity and private consumption. Along with credit-constrained agents and consumption-work complementarity, theoretical literature has started employing utility functions augmented with Edgeworth complementarity as modeling tools to explain the existence of positive private consumption multipliers and empirically plausible output multipliers. Starting from the contribution by Blanchard and Perotti (2002), empirical evidence
Footnote 1 has reported the existence of a positive private consumption multiplier of government spending. This prediction is at odds with the standard neoclassical framework (Baxter and King 1993); in the New Keynesian literature, on the other hand, it requires special assumptions such as a high share of credit-constrained agents (Coenen and Straub 2005; Galì et al. (2007) or overlapping generations models (Ganelli 2007). Recently, a number of contributions started working on the preferences structure in order to rationalize the existence of a positive consumption multiplier. This effort includes papers on consumption-hours complementarity (Linneman 2006; Perotti and Monacelli 2008; Bilbiie 2009) and on consumption-public spending complementarity (Linneman and Schabert 2004; Ganelli and Tervala 2009). Guo and Harrison (2008) show how Edgeworth complementarity in a balanced-budget policy failed to rule out indeterminacy effects. Iwata (2013) inserts Edgeworth complementarity into an estimated DSGE model and accounts for a positive response of private consumption after a government spending shock. More recently, authors such as Hall (2009) and Woodford (2011) began to explore the core of the analytical issue and to derive expressions for the multipliers under different market structures. This paper builds on these two last contributions and delves into the analytical nature of the problem. Basing on the current lack of a global theoretical approach to the link between public expenditure utility and multipliers’ qualitative evaluation, we will provide a more detailed discussion on this topic. Particularly, we intend to provide a general framework in which the characteristics and the properties of the involved utility functions are closely related to the behavior of the multipliers, showing the strong dependence between the involved functional forms and the resulting policy implications. The usual approach consists in choosing a bundle function involving private consumption and public expenditure as utility function’s arguments. In our setup, we will generalize the analysis of multipliers and of Edgeworth complementarity/substitutability to each possible bundle function and utility function. Previous literature (Fiorito and Kollintzas 2004) provides the rationale for considering public spending which either complements or substitutes private consumption. We will determine the explicit formulas for the consumption and output multiplier without applying any log-linearization around stationary points; namely we will deal with representations of multipliers with no restrictions on the plane, except for the subsets where such formulas are not well defined. Furthermore, we use our framework to gain a better understanding of the welfare effects of public spending when the latter has non-trivial general equilibrium effects. Our main results can be summarized as follows.  Edgeworth complementarity and substitutability are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions to generate—respectively—positive and negative consumption multiplier. In fact, their signs strongly depend on the characteristics of the bundle and of the utility functions, including the Arrow–Pratt measure of risk aversion of both utility and disutility functions. The output multiplier is positive if marginal utility of income is positively affected by public spending (this can also occur under Edgeworth substitutability), but this is not a sufficient condition: We need precise conditions on the form of the bundle function. A government spending stimulus can raise at the same time private consumption and output if the Edgeworth complementarity effect between private and public spending is greater than the growth rate of marginal disutility stemming from producing an additional unit of output. The optimal level of public expenditure is decreasing in the intensity of the Edgeworth dependence. As earlier mentioned, our approach might also explain why empirically estimated private consumption multipliers differ considerably across countries. Perotti (2007) finds positive values for US and Great Britain, and negative for Canada and Australia. Using our framework, qualitative and quantitative cross-countries differences can simply be explained by differences in agents’ preferences with respect to the way they gain utility from the interplay between private and public consumption. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the setup of the model, the notation we employ and recalls the basic mechanism in place to determine government spending’s impact in a perfectly competitive economy. In Sect. 3, we derive analytical expressions for the multipliers under the standard case of additive-separability between private consumption C and public spending G. Sections 4 and 5 are concerned with the derivation and discussion of signs and magnitudes of—respectively—consumption and output multiplier in a non-separability general framework. In Sect. 6, we verify the conditions under which both multipliers can be positive, thereby determining an expansionary effect of public spending on consumption and real activity, as often observed in empirical analysis. In Sect. 7, we perform a welfare analysis, deriving the conditions for the optimal level of government spending. In order to verify the general validity and consistency of our conditions, Sect. 8 considers two attempts to model Edgeworth dependence with two different functional forms taken from the recent literature (Ganelli and Tervala 2009; Linneman and Schabert 2004). Section 9 concludes and suggests future research directions.",2
61,1,International Review of Economics,28 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-013-0192-2,"Population, competition, innovation, and economic growth with and without human capital investment",April 2014,Alberto Bucci,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In an influential paper, Romer (1990) proposed a path-breaking endogenous growth model based on three major premises: technological change (1) is the main engine of economic growth, (2) is the result of an intentional economic activity (research and development) carried out by forward-looking rational agents (individuals/firms) in search of higher rewards (incomes/profits), and (3) is a non-rival input that can be accumulated without bounds on a per capita basis. Given its intrinsically non-rival nature, knowledge leads to non-convexities in an otherwise standard neoclassical production function with constant returns to scale to rival inputs (notably capital and labor), and therefore, a decentralized equilibrium with price-taking competition can no longer be sustained. On these grounds, the claim follows that: “…The only way to accept all three premises described in the Introduction is to return to the suggestion of Schumpeter (1942) and explicitly introduce market power” (Romer 1990, p. S78). Indeed, Schumpeter (1942) was among the first to recognize that more market power,Footnote 1 by increasing the rents that can be appropriated by the successful innovator, spurs R&D activity and innovation, so accelerating the pace of technological progress and, thus, economic growth in the long run. This is also one of the main theoretical results of the celebrated Aghion and Howitt’s (1992) quality ladder growth model, according to which more competition in the product market unambiguously harms incentives to innovate and, as a consequence, productivity growth. Even though the Schumpeterian hypothesis (negative relationship between competition and innovation) is now shared, within different settings, by several theoretical works (such as Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1980 and, more recently, Vives 2008, just to mention two notable examples), empirical analyses (see, among others, Geroski 1994; Blundell et al. 1995, 1999 and Nickell 1996) support the belief that competitive pressures encourage innovative activity and, thus, may play a positive role in fostering productivity growth. In order to account for this evidence, the basic theoretical Schumpeterian growth paradigm (Aghion and Howitt 1992) has been recently re-formulated and extended along different directions. A first strand of the literature (Aghion et al. 1997a, 1999) has emphasized the importance of agency issues: intensified product market competition (PMC, henceforth) forces managers to speed up the adoption of new technologies in order to avoid loss of control rights due to bankruptcy. This disciplining effect of PMC can, thus, cause higher economic growth rates in the future. An alternative approach, introduced by Aghion and Howitt (1996), has shown that more competition between new and old production lines (parameterized by increased substitutability between them) can make skilled workers more adaptable in switching to newer ones. Holding the fixed supply of skilled workers constant, the consequence is an increase in the flow of workers into newly discovered products, which enhances the profitability of research (and, hence, economic growth) by reducing the cost of implementing a successful innovation. According to these two research lines, there would be an unambiguous and positive relationship between PMC and economic growth. In sum, there now exists many convincing (theoretical, as well as empirical) arguments showing that the sign of the relationship between PMC and innovation/economic growth may be either always positive or always negative.Footnote 2
 In the literature briefly reviewed above, including Romer (1990, p. S79), the simplifying assumption that is generally made is that population size remains always constant. Instead, it is well known that innovative activity, and thus economic growth, may in theory be influenced not only by the degree of concentration of the product market, but also by the demographic change. Kuznets (1960), Simon (1981), Boserup (1981), Lee (1988), and Kremer (1993) are among the main advocates of the so-called Population-push hypothesis, according to which: “…Population growth…produces an absolutely larger number of geniuses, talented men, and generally gifted contributors to new knowledge whose native ability would be permitted to mature to effective levels when they join the labor force” (Kuznets 1960, p. 328). Theoretical models analyzing the long-run relationship between population (size and growth), innovation, and per capita income growth considers mostly economic environments where either solely technological change or both technological change and human capital accumulation are endogenous. The first class of models (those with endogenous technological change but without human capital accumulation) can, in turn, be divided into different subgroups. The first includes papers such as Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992) that generate a positive relationship between per capita income growth and population size. As a matter of fact, this result (known as strong scale effect) is generally rejected on empirical grounds (see Jones 1995a, b). The second subgroup of works, instead, includes the so-called semi-endogenous growth models. Several versions of such models do exist. In their traditional form (Jones 1995a; Kortum 1997; Segerstrom 1998), these models suggest not only that economic growth depends positively on population growth (as opposed to population size), but also that economic growth would be equal to zero in the absence of any population change.Footnote 3 The first of these two conclusions is not universally shared by empirical evidence.Footnote 4 As for the second one, it is well known that in many industrialized countries (still growing in economic terms), population growth is today very close to zero, especially if one fails taking into account the migration processes that may affect population dynamics in these regions of the world. If the first wave of semi-endogenous growth models were right, there would be no positive and sustained growth in per capita incomes in this significant portion of the globe! For these reasons, a more recent wave of semi-endogenous growth models (including, for example, Young 1998; Dinopoulos and Thompson 1998; Howitt 1999) has explained how we can observe positive economic growth even without population change.Footnote 5
 The second class of theoretical models dealing with the long-run connections between population, innovation, and economic growth (those with endogenous technological change and human capital accumulation), instead, includes papers such as Dalgaard and Kreiner (2001), Strulik (2005) and Bucci (2008), among others. The first paper, using a horizontal innovation-driven growth model with human capital accumulation, develops a theory of scale-invariant economic growth according to which increases in population growth may have solely a non-positive effect on the long-run growth rate of income per capita. Strulik (2005), instead, analyzes an endogenous growth model with skill acquisition and both vertical and horizontal product innovations. He finds that the relationship between population and economic growth rates is ambiguous and crucially depending on the magnitude of agents’ altruism toward future generations. Contrary to Dalgaard and Kreiner (2001), and as in Strulik (2005), in our paper we also stress the potentially important role of altruism in accounting for a positive, negative, or no relation at all between economic and population growth rates in the long run. However, unlike Strulik (2005), we show that for this ambiguous link to occur, the hypothesis that the R&D activity relies on two different dimensions (the horizontal and vertical ones) is not necessary. Bucci (2008) adds a new ingredient to this debate and demonstrates that in a growth model with horizontal innovation and endogenous skill acquisition, the relationship between population growth and the growth rate of real per capita income depends not only on the degree of agents’ altruism but also on the nature of technical change (Bucci 2008, Table 1, p. 1141). The present paper proves that it is still possible to obtain the result of ambiguity in the correlation between population and economic growth rates without necessarily relying upon the type of technological progress.Footnote 6
 The huge body of empirical work conducted in recent times by economists and demographers seems to confirm the ambiguity of the correlation between population growth and economic growth. This comes out clearly from Bloom et al. (2003, p. 17), according to which: “…Though countries with rapidly growing populations tend to have more slowly growing economies…, this negative correlation typically disappears (or even reverses direction) once other factors …are taken into account. …In other words, when controlling for other factors, there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth. This result seems to justify a third view: population neutralism.”Footnote 7
 The present paper has three major purposes. The first is to propose the simplest horizontal innovation-based framework through which one can analyze the interplay between population and PMC in affecting an economy’s growth rate. In this respect, we study how the effects on real per capita income growth of a larger population and a more concentrated product market can change depending on the structure of the underlying economy (in particular, the presence of human versus physical capital investment, the type of factor input employed in the uncompetitive sector, the kind of households’ intertemporal utility, and the way in which agents may eventually invest in human capital). Population growth and market structure are clearly two endogenous variables. However, since it is our interest to examine how, conditional on the characteristics of the economy under scrutiny, they can affect the pace of productivity growth, these two variables are treated parametrically here. The second objective of the article is to examine the conditions under which population size/growth and market structure may interact with each other in economic growth, in the sense that a change in one of them can modulate the impact of the other on economic growth. The traditional Population-push and Schumpeterian hypotheses do not allow studying if, and ultimately when, a change in market power (population growth) may affect the positive relationship between population growth (market power) and economic growth, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at joining together two different literatures that have, respectively, the merit of having recognized in population and market structure two possible (although separate) sources of innovation and economic growth. Finally, and related to the previous one, the third goal of the paper concerns more specifically the literature on the long-run correlation between population, innovation, and productivity growth. With respect to this literature, our contribution aims at investigating the role of PMC/monopoly power in influencing the long-term relationship between demographic and economic forces. In order to meet these objectives, in the following sections, we build upon Romer (1990)Footnote 8 and present two different models. In the first one, we introduce into the analysis positive and exogenous population growth and consider human (rather than physical) capital as an input in the production of intermediate goods.Footnote 9 In this setting, human capital is a reproducible factor, and unlike Romer (1990), we use the so-called dilution hypothesis in the production of new ideas in order to get rid of the strong scale effect. The main result of the model (which is in line with the second generation of semi-endogenous growth theory in that positive economic growth is possible even without population change) is that population growth and market power are two major determinants of innovation and economic growth, although the sign of their impact on the growth rate of real per capita income is different (unambiguously positive for market power and ambiguous for population change). Moreover, we also find that market power and population growth may be two complementary factors in economic growth, in the sense explained above. In the second model, unlike the first one, we just postulate that at an individual level, agents can accumulate human capital through a different (Mincerian, as opposed to Lucas-type) “technology.” In this setting, it is found that the correlation between population growth and economic growth is always positive and that economic growth cannot exist separately from population growth, as in the first wave of semi-endogenous growth models. The article is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we present a brief reminder of our benchmark Romerian model of endogenous technological change without human capital investment and discuss its main predictions concerning the roles of population (size) and PMC in economic growth. In Sects. 3 and 4, we present, respectively, two extensions to the benchmark model, able to highlight different effects of (the growth rate of) population, PMC, and the interaction between the two on productivity growth. The last paragraph (Sect. 5) summarizes and concludes.",2

The most famous debate was held in Chicago at a dinner at Aaron Director’s home, founder of The Journal of Law in Economics, where Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Lloyd Mints, Arnold Harberger and John McGee, challenged Coase’s theories on property rights. After a long speech, Coase won and what the colleagues considered ""an error at least and at worst a heresy"", soon became a brilliant idea, deserving years later the Prize in Memory of Nobel. However, over the years, in many articles Coase had to come back to his theories to explain how his vision was wider and more open than usually thought. The wide scholarly literature which has been developed on the Coasean legacy, focused on the economics of institutions and on the institutional frames surrounding market transactions. This tradition has progressively increased the degree of complexity of the analysis, often trespassing the disciplinary boundaries of social sciences, including law, sociology and political science. Since Coase, economic theories of institutions have evolved from the original dichotomy developed by the pioneers between the market and the state as alternative institutions to carry out market transactions to recent approaches devoted at setting more complex trade-offs among the several domains affecting market transactions (Brousseau and Nicita 2010). Still, the main “methodological” message hidden in several Coase’s inquiries seems to be largely neglected. There is a common approach behind many Coase’s contributions, so that once it is discovered and acknowledged, it appears that Coase gave us a unique fundamental message, a sort of “general theory” of institutions. In this paper, we outline the main features of this “general theory”, defining what in our view is the “Coasean methodology” and applying it to some of his principal publications. This is, in our view, the Coase’s legacy.",1

 A key insight from the conference, in our mind, was that following up many different accounts of public happiness might well serve best when people want input on how to pursue both individually and collectively their ideas of the good life. Simultaneously, it does help to critically reflect and better understand the various accounts of (public) happiness that are applied. There are not only different theoretical conceptualizations and philosophical accounts of public happiness but also alternative empirical approaches to capture how people judge and experience their life.

The majority of researches into income comparisons and life satisfaction have been carried out for developed countries due to the greater availability of data. However, research is also on the rise in developing countries (thanks to growing number of surveys that include questions on subjective well-being and the rising interest of scholars). Do income comparisons have a similar impact on life satisfaction at different levels of development? Do they perform in the same way? This paper investigates the differences between transition countries and developed countries in Europe in terms of the self-reported life satisfaction levels and income comparisons. Since transition countries differ in income per capita, socioeconomic factors and political environment, the findings of income comparisons would be useful for the measurement of relative income literature, providing evidence on different levels of development. The objective of the present paper is to examine the relationship between income comparisons and life satisfaction using a comparative approach. For this purpose, the paper exploits Life in Transition Survey II, applied in 2010 jointly by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank (WB). The first survey was applied in 2006 and included 28 transition countries, whereas the second survey, carried out in 2010, included 29 transition countries and five western European countries. The study includes two different specifications to test the importance of income comparisons on individual well-being: local comparisons (evaluation of living conditions with parents’ situation at the same age, concern for whether household lives were better than 4 years ago) and the impact of self-ranking (for the past, present and future) on an economic ladder. The econometric results reveal that for the analysis of relative income concerns, downward evaluations of individuals have a negative effect on life satisfaction, whereas upward evaluations have a positive impact in transition countries, and this relationship is asymmetric. Under-performing one’s benchmark tends to have a greater impact than out-performing it; however, this relationship is ambiguous in developed European countries, where upward evaluations have no positive impact on life satisfaction, while downward evaluations have a negative impact. The paper begins with an interpretation of income comparisons, after which, the methodology of the study, data and empirical strategy are introduced. The correlation between income comparisons, interaction effects and life satisfaction is then examined, and to check for robustness, regressions for men and women are run in the sample. In the final section, the main results are discussed and conclusions are drawn.",7

This is in part due to an ambiguity around the distinction between the social (including the economic) and the political and also to the inability of mainstream economics to distinguish clearly between the economic and the private sphere. But there may also be a deeper reason for the obscurity. Hannah Arendt, taking a phrase from the great French poet and Resistance fighter René Char, calls public happiness the “lost treasure” of revolutions, appearing and then disappearing as though it had never been (Arendt 1968c: 4–5; 1973: chap. 6). This paper seeks to clarify the meaning of public happiness and its relation to individual well-being through the question: What role does the political play in constituting individuality? A proper answer to the question requires saying something at least about what we mean by “the political” and by “constituting individuality.” But even without this, it is fair to say that for a wide range of views that can be called either individualist or liberal and conservative, the answer is: none at all. This answer comes not only from a rejection of the significance of the political, but also from a view of the individual in which there is nothing to constitute: Human beings simply are, and in some sense, by nature, individuals. For these views, then, nothing more need really be said about the terms. I am going to argue that both elements of the negative answer are mistaken. That is, not only is the rejection of the political a mistake; the individualist account of the individual is entirely inadequate. But rather than simply contradicting the individualist approach, I will try to show that it contradicts itself on the side of the political, on the side of individuality, and in the relation between them. A proper concern for the individual requires far more attention not only to what individuals are, but also to the significance of the political. By “individualism” I mean those views that begin from the idea of the individual as in some sense an isolated or self-contained being;Footnote 1 the most developed of which is, of course, methodological individualism. The critique of individualism begins with the account of the individual as such (Davis 2003; Urquhart 2012a). But expanding it to include the account of the political is important both for understanding its origins and for seeing the full implications of the danger posed by individualism to individuals. Individualists claim to be—by virtue of their very name—the guardians of the individual, theoretically and practically, in a world in which individuals are continually and increasingly endangered by the forces of government and collectivism. The inadequacy of their view, however, makes them not merely very poor guardians, but actual enemies of the individual, however, sincere they may be in their commitment. Individualism emerged within the great philosophical and scientific revolutions of the seventeenth century as one expression of the atomism that has remained so central to modern science and, at least, to Anglo-American philosophy (Taylor 1995: 129). Atomism in “pure” science and philosophy, and individualism in political philosophy were closely connected. Both were influenced by Protestant thought, as well as by the actual emergence of civil society—a public sphere in which individuals interact on the basis of their private interests—which also provided a model for the isolated individual as a natural being with an unchanging nature (Marx 1973: 83–5; Habermas 1989). Individualist political theory, notably in Hobbes and Locke, is necessarily apolitical in that it gives no other purpose to the state than the protection of the private interests of individuals. It follows from this, first, that there must be a clear dividing line between individuals, atomized by their separate and competing private interests, on one side, and the state on the other. Second, although the state has no purpose of its own and exists only to protect individuals and their interests, it can only do this by having a monopoly of the means of coercion over individuals. In the nineteenth century, a second stage of individualism developed in which Bentham’s assertion of the absolute primacy of the purely subjective experience of pain and pleasure is fundamental (Bentham 1988: 1). This stage was completed with the incorporation of his concept of utility into economic theory by the neoclassical and Austrian economists. Economics becomes the primary form of individualism, with individuals defined as essentially economic beings (Urquhart 2012a). The second stage follows closely from the first. On the one hand, its rigorous subjectivism completes the earlier view of the atomic individual; on the other hand, the apolitical and proto-economic character of the earlier political theory points to the full economism of the later stage. Individualism, then, is necessarily economistic, first, in defining the individual as an economic being, isolated in its own interests; from which it follows that the conditions of the economy must be imposed on all other spheres, notably the family and the state. Few individualist writers—Mises (1966: 97) and Becker and Michael (1976) are two of the most important—have accepted the full implications of their own theory in regard to the family; but the need for an apolitical political theory to support individualism is generally recognized, even if not in precisely those terms. The economy defines the political and makes it purely instrumental. However, between the two stages of individualism, between Locke and Bentham, a very different line of thought emerges based on the necessity of relations among individuals (Shaftesbury); and the idea that human beings change over the course of history (Montesquieu, Vico). This line of thought rejects the individualist account both of the individual and of the state. Though pushed aside by the return to individualism—at least in Anglo-American thought—it is the beginning of the modern theory of the individual that I will call plural individuality: the view that to be an individual it is necessary to stand in relation to other individuals. The paper argues that the individualist view is not only untenable, but that in its contradictions, it necessarily points toward plural individuality. It will consider the contradictions of individualism through the liberal-conservative consensus of Isaiah Berlin and Friedrich Hayek on individual freedom (Sect. 2); and John Rawls’s procedural-instrumental account of the state (Sect. 3). It will then show ways in which J.S. Mill’s work partially resolves the contradictions (Sect. 4); before turning to the plural individualist political theory of Hannah Arendt (Sect. 5). The final Sect. 6 will broaden her view to indicate a plural individuality that shows individuality as necessarily emerging through both the private and the public spheres, in which the political, through public happiness, plays a necessarily constitutive role. The terms “individual,” “political,” and “public happiness” are, obviously, central to this work, but to begin with formal definitions would defeat its purpose. Their meanings must develop through the divergent views considered. The point will be to show, first, the inadequacy of the individualist views of, especially, the individual and the political; second, that these views in their inadequacy, nonetheless point to a more adequate view (that of plural individuality); and third, to sketch out this more adequate view, seeing how it connects the individual with the political, in part through the necessity of public happiness for individuality.",2

Reading his latest book is a refreshing experience. In the first place, the book focusses on distribution as the main problem of Economics. This is a welcome surprise. Barring the contributions from certain quarters—such as Amartya Sen, Tony Atkinson and few others—as far as mainstream Economics is concerned, it has long ceased dealing with income distribution as a major theoretical issue. The idea has gained currency that income distribution is an aspect and an outcome of the pricing mechanism. In the world of general economic equilibrium, as well as in the libertarian economic order, only commutative justice can find its place. Distributive justice is a spurious construct. At best (as Hayek once wrote), it is just a name, relished by the socially oriented, and a toy for econometricians in search of ‘facts’, but it does not have a proper intellectual statute. In the severe quarters where economists live, there is hardly a place for multiple spheres of justice. To make of distribution a pillar of the economic discourse would appear to many as a step backward to David Ricardo, who had in fact argued in that sense in the classical period. The history of economic thought is not popular with the hardline mainstream economists today, such as the desperately aggressive Noisefromamerika people, almost as popular and powerful as the Bocconi gurus, especially in Italy. Their impudent Americanism makes them ‘more papist than the Pope.’ Piketty, who shares an American education and is certainly not a French nationalist, sensibly finds good reasons to keep extreme Americanism at bay, which also makes it easier for him to offer a balanced view on things that can be usefully drawn from the history of the discipline, a history so contemptuously ignored by the mainstream generally. At the same time, the book is explicitly not a purely economic book. The history of the distribution of wealth is unescapably political—the author argues (p. 47 of the French edn.); it cannot be reduced to the working of purely economic mechanisms. Thus, distribution is a field where an economist needs the assistance of history, of social science and possibly other disciplines. This, of course, means taking a healthy distance from the current conventional wisdom of economics, which is rather prone to turn the discipline into an ‘imperial science,’ which—based on the two legs of balancing incentives coupled with methodological individualism (currently dubbed ‘microfounded’ analysis)—proceeds to give exclusive privilege to a narrow focus on self-interested motivations of the agents. It then, of course, cavalierly extends that same kind of rationality as a safe and sound approach to any kind of human action.",2
61,3,International Review of Economics,08 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-014-0212-x,Network efficiency and the banking system,September 2014,Nicola Giocoli,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In a classic statement, Ronald Coase declared: “The main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism,” the latter being “[t]he cost of negotiating and concluding a separate contract for each exchange transaction which takes place on a market” (Coase 1937, 390–1). The passage is interpreted as meaning that in the absence of a firm, each input owner would possibly have to contract with every other owner of the inputs whose cooperation is required in the production process, while within the firm each input owner negotiates a single contract with the entrepreneur. In case N inputs must cooperate to obtain the final product, a total of N(N − 1)/2 bilateral contracts would be required in the free market, while only (N − 1) contracts would suffice within a firm. If, as argued by Coase, each contract has a cost, the latter is the most efficient solution to produce the output. Firms thus emerge as the efficient response to the costly process of contracting. This well-known explanation of the origin of firms relies on the implicit assumption that efficiency in production is tantamount to cost minimization. However, there may be production processes where an alternative notion of efficiency, based on the effectiveness with which knowledge—or information, or any other valuable input—is transmitted from one agent to the other, sounds more appropriate. In such a case the existence of a direct connection, in the form of a contractual relation, between any two agents participating in a common production process is a more effective way for exchanging knowledge between them than the alternative solution of having knowledge flow through the firm’s hierarchy from, say, an agent up to the entrepreneur and then from there down to another agent. Moreover, a network of direct relationships between input owners makes the production process more resilient to possible breakdowns in communication flows. In the case of a firm, each agent is connected to the others only through its contractual relationship with the entrepreneur, so much so that any interruption of this relationship (due to, say, adverse weather conditions or a contractual breakdown) determines the agent’s inability to contribute to the production process. This is not so when the agent is connected to many others via a number of contracts: even if one, or few, of its relationships break down, she will still be able to contribute to the joint endeavor (e.g., by providing essential information) through the remaining ones. An alternative definition of efficiency should ideally encompass these phenomena, while retaining a key role for cost minimization. The paper’s underlying intuition is that the heuristic potential of such an alternative efficiency notion would go much beyond the “market versus firm” dichotomy. For example, assume the production process under scrutiny is the provision of liquidity to end users (households or businesses) via the banking system. Coase’s dichotomy may thus be interpreted as two possible ways to “produce” the liquidity required by the real sector of the economy. First, think of a centralized banking system, where the liquidity collected from depositors is channeled by individual branches towards a central institution—a “money center” (as in Eboli 2001)—which then oversees its redistribution to borrowers, either directly or through its branches. The main advantage of such a system would be similar to that of the Coasean firm: the minimization of the cost required to build the network of financial channels. Each contract to transmit liquidity entails a cost, if only in terms of the information about the borrower that the lender has to gather before making the loan. Hence, the centralized system is the most cost-effective way to provide liquidity. In addition, there is a further advantage in terms of the network’s protection from systemic crisis: the failure of one branch to repay its debts (i.e., return the liquidity to its depositors) would have little if any impact at system level because the ensuing financial imbalance would not propagate beyond the money center that, by definition, has the potential to offset it in its sizeable balance sheets. Think now of a decentralized financial system where each agent is an independent bank that exchanges liquidity with other banks. Liquidity may now circulate much more effectively and always be promptly transmitted from agents in surplus (be they banks or depositors) to those in deficit. Moreover, an interbank network for exchanging liquidity represents a safety net for each bank, which may now get liquidity from several channels, as well as for the system as a whole, because it warrants that, even in case of default of a single bank, liquidity will still continue to flow to and from every local area of the economy via alternative channels. On the minus side, such a system is very costly because now each bank has to gather information about every other bank with which it exchanges liquidity, as well as about each of its partners’ partners (because financial troubles of any of the latter may impact on the bank’s direct partners’ ability to repay debts). Moreover, the very same safety net provided by the interbank network has the potential to create a contagion from the failure of a single bank to repay its debts to the balance sheets of its lenders that, when roughly of the same size, may in turn become unable to honor their own debts, thereby triggering a (possibly explosive) propagation of the liquidity crisis. In Coasean fashion, we may ask ourselves which of the two systems are the most efficient one for liquidity circulation. Is it preferable to have a cost-minimizing, vertically integrated system, which is also less exposed to the risk of systemic crisis, or a decentralized, interlocked system that may quickly transfer liquidity everywhere in the market and is locally robust to failures, but that may more easily suffer from global collapse? A trade-off seems to exist between mutual insurance and systemic risk in a banking system.Footnote 1
 What limits the centralization of transactions? The standard answer, once again inspired by Coase (1937), is that as firms grow bigger, it becomes ever more costly to manage them. A threshold of managerial complexity exists beyond which it is less expensive for the firm to leave certain kinds of transactions or activities to the market, rather than integrate them. This intuition can be generalized by observing that every agent has only a bounded ability to handle the—potentially very large amount of—inputs (or knowledge, or information) received. A crucial insight is that an agent’s position in the network determines the seriousness of the troubles caused by her limited capacity. For example, the cost-minimizing centralized system may breakdown when the amount of inputs received by the central agent trespasses the latter’s maximum capacity to effectively manage them. The problem may be solved by either paying the cost of building a decentralized network that may spread the inputs’ load over more agents or by bearing a new kind of cost in order to augment the central agent’s capacity. Think again of the banking system. A bank exceeds its capacity when the demand for its liquidity is higher than its ability to collect it. The unsatisfied demand may then turn to another bank, but this may cause further troubles if the latter exceeds its own capacity to provide liquidity; the new troubles may then spread to a third bank, and so on. The crisis may be avoided by allowing a bank extra sources of liquidity—for example, by letting the bank sell its long-period assets or by establishing a special “liquidity creator” (a.k.a. the central bank) with the duty to provide liquidity on demand. Yet, none of these solutions is zero cost. Summing up, we have four elements to take into account when evaluating the “market versus firm” dichotomy in its general form of a network of interconnected agents: 1) The cost of establishing a communication channel (say, a contract) between two agents; 2) the effectiveness in the transmission of the inputs/information among the agents; 3) the robustness of the entire system, or of parts of it, to the breakdown of an agent or a communication channel; 4) the cost of providing each agent with the capacity to manage the inputs/information received. The four features find easy translation in the banking system case. Standard economics only emphasizes the first and, sometimes, the fourth element. However, it is just through the interplay of all four that we may fully characterize the working of every system where either information or inputs or liquidity are transmitted from one agent to another. For a complete solution, we have to look outside economics and toward the theory of complex networks, a relatively young research area in physics and mathematics that aims at investigating the topological properties of non-trivial networks. In a series of recent papers, physicists Vito Latora and Massimo Marchiori (LM thereafter) have proposed some notions of network cost and network efficiency that happen to nicely overlap with the four above-mentioned features. The rest of the paper aims at presenting these notions, showing that they can provide a richer toolbox for the analysis of interconnected systems, such as the banking one.Footnote 2
 The paper is organized as follows. The next section covers the basic material of complex network theory. In Sects. 3 and 4, we introduce LM’s notions of, respectively, network efficiency and network cost and collapse. Section 5 examines how our approach may be applied to the analysis of banking systems and liquidity crises. Section 6 concludes.",2

Graham,Jack Robles,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Legal services contracts are often designed in an attempt to address a possible moral hazard problem. Since clients cannot perfectly observe attorney effort, attorneys have an incentive to provide less effort than the client would choose if she had perfect information. The typical legal services contract compensates the attorney either through an hourly wage or via a contingency agreement where the attorney receives payment only if the client’s case is successful and results in a positive award. Most authors conclude that traditional contingency fee contracts align the incentives of the attorney with the interests of the client more closely than a simple fixed wage contract; see for example, Schwartz and Mitchell (1970), Clermont and Currivan (1978), Danzon (1983), Hay (1996), Santore and Viard (2001), Polinsky and Rubinfeld (2003), and McKee et al. (2007).Footnote 1 However, Hay (1996) and others find that attorneys may earn positive economic rents with contingent fees even in a competitive market. This results because the client must choose between providing the attorney with an incentive for high effort with a large contingent fee and minimizing the attorney’s rent with a small contingent fee. The client could achieve both objectives if the attorney were able to purchase the claim from the client. However, as noted by Santore and Viard (2001), legal constraints on attorney fee contracts make this arrangement impossible. We extend the literature by allowing contracting upon hours.Footnote 2 This has an impact on both the total expected value of the client’s claim and the distribution of surplus. In certain settings, we find that by contracting on hours and requiring more hours than the first-best level, the client can reduce the rent required to induce high effort. This can lead the client to choose a high effort inducing contract when she otherwise would not and will increase the total realized value of her case. In addition, even when the client is willing to give the attorney rents to induce high effort with first-best hours, she can increase her payoff and reduce the attorney’s rents by increasing hours. This, however, decreases the total value of the case. Hours reporting requirements in contingent legal services contracts are a common feature of state “sunshine” laws. For example, in 2010, Florida passed legislation setting out conditions under which the state may hire private attorneys to assist with state legal matters on a contingency fee basis.Footnote 3 The purpose of the legislation is to allow the attorney general to employ private attorneys while ensuring that the contingency fee does not give the outside attorney excessive fees. Among other things, the law requires private attorneys to provide detailed time records and the attorney general to make a written statement that the fees paid are cost-effective. The time reporting requirement in the Florida “sunshine” law enables the attorney general to make an informed determination of cost-effectiveness by comparing, ex post, the amount of time the attorney spent on various activities and the final fee amount. Ex ante, the time reporting requirement may serve as an additional contractual lever the client can use to shape the attorney’s behavior. Given an attorney general’s expertise with legal cases and the oversight of outside counsel that is required by the Florida law, it may be reasonable to presume that the attorney general can adjust the amount of time the contingent fee attorney must put into the case. The client’s ability to effectively monitor and contract upon hours is crucial to the effectiveness of contingent fee contracts. Such ability improves both the client’s payoff and the total value of the case. We are motivated by situations in which the client is an attorney general and a sunshine law is in effect. An attorney general’s expertise and available resources along with the required public disclosure of hours provided and tasks completed by the attorney should serve to improve the effectiveness of monitoring. Effective monitoring is more likely to induce honest hours reporting, and if an attorney is dishonest, the hours reported are likely to be closer to hours worked than the attorney would otherwise report. We present the model and analyze it in the following two sections. The final section concludes.",

However, retention is relatively more beneficial, in that firms can reinvest their earnings in their own profitable operations. The query which comes to mind, then, is why firms pay dividends at all? It may be to send signals of profitability, to return profits back to shareholders when not needed for investment, to provide returns to shareholders that are independent of uncertain capital gains, to reduce opportunities for managerial misappropriation in the presence of residual managerial agency costs, and perhaps also to move the capital structure towards its optimal level. This question of firms’ motivation for dividend payments has been the focus of academic debate for a long time. However, the debate acquired new momentum after the publication of Black’s study, by now well known, entitled “The Dividend Puzzle”Footnote 1 (1976). Empirical research was carried out later on, to single out the determining factors and to come up with reasonable answers to the query in various country contexts with vastly different cultural, institutional, legal, tax, and asymmetric information environments. These studies focus on the use of financial ratios such as total assets, profitability ratios, liquidity, and leverage as the determining factors of the payout ratio. However, the literature so far lacks an examination of the role of ownership structure and corporate governance in analysing the dividend behaviour of firms. This study takes a step towards bridging that gap and shows the role and importance of ownership structure in dividend payout behaviour of corporations. Furthermore, previous studies of dividend policy, though undertaken in varying environments, in fact provide insights drawn mainly from US corporations. The financial and business environment in Japan is, though, quite different from those in other country contexts such as the UK or USA. One apparent aspect of such a different business environment is the wide spread of the Japanese-affiliated company groupings of many enterprises with strong and striking business relationships and shareholding, called keiretsu. In keiretsu, Japanese companies have been tied to each other both via extensive business transactions and by cross-holdings of equity. Moreover, Japanese corporate policy disclosure and the legal environment are quite distinct from those of other developed countries. Economists have extensively debated the difference between bank-based financial systems versus market-based systems. This argument has mainly focused on four countries namely USA, UK, Japan, and Germany. In bank-based economies such as Germany and Japan, banks play a major role in identifying and mobilizing good investments, allocating capital, supervising the investment decisions of corporate managers, and in providing risk management tools, whereas in the market-based economies, securities markets act in line with the banks in terms of mobilizing the national savings to profitable investment opportunities, exercising corporate control, and easing risk management. Some analysts suggest that markets are more effective at providing financial services that motivate innovation and long-term growth. Others advocate in favour of the advantages of intermediaries that mobilize savings and exerting corporate control. The issue is still unresolved and immersed with conflicts. In the bank-based financial system such as Japan, the communication and the relationship between corporation’s managers and shareholders are more intense than in the US market-based system. The asymmetric information seems to be less of a concern for the Japanese corporations particularly for the affiliated groups. Another aspect is that in the bank-based economy, the shareholders interest is to establish long-term investments regardless of the dividend policy. However, in the market-based economy, dividends policy serves as signalling and that US managers are more concerned about adjusting dividend announcements in response to earnings changes. As far as the dividend policy is concern, additional discrepancy between the two above-mentioned economies is that unlike the US firms, Japanese keiretsu organizations are less likely to be encountered with the agency cost problem. As a result, the use of the dividend as a signalling tool is less pertinent. Rather, the equity cross-shareholding in the group-affiliated firms is utilized as a mean to distribute dividends among its shareholders. Accordingly, we can anticipate that the determinants of dividend policy in Japan will differ from those in the USA and that a study of Japanese dividend policy can provide fresh insights into understanding the determinants of dividend policy across the world more fully. Here, we explicitly incorporate the ownership structure and change in ultimate control of companies in a model with dividends payout as response variable, to get a clue about the role of various different classes of investors (such as stable shareholders, market investors, inside, and government shareholding) in dividends payments. Moreover, this study can also be useful in understanding cash flow relationships among various ownership entities and should be of widespread interest given that ownership groups are a dominant force in most non-Anglo-Saxon countries (see, e.g., La Porta et al. 2000; Almeida and Wolfenzon 2006; Khanna and Yafeh 2007). For the market-based economies, Jensen (1989) and Scharfstein and Stein (1988) argue that the market for corporate control improves efficiency by enabling a third party to take control of the firm. This improvement can be signalled in the form of paying higher dividends to its shareholders. For the Japanese economy, traditionally, the majority of shares in Japanese firms have been held by stable shareholders such as affiliated firms, banks, and insurance companies. A defining characteristic of these types of investors is the development of stable long-term business relationships, such as lending and commercial trade ties,Footnote 2 with the firm in which they are investing rather than simply earning returns on their equity investments (Abegglen and Stalk 1985; Miyajima and Kuroki  (2008).Footnote 3 The existence of these holdings has insulated firms from capital market pressures and the threat of takeover (Kester 1986) and has provided an opportunity to the stable shareholders to influence corporate strategy in a manner consistent with their objectives (Gedajlovic and Shapiro 2002). On the other hand, the market investors such as foreign corporations and private individuals have the primary objective of maximizing their return on the invested capital in these firms. Market investors have an incentive to monitor firms, in which they hold shares, reflecting their singular (rather than multifaceted) tie to the firm; their monitoring efforts are likely to emphasize corporate profitability and hence dividends payments (Fukao 1999). Hence, change in ultimate share ownership may make dividends sensitive to the investment objectives of market investors. The recent evidence from the Japanese corporate control market suggests that corporate governance in Japan is evolving in response to rapid increase in competition in the financial market, a changing legal environment and fiscal policies. The proportion of share and ultimate control held by stable investors is declining, and the role of market investors is increasing. As Kikuchi (1999) and Yoshikawa and Phan (2001) have mentioned, the power of market investors is increasing in Japan particularly that of foreign shareholders.Footnote 4 Foreign and domestic private individual shareholders are now in a better position than ever before to influence corporate behaviour. Furthermore, the influence of traditional stable shareholders in Japan appears to be diminishing.Footnote 5 At the same time, many contemporary accounts suggest that the relationship between Japanese financial institutions and their client firms has become less relational and more transactional during the past decade (e.g., Inoue 1999; Yasui 1999).Footnote 6
 Since ownership structure and hence corporate governance have been evolving in the Japanese corporate market, a new environment is emerging, due also to changes in the financial system and public policies. The pressure from capital markets (the rapid increase in M&A’s, in particular) has played an important role since the decline in the main bank system and the dissolution of cross-shareholding. This pressure has assisted in the restructuring of business organizations’ spheres and capital structure as well as having contributed to increased efficiency and better corporate performance among the companies concerned. In this study, we empirically examine the determinants of dividend policy in Japan, taking account of the ownership structure and changes in ownership for the first time. Furthermore, we have made a comparison among private individual, non-financial, and financial institutions’ transfers with regard to corporate dividends within the groups of firms that have experienced a change in control. In this study, our main focus is on the impact of governance structure and change in ownership upon dividend payout behaviour: a change apparently necessitated by the legal and corporate reforms in the post-Bubble period in Japan. Our principal contribution lies in the new insights provided by adding a set of previously unused variables in the investigation of dividend policy in Japan: the ownership structure as well as change in ownership, in addition to various entities’ variables which further gauge the importance of intra-group financial ties (debt and equity) and transactional ties (intra-group sales). The rest of our paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we discuss the prior work on Japanese dividend policy. In Sect. 3, we outline the basis of our own empirical work and describe our variables, model, econometric methodology, and our sample. Section 4 deals with the empirical results and is followed by our interpretation and conclusions in the last section.",1

The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 prompted the search for new solutions to secure banking stability. Two approaches have been put forward in response to this need. On the one hand, proposals were made and subsequently implemented with regard to capital requirements, and other measures aimed to increase loss-absorbency capacity and make banks less vulnerable to liquidity problems. Such an approach is proper, for instance, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and resulted in the development of a new package of measures to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector (so-called Basel III).Footnote 1 On the other hand, projects for structural reforms have been proposed to delimit the scope and size of core banking functions with the explicit aim of shielding these activities from the risks associated with other financial activities that are only incidental to them. Our article is focused on the reforms concerning structural regulation. Structural measures pertaining to the second approach have been under consideration as part of banking sector reforms in different jurisdictions (particularly, the USA, the UK and the European Union) under the assumption that rules from the first approach are not sufficient to reduce excessive risk taking and bank failures. Despite the common premise, these proposals of ring fencing (RF) exhibit prominent differences as to the nature and scope of the requirements for separation of bank businesses. The solutions envisaged in the UK and the EU aim to isolate certain retail banking servicesFootnote 2 in an independently capitalized entity (ring-fenced bank). A ring-fenced bank is thus allowed to remain in a wider financial group, on condition that it constitutes a separate legal entity: this would ensure that the provision of banking services, which are vital to the economy—namely deposit-taking and payment services—is not threatened by other activities that are incidental to it (specifically, proprietary tradingFootnote 3 and wholesale and investment banking operationsFootnote 4). Conversely, the US rule (so-called Volcker Rule) is more extreme in that it prevents common ownership of banks and entities engaging in proprietary trading and covered fund activities, although banks are permitted to engage in some activities that, in the UK and EU solutions, are otherwise placed outside the fence. Accordingly, the US solution may be interpreted as a peculiar form of ring fencing,Footnote 5 where the separation of commercial and investment bankingFootnote 6 is more extreme for some aspects but less complete for others. Considering the Volcker Rule, it is also possible to make a comparison with the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 (GSA), which is generally regarded as its historical precedentFootnote 7 and represented an example of regulatory use of ring fencing.Footnote 8 Indeed, as a reaction to the stock market crisis of 1929 and the banking crisis that climaxed in 1933, the GSA led to a ‘divorce’ between commercial and investment banking, putting an end to unrestricted universal banking in the USA.Footnote 9 Arguably, the pressures to remove the GSA barriers, which resulted in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999, can be interpreted as one of the possible causes of the global financial crisis: accordingly, the endorsement of the Volcker Rule may be regarded as an attempt to separate again commercial and investment banking so as to prevent future crises. From a political economy perspective, these differences in the design and implementation of ring-fencing proposals can be understood as the result of the activity of policymakers who are delegated the task to define and implement the optimal level of separation between banking and other financial activities. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that in each national system, the actual level of ring fencing can be different from the social optimal one given the existence of peculiar political cost and benefit analyses. Continuing along this line of reasoning, it is no coincidence that in June 2014 The Wall Street Journal reported that the Head of the House Financial Services Committee has called on US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to investigate whether the new ring-fencing rules have impaired the market for US corporate debt, arguing that it was the responsibilities of the regulator to ensure that the Volcker Rule, which bans commercial banks from the securities business, does not harm US capital markets. The ring fencing has sparked concerns among some politicians and bankers as well that the new regulation could negatively impact on the market efficiency. The legislator seemed to be affected by a stability bias. At the same time in July 2014, the Financial Times highlighted that the US financial regulators unimously claimed that the biggest eleven banks did not have adequate plans in the event of distress and failure, notwithstanding the new US regulation has been designed to avoid the excessive risk taking in commercial banking, including the Volcker Rule provisions. Following this perspective, the new regulation so far has failed to reach its goals of mitigating systemic risks and fixing the too big to fail problems; the legislator was influenced by an efficiency (market friendly) bias. It is evident that two opposite views are on the table in evaluating the recent acts in banking regulation, using arguments in favour of or against ring fencing. As mentioned, after the 2008 Financial Meltdown, the need for reconsidering the separation between commercial banking and other financial risky activities—ring fencing—was publicly recognized both in the USA and in Europe. In spite of this widespread demand for structural banking regulation reform, the ring-fencing proposals—the Volcker Rule in the US Dodd-Frank Act, the Vickers Report in the UK, the Liikanen Report in the European Union—are still very controversial. How to explain the difficulties in enacting and accepting structural banking regulation? Our paper answers using a political economy view. We assume that the policymaker is a politician—i.e. a career concerned agent—which is influenced time to time by the public goal to avoiding banking instability and the banking private interests in having soft and light touch rules. Our interpretation is based on two hypotheses.Footnote 10 First of all, gains and losses of a given RF setting are variables computed by the incumbent policymaker, who maintains or reforms the regulatory regime following his/her own preferences. Secondly, policymakers are politicians, and as such, they are held accountable at elections for how they have managed to please voters. All politicians are career-oriented agents, motivated by the goal of pleasing voters in order to win elections. The main difference among various types of politicians concerns which kinds of voters they wish to please in the first place. In other words, we can shed light on the establishment of a RF regulation using a political delegation framework. In doing so, we adopt the view that argues that the policymaker’s actual choices related to the RF framework are conditional on the economic and institutional environment existing at a given time, which in turn determines the political weights put on the pros and cons of the RF establishment. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the legislative history of the aforementioned Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 (GSA) and presents a historical account of the events leading to the repeal of the restrictions to universal banking in the USA, which was formalized by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999. Considering the ring-fencing projects that have been put forward with the global financial crisis, Sect. 3 reconstructs the timeline of the events in each legal system (USA, UK and EU) from the initial ring-fencing proposal to the final enactment of the relevant rules (USA and UK) or their formal publication (in the EU). Section 4 concludes.",3
61,4,International Review of Economics,25 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-014-0211-y,Income growth and happiness: reassessment of the Easterlin Paradox,December 2014,Edsel L. Beja Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper is yet another intervention to the continuing debate on the Easterlin Paradox. Simply put, the paradox is about a contradiction between the short-run evidence of a positive income–happiness relationship and the long-run evidence of a zero income–happiness relationship. This scenario is a paradox because it goes against the standard view that a positive income–happiness relationship exists regardless of the time perspective in the analysis. Briefly, a summary of the debate includes the following observations. First, Easterlin (1974, 1995, 2001) argues that hedonic adaptation to income and social comparison in income operate to cancel out any short-run impact of income growth on happiness and/or make happiness revert to its long-run level notwithstanding the presence of income growth. The argument does not really say that income growth cannot affect happiness at all, but, rather, any effect can only take place under the restrictive assumption of ceteris paribus. More recently, Easterlin et al. (2012; see also Knight and Gunatilaka 2011, 2012) add that robust income growth that spans for many years like the experience of China is not even enough to offset the impact of hedonic adaptation and social comparison in keeping happiness steady in the long term. Second, the “Stevenson–Wolfers group” (i.e., among others, Deaton 2008; Inglehart et al. 2008; Stevenson and Wolfers 2008; Sacks et al. 2012; Diener et al. 2013; and Veenhoven and Vergunst 2014) presents evidence that refutes the findings of the “Easterlin group” (i.e., Easterlin 1974, 1995, 2001, 2013; Easterlin and Angelescu 2009; Easterlin and Sawangfa 2010; Easterlin et al. 2010). In particular, Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) point out that a statistically not significant association between income growth and happiness is not the same as an absence of a relationship between the two variables, as hinted by the Easterlin group. They then go on to present evidence that both the short-run and long-run relationships between income growth and happiness are indeed statistically positive. In fact, they also state that the long-run evidence is not statistically different from the short-run evidence. In turn, Easterlin (2013), for instance, counters by saying that what the Stevenson–Wolfers group ends up estimating is merely a short-run relationship between income growth and happiness, and, as such, what they are presenting is evidence that does not invalidate the paradox.Footnote 1
 
Third, the two sides of the debate differ in the generality of the purported absence or presence of the long-run income–happiness relationship. On the one hand, the Easterlin group argues that the absence of such a relationship applies to both developed and developing countries. On the other hand, the Stevenson–Wolfers group argues that the presence of such a relationship applies to both sets of countries, but only the degree of the relationship is different. That is, the long-run income–happiness relationship is generally weaker in the developed countries, but generally stronger in the developing countries. Interestingly, though, the recent findings of Sacks et al. (2012), Diener et al. (2013) and Stevenson and Wolfers (2013) show that income growth affects happiness in the same degree regardless of the country groupings, albeit Diener et al. (2010) find that income growth shows more impact on happiness in the developed countries than in the developing countries. Fourth, both the Easterlin and Stevenson–Wolfers groups obtain positive but very small estimates on the long-run income–happiness relationship. Earlier studies such as Oswald (1997), Veenhoven and Haggerty (2006), Clark and Senik (2011), and Veenhoven and Vergunst (2014) made a similar observation as well. Clearly, while the findings of both groups suggest that income growth is not the end-all and be-all to happiness, it is apparent in the extant literature that many things constitute happiness. Such is necessarily the case because income growth and happiness are fundamentally different concepts: the former is a proxy measure of an economy’s well-being, and the latter is a proxy measure of the people’s well-being. Such is also the case because the transformation of income growth into happiness is neither definite nor automatic. Moreover, there is also an issue about how social values and preferences are now inextricably linked to money, income, and wealth, but disassociated from relationships, community, and citizenship. Ensuring that analyses are sound and robust is of course important, but it seems that the debate on the Easterlin Paradox tends to focus more on the statistical significance of the evidence and less, if at all, on the practical meaning of the finding. The foregoing introduction acknowledges that the debate on the Easterlin Paradox is one of those situations in which researchers are examining an issue using different perspectives and empirical strategies. This paper, in turn, contributes to the debate by asserting that an economic significance reading of the evidence might be more helpful to a better appreciation of the paradox itself and, hopefully, to a resolution of the debate as well. The paper asserts that a rejection of the paradox must hinge on an affirmative answer to the question: “Does the estimated long-run relationship between income growth and happiness indicate any economic significance?” What, then, does “economic significance” mean? McCloskey (1985) and Ziliak and McCloskey (2008) explain that economic significance refers to the substantive content or meaningfulness of the estimated relationship between, say, two variables. In turn, they say that “substantive content” or “meaningfulness” is about the size of the estimate—that is, the evidence is large enough to be noteworthy. In short, economic significance indicates the “oomph.” Still, Thornbecke (2004) adds that making the theory or framework underpinning the analysis transparent helps in specifying an acceptable oomph. As regards the Easterlin Paradox, then, economic significance means checking if the evidence is useful for a meaningful understanding of the long-run relationship between income growth and happiness. Accordingly, an evaluation of the paradox becomes less about whether the estimated long-run relationship is statistically equal to zero or not, but more about whether the estimated long-run relationship is practically equal to zero or not. Nevertheless, in the context of the debate on the Easterlin Paradox, I agree with Engsted (2009) that it is still worthwhile to ensure that the estimated long-run relationship is not a spurious finding or an outcome of biased calculation procedures.Footnote 2 Statistical analysis, in this context, does not play a be-all and end-all role, but plays an instrumental role in reaching a conclusion that has economics relevance. Given the foregoing remarks, this paper takes the Easterlin Paradox as its default position. The analysis in this paper tries to account for the different phenomena as pointed out by the Easterlin group. What I obtain in the end is a measure for the “net” long-run income–happiness relationship, which should practically be a zero estimate precisely because the estimation tries to account for the occurrence of the paradox. As such, a decision to reject the paradox can only make sense if the evaluation of the evidence remains in the realm of statistical significance, as the Stevenson–Wolfers group does. Like the Easterlin and Stevenson–Wolfers groups, this paper uses country-level time series data in its analysis. But, unlike the two groups, the empirical scope of this paper is rather limited because the dataset covers nine developed countries only. The evidence therefore needs to be interpreted with some caution. Needless to say, the availability of an extended time series dataset that not only covers a large group of countries, but also contains information comparable across countries remains a major obstacle in doing an analysis such as what this paper is trying to accomplish. All the same, the foregoing introduction suggests that the findings of this paper are not going to be substantively different from those of the Easterlin and Stevenson–Wolfers groups, especially when they are viewed using the lens of economic significance. The rest of the paper has the following structure. Part 2 presents a framework for an analysis of the Easterlin Paradox. A discussion of the data and empirical strategy follows in Part 3. The findings and implications come in Part 4. The last part concludes the paper.",19

Mixon Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is sometimes the case in economics that two separate theoretical constructs are observationally equivalent in their predictions. Kaffine (2009) provides an example of the phenomenon in discussing the seminal literature on common-property resources and property rights delineation. One theoretical approach, developed largely through the work of Gordon (1954), Scott (1955), Coase (1960), Hardin (1968), Ostrom (1990), and Cole (2002), argues that common-property resources lacking well-defined property rights often suffer from overexploitation—the well-known “tragedy of the commons.” This overexploitation is perhaps best addressed with the development of private property rights or perhaps instead with the development of rules of use, in order for economically efficient behavior to take hold. As this line of inquiry suggests, overexploitation and congestion are avoided, while rent preservation and increased resource quality result (Kaffine 2009). A second theoretical approach, expressed in Demsetz (1967) and supported by Umbeck (1981) and Libecap (1989), argues that property rights will be endogenously created by resource users when the benefits of developing and enforcing property rights exceed the costs, as in the historical case of the creation of mineral rights across the western states (Kaffine 2009). The observational equivalence in this case comes from the two theories’ implication of a(n) (endogenous) link between the strength of property rights and the quality of the common-pool resource, an equivalence highlighted by Kaffine (2009: 728) through the question: “If we observe a high-quality [common-pool resource] with strong property rights, is quality high because strong property rights encourage investment in the resource, or did users recognize the high quality of the resource and move to establish strong property rights?” In answering questions regarding (1) the strength of informal property rights and resource quality, (2) the benefits to owners from an increase in resource quality, and (3) the implications for empirical research if resource quality is endogenous to property rights, Kaffine’s (2009: 728) study of California’s surf gangs considers the strength of user-enforced informal property rights in an equilibrium setting, wherein local and nonlocal users derive benefits from a surf break of exogenous quality while also suffering costs either from providing or being on the receiving end of exclusionary effort. Kaffine (2009) assumes that local surfers solve the collective action problem either formally or informally and decide how much effort should be expended to prevent nonlocal surfers from enjoying the local surf break.Footnote 1 Using cross-sectional data on 86 surf breaks along the southern California coast, Kaffine (2009) finds a positive and statistically significant relationship between surf break quality and informal property rights, specifically noting that a 10 percent increase in surf break quality leads to a seven to 17 percent increase in the strength of surf break property rights. This study extends Kaffine’s (2009) work on informal property rights along California’s surf breaks by expanding the test area to include all of both central and northern California’s surf breaks. This expansion allows for an empirical test of structural differences between informal property rights regimes across the three regions of California’s common-pool surf break resources. Additionally, this study explores other aspects of surf break quality not tested in Kaffine (2009), such as ocean currents, ocean floor, and other risks faced by those who would attempt to enjoy a given surf break. Finally, this extension redefines “access” to the common-pool resource (i.e., the surf break) by would-be users and re-examines some of the linear restrictions present in prior empirical modeling. The results from ordered logit estimations presented below are perhaps even more striking than those in Kaffine (2009)—indicating that, beginning with a near top-notch surf break, a marginal increase in surf break quality leads to an increase in the probability of observing near-fiercest and fiercest informal property rights protections by local surfers of 28 and 23 percentage points, respectively. The following section of this study provides a brief overview of localism in surfing, with particular reference to California’s common-pool surf breaks. Section 3 reviews aspects of the formal model in Kaffine (2009) in order to establish some testable hypotheses about informal property rights protection in the context of surf breaks. The empirical model is introduced in this section as well. Finally, Sect. 4 presents the results of various econometric tests, along with implications of the empirical results. The study concludes with some brief remarks in Sect. 5.",13
61,4,International Review of Economics,22 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-014-0199-3,Exploring the nexus between remittances and economic growth: a study of Bangladesh,December 2014,Ronald R. Kumar,Peter J. Stauvermann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Bangladesh, according to the United Nation (UN) classification, is a least developed country (LDC). The average per capita income for the economy is around US$588 (constant 2000). Nevertheless, the country receives large amount of remittances.Footnote 1 The top ten destination countries for Bangladeshis include India, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Oman, the United States, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, and Jordan. 
Although, there are lot of studies done to explore the role of remittances on economic growth in Bangladesh, the contribution of remittances to output, and the direction of causality remains controversial. Bangladesh has experienced an exceptional growth in remittances on the back of growing output per worker. However, it is not clear whether remittances have any significant effect on the growth rate of output per worker, since the results presented in the earlier studies (Siddique et al. 2012; Paul et al. 2011; Ahmed 2010) are mixed. Therefore, in this article, we present an alternative method and model (Rao 2007; Kumar 2013c; Kumar and Kumar 2013) to examine the nexus between remittances and economic growth. While our results in few respects coincide with Siddique et al. (2012), Paul et al. (2011), and Ahmed (2010) who looked at Bangladesh in the recent past, it significantly deviates from them in many other ways. Henceforth, we would like of highlight them in the rest of the article. Briefly, we examine the plausible effects of remittances vis-à-vis per worker income in Bangladesh over the period 1979–2012. In what follows, we establish the cointegration relationship between remittances and output per worker, estimate the short-run and long-run effects of remittances, and explore the direction of causality. We use the augmented Solow framework (Solow 1956) and apply the ARDL bounds approach (Pesaran et al. 2001) to examine cointegration and short-run and long-run effects. In addition, we utilize the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) approach to examine the causality nexus. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide a brief literature survey to account for the huge literature on this topic. Section 3 provides the econometric modeling, estimation techniques, and results. In Sect. 4, we conclude our results.",16

Standard intertemporal international macroeconomics suggests that every current account deficit has to be mirrored by future surpluses. No country can run persistent current account deficits, without depleting its net foreign assets (nfa).Footnote 1 Nevertheless, for most of the 2000s (the time of the widening US current account deficit), the US net foreign liabilities grew at a rate below the one of the cumulative current account deficit.Footnote 2 This paper will show how the unique position of the USA in the world monetary system allowed them to do so. 
Figure 1 displays the change in the nfa position and the CA positions between 1989 and 2009. The dotted line being above the solid line indicates the US net foreign liabilities were growing at a rate smaller than the American CA deficit in most years. Triffin describes how the “disastrous result” of the use of a reserve currency as the sole instrument of international monetary reserves is that “the deficits of a reserve-centre country may be financed […] with little or no decline of gross reserves for that reserve-centre country and, therefore no imperative pressure for the readjustment of inflationary policies”.Footnote 3
 Development US CA deficit and NFA position in million USD. Data: US Department of Commerce, BEA According to Triffin, the discrepancy between the two figures is explained by the use of Seigniorage. This has also been mentioned by other authors.Footnote 4 In that scenario, there is an unaccounted value in the form of liquidity services that the USA provide to the world (Seigniorage). The USA earn a significant premium on the provision of liquidity.Footnote 5 The Americans use the proceeds from printing money as an interest free loan to buy assets that generate returns.Footnote 6 The USA also benefit from exchange rate effects through the valuation channel. When the value of the US dollar (USD) decreases, the value of the US liabilities in USD remains the same, whilst the value of US assets in foreign currencies increases (measured in USD).Footnote 7 Thus, in both cases, there is a wealth transfer towards the USA. The fact that the dotted line is below the solid one in 1997 (Asia crisis), and the early 2000s, when the USD reached its 15 year peak, demonstrates that the valuation effect can also be negative for the USA, in times of peaks in the value of the USD.Footnote 8
 The idea of this paper is to set up a deterministic two-country dynamic general equilibrium model for an asymmetric world, where only one country can issue the world reserve currency and use it to purchase its imports, whilst the other country will have to collect foreign currency to pay for its imports. We will analyse how the use of Seigniorage in one country leads to current account deficits and a deteriorating net foreign asset position. The paper relates to other contributions on global CA imbalances which stress the role of the USD and net foreign asset holdings in the USA.Footnote 9 It is based on earlier models with asymmetric liquidity constraints that cover current account deficits and Seigniorage,Footnote 10 but will extend them by the holdings of domestic and foreign bonds. Thus, we will be able to examine the development of the respective net foreign asset positions.

Stochastic models have two main advantages compared to those of deterministic standard growth. First, thanks to the generalisation of the solutions they offer, the identification of the accumulation dynamics becomes possible without being limited to a comparison between different stationary states (Joshi 1998). Second, they allow to examine in a more systematic way the current issues such as welfare under a different monetary systems, the PPP in the presence of rigidities, the link between the macroeconomic volatility and international trade (Obsfeld and Rogoff 1999). However, the examination of the effect of the fiscal policy on welfare in the stochastic continuous-time context has been scarcely carried out in the available applied literature on developing countries. Few studies have been carried out in a discrete-time stochastic context, on one hand, and have only considered uncertainty taxation as Aizenman and Marion (1993) and Mendoza et al. (1997) or the productivity shock on the other hand as Hopenhayn and Maniagurria (1996). Although their method allows isolating the tax effects on welfare, it does not seem to be convenient for conveying the overall macroeconomic interactions occurring as a result of the endogenous stochastic adjustments. It would be possible to do this through stochastic processes generating evolution for all macroeconomic variables as shown in this paper. The aim of this paper was to examine the dynamic effects of the tax policy in the framework of a small open economy. We have shown that the nature and scope of these effects depend on the risk aversion degree of the representative agent and a “fluctuations threshold” that we endogenously determine. We also showed that the representative portfolio structure is continually modified in response to the several random shocks. For this purpose, we highlight the corresponding adjustment mechanisms. This paper is organised as follows: the second section is devoted to the elaboration of an endogenous growth stochastic model for a small open economy. Here, a description of a stochastic environment of an emergent economy will be provided along with the equilibrium conditions in the stationary state. The third section, illustrating the analytical scope of the introduction of stochastic context in endogenous growth models, shows the effects of the variability of tax policy on welfare.

The origin and nature of a contested concept,March 2015,Johannes Hirata,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The title of Diane Coyle’s latest book, “GDP: A brief but affectionate history” sets the reader on track for a historical account of the controversial concept of Gross Domestic Product, but in fact, her book is much more than that. While the six chapters follow a chronological timeline from the eighteenth to the twenty first century, each of them goes beyond merely tracing the historical development of GDP, discussing a number of important philosophical, methodological and practical issues and challenges relating to GDP, even though the brevity of the book (159 pages) means that most issues are not dealt with in depth. The issues to which Coyle devotes more attention and, as promised by the title, passion have to do with the difficulty of accounting for the increasing variety and quality of the goods and services at our disposal, and she concludes that our current measurement of GDP must be substantially underestimating growth in this regard (p. 124).Footnote 1 At the same time, she acknowledges that GDP fails to account for the depletion of natural resources and the changes in the stocks of various forms of capital (p. 115). She also vehemently criticizes the way financial services are accounted for and plausibly argues that the overestimation of the financial sector’s contribution to GDP has real policy implications (p. 101). Overall, she argues, GDP has always been an imperfect measure of output, but it is outright misleading today due to our economies’ inherent complexity, the increasing role of services and intangible goods and the challenge of sustainability. The book’s wealth of information and analytical insights are not matched by a similar degree of conceptual clarity, though. Coyle gives a number of differentiated and knowledgeable arguments for and against various ways of construing and measuring GDP, but it remains unclear on what basis she makes those arguments: She does not make explicit what exactly a good concept of GDP should accomplish apart from stating that it should measure “economic performance,” “how well the economy is doing” (p. 6) or the size of economic output (p. 40, 119). She explicitly rejects the idea that GDP ought to measure welfare (p. 40, pp. 113), but as I will argue presently, she seems to be more committed to the idea of GDP as a measure of welfare than she is aware of (and she is far from alone in doing so). I will take up three specific aspects of GDP that Coyle discusses in her book in order to substantiate this thesis and to point out a conceptual conundrum that seems to be inherent in the idea of GDP as a measure of economic performance. These three aspects are the role of increasing consumer choice, the relationship between technical measures of economic welfare and GDP, and the bearing of the relative-income effect and happiness on the significance of GDP.",2

The subject of happiness has long been a playground for philosophers. Since the 1970s, it has become the object of empirical research in the social sciences. In the wake of the social indicators movement, happiness became a common topic in large-scale welfare surveys, and a key topic in psychological research on mental health and in medical research on ‘health-related quality of life.’ Around 2000, ‘Happiness Economics’ appeared on the scene (e.g., Frey and Stutzer 2002; VanPraag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2010). The starting point of the literature on economics and happiness is an empirical finding, generally referred to as the Easterlin paradox: while across individuals and countries higher income results in higher happiness, over time income growth is not associated with higher happiness levels (Easterlin 1974).Footnote 1 Motivated by this puzzling result, a large number of studies in the economics and happiness literature have investigated the relationship between income and happiness (Clark et al. 2008; Stevenson and Wolfers 2008; Stanca 2010). Three main types of explanations have been offered for the Easterlin paradox, based on hedonic, aspirational, or positional mechanisms (Easterlin et al. 2010). More recently, the relational treadmill has been proposed as an additional explanation, based on the interplay between economic conditions and interpersonal relations (e.g., Gui and Stanca 2010; Stanca 2009, 2012; Colombo and Stanca 2014). The common theme in all these explanations is that although our material conditions improve, some other change occurs at the same time with an opposite effect. As a consequence, similar to the position of a runner during a treadmill workout, our perceived well-being remains unchanged. Forty years since Easterlin’s seminal contribution, a large body of evidence is available about the relationship between income and happiness. Quite surprisingly, instead, relatively little is known about the effects of the level and composition of consumption on happiness. This special issue aims at filling this gap. It draws on papers presented at a workshop on ‘Consumption and Happiness,’ organized by Ruut Veenhoven within the conference ‘Advances in Happiness Economics,’ held at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands, on October 28–29, 2013. This paper provides a short introduction to the special issue. We start by discussing different concepts and measures of happiness in Sects. 2 and 3, respectively. We then briefly review, in Sect. 4, the existing literature on consumption and happiness. Finally, Sect. 5 introduces the papers contained in the special issue by outlining their respective contributions.",21

The material well-being of private households is ultimately defined by the level, kind and quality of their consumption of goods and services, even if it may turn out to be debatable whether or not further growth in material wealth seems to be desirable considering the level of prosperity already achieved. As it thus seems rather obvious to consider consumption as a potential driver of subjective well-being (SWB), the lack of empirical research on the subject is quite striking. In any case, there is ample evidence that consumption can not only be a source of joy, pleasure and satisfaction, but also—if the necessary financial means are lacking—a cause of distress, discontent and absolute or relative deprivation. This article focuses on the role of consumption as a potential driver of SWB compared to other influencing factors, primarily household income. The leading research question will concern how and to what extent SWB is affected by the level and composition of a household’s consumption expenditures.",34

The question of how to achieve greater happiness goes back to Aristotle, who considered happiness as the ultimate motivating factor for all human action. The question of whether and how individuals achieve the happiness they seek in their daily life is of critical concern. There is an extensive body of literature analyzing the role of subjective well-being with the aim to understand individuals’ quality of life (Diener et al. 1999). For the last couple of decades, this subject has been attracting increased interest from other disciplines, including economics. Scholars have begun to research the connection between subjective well-being and several socioeconomic indicators (such as income, unemployment, inflation, and education.) that complement the income-based measure of welfare with the economics of happiness. Economists often take for granted that the higher the income per capita or higher levels of consumption/income mean, the greater the welfare and increased happiness. Individuals with higher incomes have more opportunities, such as being able to afford to buy more material goods and services. Higher income results in higher utility, while individuals with lower incomes are not as happy as those who have higher incomes. This relationship between income and happiness, at a particular point in time and in a specific country, has been the subject of a large empirical study. Cross-sectional studies within countries demonstrate that people in higher income groups along with higher levels of consumption report higher levels of self-reported happiness than people in lower-income groups (Diener et al. 1995; Inglehart 1990), and the relationship between income and happiness using regressions (controlling a large set of socioeconomic and demographic variables) proves to be statistically significant. However, the income/consumption effect on utility/happiness is complicated. The first issue is that evidence suggests in developed economies that in the long run, money does not buy happiness, or at least not much (Easterlin 1974; Oswald 1997). Easterlin (1974) revealed that the average self-reported happiness in the USA stayed practically unchanged during the post-war period although real incomes increased, nearly doubled during this time. This paradox is best explained by the relative income hypothesis, which is based on the idea that the impact of income or consumption depends on variable standards, such as those derived from expectancies, spending habits and social comparisons. Second, how an individual spend his/her money impacts on the level of life satisfaction is not yet explicitly known. Individuals spend their disposable income on several consumption categories such as food, durables, and luxury items; however, we do not know very much about how to spend one’s income in order to achieve greater happiness. The present paper examines the second issue by looking at the connections among consumption categories and life satisfaction at different levels of development by examining the Life in Transition Surveys (I and II). The surveys contain exact measurements of consumption items by focusing on both transition countries and developed European countries. The study includes different categories (eight in the first survey and seven in the second survey) to assess the importance of the consumption of goods such as food, education, durables, utility, transportation and health on an individual’s well-being. In addition, by analyzing the Life in Transition Survey II, the paper examines the impact of the reduction in several consumption items on the level of life satisfaction after the 2008 crisis. The econometric results show that not all consumption items are statistically significant as determinants of life satisfaction. Moreover, some consumption items have a negative impact on life satisfaction. At different levels of development, the correlation between life satisfaction and consumption differs. Additionally, the reduction in consumption due to economic crises has a negative impact on life satisfaction. The paper is organized as follows: In the following section, the methodology for the study on the effect of consumption items on individual well-being is outlined; in this same section, the survey, data, variables, some descriptive statistics, and the empirical strategy are provided; the subsequent sections include: empirical analyses, a discussion on key results, and finally the conclusions that can be drawn.",24

62,3,International Review of Economics,08 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-015-0239-7,The meta-crisis of secular capitalism,September 2015,John Milbank,Adrian Pabst,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The current crisis concerns the way in which contemporary capitalism has turned to financialisation as a double cure for both a falling rate of profit and a deficiency of demand (Brenner 2006; Kindleberger 2005). Although this turning is by no means unprecedented, previous capitalist cycles have tended to oscillate between more pressing needs to meet one or the other of these twin requisites. Thus, after the Great Depression of 1929–1932 came a sustained attempt to resolve a crisis of over-accumulation of capital with nowhere to go by systematic stimulation of demand in terms of a state-driven programme of higher wages, centralised welfare, public works, investment in industry and ultimately a war economy. Inversely, from the 1970s onwards, the falling rates of profit, which ensued to a degree everywhere (and not just in the Anglo-Saxon world, where this instance was exaggerated by comparison), were deemed to require a severe reversal of tactics that took the shape of supply-side reforms: in addition to spending cuts (except for defence), governments privatised state enterprise, curtailed trade union rights and lifted restrictions on banking, finance and retail. Today, however, it has become apparent that, while these measures have once again and inevitably depressed demand (shown notably in long-term stagnation of average wages), they have at the same time not proved adequate to restore profits and growth. There are three closely connected reasons for this. First of all, public expenditure remains very considerable, especially in terms of the administrative state and its layers of managerial bureaucracy that absorb significant resources for largely unproductive activities (Burnham 1941; Polanyi 2001 [1944]; Supiot 2013). Second, in a globalised and post-colonial era there is a growing scarcity for new sources of ‘primary accumulation’. The latter can be defined as a permanent process on which capitalism depends for economic expansion and which requires no-cost economic resources that mitigate the consequences of the need for incessant internal growth in the pursuit of increased abstract ‘wealth’ (Perelman 2000). The third reason is that capital resources are squandered through the exigencies of unnecessary duplication of production and provision for non-economically competitive reasons that ensue from rivalry between nations and power blocks (Brenner 1977; Arrighi 1994). Whatever the specific reasons for the current crisis, today the twin poles of the typical cycle coincide: gears crash and the system threatens to grind to a halt. Most employees and workers earn too little to help stimulate the economy through consumption, yet many businesses still do not make enough profit to render them secure in the medium to long term. So the current crisis is less the ‘normal’ one that has to do with a constitutive need to balance growth of abstract wealth with demand for concrete commodities. Rather, it is a kind of meta-crisis that seems more to do with the difficulties of sustaining abstract growth as such—a type of growth for which any sum, even one extracted from material destruction, counts as ‘gain’. Thus, the capitalist meta-crisis is the tendency at once to abstract from the real economy of productive activities and to reduce everything to its bare materiality. Unlike a market economy that binds material value to symbolic meaning (Polanyi 2001 [1944]; Braudel 1985), a capitalist economy tends to separate matter from symbol and reduce materiality to calculable numbers representing ‘wealth’. Such a conception of wealth rests on the aggregation of abstract numbers that cuts out all the relational goods and the ‘commons’ on which shared prosperity depends (e.g. Ostrom 1990; Gui 2005). This tendency is by no means new, but it does seem now to have surfaced to an unprecedented degree. Arguably it has not so much to do with the ‘internal’ contradiction of capitalism, i.e. its need at once to extract profit from the worker–consumer, and yet ensure that she can go on consuming. Instead, it has to do with the contradictions that inevitably ensue upon the setting of capitalist practice within an extra-capitalist margin that both precedes it and continues to accompany it. This margin is complex and multifaceted: it includes un-capitalised economies, besides the social, cultural, political and international relations spheres, insofar as these remain external to a purely capitalist market logic (Fraser 2013, 2014). Given all this, financialisation is a logical response to the meta-crisis of capitalism, for deeper reasons than are usually seen, besides the more superficial but nonetheless true ones (Lapavitsas 2013). From any perspective it is clear that it addresses both poles of the usual oscillation of crisis between consumer demand and rate of return at once—as if the economic cycle had now become a static vicious circle. Thus, it has proved easier for both the administrative state and the global market to offer the mass of people easy credit than to reskill them, or induct them into vocational commitment more likely to result in productive hard work and innovation (Lazzarato 2012). Equally, it is easier to do this than to offer higher wages with an expectation of increase that would encourage family solidarity, time spent by parents with children and a greater sustainability of familial relationships. For to do so would both eat into the easy extraction of surplus value through depressed wages and popular consumption of shoddy goods (Roscoe 2014), and threaten the equality gulf upon which today a new oligarchy rest their sense of prestige and self-recognition (Rothkopf 2008; Mount 2012; Freeland 2013). It would also tend to undermine the foundations of the reigning ideology of ‘meritocratic extremism’ (Piketty 2013), which confuses merit with monetary return and even skill in monetary manipulation with the luck of the draw. Precisely allied to this ideology is the practice of ‘debt-Keynesianism’, which parodies what John Maynard Keynes actually proposed (Clarke 2009; Davidson 2009; Skidelsky 2009). Debt-Keynesianism marks the shift of debt and risk from the public and the private sector to individuals and households (Hacker 2008; Crouch 2009). It was adopted as a novel way to address that fall in demand, which has inevitably ensued upon decades of neo-liberalism. Genuine Keynesianism (however inadequate this may be as a long-term solution) cannot be entertained by those politicians and economists who have embraced austerity (Blyth 2013). That is because increased wages—plus public works and investment and nationalisation of certain key industries and banks—would threaten the new oligarchic hegemony that is political and cultural as well as economic. But at the same time, financialisation is also a riposte to the failure of neo-liberal measures fully to address the falling rates of profit, which prompted them in the first place (Brenner 2006). There remain nevertheless inherent anthropological and theological (if not also economic) limits to financialisation, as we will explore in this paper. And it has in any case engendered a crisis of demand that inhibits any further extraction of surplus value, while the wealthy few have become culturally reluctant to promote real demand that benefits the many. For these reasons, capital has been diverted from productive investment towards financial speculation. Money is still to be made from money by some, and that counts as ‘growth’ in capitalist terms. But this increase is now so further abstracted that nominal growth becomes perfectly compatible with actual material decline in living standards for most people. Of course the debt financing of demand and the debt financing of profit are not simply two separate processes. To the contrary, it is often the expansion of the former that allows the expansion of the latter. In the case of the housing bubbles, unrestricted growth of the mortgage market through the offering of loans to those unlikely to be able to pay them back allows increased private speculation on these debts. It also leads to increased investment in insurance against debt, which in turn fuels increased private speculation upon this financial vehicle (Lanchester 2010). Thus, the extreme bubble cycle of boom and bust that has supplanted the more regular business cycle of expansion and contraction during the trente glorieuses encapsulates the repeated attempt to tackle the meta-crisis of capitalism (Kindleberger 2005; Brenner 2006). The nature of that meta-crisis is best understood in terms of the dialectical oscillation between abstraction through speculation and materialisation through nominalisation, as we will suggest in Sect. 2.",3

By income tax or consumption tax?,September 2015,Masaya Yasuoka,Naohisa Goto,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This study was designed to examine how social security benefits are provided and financed. First, we present an examination of the effect on fertility of a child allowance financed by an income tax or a consumption tax. Second, our analyses suggest an optimal child allowance and an optimal income transfer from younger people to older people. We set an endogenous fertility model with a child allowance and a pay-as-you-go pension system in a closed economy. Some OECD country governments are managing an aging society with a low birth rate, as described by Sleebos (2003). As one example, the total fertility rate in Japan in 2011 was 1.39. Italy and Germany are also coping with a decrease in fertility. France and Sweden provide extensive fiscal support for families with policies that have apparently halted the decrease in fertility. Figure 1 shows a correlation between the total fertility rate and fiscal support for families in some OECD countries. Fertility (below the country) and fiscal support for family (share of gross domestic product). Data: OECD social expenditure database (November 2008), A 2013 declining birthrate white paper (2013), demographic yearbook (UN) and vital statistics in Japan (Ministry of Health, labour and welfare in Japan). Data of fiscal support for families are those of 2009, except for Italy 2007. Fiscal support for family includes benefits in kind (day-care/home help and other benefits in kind) and cash benefits (family allowance, maternity and parental leave, and other cash benefits). Data of the total fertility rate are those of 2011 As Fig. 1 shows, increased fiscal support for families brings about higher fertility than that in countries that do not support families actively.Footnote 1 Considering public social expenditures, those in France and Sweden are higher than in the other countries.Footnote 2 Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, the government expenditure related to family-supportive policies in France and Sweden is at a high level. Social spending for elderly people in Japan is higher than that in either France or Sweden.Footnote 3 In France and Sweden, total government social spending is greater than that in Japan. However, the ratio of social spending for elderly people to total government social spending in France or Sweden is less than that in Japan: the ratio of social spending for young people such as family support to total government social spending in Japan is less than that in either France or Sweden. Social spending for young people should be expanded to include fiscal family support, as shown in the cases of France and Sweden. Sufficient social security benefits demand great fiscal burdens. Although a large amount of fiscal support for families is provided in France and Sweden, the national burden in France and Sweden is much higher than in other countries.Footnote 4 Both the national burden and fiscal support for families in France and Sweden are higher than those in Japan.Footnote 5
 Why must the government restore declining fertility? It must do so because the government is obligated to manage the social security system. Social security systems such as those of health insurance and pension systems must be supported by younger generations. Unless the population of the young generation is sufficiently large, maintaining the social security system will become impossible. Actually, we must consider the following question: Can a child allowance increase fertility? How should a child allowance be financed? How are optimal social spending levels determined for both younger people and older people? Our paper presents an examination of these questions and derives an optimal social spending level and an optimal tax burden. The results derived from our analyses and presented in this paper are as follows. First, a child allowance financed by a consumption tax can always raise fertility, although a child allowance financed by income tax will not always raise fertility. Second, based on how the child allowance is financed, an optimal income transfer from younger people to older people and an optimal child allowance differ between a child allowance financed by an income tax and one financed by a consumption tax. Some economically developed countries use a consumption tax as the means to finance government expenditures. Therefore, the results of our paper should be considered for an aging society in which the government determines the provision of social benefits for younger people and older people. The remainder of this paper is presented as follows. Section 2 introduces the related literature. Section 3 sets the model. Section 4 presents a description of the equilibrium. Section 5 presents derivation of the first best solution, which maximizes social welfare, based on an optimal tax rate and an optimal child allowance to achieve the first best solution. The final section presents conclusions of this study.",3

Austrian scholars, Kirzner (1973) in particular, define entrepreneurship as the individual ability to exploit opportunities, which have been overlooked by others, and obtain profits by acting as an arbitrageur. These approaches identify the capacity to take risks as a fundamental feature of entrepreneurs. If we look at equilibrium theories, in the presence of imperfect contracts or imperfect capital markets (i.e., in environments where perfect diversification is not attainable), the only separating equilibrium is the one in which more risk-loving individuals self-select entrepreneurship. In reality, the technological domain is characterized by uncertainty, because it deals with ambiguous lotteries where the probabilities are unknown. As a result, we might better characterize the entrepreneur as someone who is more willing to face uncertainty (Knight 1921). Nevertheless, the evidence on the risk behavior of entrepreneurs is rather mixed: Although there are success stories and indirect evidence on risk propensities, the typical revolving door that pushes 20–40 % of new businesses off the market in the two years after entry (Bartelsman et al. 2005) suggests that overconfidence and other behavioral biases may be at work (Camerer and Lovallo 1999). Moreover, both push and pull factors play a key role as drivers of entrepreneurship (Santarelli and Vivarelli 2007). In the literature, the behavioral theory of entrepreneurship is also well established as an alternative to rational choice explanations. This alternative approach dates back to Weber and his analyses of the cultural elements behind the decision-making of entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, the behavioral hypothesis has received a recent revival from the emergence of Behavioral Economics, which aims to introduce cognitive psychology into the theory of decision-making (Camerer 1995; Camerer and Loewenstein 2003). In the domain of choice under uncertainty, BE gave rise to Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). According to the latter hypothesis, the risk attitude cannot be characterized as a stable preference trait; in fact, the level of risk aversion is context dependent, and preferences for uncertain outcomes are framed in terms of gains and losses in relation to a reference point. Moreover, recent theoretical contributions propose that individual aspirations (Lopes 1987) may act as a reference point, shaping risk attitudes (Genicot and Ray 2010; Bogliacino and Ortoleva 2013). In this approach, individuals are risk-seeking when their income (or education or wealth) stays below their level of aspirations (i.e., they are willing to face risks to avoid staying below the reference point), and risk-averse when these factors are above it. Aspirations are not expectations: The latter pick out a subset (potentially a singleton) of the possible consequences of actions as a relevant scenario for the decision-maker, and the former define a point whereby consequences of actions are evaluated. In the domain of social psychology, aspirations are dubbed “expectancies” (Gurin and Gurin 1970). They capture the basic intuition of reference dependence as defined in Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1991). Although a considerable empirical literature analyzing the role of behavioral biases in decision-making inside firms and organizations does exist,Footnote 1 to the best of our knowledge we were not able to find an experimental test of the core hypotheses of behavioral theory on entrepreneurs, namely that (a) Prospect Theory applies; (b) aspirations are the reference point. The aim of this article is to perform this experimental analysis. We proceed in various steps. First of all, we measure risk propensity according to a well-established protocol (Cardenas and Carpenter 2013), and then, we conduct two tests. The first assesses whether changing the framing of the choices affects the behavior of the participants. By giving participants a fixed sum and then presenting the lotteries as potential losses from that fixed sum, we change the framing but not the set of options in the task. Our aim is to assess to what extent the framing in terms of losses increases risk propensity [a hypothesis dubbed loss aversion, postulated by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1991)]. The second test performs a direct validation of the independence axiom (Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). In a nutshell, the latter postulates that probability enters linearly into the decision-making, acting as a weight on the streams of utilities. Independence is a basic assumption of Expected Utility Theory, while its violation is an assumption of Prospect Theory, where indeed probabilities are assumed to be weighted. In our second step, we provide a test of ambiguity aversion. We define as ambiguous a lottery where the probabilities are partly or totally unknown, i.e., involving Keynesian or Knightian uncertainty (Frisch and Baron 1988). According to standard rational choice theory, this case should be treated uniformly with the standard risk case, in the sense that individuals can be represented as maximizers under a restricted set of axioms postulating (a) the existence of a utility function and (b) the existence of an individual prior (Savage 1954). Nevertheless, experimental evidence derived from the Ellsberg paradox suggests that this hypothesis should be rejected (Ellsberg 1961; Fellner 1961; Einhorn and Hogarth 1985; Halevy 2007). A typical example of an ambiguity aversion experiment is the following one. Assume that we have an urn with 100 balls, 30 of which are red, while the other 70 are either yellow or black. A participant is offered the possibility of betting on one of the following lotteries: either (A1) drawing a red ball or (A2) drawing a black ball (in both cases, the prize is 1000 tokens). With the same urn, the same participant is asked to bet on one of the following lotteries: (B1) drawing a red or yellow ball and (B2) drawing a black or yellow one (same prize as above). Participants tend to choose (A1) and (B2), and this violates Savage’s Subjective Expected Utility: We cannot find a (subjective) prior able to rationalize the choices above as the maximization of a utility function under that probability distribution. In fact, representing the choices as utility maximization and assuming without loss of generality that \(\;u(0) = 0\) (using the initial of a color to define the event of drawing a ball with that color), choosing (A1) implies \(.3\;u\left( {1000} \right) > P\left( {B |B \cup Y} \right)u(1000)\), while choosing (B2) implies \(.7\;u\left( {1000} \right) > (1 - P\left( {B |B \cup Y} \right))u(1000)\). As a result, \(P\left( {B |B \cup Y} \right)\) should be both strictly greater and strictly lower than .3/.7 which is a contradiction. If entrepreneurs behave according to an Austrian–Knightian–Schumpeterian perspective, we should observe a lack of ambiguity aversion. Step 3 contains another novelty: We manipulate aspirations in the experimental setting by the use of a psychological priming technique, and we test whether risk aversion differs systematically according to the aspiration level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test of the hypothesis that aspirations (or beliefs) may act as a reference point. Finally, we measure the association between experimentally measured risk preferences and behavioral and firm characteristics and we assess to what extent violations of Expected Utility are associated with firm performance. We use regression analysis to identify the effect of the presence of biases on firms’ turnover, after using a standard set of controls. We extracted our sample of 118 entrepreneurs at random from the list of registered firms in the Bucaramanga metropolitan area in the Santander region (Colombia). Attrition is limited compared to the standard rate of response to surveys. As a result, external validity is not rejected for the (formal part of the) economy of the area under study. This article proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 describes our methods, materials and sample. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 offers some concluding remarks.

Commission, 1978, italics added). In ECJ’s decision, dominance is defined as the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of the behaviours of others. However, European competition law does not impose sanctions on the dominant position, per se, but only its abuse.Footnote 1 The Hoffmann-La Roche case delineated abusive conduct as behaviour which, through recourse to methods different from those which condition normal competition in products or services on the basis of the transactions of commercial operators, has the effect of hindering the maintenance of the degree of competition still existing in the market or the growth of that competition (Hoffmann-La Roche v. Commission, 1979, italics added). In the definition of the abuse of a dominant position, the ECJ seems to distinguish between two “kinds” of conduct: on the one hand, conduct based on “normal competition” on the merits (i.e. products and services); on the other hand, conduct with “methods different from normal competition” which can harm the competition of the market.Footnote 2
 The concept of dominance is not (solely) represented by the ability to raise prices, the ability which represents market power in economic textbooks (e.g. measured by Lerner index). Indeed, abusive behaviour consists of a larger inventory of practices than mere price-raising, such as predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, refusal to supply, tying, etc.Footnote 3 This work starts from the fact that it is still difficult to translate into economic terms both the definition of dominant position and the distinction between the use and the abuse of dominant position (cf. on this difficulty see, for instance, Motta 2004: 34). Hence, what does an “appreciable extent independently of” other agents mean in economic terms? Second, how should the distinction between “normal competition” and “methods different” from normal competition be translated into economic terms? To propose the answer to these questions, the work uses a simple game-theory framework to reappraise the ordoliberal thought which made a similar distinction between performance and impediment competition. The choice to use the study of ordoliberalismFootnote 4 to understand the meaning of dominance and its abuse is motivated by the fact that some commentators argue that European competition law, and in particular the norms on dominant position, derives from ordoliberal thought (Gerber 1998).Footnote 5 Indeed, the concept of the abuse of a dominant position does not stem from US antitrust law, and is quite different from the US formulation of market power, which is based on the notions of “monopolization and attempted monopolization” as stated by §2 of the Sherman Act.Footnote 6 This difference is not only a matter of terminology. In US practice, the question of whether a behaviour is proper or not does not depend on the position that the firm occupies in the market; that is, anticompetitive conduct does not stem from the status of the firm (in theory, at least); in Europe, on the contrary, some modes of conduct that are legal when pursued by non-dominant firms are no longer legal when employed by dominant firms (see, among others, Vickers 2005). In particular, the ECJ states that the dominant position has some sort of special responsibility; i.e. the dominant firm has to abstain from “abusive” behaviours, even if these behaviours may be permissible for its competitors. For ordoliberals, competition is the instrument used to dethrone economic power and the state has to take active measures to foster competition and to frustrate abusive conducts. Otherwise, power in the market will not only subvert the advantages offered by the market economy, but will also possibly undermine democracy itself, since strong economic power can be transformed into political power (see Sect. 5 below and also Vatiero 2010a). The ordoliberal perspective emphasizes the dangers economic power poses not only to efficiency and consumer welfare but also to democracy: “The goal of ordoliberal competition is the preservation of a free society” (Maier-Rigaud 2012: 136). Hence, to safeguard competition in particular and democracy in general, ordoliberals advanced the idea of the as-if competition. This paper will try to illustrate this notion in a (more) modern fashion and to offer a more comprehensive concept of dominance. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the notion of ordoliberal competition; in Sects. 3 and 4, I propose a game-theoretical illustration of dominant position and its abuse using the ordoliberal distinction between performance and impediment competition; Sect. 5 investigates the main differences between the as-if test and other current tests on dominance; Sect. 6 discusses some examples; and, finally, Sect. 7 outlines our findings and advances a research agenda.",7

Beja Jr.,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The usual view is that parenthood leads to happiness. Yet, interestingly, empirical analyses often find no evidence of a positive relationship between parenthood and happiness (see, e.g., Glenn and McLanahan 1982; Kohler et al. 2005; Margolis and Myrskyla 2011; Stanca 2012; Andersson et al. 2014; Deaton and Stone 2014).Footnote 1 Such a description stands out against robust evidence that parenthood leads to a life with meaning and purpose (see, e.g., Baumeister 1991; Marks and Fleming 1999; Nelson et al. 2013) and that being married or living as married leads to greater happiness (see, e.g., Stack and Eshleman 1998; Diener et al. 2000; Stutzer and Frey 2006).
 In this paper, I reevaluate the relationship between parenthood and happiness. What I find is evidence of positive direct and negative indirect impacts of parenthood on happiness and that the latter reduces the former by a significant amount. This finding implies that a conflation of these different effects results in an unfavorable evaluation of parenthood. Public policy can help make a positive evaluation of parenthood possible by reinforcing the intrinsic meaning of parenthood and reducing the adverse impact of parenthood on the life domains. The rest of the paper has the following structure. Section 2 discusses the methodology of the paper. Section 3 presents the results. In the last section, I outline the policy implications of the findings.",9

In the decade preceding the crisis, cumulative inflation rates in the countries which had lost market access by 2012 or were at the brink of doing so (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy) were 10 to 15 % points higher than in Germany. A similar relative inflation performance had already been observed in previous decades. This has led some observers to attribute the recently observed divergences in inflation rates to differences in a stability culture between northern and southern countries of the euro area (see for instance Greenspan 2011, quoted in Bützer et al. 2013). In fact, the view that European countries differ in their attitudes toward inflation and unemployment had already surfaced long before the introduction of the Euro. Karl Otto Pöhl, former president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, argued in 1973 that  [...] France does not follow the same economic objectives as Germany. The French are way more concerned about expanding their economy, Germany far more about the fight against inflation.Footnote 1
 Our paper investigates differences in stability preferences between 15 European countries over the period from 1973 to 2013. Following the approach introduced by Di Tella et al. (2001), Di Tella et al. (2003), we measure a country’s stability culture by estimating the costs in terms of individual life satisfaction associated with inflation relative to those associated with unemployment. This ratio is negatively related to inflation rates in the positive theory of inflation (e.g., Barro and Gordon 1983; Alesina et al. 1992). Our analysis indicates significant cross-country differences in preferences over inflation and unemployment. They partly correspond to the supposed differences between core and peripheral countries of the euro area. Relative inflation aversion is comparably small in most countries which were characterized by above-average inflation rates in the decade preceding the crisis, in particular Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. At the other end of the spectrum, we find that Denmark and Sweden have the highest degrees of relative inflation aversion. Germany, often assumed to have a particularly strong stability culture, ranges in the midfield. This result is mainly due to the relatively high degree of absolute unemployment aversion in Germany, which counterbalances the high level of absolute inflation aversion. Previous research by Di Tella et al. (2001), Di Tella et al. (2003), Wolfers (2003), Gandelman and Hernández-Murillo (2009), Welsch (2007, 2011) and Blanchflower et al. (2014) studies the trade-off between inflation and unemployment with similar data, but does not report country-specific estimates.Footnote 2 Becchetti et al. (2010) present evidence that country-specific preferences regarding the trade-off between unemployment and inflation could be due to different age structures of the population or different degrees of employment protection. Collins and Giavazzi (1992) estimate country-specific rates of substitution between inflation and unemployment for the time before 1990, based on individual perceptions and expectations of the general state of the economy, inflation and unemployment rather than life satisfaction. Neuenkirch (2014) provides evidence that the importance that people attach to the political goal of fighting inflation is indeed reflected in interest rates set by central banks. Our paper also relates to the work on the effect of culture on economic outcomes. For instance, Bützer et al. (2013) analyze whether cultural preferences or values can explain observed differences in macroeconomic variables between the core and peripheral countries of the euro area.",

However, global imbalances, emerging countries’ current account surpluses and the US twin deficits, as well as the financial turmoil of recent years supported varying beliefs and understandings of SWFs.Footnote 1 The change in perception of these government-owned investment vehicles, which are managed separately from official reserves, and the adjustment of the public opinion about this phenomenon are remarkable. Not so long ago, SWFs were seen as one of the vicious instruments of state-owned capitalism, but in times of financial crisis and global depression, they became “white knights” for cash-strapped companies or countries and attractive buyers of last resort (Couturier et al. 2009). Presently, SWFs are interpreted as a symbol of a shift in global power. This again raises questions about the possible abuse of markets and fears that SWFs will be used for political and strategic purposes (Hassan 2009). At the early stages, the most meaningful arguments for justification of these concerns were the lack of transparency and the opaque nature of most funds. As a result, fear and doubt materialized in protectionist actions against this important class of financial market participants and their investments. 
Gilson and Milhaupt (2008) argue that SWFs have to give up their shareholder voting rights to avoid the influence of their strategic behavior on governance of firms they hold. Two prominent examples of the protectionist practice against SWFs’ investments are the Dubai Ports World and Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) controversiesFootnote 2 and the failed bid for Unocal by the government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in 2005. On the one hand, these incidents led to the establishment of institutions like the International Working Group (IWG) on SWFs and to the attempt to develop some rules for both SWF-hosting (“Santiago Principles”) (International Working Group on Sovereign Wealth Funds 2008)
 and investment-recipient countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2008). On the other hand, they motivated concerns about the legitimacy of SWFs and their governance (Monk 2009). Indices, like the Linaburg–Maduell Transparency Index (SWF Institute) or the Truman’s scoreboard for SWFs (Truman 2008), were developed to measure transparency and governance of SWFs. Both include the involvement of external managers as a point that delivers positive scores for a SWF and makes it less opaque. The academic literature emphasizes the outsourcing of the management of SWFs as a way to signal the commercial nature of their investments (Rozanov 2009). The practice shows that more and more SWFs allocate some of their funds to external managers or pool resources with private funds. According to Rozanov (2009), the outsourcing of SWFs’ management and thus the compliance with the “Santiago Principles” increases transparency of a particular SWF and eliminates concerns about strategic behavior. In turn, this improves investment possibilities and results in higher returns. These logical implications seem to give an answer to the important question: Why do politicians give away some decision-making power and delegate policy tasks to an independent external manager? I use a simple model to describe the incentives which underlie the politician’s decision to delegate the management of a SWF. A simple cost–benefit analysis of the delegation from the office-holding politician’s perspective forms the basis of the theoretical framework. I formalize the motives for delegation. The first is the increase in SWF’s expected return due to the management outsourcing and improved portfolio diversification options. This represents the innovative building block of the model. The second is the possibility for the politician to make use of the prevailing status quo and depends on the quality of existing institutions. Additionally, I introduce two disciplining mechanisms for the politician under alternative management regimes—elections and separation of powers (Persson et al. 1997). The role of elections as a mechanism which controls the officeholder and helps achieve accountability of elected politicians is analyzed in theoretical works by Barro (1973), Ferejohn (1986) as well as Persson et al. (1997) and Berganza (2000). In models following the Barro–Ferejohn tradition, politicians are identical and thus voters are ex post indifferent about which candidate to vote for. In this case, the reelection motive controls moral hazard on the side of the incumbent inducing him to act on behalf of voters’ interests. Modeling policy tasks delegation combines components used by Eggertsson and Le Borgne (2007) and Alesina and Tabellini (2007). The delegation decision made by the politician trades off the costs of losing decision-making power and having an incompetent manager against the benefits from transparency effects and the possibility to mitigate the threat of being replaced by forcing the manager to exert additional effort. The idea of the paper is also related to the study of Fedele and Mantovani (2008) discussing the use of delegation as an indirect mechanism to reduce information asymmetries. The authors model a moral hazard problem between a bank and a firm and show how delegating the hidden task to a third agent can act as a commitment to exert high effort and mitigate moral hazard. The fact that delegation reduces information asymmetry also plays a central role in the analysis presented in this paper. I find that the increase in SWF’s investment possibilities as a consequence of management outsourcing and higher transparency improves expected output. Moreover, the conflict of interests between the politician and the manager with agenda-setting power disciplines both policy-makers and results in an equilibrium with higher expected output. However, the politician’s delegation motivation is strongly linked to his competence level. Incumbents with lower competence are basically more prone to delegate the management of the SWF. Another interesting finding is that delegation occurs if existing political and economic institutions are extractive which allows the incumbent to get nonzero status quo rents in case of delegation. Higher private benefits from the political office and a higher discount factor deliver incentives for the politician to delegate the policy task in order to get a reelection chance even if he loses some decision-making freedom. Thus, the paper combines well-elaborated theoretical components with some aspects characterizing SWFs. This allows a suitable application of the policy task delegation theory to highly discussed SWFs. The intention of the paper is to stimulate interest in the management outsourcing issues in SWFs and to deliver some formal arguments and explanatory statements that will facilitate further academic debate and provide policy decision-makers with helpful background. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes the politician as a manager of a SWF and the output generated under this regime. Section 4 characterizes the output of a SWF produced with an external manager. Section 5 compares both regimes and derives the conditions under which delegation takes place. Section 6 concludes. The “Appendix” contains technical details.",

This is striking because he appeals to it so frequently in The Theory of Moral Sentiments—along with other terms for the divine: Director of nature, Author of nature, Author of our nature, etc., from which it is clear that nature overall is providentially ordered—and in contexts sufficiently similar to some in the Wealth of Nations. Thus, the “invisible hand” in The Theory of Moral Sentiments is the hand of Providence (Smith 1976a: IV.I.10). We can speculate on the reason for the difference—my own opinion is that he was seeking a sober, “scientific” presentation in the later work on which the appearance of Providence would have jarred—but there is no way of knowing. We are, I think, on stronger ground in taking it that he continued to see Providence at work in the human world: that is, the invisible hand of the Wealth of Nations is also the hand of Providence, and the “natural course of things” is laid down by the Author of nature. We are on stronger ground here for a number of reasons. First, the place of Providence is not modified in the successive editions of The Theory of Moral Sentiments published before and after 1776.Footnote 1 Second, many arguments in the Wealth of Nations sound very much like the providential arguments of The Theory of Moral Sentiments: for example, the role of the propensity to exchange; the foolishness of the nobility in the late middle ages; and, of course, the invisible hand itself (Smith 1976b: I.ii; III.iv.10; IV.ii.9). Third, nature, as an organizing force producing harmony and prosperity, is present throughout the Wealth of Nations: in the propensity to exchange; “the obvious and simple system of natural liberty”; and, perhaps above all, in “the natural course of things” (Smith 1976b: I.ii.1; IV.ix.51; e.g., I.x.a.1, I.xi.m.9). All that is missing is the explicit ascription to nature of a providential design. Providence pervades the Wealth of Nations in all but name. The market, realizing itself through the pursuit of individual self-interest in the endless repetition of the system of exchange relations allied with the division of labor, is a natural and so providential order. Smith’s commitment to arguments from Providence was distinctly old-fashioned in his own time. Hume, Steuart, and Ferguson, for example, do not make such arguments. But the argument of the Wealth of Nations was the future of the great science of economics. The primary claim of this science, set forward by Smith, is that the naturally self-equilibrating market is beyond human knowledge and agency: “no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient” to comprehend or direct its course (Smith 1976b: IV.ix.51). Smith thus establishes a necessary theological basis for economics that can be understood through Mircea Eliade’s account of the “archaic ontology” of eternal recurrence. In this ontology, first, order is beyond human knowledge and agency; second, it realizes itself through the eternal recurrence of archetypal agents and acts; third, in its realization it abolishes history (Eliade 1965: 3–6). In regard to Smith, two things are to be noted. First, the archaic ontology is only barely “secularized”: that is, Smith himself seems to think that the order of the market is providential and divine.Footnote 2 Second, the order is beyond human knowledge or agency and realizes itself through the endless repetition of the archetypal act of exchange. In this, it effects an escape from politics: the automatic order of the market largely dispenses with external political requirements. Government is reduced to administration.Footnote 3 But however important the escape from politics may be, Smith cannot see his way to abolishing history. He does not think that the order (providential as it is) can guarantee everlasting prosperity (Smith 1976b: II.v.22; III.iv.20; I.viii.43, I.ix.14, 15). There is, then, a contradiction between the providential perfection of the order and its ultimate tendency toward dissolution. For these reasons, I will characterize Smith’s view as a primitive
theology of economics. Smith’s view stands in contrast to modern mainstream economics in its developed neoclassical form, which may see itself as an advance insofar as it can claim to have abolished history along with politics. It can do so by the double reduction of all to the single, isolated individual, and to a quantitative formulation in which everything can be measured on a single quantitative scale. This is much more than a ploy to guarantee the dominance of quantitative models. The single, isolated individual conceived as eternal and unchanging in nature is the necessary entity of the economic order from which the quantitative formulation follows. All individuals, in all times and places, adhere to the same logic of choice. Lionel Robbins’s celebrated definition of economics already makes this clear, later rational choice accounts only formalize the idea more fully (Robbins 1935: 16; Becker 1976a). All choices can be aggregated, just as all individuals can be aggregated: this is taken for granted with easy nonchalance in the textbooks today.Footnote 4 But the principle that the whole is nothing more than the sum of individuals and their choices is already enunciated by Bentham (1988: 3).Footnote 5 Its implications are most fully developed by J.B. Clark, who says, first, that “measurements of utility are never made by any other than a single independent being,” and that Society as “one great isolated being” is such, just as is Robinson Crusoe on his island (Clark 1967: 81). Second, the individual human being is the atomic unit of society, and, “like the monad of Leibniz,” is a perfect microcosm, “a mirror of the universe” (Clark 1967: 90). Society is an individual, and the individual is society in miniature. No gap in aggregation is possible. This singular structure has a curious modus operandi: an automatic process leads to the best result, yet the result is instantaneous, occurring without the passage of time. In the primary and defining case, a limited mass of natural resources is allocated among an unlimited mass of human wants. The resources, having been parceled out as original endowments of individuals, are allocated through exchange so as to satisfy wants (maximize utility) to the greatest possible extent. Edgeworth’s (1881) pure exchange model is the paradigmatic example.Footnote 6 The mechanism of the market is so perfect that time and history are of no significance—it will bring about the maximizing result. In the lapidary assertion of Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian: “Technology changes. Economic laws do not” (Shapiro and Varian 1999: 2). Politics is reduced to the economic order, simply added to the circular flow diagram as another agent making choices according to the same maximizing logic as the others.Footnote 7 This static model, far from being a limitation, is the necessary embodiment of market order. In contrast to Smith, with whom the plural is still all too evident, politics and history can be eliminated through the singularity of the order: it is all one thing. In neoclassical economics division of labor is eliminated as a necessary element of economic theory.Footnote 8
 Neoclassical economics—most notably in the model of general equilibrium—gives an exhaustive quantitative representation of the market order. It nonetheless leaves intact the primary claim that the market is beyond human knowledge or agency: for all its precision, the model shows that not we, but the market, knows best. We must recognize the oddness of this. No one makes such a claim for the family or the state, for example, or any other field of human endeavor. Nor is it the kind of claim made by science. Scientists will always acknowledge that there are things that they do not know, but not that the central element of their particular study is in principle unknowable. There is, of course, a place where just such claims are made and that is in the realm of theology (and this is why it made sense to invoke the theological in regard to Smith). The economic order is supposed to function entirely through immanent laws, usually treated as in some way natural (as is suggested by the assertion of Shapiro and Varian); and neoclassical economics claims the status of value-free positive science. But the demand is immediately put in question by the character of the result of the process as the best possible. For this strongly suggests some agency outside of the order itself, and the continued appeal to the image of the invisible hand—both by economists and by lay defenders of the market order—reinforces the suggestion. The continued assertion of the primary claim, with its theological aura, is thus explained. Neoclassical economics secretly retains the role of the providential that was only barely veiled in the Wealth of Nations. The providential (or theological) element cannot be admitted explicitly, but it must remain: science, it seems, is not quite enough. Belief—and belief in a mystery—is needed also. The uneasy cohabitation of science and theology in neoclassical economics is an indication of its ideological character.Footnote 9 The entangling of theological and scientific permits an elision of the positive and the normative in which each can either support or hide behind the other as need arises. The market as best is demonstrated by the impenetrable “scientific” complexity of the model’s apparatus, while the austerity of quantitative technique is humanized by the claim for social welfare. The instantaneity of the process avoids challenge just because we know that the result is the best possible—we know, that is, that we are not meant to plumb the mystery, and must not seek to, lest we share the shame of doubting Thomas.Footnote 10 Instantaneity also supports the necessary claim that the entire order is the result of autonomous individual choices—choices by independent individuals with no necessary relation to one another—and that all these choices are embodied in exchange.Footnote 11 Since the primary case, the paradigm for all others, has no production, production can be treated as derivative. No account of an articulated process of production and exchange permitting the reproduction of the system as a whole has to be given.Footnote 12 Here again we see why the division of labor must be eliminated as a necessary theoretical category, both because it imposes a necessary structure on the economy; and because it creates necessary social relations of production according to which society is divided into classes. For it follows that the sum of individual and random exchanges motivated by the sum of subjectively autonomous individual choices cannot possibly generate the economic order.Footnote 13 Marx makes a similar critique of those whom he names the “vulgar economists” (Marx 1977: 174, fn. 34; 732–3; 1002–3). This ideological formation rests on two theoretical displacements. First, needs are displaced by wants. Each individual begins with an initial endowment and can simply remain with it. Exchange is the central mechanism of the system, but it is never necessary.Footnote 14 The naturally unlimited character of wants follows from this. There is no necessary minimum, but individuals always want more. Scarcity then guarantees a maximizing result. The ideological character of the elimination of need is particularly apparent in regard to the supply of labor: like any other suppliers, suppliers of labor do not need to supply it. Second, history is displaced by nature. The same unchanging economic laws lie behind all differences and all historical change. This does create an odd ambiguity: on the one hand, the same thing is always happening in all societies across history; there is nothing distinctive about the modern, and certainly nothing distinctive about capitalism. On the other hand, the free market clearly is the best, most natural, order, and earlier societies “irrationally” obstruct it. Marx has a lot of fun with this: “The economists have a singular way of proceeding. For them, there are only two kinds of institutions, artificial and natural. The institutions of feudalism are artificial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions. … Thus there has been history, but there is no longer any” (Marx 1977: 175, fn. 35). But the ambiguity seems of little concern to economists. Neoclassical economics does recognize some real and historically determined features of the capitalist economy, albeit in mystified form, hypostatized as natural and unchanging. Unlimited wants are a proxy for the goal of unlimited accumulation. While “the egoistic bourgeois isolated artificially by capitalism … [with] an isolated individual consciousness à la Robinson Crusoe” (Lukács 1971: 135) becomes the model for human nature. It celebrates the market, even recognizing it as capitalist, while also masking its specifically capitalist characteristics—and this is the point of finding nothing historically distinctive in capitalism. The ideological character of the theory makes it not only pseudo-science but also pseudo-theology. The failure of neoclassical economics both as science and as theology is preordained by the true
theology of Marx. I say “true” here because Marx identifies the order of the capitalist mode of production with that of religion. Human beings project ideas and purposes into the world, forming social relations and a human world of use things, but these ideas and purposes return as objective structures of domination (Marx 1977: 165, Marx and Engels 1975: 331). Theology and capitalism are the products of human agency; they are true because the objective structures are real. But because this reality is human, its laws can be broken and negated (Adorno 1973: 355). Capital in the person of the capitalist, Marx (1977: 739) says, “ruthlessly forces the human race to produce for production’s sake”. But the goal is not the production of use-values; nor even of value; but the production of surplus-value, the substance and subject of unlimited accumulation (Marx 1977: 1037). This is the goal proclaimed by the “‘strange God’ … as the ultimate and the sole purpose of mankind” (Marx 1977: 918). The unlimited accumulation of capital occurs through an endlessly repeated cycle that changes only by continually expanding. The vast volume and enormous variety of useful things created by the uniquely productive power of capital exist only to serve as bearers of value, homogeneous and immaterial, while individuals exist only to serve as bearers of the necessary functions of capital through which surplus-value is produced: capitalists and enterprises as personifications of their capital; those employed by them as bearers of homogeneous human productive activity. Archetypal repetition reappears. Individuals are only given meaning as atoms in an endlessly repeated process. But the archaic archetypes, acts and actors, had real content. Heroes and gods have their own characters, they do specific things, and these give meaning in later times to ordinary individuals and their actions. The capitalist “archetype”, however, empties all individuals, all acts, and the system itself, of content. Nothing is real, nothing has meaning except in the purely formal and quantitative dimension of surplus-value. Unlimited accumulation of capital is the primary social instance of what Hegel calls a bad infinity: the formless and indeterminate infinity that is nothing but the possibility of always adding one more (Hegel 1975: 137–8). The infinity is both of endless repetition and of increasing quantity through accumulation. It brings out another contrast with the archaic. In the archaic eternal recurrence the point is what recurs and its archetypal meaning. With accumulation, the only point is the recurrence itself, devoid of all meaning. No other goal exists than to continue accumulation (Marx 1977: 254). It might seem, then, that another contrast with the archaic is that whereas the archaic order is backward looking, accumulation looks forward, constantly moving into a new future. But this is not so. Looking backward is something that they share. Accumulation also seeks to put a stop to history and to time. The claim of capital to be forward looking lies in unparalleled technological innovation, unimaginable before. But in spite of the possibilities for a just and humane society thereby opened, the only real purpose of all this extraordinary change and innovation, with all its intelligence and skill, is the maintenance of the established exploitative order. (In this way, the assertion of Shapiro and Varian quoted above is accurate at least as a description of the capitalist mode of production). The only significant change is that capital becomes more adequate to its concept. Change is the progressive loss of substantial content or meaning as the concept works to reduce the concrete heterogeneity of the world to identity with itself (Adorno 1973). With accumulation, as with the archaic order, it is the first event that is repeated. However inadequate the neoclassical attempt to eliminate time and history, it does point to a real aim of capital, though one realized very differently than the general equilibrium model. The capitalists impose the passage of time on workers, making them give up their lives to the production of surplus-value through alienated labor. It is true that the capitalists also will age and die, but not overly fanciful to suggest that in accumulation they store time, and store it for themselves. Just as they make alienation their own property (Marx and Engels 1975: 36), so the endless temporal cycle of accumulation is their own. Capital lays claim to a standing outside of time, or, rather, to being the absolute concept within time as eternal that regulates all else by subjecting it to the passage of time. The corporation, capital personifying itself as potentially immortal, gives a new and concrete reality to this concept. Capital is as ruthless to the capitalists as it is to the laborers: it alone survives. But the capitalists, personifications of capital, are truly selfless, they are “truly [themselves] only, and precisely, insofar as [they] cease to be so” (Eliade 1965: 34). What they give themselves up to, however, is meaningless, the bad infinity can have no other content than its own empty repetition. If what Adorno says of the absolute idealists can more or less be said of the capitalists, it hardly has the same stature in this application: “They glorify time as timeless, history as eternal—all for fear that history might begin” (Adorno 1973: 332). This fear gives the full measure of the emptiness, the triviality of capital behind its vast, self-important and world-spanning apparatus, in showing just how far the capitalists are willing to go in order to prevent history—a truly human history—from beginning. Marx’s true theology reveals the capitalist mode of production as a system of domination operating through objective, seemingly natural, laws that are in reality social relations and products that develop through the objectification of human purposes. It not only accounts for the ideological character of mainstream economics, including the neoclassical version, but also shows the ground of its mystifications in the commodity form, and the appearance of formal freedom and equality. Oddly, however, neoclassical economics, in the ideal model of perfect competition, comes remarkably close to unmasking the structures of domination that it works so hard to conceal. For in this model, individuals have absolutely no control over the conditions they face and can never do other than the one thing that these conditions dictate to them: the freedom that individuals are supposed to have in perfect competition is the negation of freedom (Urquhart 2012).Footnote 15

His revolutionary political economy developed in part through his critical appropriation of the philosophy of humanity found in the thought of Plato and more so of Aristotle. In order to comprehensively understand Marx’s idea of revolutionary communism, we must recognize the philosophy of humanity at the core of his humanism, and we must therefore acquaint ourselves with the tradition that his anthropological philosophy is rooted in. However, it would of course be ridiculous to pay no attention to the intellectual climate that Marx’s thought actually developed in, and it is plain that his humanism was profoundly shaped by his exposure to the radical criticism of religion and theology by the Young Hegelians.Footnote 1 It is also essential to recognize that his schooling in the anthropological and ontological philosophies of ancient Hellenic thought provided a philosophical foundation for his critical engagement with the Young Hegelians. Aside from these mostly theoretical pursuits, of course, Marx’s humanism was influenced by his own revolutionary activity. His humanism was atheistic insofar as there is no belief in an otherworldly, divine being.Footnote 2 Rather than believing in such a “divinity,” Marx directed his attention to the human being and our “essential powers” (1964, 142) with a concern for the realization of true human freedom.Footnote 3 Even though he was fundamentally interested in political theory in its classical sense, he did not simply ignore debates concerning theology. As a humanist, Marx thought that the purpose was not unity with “God” but rather a truly good life as corporeal, human beings. This universal “end” or “purpose” of human life is then considered to be the hidden truth behind our misleading religious strivings. This humanist perspective on religion and theology was deeply influenced by his exposure to the philosophy of humanity in the thought of Plato and Aristotle. This is in part because of how they conceived of the human being in relation to “divinity.” As we shall see, the anthropological philosophy that he critically appropriated from themFootnote 4 is essential for his revolutionary communist, humanist “atheism.” Once we are acquainted with this philosophy of humanity, it will become apparent that we cannot simply call Marx an “atheist” in the current context of contemporary thought because of the very specific connotations associated with atheism today.Footnote 5 Unlike twenty-first century atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and the like, Marx did not endorse atheism as a doctrine to battle against religious beliefs. Rather than the absolutely negative and, in some instances, ironically dogmatic approach of contemporary atheists like Dawkins, Marx believed that religious beliefs and theological conceptions of the divine and humanity would be sublated—in theory and in practice—along with the revolutionary movement of the working class. His revolutionary communism is atheistic and humanist in this sense because it developed alongside a form of criticism enacted not as an absolute antithesis to religious belief but rather as a philosophical component of a revolutionary social movement rooted in the definite sociohistorical life activity that he experienced. Put simply, his belief that communism was the Aufheben of religion means that there is no absolute need for a doctrine of atheism because if humanity actualizes its potential for freedom, religious, and theological conceptions of “divinity” would have no basis to exist from the outset. Thus, rather than displacing the question of “divinity” entirely, Marx attempted to find the rational kernel within the mystical shell of the concept of the “divine” as it is present in theological and religious belief. This, for him, was necessary in order to critically appropriate its relevant truth content. He came to recognize religion and belief in the “divine” as a particular form of human self-estrangement. Marx’s concept of estrangement is not only related to his atheistic humanism but is also an essential philosophical component of his revolutionary political economy. He believed that the human species is developing historically
through self-estrangement
Footnote 6 which leads to—as both the outcome and overcoming of our estrangement—the actualization of our human “species being” (1964, 122) in the life activity of communist society. We see a tension in the way Plato and Aristotle theorize the relationship between humanity and the divineFootnote 7 which ultimately has radical humanist implications. It is thus especially interesting to notice that their idea of the “divine” is often best articulated in relation to humanity. G.M.A. Grube wrote that “the adjective divine (θεĩος)…could be applied to anything greater and more lasting than man” (1935, 150), and that “the use of the word theos and its plural [is used] to indicate whatever there be in nature beyond and above humanity” (ibid., 156). The divine is thus a “more than human world” (ibid., 159) and yet it is humanity—and not the animals or rocks or any other creature in nature—that is closest to the divine world. Furthermore, Grube states that the “divine has two aspects: the static and dynamic. God may be looked upon as the ultimate reality, the highest form of being the eternal absolute. We also speak of God as the creator, the first link in the chain not of existence but of causation, the maker, an active force causing movement and life” (ibid., 151). Interestingly, it “was Plato’s belief from first to last” that “there were some kind of higher forces which worked for good” (ibid., 156), and thus the concept of “divinity” is also associated with a true good.Footnote 8
 Going well beyond the kind of humanist implications found in the thought of Plato and Aristotle, Marx’s “historical materialist” humanism led him to theorize what he calls the “universally developed individuals” (1973, 162) of communism who have actualized the human “species being.” From the outset it is clear that in Marx’s thought there is no “otherworldly” divinity. In an ideal society we would enjoy the “divine” or universal beautyFootnote 9 that we have consciously objectified in our social relations and in the communicative content of these relations. This is the experience of a true “good” which is an ontological idea that Marx critically appropriates from both Plato’s and Aristotle’s conception of the “good” for humanity. For Plato this is the direct contemplation of divine beauty as disembodied souls, and for Aristotle this is the “activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue” (1998a, 24) which defines a eudaimonic life. For Aristotle this requires the practice of the virtue of “justice” which is the practice of “complete virtue” (ibid., 108) in relation to others generally. Marx appropriates this as well in his conception of the social relations of communist society, in which the ethical component is essential for a truly good and flourishing life. This is because communism is predicated on and also facilitates the development of what Marx calls the “rich human being” whose “rich human need” also necessarily includes “the need of the greatest wealth—the other human being” (1964, 144). In sustained relations that are intimate enough, this relation embodies Aristotle’s idea of true “friendship,” i.e., mutual recognition between individuals alike in developed virtue, wherein the joy of the other is the joy of oneself, and the relationship is treated as an end-in-itself. A kind of 'divine love' in this sense holds communist society together—“divine” because of its true mutuality, giving it the character of infinite life, as well as being the highest kind of life possible for realization. The character of our social relations make our society essentially what it is; broadly, this society would require “justice” in Aristotle’s sense in order to flourish because everyone is provided with what they need for a truly good, fulfilling life. Ultimately, this universal ethical value would be actualized in all of our relationships.",

K. Safar-Aly,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Although frequently referred to as ‘Islamic law,’ the Shariah incorporates a far larger scope than what one may consider as typically falling within the common understanding of a legal system. It is comprised of a collection of theology, values, norms, rules and either mandatory or encouraged etiquette, meant to establish and maintain life in this world in balance with the realities that exist beyond the temporal order.Footnote 1 Consequently, it is intrinsically linked to a deeply embedded consciousness of eschatological and spiritual considerations and implications.Footnote 2 What is considered as the Shariah is indeed home to a vast collections of rules and legal principles pertaining to many subject matters, from business and finance, to environmental considerations and personal hygiene, as well as of course the interconnected matters relating to the spiritual well-being of the soul. This understanding of ‘law’ appears to be somewhat different from what is often understood by the term ‘Canon Law’ in catholicism, albeit its already self-evident linguistic divergence and constraints in the English form of the term, when compared to the original Latin—ius canonicum.Footnote 3 ‘Canon Law’ has been described as governing the ‘external order of the church, [and] the public life of the community of faith’ (Cordien 2004) [emphasis added], and ‘almost pertains exclusively to the “external forum,” the arena of the church’s public governance, as over against the “internal forum,” the arena of conscience’ (Cordien 2004). It has been advanced that ‘theology’ is a closely–related but ‘distinct’ (Cordien 2004) discipline within the Roman Catholic tradition, being primarily concerned with revelation and Church teachings, while not attempting to ‘measure or compel personal conscience or moral judgments’ (Cordien 2004). However, given that the fundamental object in both Catholic ‘theology’ and ‘Canon Law’ remain principally concerned with the ‘life of the mystical Christ on earth’ (Örsy 1965), they are indeed both parts of a somewhat indivisible understanding. Consequently, what could be understood as falling within the ambit of both ‘theology’ and ‘Canon Law’ is not too dissimilar to what could be considered as falling under the scope of the Shariah.Footnote 4
 The primary sources of the Shariah are first and foremost the Qur’an, followed shortly thereafter by the Sunnah. The Qur’an is believed by Muslims to be actual words of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad across his 23-year prophetic mission (Kamali 2003). The Sunnah (lit. ‘custom’), the written record of which is termed ‘ḥadīth,’ are the acts and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad which include actions that have been either approved, disapproved or recommended, along with reports that describe his behavior and character (Nyazee 2004). Applying methods of hermeneutics and logical and legal reasoning (a discipline termed in Arabic, uṣūl al-fiqh) (Jackson 1996)Footnote 5 to the texts of the Qur’an and the Sunnah, Muslim jurists across time have derived and continue to derive detailed practical rules in the form of jurisprudence (known in Arabic as fiqh) from the sources of the Shariah (Ali 2009).Footnote 6
 There are of course many aspects to the deep and extensive world of Islamic jurisprudence. However, on the most macroscopic scale, Islamic jurisprudence and law are arguably principally divided into two main categories: (a) those relating to the worship of God (ʿibādāt) and (b) those relating to interactions between and amongst humans and the balance of creation (muʿāmalāt) (Moghul and Ahmed 2003).Footnote 7 This categorization mirrors the dual nature of humans, as understood within Islam, as beings having both temporal and transcendental components. Generally speaking, different rules govern the derivation and application of law in ʿibādāt and muʿāmalāt (Zysow 2013; Kamali 2001).Footnote 8 That being said, as shall become apparent, acts and rules focusing on purely worldly transactions are indeed intrinsically linked and embedded to acts relating to the devotion of God, including the world of commercial transactions, in an interplay between the temporal and transcendental—a platform that the Muslim will have to inevitably circumnavigate. The ‘objectives’ of the Shariah are known in Arabic and classical Islamic literature as the maqāṣid al-Sharīʿah (Kamali 1999). These objectives further a holistic ‘integrated code of life’ that encompasses all aspects of living (Dusuki and Abdullah 2007). The great classical Persian Islamic scholar, jurist, theologian and philosopher, Imam al-Ghazālī (d. 1111 CE) defined the objectives of the Shariah as  promoting the well-being of all humanity in relation to safeguarding: (a) faith (dīn); (b) human life/souls (nafs); (c) intellect and/or reason (ʿaql); (d) family or progeny (nasl); and (e) wealth (māl) (al-Ghazālī 1904; Kamali 2008). Actions and policies within the Shariah framework must be in furtherance of the protection of the aforementioned objectives, and work towards what is classically referred to as the ‘common good’ (maṣlaḥah) of the Shariah (al-Raysuni 2005).Footnote 9 Imam al-Ghazālī defines the concept of maṣlaḥah as protecting the objectives listed above in order to attain the welfare of human beings (al-Ghazālī n.d). The medieval Andalusian Islamic jurist al-Shāṭibī (d. 1388 CE) similarly defines the concept of maṣlaḥah as one that concerns the protection of human life and one’s livelihood (Hallaq 2004). Consequently, in turning to the focus of one’s livelihood and wealth (māl), the Qur’an, as well as recorded sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (ḥadīth), may provide guidance in terms of the Islamic approach to the profit incentive and the procurement of capital.",2

63,2,International Review of Economics,02 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-015-0238-8,Insularity and economic development: a survey,June 2016,Manuela Deidda,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"While a wide strand of theoretical and empirical contributes investigate the existence and the reason of development gaps between different countries or regions, the effect of insularity on economic development remains a relatively unexplored area in both theoretical and empirical research. However, even if island share some common features with underdeveloped areas, they hold some peculiar characteristics that may represent an interesting case study in order to explain patterns in economic growth and convergence. On one hand islands, especially small ones, are characterized by a disadvantage with respect to both the mainland and the peripheral regions. Being a geographical permanent condition, the economic consequences of insularity cannot be completely eliminated, but only mitigated through adequate policy interventions. In line with the definition of Eurisles (2002), insularity can be regarded as a “permanent phenomenon of physical discontinuity”. On the other hand, insularity—like other “geographic specificities”—can be regarded as an asset, rather than a disadvantage. The traditional view of insularity as a mere disadvantage may stem indeed from unexploited opportunities deriving from a “lack of local coherence between natural resources, human capital and the institutional context” (Gloersen et al. 2012). Indeed, insularity is more than a mere geographical status, being the combination between a geographical condition and the reactions of political,Footnote 1 social, economic and cultural peripheralization affecting islands’ attractiveness, thus influencing their economic and social development (Hache 1987). Geographical permanent features such as low accessibility and small size strongly affect the economic and social development of islands (Eurisles 1998; Planistat 2002; CEC 1994), thus raising the need to weight the main socio-economic indicators for the degree of insularity. The small size of market and lower competition affect the potentiality in production, as well as working and living conditions. The topography of islands has critical economic growth effects as well as geographical characteristics, (Dolman 1985; Briguglio 1995). On one hand, islands’ peculiarity in terms of environmental characteristics often makes them attractive as touristic destinations. On the other hand, they are particularly exposed to a set of external economic fluctuations that are usually beyond their control: strong seasonality and the vulnerability to climatic disasters represent indeed a threat for the tourism industry. Smallness, remoteness and vulnerability, together with inadequate policies at both national and EU level, affect indeed islands’ attractiveness, causing islands to stay far beyond the level of development of the mainland. From this perspective, the existence of special traits inherent to islands (Read 2004) raises the need for a separate analysis of islands and their challenges with respect to similar territories such as peripheral and remote areas. So far, the political debate regarding the nature of the economic challenges facing island economies is relatively recent. During the first twenty years of the European Community existence, the problems related to insularity had not been taken into appropriate account, neither from a legal nor from the political point of view. It was in 1992 that the Amsterdam Treaty (art. 158Footnote 2) first addressed the issue of insularity, emphasizing the necessity to develop appropriate policies that would offset islands’ lower accessibility. The Treaty of Maastricht (art. 154) as well focuses on the necessity to link islands, landlocked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the European Community, in order to guarantee a homogeneous development within the EU. Moreover, particular types of island economies (the “Outermost Regions”) have been granted with a special status. After the introduction in the EU of two small island states, Cyprus and Malta, the economic challenges facing island economies and the determinants of islands’ relatively poor economic performance become a key issue within the EU legislation. As far as most of the key development indicators are concerned, European islands are indeed far from the achievement of EU-27Footnote 3 goals; furthermore, Lisbon’s strategy goals have not been met in islands (percentage of employment, R&D expenditure, education attainment, ITC penetration, resource efficiency etc). As ESPON (2010) point out, islands’ unattractiveness for establishing competitive economic activities and for active population will led to a progressive reduction in its socio-economic base and its overall viability, increasing the discrepancy from EU and national goals for sustainable development. While the early debate focuses on insularity as a mere disadvantage, more recently geographical peculiarities such as insularity are started to be considered as a source for territorial development challenges. In this regard, the European Commission Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion (EUROMONTANA 2009) proposes a definition of territorial cohesion as “a means of transforming diversity into an asset that contributes to sustainable development of the entire EU”. From this perspective, insularity can be considered as an asset and a source of potential development if adequate policies are implemented. The double nature of islands—threat and opportunity—makes them an interesting case study as well as a target for policy interventions. The peculiarity of the economic challenges faced by islands, together with a considerable variability in terms of islands’ economic performance, fosters a debate among economist and policy-makers regarding the nature of the difficulties faced by islands and their consequences in terms of economic performance. On one hand, theoretical models (New Economic Geography, New Trade Theory) do not tackle explicitly with the issue of insularity. However, they represent a good starting point for the analysis of insularity, providing an analysis of the mechanisms through which distinctive features of insularity such as smallness, remoteness and peripherality impact on trade, firms localization and firm economic performance, thus affecting regional economic development. Furthermore, islands’ peculiarity can be exploited as a “natural experiment” for theories of regional growth. A large strand of literature on regional development investigated the dualism between developed and underdeveloped areas, providing a confirmatory analysis of cross-country (or inter-regional) differences in levels of development, as well as explaining the main determinants of such a gap. While traditional demand-constrained and supply-side constrained modelsFootnote 4 have been found to have a limited explanatory power, factors such as differentials in human capital endowment (Lodde 2000; Di Liberto and Simmons 1998) or in R&D expenditure (Paci and Usai 2000), real wage rigidity (Faini 1999; Brunello et al. 2001) inadequacy of the banking sector and high illegal activity rate (Del Monte and Giannola 1997) represent more powerful explanation for development gaps. Several literature contributions further investigate whether a gap between the underdeveloped southern regions and the more developed northern ones.Footnote 5 D’acunto et al. (2004), using a two-stage procedure to analyse the role of demand- and supply-side factors in explaining economic growth, with reference to the 20 Italian administrative regions, eventually found that demand-side factors, rather than supply-side ones, are likely to be responsible for the level of underdevelopment of southern regions relatively to the northern, more developed, areas. Furthermore, a second-stage analysis has revealed that the size of regional manufacturing, social capital, the state of technology and competition and efficiency in the banking sector are the key determinants of development gaps. Ascari and Di Cosmo (2005) and Aiello and Scoppa (2000) go one step further previous literature, investigating the factors determining development gaps in terms of different regional TFP estimates. The authors eventually found that research activity, human capital, social capital, infrastructures and agglomeration spillovers are the main determinants of TFP differences across Italian regions: endowment of infrastructures, structure and development of the financial system, enforcement of property rights and crime rates, level of public intervention. The role of public investment—especially production-oriented infrastructure, needs to be tackled as well. Marrocu and Paci (2010), using a disaggregated dataset, highlight that production-oriented infrastructure, more than other kinds of infrastructures, may help not only increasing national production, but also achieving a permanent reduction in regional disparities. From the growth theory perspective, given that the majority of islands lag far behind the mainland with respect to most of the socio-economic indicators, investigating to what extent island differ from the mainland regions holds its own interest to analyse whether insularity plays as an aggravating factor besides factors traditionally hampering underdevelopment areas. Last but not least, empirical literature regarding the impact of insularity on economic performance is fragmented, and empirical evidence casts a dubious note on the impact of insularity on economic performance. Particularly, a debate exists regarding whether adverse effects on growth are caused by insularity per se rather than small size. According to one strand of literature, smallness per se does not represent a challenge, since there is evidence regarding some small states performing well. Rather, it is the combination of smallness with other geographical characteristics such as being an island, landlocked or mountainous that matters. However, according to another strand of literature (i.e. Armstrong and Read 1995), the adverse effect of insularity on small size is negligible; on this perspective, it is smallness, rather than insularity per se that affects growth.Footnote 6
 This paper aims at addressing the problem of insularity analysing this issue as far as its economic consequences are concerned. First of all, a definition of insularity as presented by the EU legislator is presented. In particular, insularity will be defined in its components: smallness, remoteness and peripherality. In the third section, the theoretical framework of the NEG and NNT, useful to derive potential implications of the consequences of insularity, will be briefly described, whereas a review of the main empirical literature contributions that have tackled the economic consequences of insularity will be presented in the following paragraph. Section 6 presents policy implications, with a particular focus on the double nature of insularity as a disadvantage and a potential opportunity. The last section includes concluding remarks and directions for future research.",17

It is also common to hear this idea in many public interventions of the academics that lead the recovery of the Italian civil tradition. For example: The civil economy makes the person its center, in the line of Emmanuel Mounier and Jacques Maritain, and intends to seek the good of all the people without exception. That is precisely the common good (Cortina in Zamagni 2012b). Another example: when Bruni and Zamagni describe the concept of subsidiarity (which is absolutely central in the civil economy tradition), they understand it as a… […] personalist principle according to which human beings are not just individuals, but, over all, persons. That means, human being become fully himself in the reciprocal relationship. From the personalist root raises this subsidiarity principle (Bruni and Zamagni 2004, p. 240). In Spain, one of the academics who have best studied the work of Maritain, Juan Manuel Burgos, establishes a clear link between both traditions: We estimate that, in Italy, personalism has become a genuine cultural koine in which we found a large number of intellectuals from many different areas (Burgos 1997, p. 145). However, there are not many papers that study in a deep and clear way the connection between personalism and the Italian civil tradition. In this paper, we aim to describe the anthropology of one of the most representatives of the personalist authors (Jacques Maritain) and demonstrate that it can provide a solid anthropological foundation for the civil tradition and even promote further developments for it.

Economic growth and unemployment are in fact not always inversely related, since an ambiguous relationship has also been found in empirical studies.Footnote 1 Also, shadow economy negatively contributes to economic growth (see, for example, LaPorta and Shleifer 2008), but unemployed workers may be absorbed by the underground economy; hence, attempts to reduce the shadow sector may result in higher unemployment (Boeri and Garibaldi 2002, 2005). Accordingly, the direction of the relationship between growth and unemployment, as well as the sign of relationship between shadow economy and unemployment, is a priori ambiguous. Furthermore, when growth and unemployment are inversely related and the shadow economy contributes to reducing unemployment, also the relation between growth and shadow economy can become ambiguous. Another important issue, only apparently unrelated to the previous one, is the relation between rational economics and behavioural economics. In my opinion, the key economic challenge by the Nobel Prize winner, McFadden (1999), namely the introduction of more realistic (non-rational) decision-making processes into the mainstream economic models, has not yet been fully realised. Could relatively simple theoretical models of behavioural economics provide valuable insights for a better understanding of the relationship among unemployment, growth and shadow economy? This theoretical paper aims to reply to this important question. Firstly, in order to show that an integration between rational economics and behavioural economics is feasible and relatively simple, I introduce and simplify a theoretical model (Lisi 2012, 2014) that studies the macroeconomic effects of tax compliance in an environment where the decision to evade taxes or to comply with them depends on trust in tax authority (vertical trust) or, simply put, the willingness to pay taxes (henceforth simply “trust”). In turn, trust depends on power of tax authority or, simply put, power. This reasonable hypothesis radically changes the economic results with respect to a standard model of profit maximisation. Indeed, the profit maximisation approach is not able to capture the important link among tax compliance (tax evasion), job creation and unemployment. Secondly, I make a simple extension of the model by introducing economic growth. Once the link among tax compliance (tax evasion), job creation and unemployment is taken into account, it can be shown that the extension to economic growth makes the model able to shed light on the true (long-run) relationships among unemployment, growth and shadow economy. The main result of this paper is that in a society where the tax authority respects the taxpayers and applies transparent and fair procedures (i.e. in a trustful society), trust is large, the underground economy is shrunk, unemployment is reduced, and growth is high. In contrast, in a distrustful society (a society where the power of tax authority is too high or too low), trust is scant, the underground economy strengthens, unemployment is reduced only in the short run, and long-run growth is low. This result is consistent with the general finding of growth theory that economic growth requires improvements in social infrastructure (Hall and Jones 1999; Romer 2006).Footnote 2 Indeed, the government’s fiscal policy is a key component of social infrastructure (Romer 2006) and, thus, a distrustful society is merely a society with poor social infrastructure. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the static version of the model and finds the steady state solutions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the trade-off among tax compliance (tax evasion), job creation and unemployment. Section 3 makes the model dynamic by introducing economic growth, hence contributing to a better understanding of the long-run relationship among unemployment, underground economy and economic growth. This section also provides some remarks on policy implications. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the work.",3
63,2,International Review of Economics,11 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-015-0248-6,The Italian productivity slowdown in a Real Business Cycle perspective,June 2016,Francesca Marino,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The slowdown of the Italian productivity over the last 20 years is a well-known and debated fact (e.g. Aiello et al. 2009; Daveri and Jona-Lasinio 2005; Bassanetti et al. 2004; Venturini 2004). Across the works in this literature, it is almost unanimously claimed that this phenomenon is connected to the Total Factor Productivity deceleration that took place after 1995 (Fig. 1, panel a). At the same time, there is a pretty common view that different sectors may have contributed differently to the overall observed productivity pattern, and the decline mainly stems from the Made in Italy productions, namely manufacturing (Bassanetti et al. 2004) and, more specifically, intermediates (Aiello et al. 2011; Daveri and Jona-Lasinio 2005), and non-ICT (Information and Communication technologies) industries (Venturini 2004). Nevertheless, the bulk of the existing contributions focuses on non-structural approaches, mainly growth-accounting exercises (e.g. Daveri and Jona-Lasinio 2005) and supply-side analysis (Sgherri 2005; Mastromarco and Zago 2012), thus failing to investigate properly the structural nature of the observed productivity slowdown. Moreover, a partial-equilibrium perspective misses to identify the connections between the Italian protracted slowdown of per capita output growth and productivity (van Ark et al. 2007) and the behaviour of other key macroeconomic variables. Indeed, a visual inspection of the dynamics of consumption and investment (Fig. 1, panel b) reveals that the consumption-good sector matches pretty well the downturn of TFP after 2000, but at the same time, these two variables are strictly comoving in the long run. As a result, in a general equilibrium perspective, the view that all the Italian productivity problems arise from the Made in Italy sectors would only partially be confirmed. Motivated by these considerations, this paper proposes a fully parameterized general equilibrium model to investigate the link between the Italian productivity dynamics and the behaviour of three macroeconomic variables—consumption, investment and hours worked—from the 1980s on. Estimating a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model for Italy, we provide a mapping between these observable variables and the unobservable structural shocks, both in the short and in the long run. Such a structural approach would thus provide useful insights into the relation between the long-lasting Italian productivity slowdown and its arising economic weakness in terms of low competitiveness, wage moderation, weak domestic demand. The theoretical framework is a modification of the two-sector RBC model developed by Ireland and Schuh (2008). In the original model, the economy is decomposed into a consumption-good sector and an investment-good sector, while the dynamics of the system are driven by the level and growth rate components of shocks to preferences and sector-specific productivity. The level components are generally responsible for temporary changes in growth and levels of each shock, while the growth components drive long-run growth and permanent shifts. As an implication of this two-sector model, since consumption- and investment-good technologies are driven by sector-specific stochastic processes, technology growth rate may be different across sectors, while consumption and investment—if non-stationary—are not necessarily cointegrated (Ireland and Schuh 2008). In order to account for the specific relation between consumption and investment for Italy, which seem driven by the same stochastic process in the long run, we transform Ireland and Schuh’s (2008) pure two-sector model into a hybrid where the level component of productivity can be different across sectors, while the growth component of productivity is the same. This common-trend assumption is generally consistent with the idea that sectorial performances are affected by both idiosyncratic factors—like inputs or sector-specific knowledge—and other common features—like infrastructures or global shocks. In line with the original paper, the model is estimated using maximum likelihood, where the likelihood function is constructed through the Kalman filter from the state-space representation of the solution and evaluated analytically. The smoothed estimates of the shocks and the counterfactual analysis contribute to match the sectorial dynamics of permanent and transitory productivity shocks with the overall productivity decline and consumption and investment performances. As a result, we are able to interpret the bad Italian economic dynamics in the 2000s in terms of a permanent negative shock to the common component of productivity across sectors, while the slowdown in the mid-1990s seems in line with a loss of productivity in the intermediate-good sector. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 briefly summarizes the literature on Real Business Cycle models, with a focus on the nexus between productivity and growth. Section 3 describes the modified Ireland and Schuh’s (2008) model and its application to the Italian economy. Section 4 discusses the estimates of the structural parameters, the smoothed estimates of sectorial productivity and the Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) in the light of the existing literature on the Italian productivity slowdown, while Sect. 5 concludes.

If the nominal interest rate changes by more than one unit in response to each unit change in the inflation rate, the policy is referred to as active. Conversely, if the nominal interest rate changes by less than one unit, it is referred to as passive. To achieve local equilibrium determinacy, monetary policy must be active. This well-known proposition is called the “Taylor principle.” Leeper (1991) studied the interaction between monetary and fiscal policies and evaluated the efficacy of a fiscal policy rule in which the lump-sum tax responds to the total government liabilities (tax collection rule). An active fiscal policy manipulates the amount of tax without abiding by budget discipline. In contrast, a passive fiscal policy seeks to keep the total government liabilities from diverging, which is a Ricardian-type fiscal policy. Leeper (1991) demonstrated that for local equilibrium determinacy, an active monetary policy must be combined with a passive fiscal policy, whereas a passive monetary policy must be combined with an active fiscal policy. In the case of an active fiscal policy combined with a passive monetary policy, the treasury budget is balanced by the inflation caused by a passive monetary policy. Although Leeper assumed flexible prices, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) and Kumhof et al. (2010) developed Leeper’s model to include price stickiness, i.e., Leeper’s model was expanded into an NK model. The two studies also examined the efficacy of rules that include responses of the income tax rate to total government liabilities, which is distortionary taxation. Their studies basically confirmed Leeper’s results. These studies used discrete-time models. Furthermore, they assumed that tax responds to a past value (one period earlier) of government liabilities. In other words, they considered the presence of a policy lag. More generally, a certain policy variable evaluated at period t, denoted by \(\tau _t\), responds to an endogenous variable evaluated not at time t, \(x_t\), but at time \(t-1\), \(x_{t-1}\). Discrete-time models have no analytical problem when treating a time lag. However, how should a time lag be treated in continuous-time models? Would the results concerning the effects of monetary and fiscal policies hold in continuous-time models with a policy lag? The main objectives of this paper are to provide answers to these questions. One way of treating the “past” of a variable in continuous-time models is to employ a weighted average of a stream of such variable values that extends from the infinite past to the present, as in the study by Benhabib et al. (2003). However, a time lag in the strictest sense cannot be represented by the variable’s weighted average. Instead, it should be represented by a past value taken at a certain point in time. If we introduce a time lag into a continuous-time model, the system will be described by a delay-differential equation (in other words, a differential-difference equation), which includes the terms \(\dot{x}_t\), \(x_t\), and \(x_{t-\theta }\), where \(\theta \) represents a time lag. There is still only a limited amount of research on the effects of a lag in policy responses using a continuous-time NK model. Although Tsuzuki (2014, 2015) developed continuous-time NK models with an interest rate rule that considers a monetary policy lag, these models do not include a fiscal policy rule. Generally, fiscal authorities are considered to take a longer time than monetary authorities to implement policy. This suggests the importance of the analysis of fiscal policy lags. This paper first examines whether the abovementioned results by Leeper (1991) hold in a continuous-time NK model without a policy lag. Next, we introduce a fiscal policy lag into the model and examine the local equilibrium determinacy. We also demonstrate that a lag can have a stabilizing effect on the local determinacy. Leeper’s (1991) study triggered much discussion on the determinacy of equilibria under different policy rules in NK models. We shall refer to some of these studies, focusing on those that show that equilibrium determinacy can be achieved even under a passive monetary policy, i.e., the situation wherein the Taylor principle does not hold. These studies base their discussion on models with capital accumulation (although this paper’s model does not include capital). First, Meng and Yip (2004) developed a flexible-price, money-in-the-utility-function model that incorporates endogenous investment. According to their study, equilibrium determinacy can be achieved by using either active or passive monetary policies if labor supply is endogenous. However, when money affects both utility and production, equilibrium determinacy can be achieved only by using active monetary policies. The study also demonstrated that when additive separability of leisure is assumed in the utility function, either active or passive monetary policies can ensure the determinacy. Furthermore, Gliksberg (2009) discussed the following two cases: one in which investment requires money and the other in which investment takes an adjustment cost. In both cases, if production externalities exist, either active or passive monetary policies can establish equilibrium determinacy. Finally, Annicchiarico et al. (2012) developed an overlapping generation model with monetary and fiscal policy rules. They focused on the wealth effect between generations. The wealth effects change the results of monetary and fiscal policies through changes in household consumption levels. Using numerical simulations, the study demonstrated that passive fiscal policies combined with active monetary policies can lead to equilibrium determinacy, but they may also induce output volatility, i.e., a fiscal expansion increases the output in the short term but decreases it in the medium term. Their study is quite unique in its discussion of both the short- and medium-term effects of policies. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a discussion on the behavior of economic agents in a model economy. Section 3 includes an analysis of local dynamics for a case in which a lag is not present. Section 4 includes an evaluation of a case where a fiscal policy rule is introduced and accompanies a time lag. Section 5 concludes.",5
63,3,International Review of Economics,23 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-016-0253-4,The role of persuasion in cultural evolution dynamics,September 2016,Fabrizio Panebianco,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Each society, being it a firm, a group of friends, a family or a community of any type, develops during time an internal culture composed of norms and ways of behavior that are the results of the long-term relationships among agents. Consider, for example, a firm in which different working cultures coexist at a given time. These working cultures may represent different knowledge-sharing rules among coworkers. These different working cultures, then, can differently spread in the firm and determine the long-run organizational culture it is observed. Another example can be given by communities (religious communities, NGOs). In these small societies, often built on some ethical norms, there is the need to sustain cooperation culture against free-riding culture. The long-run equilibria of these cultural dynamics often have strong economic implications. As already established (see, for example, Guiso et al. 2006), culture matters for economic outcomes. In the examples above, the fact that a firm has a large or small knowledge-sharing culture may affect long-run productivity and the success of the firm in the market. In the case of communities, if cooperators fail to survive, then we can have the collapse of the whole community. Cultural traits spread in the society partly depending on their ability to adapt to the social and economic environment (the standard notion of fitness) and partly depending on the ability of agents to ‘promote’ own type. Cultural transmission and evolution literature exactly focuses on the interaction of these two processes, paying particular attention on the social interactions that drive to long-run cultural landscape. The main difference between these models and standard evolutionary game-theoretic models is well expressed by Samuel Bowles in an influential paper (Bowles 1998). ‘Evolutionary game theoretic models typically abstract entirely from the process of cultural transmission, representing payoffs associated with particular traits as if they were the only influences on the replication of traits. By contrast, models of cultural evolution typically address what is known about the particulars of the process by which traits are acquired…’ [p. 82]. Namely, cultural evolution models do not just look at how payoffs influence replication but also at the specificity of cultural transmission processes, that is how agents persuade others to imitate own trait. Being transmission of culture not a genetic transmission, agents have to be convinced or persuaded to adopt a given cultural trait and not a competing one (also referred to as socialization to a given trait). All cultural transmission and evolution literature is about how this persuasion happens,Footnote 1 and how actively agents shape what is called their cultural fitness (Durham 1991). This persuasion step may take different forms. In cultural transmission literature, the persuasion process is the common basis of all models, and persuasion is done purposefully by means of a costly effort (see Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1973, 1981; Boyd and Richerson 1985, 2005; Bisin and Verdier 2001 and all the following economic literature).Footnote 2 In some case, agents just want to be recognized for their work and persuasion of others is a by-product of the fact that each agent wants to show she is doing the right thing. We may think at the persuasion step referring to the two examples provided above. If we take the example of firms, each worker belonging to a given working culture may be asked to confront with others and defend the appropriateness of own working culture with respect to the others. If we think, instead, at a small community, there can be a form of public debate in which all agents constantly share their views about different cultures and, in this way, shape others’ judgement and choices. In this paper, we try to merge standard evolutionary game approach with the persuasion step peculiar to the cultural evolution literature, providing new insights on the dynamics of cultural traits in a society. In particular, we show how, if we explicitly model a persuasion step in a standard evolutionary game-theoretic model, then we can sustain cooperation even in environments in which, usually, non-cooperative cultures win. In terms of our previous examples, what happens if, in a firm, agents are given the chance to give reason of their work through an evaluation process where they need to give reason of their activity? What happens if, in a community, cooperators and non-cooperators should defend, in a sort of public debate, their activity? Does it help cooperation or not? If we give cooperators the possibility to publicly defend their trait in social dilemmas, do we help cooperation? In this paper we show that giving the chance to persuade others may help cooperators to survive. In building a model that merges cultural evolution and evolutionary game theory, we must pay attention to two main elements. First, in standard evolutionary game-theoretic models applied to cultural issues, and as reported in Bowles citation above, there is no difference between how much a culture is fit to a given environment and its rate of spread, since payoffs are given and replicator dynamics just builds on that. Here, however, persuasion may produce a cultural fitness (the actual spread in the population) different than the standard fitness computed just by looking at payoffs; this is the key point in cultural evolution: Non-fit cultures may spread because it can succeed in being more convincing despite lower fitness. This comes to be crucial, for example, in the spread of cooperation: In short-term relationships in social dilemmas, Cooperation is non-fit, since individual deviations toward non-cooperation are more profitable. However, cooperators (and non-cooperators) should be given the possibility to actively influence this process in their favor. Thus, the paper provides a different motivation for the possible survival of cooperative strategies in a prisoner’s dilemma framework other than the ones as Nowak (2006), Fehr and Fischbacher (2002, 2004), Gintis et al. (2005), Binmore (2006), Sugden (2004), Bruni (2008) and Bruni et al. (2014). Second, in a cultural transmission framework, we allow agents to act in order to influence the way in which cultural fitness is built. However, the persuasion and the imitation steps have always been considered as a unique process. This may create some problems in disentangling the effect of the persuasion technology from the imitation technology. Thus, in order to avoid any confusion, we consider persuasion and imitation as two distinct processes. As for imitation, we use replicator dynamics that properly mimic imitation. As for persuasion, we use the tool of a third party that has to be persuaded by agents about their contribution to a task and assigns payoffs. The third party can mimic, for example, the chief of a firm, or a committee, that has to judge the contribution of the workers to a given task. However, in some contexts, the third party has no sense and persuasion happens through public debates among all the agents. As we will discuss in the paper, our model can take into account of both cases and the third party is just a theoretical tool that makes us able to capture persuasion as a process distinct from imitation and to explicitly refer to it without any misunderstanding. The third-party framework we have here is just used as an example for a wider possible set of applications where cultural types may be seen as competitors in obtaining a given payoff. However, this setup is linked to the existing literature about the evolution of corporate cultures as in Cordes et al. (2008, 2010). We build a framework in which agents of different types are matched in pairs. Once matched, they have to perform a task in which their payoff depends on some priors the third party has about their productivity and also on how much they are able to convince a ‘third party’ about their productivity level. To do that, they produce a costly effort to signal their ability and the third party assigns payoffs. Then, imitation proxies by standard replicator dynamics are at work. Our analysis and results can be summarized as follows. First, we analyze numerosity and stability properties of the equilibria for generic game matrices and a generic class of persuasion mechanisms, finding that standard game classification may not be helpful in these kinds of cultural processes to understand long-run properties. We provide necessary conditions for the stability of the polymorphic equilibrium, relating the productivity in homogenous matching to the maximal social production of heterogeneous matching. We find that prisoner’s dilemmas or stag hunt games can both be consistent with long-run persistence of cooperation, which fails under the standard model with no persuasion. Second, we specify a class of rules derived from cultural evolution literature (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1973, 1981; Bisin and Verdier 2001) in which cultural types are judged by the third party with different mechanisms (parametrized by a competition parameter), and we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stable and unstable polymorphic equilibria in the long run at each competition level. The way in which agents compete for payoffs with the costly effort also has some link with both holdup models (Ellingsen and Robles 2002; Olcina and Penyarrubia 2002 the latter for a model of holdup with intergenerational preference transmission) and conflict theory model (forareview Garfinkel and Skaperdas 2007). Again we show how persuasion change the long-run dynamics and allow for the presence, for example, of cooperative outcomes in cases where standard models do not allow for. Third, we focus on prisoner’s dilemma as a prominent example that can capture the incentives of cooperators and non-cooperators in social dilemmas. We find that the presence of cultural competition allows for the existence of both stable and unstable polymorphic equilibria and for the victory of cooperators. Also for these cases, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions over the parametrization for the stability of possible polymorphic equilibrium. In this way, we prove that giving the chance to the cooperators (and non-cooperators) to publicly defend their performance may play an important role in fostering cooperation in the long run. At last, we analyze, in a prisoner’s dilemma framework, the effect of the levels of competition among types on the long-run results. We thus find out that a little competition allows for the presence of cooperators in the long run. Moreover, we show that the introduction of persuasion, at any level, makes the society bettered off in a large part of the parameter space, so that the overall social production may increase under this persuasion mechanism. In this sense, the costly persuasion step, even if temporarily destroying resources, is a device that can help reaching efficient social outcomes. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the model, while Sect. 3 presents the results for a generic payoff matrix and for both generic and specific competition rules. Section 4 presents the entire analysis in the case of prisoner’s dilemma matrix, while Sect. 5 concludes the paper. In Appendices, proofs of propositions are provided.",

There are exceptions though. First, competition fails if there are internal scale economies in production or the number of players on the supply/demand side is restricted (Chandler and Hikino 2009). Also, economic theory stresses the role of networks, where scale economies or a product’s value raise with network users and, hence, cooperation boosts efficiency while competition would not (Katz and Shapiro 1994). But, perhaps the toughest challenge is that asymmetric information makes competition impractical. Notably, market-clearing equilibrium may be unfeasible in labor (Spence 1973) and credit markets (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981; Diamond 1984) where below-perfect-competition arrangements deliver second best results. So, we cannot assume that rivalry boosts efficiency for the Banche di Credito Cooperativo (BCCs), a system of a few hundreds mutual banks set up in a network. Indeed, two of the principles making competition likely undesirable join forces here. First, belonging to a network where some products or services are jointly produced in a setup of non-excludability creates network economies and cooperation rather than competition favors efficiency. Second, BCCs work in credit markets where wild rivalry can convey third best results rather than the first best. Here, competitive business models may be suboptimal (Boot and Thakor 2000). For instance, relationship banking—via long-term bank-firm rapports—can lower lender–borrower information asymmetry and credit rationing, mainly for opaque borrowers. Instead, transactional banking—by diluting borrower-lender information sharing—may raise credit rationing, an adverse effect for both borrowers and banks. Then, the merits of competition versus cooperation are non trivial for BCCs. On the one hand, competition can usefully expel least efficient BCCs from the market. Instead, cooperation may boost BCCs efficiency by both raising network economies and backing relational business models clearly suitable toward small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the typical BCCs customers. Besides, cooperation may per se cut costs implied by market failure in collecting information in credit markets. Also, the effect of rivalry may differ at profit focused shareholder-value-oriented banks versus stakeholder-value-oriented banks like BCCs, which do (or should) not only maximize profit. Besides, following Barbetta et al. (2012) intuition, we must distinguish outer—a BCC competing with other bank types but not with other BCCs—from inner competition—a BCC competing solely with one or more other BCCs. Barbetta et al.’s model predicts that outer (inner) competition benefits (harms) BCCs. But their supportive evidence refers only to BCCs in the Trento province. Our main aim is extending the empirical test in the spirit of Barbetta et al. to all BCCs. We offer a methodological improvement too by taking the analysis from bank level to branch level. With the rich database we built, we can also test whether the move from BCC monopoly to BCC duopoly—i.e., from monopoly to inner competition—differs from that where a BCC competing only with non-mutual banks starts competing also with other BCCs—i.e., from outer to both outer and inner competition. In the rest of the paper, Sect. 2 reviews the relevant literature on cooperatives, network economies, competition, and market structure, and then centers on competition and the actual context of BCCs in Italian banking. Section 3 casts the analysis to competition within a network of cooperative banks like the BCCs, detailing the asymmetric effect of outer versus inner competition and stating our testable hypotheses. Section 4 hosts our empirical contribution. First, we present the unique painstakingly assembled database where we can track efficiency to BCC-level or down to municipal-level or even deeper to branch level. Then, we propose our econometric method to identify the different effects of outer versus inner competition, controlling for other market structure components and factors external to BCCs. Third, we report and comment the main econometric results. In general, these results support the beneficial (or neutral) effect of outer competition versus the harmful effect of inner competition on BCCs productive performance. Finally, Sect. 5 recaps our main results and debates their policy implications. Just to anticipate our possibly most controversial conclusion, we cast doubts on the efficacy/desirability of the “level the playing field” mantra shaping much of the—questionable according to some (e.g., Admati and Hellwig 2013; Ferri and Neuberger 2014)—current approach to banking regulation.",10

Piper,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many news articles about sleep, and some academic ones too, start with the cliché about how it is important because it is such a large part of our day. This article, which empirically investigates the amount of sleep associated with maximum life satisfaction, is no exception. It has been estimated that 36 % of our lives are spent asleep, approximately 32 years in total if we live until 90 (Tufnell 2014). The sample of German individuals investigated here sleep for an average of 7 h per weekday, and nearly 8 h per day at the weekend which represents about 30 % of their lives. Given this importance, it is somewhat surprising that it is little researched from a well-being point of view. There is a large medical literature about sleep and its associations with health generally, and a very small ‘economics of sleep’ literature despite its economic importance. As just one example of this importance, the market for sleep aids is estimated to be a multi-billion dollar industry (Walsh and Engelhardt 1999). The current study is one of the first within economics that investigates life satisfaction and the amount of sleep an individual has. Overall, the results indicate that the duration of sleep that is associated with maximal ceteris paribus life satisfaction is, on average, substantially higher than that which individuals actually have. The medical literature is briefly discussed in the next section and, broadly, finds negative health consequences from both short and long sleep durations. These health consequences include increased weight gain and obesity, and the effects of such weight gain including diabetes and hypertension. Also discussed in the next section is the brief ‘economics of sleep’ literature. The ‘economics of sleep’ literature treats the amount of sleep an individual has as a choice: individuals can choose how to split their day up between work, leisure, and sleep in an attempt to maximise utility. The third section describes the data which come from the well-known German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) which has, since 2008, included questions about the amount of sleep a respondent has. Panel data are particularly advantageous because of evidence that sleep patterns differ substantially across different subgroups (as shown by, for example, Biddle and Hamermesh 1990; Szalontai 2006). There is also evidence that individuals have specific time-invariant differences regarding their need for sleep (Aeschbach et al. 2003; Van Donegan et al. 2005). The use of fixed effects (FE), in Sect. 3, usefully allows these individual time-invariant needs to be controlled for. This section also provides descriptive statistics, including the overall sleep duration averages given above. A notable trend is with health: on average, healthy individuals sleep longer than less healthy individuals.Footnote 1 Also in this section, the methodological approach to attempt to find ceteris paribus maximal life satisfaction is briefly explained. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 4 presents the results; Sect. 5 contains a discussion of these results as well as suggestions for future research; finally Sect. 6 concludes.",6

According to a survey conducted by Yoga Journal, more than 20 million Americans practice yoga, spending more than $10 billion a year on this activity.Footnote 1 Practitioners generally perceive yoga as a method of maintaining mental and physical health and improving body flexibility. Although the above-mentioned survey was carried out by a special interest yoga magazine and thus may contain response bias, the popularity of yoga meditation in the USA and in other Western countries is undeniable. Moreover, several scientific studies have provided evidence of the effects of yoga meditation on regulating physical and emotional reactions.Footnote 2
 The aim of our research is to understand whether meditation leads to selfish or pro-social behavior. To explore the potential effects induced by short-term yoga meditation, we performed a controlled experiment based on the investment game designed by Berg et al. (1995). We compare the behavior of two groups of participants playing this investment game: those exposed to prior short-term meditation and those not exposed to prior meditation. Several findings on short-term exposure to meditation and similar practices report that such practices can reduce cognitive rigidity, which is defined as a resistance to change in beliefs, attitudes, habits or the tendency to develop and persevere in the use of mental or behavioral sets. Short-term meditation has been shown to improve attention and stress control (Tang et al. 2007, 2009; Gothe et al. 2013; Hafenbrack et al. 2014). In particular, Tang et al. (2007, 2009) found that participants who engaged in five consecutive days of 20-min meditation sessions reported significantly better attention and stress control than a control group.Footnote 3 The participants exposed to yoga were reported to have improvements in conflict-resolution ability (or in executive attention) and reductions in levels of anxiety, stress, depression, anger and fatigue. Gothe et al. (2013) report that even just one yoga class can improve cognitive function by boosting both focus and working memory. Hafenbrack et al. (2014) suggest that increased mindfulness reduces the tendency to allow sunk costs to influence current decisions. In general, the effects of meditation on emotions and cognitive rigidities are immediate, but transitory. Short-term meditation causes similar effects. In contrast, long-lasting health benefits occur only after long-term meditation practice (e.g., effects on blood pressure regulation, improved sense of balance, healthy weight, or lower risk of heart disease). As we are interested in the effects on behavior, we focus on short-term meditation. It is reasonable to suppose that the aforementioned emotive changes induced by meditation may also affect the way people interact both as individuals and as a group. However, there are few studies regarding the effects of yoga on social behavior, with the exception of Kirk et al. (2011). In an ultimatum game, Kirk et al. (2011) found that experienced meditators were more likely to accept unfair offers. In fact, meditators accepted more than one out of two unfair offers, whereas control groups only accepted one out of four unfair offers. Their experiment involved 66 participants playing multiple rounds of the game. At the end of the experiment, participants were paid according to the decisions they had made on one randomly selected round and they were given an additional small flat fee. The results of Kirk et al. (2011) can be explained by the argument that meditators are “a population of human beings with an unusual tendency to behave more like rational economic agents” (Kirk et al. 2011: 11). Being less affected by cognitive rigidities and emotional biases, meditators should experience more self-interest preferences, making them more likely to accept any type of offer. The same results, however, may derive from the opposite argument: meditators may be a population that cares more about others (i.e., they may have higher social preferences). Meditation, in fact, may reduce anger and stimulate empathy; high acceptance rates can therefore be justified by arguing that meditators are simply more generous (altruistic) and less willing to lose money in order to punish others who have made unfair proposals. The aim of our paper is to verify whether the behavior of individuals exposed to short-term meditation is more oriented to self-interest preferences or to social preferences. In an ultimatum game, one cannot disentangle the motivations for accepting an unfair proposal, as such an acceptance can be driven by either selfish or generous behavior. Thus, we consider a different framework: i.e., an investment game (Berg et al. 1995). In an investment game, if meditation supports the neoclassical view of human interaction, we should expect a reduction in the amount sent; in contrast, if meditation increases social preferences, the reverse should be true. Our main finding is that, on average, subjects exposed to meditation exhibit more trust and trustworthiness (pro-social behavior) than the control groups. However, as the effect of meditation suddenly decreased in the last round of the game, the effect does not appear to last for an extended period of time. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our experiment and methodology. Section 3 illustrates and discusses the main outcomes of our experiments. Section 4 provides several concluding remarks.",1
63,4,International Review of Economics,21 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-016-0260-5,Revisiting equity and debt: access to finance and economic inefficiency,December 2016,Mahmoud Sami Nabi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many studies related to the literature on financial contracting compare the optimality of debt and equity finance in the presence of information asymmetry and costly monitoring. The seminal work of Jensen and Meckling (1976) analyzes the optimal capital structure when “agency costs” prevail between the financiers and the managers (or entrepreneurs). It shows that debt is less susceptible than equity to moral hazard in effort. However, if moral hazard concerns the risk choice of the project, equity finance is shown to be less susceptible. Hence, the optimal capital structure of outside finance is obtained by minimizing the sum of the agency costs. The trade-off between the benefits of risk-smoothing under equity and the incentive effects of debt is shown in Grossman and Hart (1982). Hölmstrom and Milgrom (1991) analyze the optimal contract between the principal and the agent under moral hazard with multitasking and show that equity dominates as a result of pure risk equity. Innes (1990) considers moral hazard in the effort’s choice of a risk-neutral entrepreneur. Under the conditions of limited liability and non-decreasing financier’s payoff, debt is shown to dominate equity. Once the second condition is relaxed, the optimal contract ceases to be debt. It takes the form of “live-or-die” contract with the following feature: The investor is paid a constant share of the profit if it is below a given threshold and nothing otherwise. The logic behind the optimality of debt in case of non-decreasing payoff of the financier is the following: Under any other form of contract, the entrepreneur does not get full benefit from the additional payoffs resulting of higher effort. This leads to an effort level that does not maximize the project’s payoff. The other rationale for the dominance of debt over equity (emphasized in the literature on debt finance optimality in the presence of costly state verification, e.g., Townsend 1979 and Gale and Hellwig 1985) is the minimization of monitoring costs when monitoring under equity is deterministic. However, as shown by Al-Suwailem (2005), a random auditing strategy reduces the higher monitoring cost of the equity contract. This strategy leads to the Pareto-dominance of equity over a specified range of the financier’s opportunity cost.Footnote 1
 More recently, Hellwig (2009) re-examines the theory of Jensen and Meckling (1976) by considering two interdependent sources of moral hazard: risk and effort choices. This interdependence adds an additional dimension to the agent’s set of choices: conceal low effort behind a relatively high-return/high-risk project. Within this more general framework, Hellwig (2009) shows that, contrarily to the standard literature on financial contracting, an incentive financial scheme which achieves the first-best outcome does not exist if the entrepreneur has insufficient funds. Besides, when it exists, such an incentive scheme does not correspond necessary to a combination of debt and equity finance. In some cases, the financial scheme stipulates that the entrepreneur receives nothing if the output is too low and receives a constant share of it otherwise. Hellwig (2009) criticizes the assumption of the financier’s non-decreasing payoff by Innes (1990) which is required to show the optimality of debt. Instead, Hellwig (2009) shows that, for risk-neutral financier and entrepreneur, the type of the incentive scheme does not matter if it provides the requisite payoffs and incentives in expected-value terms. If in addition to risk neutrality and limited liability, the agent exerts efforts in multiple tasks, Dam and Ruiz-Pérez (2012) show that equity, rather than pure debt, is the optimal contractual arrangement. Aside from the Pareto-optimality at the microeconomic level (taking into account the welfare of the principal and agent), it is important to compare equity and debt on the macro-level. There are few studies that point out the economic inefficiency of debt finance in the form of underinvestment (e.g., Gale 1990; Hubbard 1998; Dang 2010). In a two-period relationship between risk-neutral entrepreneur and financier, Dang (2010) shows that debt leads to an inefficient economic situation where some entrepreneurs, although endowed with positive net present value projects, are financially constrained during the second period.Footnote 2 Cressy (2002) notes that the costs of bankruptcy associated with debt finance create a deadweight loss that both firms and banks wish to avoid. He adds that “One way this can be done is by the use of equity, since equity has no bankruptcy costs associated with it. If, then, there is an outside equity provider the firm will prefer (ceteris paribus) to take funds from her than borrow from the bank” (p. F5). In practice, the all-equity funding is rarely observed mainly due to adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The aim of this paper is to delve the possibility to conceive an equity contract which overcomes the economic inefficiency resulting from debt while ensuring the same conditions of access to finance. To this end, I construct a theoretical framework in line with Innes (1990) where moral hazard prevails in the form of hidden effort by a risk-neutral agent (entrepreneur). My framework generalizes the model of Innes (1990) along two joint dimensions. The first dimension is endowing the entrepreneur with an initial wealth enabling him to partially fund his project. Thereby, following Hellwig (2009), it is possible to analyze the incentivizing effect of internal funds on the entrepreneur’s behavior. The second dimension is linking the entrepreneur’s share (under equity) to the level of his self-financing. By this way, the financial contracting embeds a dynamic incentive over a two-period horizon. I begin by showing that equity and debt contracts are feasible only if the entrepreneur’s initial wealth is sufficiently high. The characteristics of the project (size, payoff and probability of success), the opportunity cost of the financier and the type of the outside finance (equity vs. debt) are determinant of the minimum required self-financing. I also show that large projects are less financially constrained with debt than with equity. Contrarily, for enough small projects, I find an original result which is the broader financial opportunities with equity relatively to debt. Extending the contractual relationship to two periods reduces the scope of the financial constraints, for a sufficiently foresighted entrepreneur, if some additional conditions are satisfied. For equity, the size of the project should not exceed a specified threshold. For debt, the termination threat (financing non-renewal successive to a first-period failure) should be sufficiently stringent. The more restrictive this threat, the loosely is the financial constraint. However, this condition undermines the second-period investment and generates the economic inefficiency of debt finance. From the entrepreneur’s perspective, I elaborate a pecking order result showing that he is indifferent between debt and equity over a one-period horizon. However, over a two-period horizon, he strictly prefers equity in the presence of the termination threat. These results pave the way to policy implications related to governmental intervention to improve access to finance through equity and reducing the inefficiency of debt finance. The principal feature of the conceived equity contract is the dynamic incentive which links the entrepreneur’s share in the project’s payoff to his own invested funds. This is an original sharing contract which is different from the traditional sharing contract considered in the standard literature (e.g., Innes 1990). In this framework, the entrepreneur is encouraged to undertake the higher effort during the first period, not only to generate high cash flow during that period, but also to increase his share in the second-period project. The identified two-period debt finance relationship has similar features with the one analyzed in Dang (2010). However, contrarily to Dang (2010), the framework here is more general, not only because I consider equity in addition to debt, but also because the entrepreneur is enabled to invest his initial own funds and to reinvest the first-period revenues. Thus, the present paper has also commonalities with a growing number of studies analyzing the effect of dynamic incentives on moral hazard in the context of financial contracting. Hart and Moore (1998) analyze the incentive effect of the termination threat in the context of a two-period model where risk-neutral entrepreneur and investor interact within a symmetric information environment.Footnote 3 In case of default, the termination threat materializes if the investor decides to seize the fixed assets and the project is liquidated before maturating at the second period. The alternative to liquidating the project is to renegotiate the contract. However, this option is not feasible with a debt contract since the returns of the project can be diverted for the own benefit of the entrepreneur. Considering a broader class of contracts, Hart and Moore (1998) show that debt can be strictly inferior to an option-to-buy contract which precludes the inefficient liquidation of the project. Ohlendorf and Schmitz (2012) consider the contractual relationship between risk-neutral principal and agent by extending the standard model to two periods. In each period, the wealth-constrained agent—hired by the principal—exerts unobservable effort, which increases the likelihood of success. The agent’s revenue at the end of the second period is higher in case of first-period success. It is interestingly shown that the termination threat following a first-period failure is not credible if renegotiation cannot be prevented. In this case, the principal may prefer a project with lower returns leading to inefficient resources allocation. Zhu (2013) analyzes a standard continuous-time agency relationship where the agent has a shirking action. He identifies two new dynamic contracts characterized by shirking phases of distinctive types: relaxation periods rewarding the agent for good performance and termination arrangements punishing the agent for poor performance. The rest of the paper is organized in seven sections. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. Section 3 characterizes the equity and debt contracts in the context of a one-period relationship. The characteristics of the two types of contracts in the context of a two-period relationship are analyzed in Sect. 4. Then in Sect. 5, I discuss access to finance and economic inefficiency and suggest a sort of pecking order analysis of the two types of finance. In Sect. 6, I discuss the policy implications of the model. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes.",1

64,1,International Review of Economics,29 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-016-0262-3,Alcohol consumption and individual time preferences of Russians,March 2017,Tatiana Kossova,Elena Kossova,Maria Sheluntcova,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Alcohol consumption has long been an important research subject in the fields of economics, psychology, sociology, and history. The close relationship between alcohol consumption and health outcomes has been documented in numerous studies (Ruidavets et al. 2002; Fenoglio et al. 2003; Collins et al. 2003; Rehm and Greenfield 2008; Neufeld and Rehm 2013). The drinking habits of Russians are a product not only of customs and traditions; they are also influenced by a variety of socioeconomic factors and represent a significant economic problem. The health consequences of alcohol consumption are very important for the economy, as they entail cost. The Russian government has long been cognizant of the problem of excessive drinking in the country. There have been multiple attempts to implement anti-alcohol campaigns and to promote healthy lifestyles. The most prominent example is the anti-alcohol campaign of Gorbachev in 1985–1987. There was a sharp reduction in the production of alcohol. After that, the economic transformation of the 1990s and the transition to the market economy made alcohol relatively more accessible to the public than before. During the 1990s, the price of alcoholic beverages rose relatively less sharply than the price of other goods. This fact, combined with the social tension that arose as a result of the economic reforms, led to a significant increase in alcohol consumption. At present, government authorities are again directing attention to the problem of excessive drinking. According to the World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health (2015), the Russian Federation exhibits one of the highest levels of total alcohol consumption, which is 15.1 L of absolute alcohol per capita for adults of both sexes, taking into account both recorded and unrecorded consumption. In response to the large volume of alcohol consumption, the Russian government has authorized special measures for reducing alcohol abuse for the period up to 2020 (Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation 2015). These measures underlie anti-alcohol programs that have been implemented at the federal and regional levels. Government efforts are directed at reducing the consumption of strong alcoholic beverages, liquidation of the illegal alcohol market, and reducing alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality. A large number of studies investigate alcohol consumption in Russia. Authors analyze the relationship of alcohol consumption with premature death (Neufeld and Rehm 2013) and suicide rates (Nemtsov 2003; Pridemore 2006; Razvodovsky 2011), as well as trends of alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse (Treml 1997; Nemtsov 2000; Perlman 2010; Razvodovsky 2011). Special attention is paid to the determinants of drinking behavior, including age, gender, income, employment status, marital status, occupation status, and health status, among others. Recent studies suggest that the rate of time preference (RTP) or individual discount rate (IDR) plays a key role in individuals’ health behavior and, in particular, their drinking behavior (Ida and Goto 2009; Harrison et al. 2009). RTP is an individual’s preferences for receiving utility from consumption in the present rather than in the future. In other words, it is the rate at which an individual discounts future utility derived from consumption. The origins of intertemporal choice analysis come from Samuelson (1937). A high RTP indicates an impatient person who is likely to delay any activity associated with costs to future periods. Any activity that brings utility will be shifted to the present moment (Bradford et al. 2010). A common way to estimate RTP is to conduct an experiment in which an individual is offered a sum of money and chooses either to delay receipt of the money in order to get a higher amount later or to take the lesser sum immediately (Harrison et al. 2002; Grignon 2009; Bradford 2010). This experiment can be either a real choice (that is, money is actually given) or a hypothetical choice in the form of a survey. The respondents’ answers provide insights about their RTP. For instance, Ida and Goto (2009) showed that drinkers discount delayed monetary rewards more than nondrinkers. The main criticism of hypothetical experiments lies in the fact that in real life people’s behavior might be substantially different from when they are answering a questionnaire. However, in a hypothetical experiment, one can interview a much larger number of respondents and obtain results that are more representative. This paper examines the relationship between Russians’ drinking behavior and their rates of time preferences. In our study, we use a hypothetical experiment in order to reveal individual time preferences of Russians. Along with time preferences, we investigate various socioeconomic determinants of drinking alcoholic beverages. Our contribution to the current understanding of this problem could lead to better policy choices and measures aimed at improving the health of the population. Our research is based on a special survey conducted by the Yuri Levada Analytical Center in 2011. The sample includes individuals 15 years and older and consists of 4001 respondents. The sample is representative by age, educational level, region, and size of the place of residence. We estimate a multivariate probit model, which enables us to account for the possible endogeneity of RTP and individual’s characteristics. Our main suggestion is that the rate of time preferences along with other socioeconomic factors significantly influences the decision of an individual to drink alcohol. The next section of the paper introduces the issue of alcohol consumption in Russia. Section 3 describes the research question and data used in the analysis. Section 4 provides sample characteristics regarding alcohol consumption. Sections 5 and 6 explain the method of analysis and estimation results, and the last section presents main conclusions of our study.",6
64,1,International Review of Economics,30 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-016-0263-2,Causes and barriers to increases in economic freedom,March 2017,Raymond J. March,Conrad Lyford,Benjamin Powell,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Empirical evidence has mounted that economic freedom leads to a number of improved societal outcomes (Hall and Lawson 2014; Hall et al. 2015). For example, economic freedom has been shown to lead to higher incomes (Easton and Walker 1997), economic growth (Gwartney et al. 1997; Cebula 2011), a significantly positive effect on overall wellbeing (Gehring 2013) and longevity (Grubel 1998). Although many studies have been done on the consequences of economic freedom, comparatively fewer studies have been done on the causes of changes in economic freedom. We examine a cross section of countries over the last 20 years to see what factors were correlated with increases and decreases in economic freedom. Economic freedom could be affected by numerous factors. Financial crisis may impact economic freedom by breaking existing political equilibria (Pitlik and Wirth 2003; Young and Bologna 2015). Natural resource endowment, specifically oil, has also been theorized to hinder the development of institutions consistent with economic freedom (Campbell and Snyder 2012). The impact of foreign aid has also been examined extensively (Powell and Ryan 2006; Vasquez 1998; Heckelman and Knack 2008). A significant body of scholarship has considered how the role of legal origins (Glaeser and Shleifer 2002; La Porta et al. 2008), the ability to constrain the executive function of government (Glaeser et al. 2004), and ethnolinguistic fractionalization (Easterly and Levine 1997) have impacted subsequent economic development. Given the importance of economic freedom for economic development, perhaps some of these factors influence subsequent development via their impact on economic freedom. This paper contributes to the literature on a few significant margins. First, we merge the literature that has examined factors influence economic freedom with some of the literature considering how other factors influence economic outcomes by examining whether these other factors also impact economic freedom and thus might impact growth through their impact on economic freedom. We also separately test countries which have made the largest increases in economic freedom from 1990 to 2010 to determine whether these factors impact countries that make large improvements differently. Perhaps causes of large systematic changes in economic freedom are different from those that are more mundane. Intuitively, maybe crises break political equilibria in a way that allows for large changes in economic freedom, but not in a way that significantly impacts smaller changes in economic freedom. Similarly, we sort countries by their initial levels of economic freedom to examine whether different factors are responsible for increasing freedom in already relatively free countries compared to the factors that are important for increasing freedom in relatively unfree countries. Intuitively, perhaps the factors that lead to institutional change in a country like the USA are fundamentally different than factors that lead to institutional change in an unfree country like Zimbabwe. Following the same method, we separately test countries which have received foreign aid and which have not received foreign aid to see whether our factors impact countries who receive foreign aid differently than countries which do not receive foreign aid. We also test countries with one standard deviation above mean value for their initial (1990) GNI per capital value and level of ethnolinguistic fractionalization to test whether our variables affect countries with comparatively higher income and more diversity differently.",24
64,2,International Review of Economics,14 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0279-2,Health and happiness: an introduction,June 2017,Luca Crivelli,Mario Lucchini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the first four decades of happiness research, social scientists have mainly devoted their attention to the analysis of the determinants of well-being. A large number of studies, conducted in several countries and based on different datasets and methods (Dolan et al. 2008), show that dimensions like age, gender, marriage, education, occupational status, income, social support, and relationships are all significantly associated with well-being. Nonetheless, most studies conclude that one of the strongest predictors of happiness is health. Indeed, physical and mental diseases frequently disrupt daily functioning (Angner et al. 2013) and lead to the empirical observation that, on average, individuals self-report a significant decline in happiness after the deterioration of their health status. Beyond the causal effect of health on happiness, a second point of interest has been the temporal dynamics underlying the link between these two dimensions of life. Despite the widely accepted theory of the hedonic treadmill (Brickman and Campbell 1971), according to which people are able to adapt to various (good and bad) life circumstances, chronic sickness is more difficult to adapt to, or in some cases the adaptation takes a very long time. From the literature (see, e.g., Clark et al. 2008; Piper 2013), we know that individuals are able to adapt almost completely to positive life events like marriage, the birth of a child, and an increase in income and wealth, as well as to negative ones, such as divorce, widowhood, and a layoff. Conversely, most studies (see, e.g., Angner et al. 2013; Dolan et al. 2008) have shown that individuals find it extremely difficult to completely adapt in the case of degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, for which progress is slow and difficult. Moreover, difficulties in adapting have been recorded with respect to health conditions associated with social stigma (like urinary incontinence, facial disfigurement, and mental disorders) and, more generally, to diseases that strongly affect the individual’s daily functioning, such as fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and hearing loss. Crivelli et al. (2016a) apply a fixed effects model specification to the Swiss Household Panel dataset. Their results show that happiness strongly depends on one’s current level of health, but also that past poor health conditions continue to exert a significant and negative effect on happiness, while for all other life events but conflicts with relatives the coefficient of the lagged variable is nonsignificant. The weak adaptation of individuals to physical and mental health problems means that promoting health for all has to become a priority public policy target, at least in happiness-oriented societies. Methodologically, researchers have to deal with three main challenges in order to determine whether the observed association between health and happiness is a truly causal relationship or just a spurious one. First, one needs a reliable measure for health that goes beyond the simple self-reported health status and takes seriously the multidimensional nature of both variables. Second, one has to resolve the issue of reverse causality. Finally, the problem of confounding requires researchers to improve their control over the main sources of unobserved heterogeneity that are immanent in secondary datasets, in particular individuals’ genetic endowment.",1
64,2,International Review of Economics,20 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1,Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?,June 2017,Robert Sugden,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the passages I have quoted, Thaler and Sunstein are declaring that their normative criterion is based on individuals’ judgements about what makes them better off, and about what their goals are. There is a clear implication that these judgements are subjective: different individuals in similar circumstances may make different judgements about what is good for them, without those differences showing that anyone’s judgement is in error. The policy maker is expected to respect those judgements, rather than to implement her own judgements about what is good for people, or to implement the judgements of some consensus of experts. But how are individuals’ subjective judgements defined, and how is the policy maker (or the normative economist who advises her) to elicit them? Immediately after presenting the principle of trying to make choosers ‘better off, as judged by themselves’, Sunstein and Thaler promise: [We will] show that in many cases, individuals make pretty bad decisions—decisions that they would not have made if they had paid full attention and possessed complete information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control (2008, p. 5). The obvious interpretation is that individuals’ judgements about their own welfare are revealed in the decisions that those individuals would have made in the absence of error—that is, with full attention, complete information, unlimited cognitive ability and complete self-control. The normative economist’s job is to reconstruct individuals’ error-free latent preferences and to recommend policies that satisfy those preferences. This approach of behavioural welfare economics is widely used by prominent behavioural economists (Bleichrodt et al. 2001; Camerer et al. 2003; Kőszegi and Rabin 2007; Bershears et al. 2008; Salant and Rubinstein 2008; Bernheim and Rangel 2009) and has been endorsed from the perspectives of economic philosophy (Hausman 2012) and the economics of social policy (Le Grand and New 2015). In a recent paper, Gerardo Infante, Guilhem Lecouteux and I have documented the extent to which this approach is used, reconstructed its logic, and subjected it to a methodological critique (Infante et al. 2016). We argue that its implicit model of a human decision maker is that of an inner rational agent interacting with the world through an error-prone psychological shell. The inner agent is imagined to have stable, context-independent preferences of a broadly neoclassical kind. These are the latent preferences that policy makers should try to satisfy, and which express the individual’s judgements about what is good for her. Psychological factors appear in the model only as obstacles that can prevent the inner agent from achieving its goals—obstacles such as inattention, cognitive overload and lack of self-control. Despite Thaler and Sunstein’s label, the decision maker described by this model is not a Human in the ordinary sense of the word. It is a faulty Econ. Infante, Lecouteux and I argue that this model lacks adequate psychological foundations. The existence and rationality of latent preferences is assumed, not explained. Latent preferences are defined as the subjective judgements that a person’s choices would reveal in the absence of error, but we are given no independent criterion by which errors can be identified. Nor are we given any reason to suppose that, after the effects of specific errors have been filtered out, individuals’ choices will be free of the ‘anomalies’ that are the raison d’être of behavioural welfare economics. Take the familiar case of Thaler and Sunstein’s cafeteria, in which customers’ choices between food items vary according to the display chosen by the cafeteria director. Thaler and Sunstein’s recommendation is that the director displays the items so that customers tend to choose as they would have done, had their reasoning not been distorted by error. But if error-free choices are affected by the display too, we are no further forward. Because of this gap in the analysis, the claim that behavioural welfare economics uses individuals’ own judgements about their welfare often turns out to have little content. For example, here is how, as part of their discussion of the differences between Humans and Econs, Thaler and Sunstein justify nudges towards healthy eating: Consider the issue of obesity. Rates of obesity in the United States are now approaching 20 per cent, and more than 60 per cent of Americans are considered either obese or overweight. There is overwhelming evidence that obesity increases risks of heart disease and diabetes, frequently leading to premature death. It would be quite fantastic to suggest that everyone is choosing the right diet, or a diet that is preferable to what might be produced with a few nudges. … We do not claim that everyone who is overweight is necessarily failing to act rationally, but we do reject the claim that all or almost all Americans are choosing their diet optimally… With respect to diet, smoking, and drinking, people’s current choices cannot reasonably be claimed to be the best means of promoting their well-being. Indeed, many smokers, drinkers and overeaters are willing to pay third parties to help them make better decisions (p. 7). Notice that Thaler and Sunstein are not identifying specific errors of reasoning that are being made by obese Americans. The argument goes in the other direction. Because it is (supposedly) so obvious that obesity is contrary to a person’s best interests, we are invited to infer that obese Americans must be reasoning erroneously—that their ability to act on their latent preferences must somehow be being obstructed. Apart from the final sentence (which surely refers only to a small minority of the obese population), there is no argument that healthy diets would be good for the obese, as judged by themselves, or that the obese are aware of the errors they are supposedly making. The argument is straightforwardly paternalistic. That is not to say that it would be wrong for policy makers to try to nudge people towards healthier eating: this paper is not about whether paternalism is justified. My point is that the ‘as judged by themselves’ clause is not achieving what I take to be its purpose, of countering the criticism that nudge policies are paternalistic. Or at least, it does not achieve this purpose if that clause is interpreted as it is in behavioural welfare economics.",50

Clark,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the mainstays of the empirical literature on subjective well-being is the relationship between well-being and income. There is a broad consensus in the literature that richer individuals or countries are happier than poorer individuals or countries: as such, the cross section relationship between income and subjective well-being at the aggregate level is positive, as is that between income and well-being at the individual level. However, the time-series analysis of how average happiness within a country changes over time as that country becomes richer (i.e. as its GDP per capita rises) has led to a far less consensual set of results. Easterlin’s original 1974 contribution referred to the case of the USA, and it indeed continues to be the case that rising GDP per capita in the USA has not been accompanied by rising happiness in General Social Survey (GSS) data in that country: see Fig. 1. The case in other countries is less clear. The seemingly flat trend in Japan as the economy grew (Easterlin 2005) may be due to changes in the subjective well-being question (Stevenson and Wolfers 2008). Easterlin (2016) in turn has produced an extremely useful summary of the many issues involved in estimating the relationship between subjective well-being and GDP per capita in time-series data, in particular pinpointing changes in the questions over time, and that we are interested in the trend relationship between economic growth and happiness, rather than short-run movements in both that reflect the business cycle. In the short run, income and subjective well-being will very likely be correlated, but this does not inform us about the long-run trend relationship (see Figure 1 in Easterlin 2016). The debate thus remains open, although recent trends in subjective well-being in large-scale panel datasets do indeed appear to be uncorrelated with GDP per capita: see Fig. 2. Happiness and GDP per capita in the US General Social Survey Happiness and GDP per capita in the BHPS, SOEP and HILDA We may wonder how much we can learn in the end from the analysis of such time-series data. A first obvious problem is that there are only few data points, and only rarely any individual-level control variables: the demographic characteristics of individuals living in the USA in the 1970s are not the same as those of individuals who lived there in the 2000s, producing a composition effect. Equally, there are very likely country-level omitted variables that may be correlated with both GDP per capita and subjective well-being, such as income inequality, crime and pollution. One popular explanation of the different cross section and time-series relationships between well-being and income does not appeal to composition effects or omitted country-level variables, but rather income comparisons. Here individual well-being (W

i
) depends not only on the individual’s own income (y

i
) but also on that of the reference group to which she compares (\(y_{i}^{*}\)). Well-being can then be written as: We imagine that W rises in y but falls in \(y^{*}\). In the cross section, high-income individuals have higher levels of well-being than low-income individuals (at least assuming that their values of \(y^{*}\) are not too wildly different). But over time, it is perfectly possible that y and \(y^{*}\) rise at the same rate: if I compare my income to yours, and you compare your income to mine, then a rise in both of our incomes may well cancel out, leading to no rise in either my or your well-being. This relationship between individual well-being and own and others’ income can explain the small or zero relationship between GDP per capita and average well-being over time. This translation from the individual to the aggregate level obviously depends on the parametrisation of (1), who is in the reference group that determines \(y^{*}\),Footnote 1 and how both own and others’ income changes as GDP per capita grows over time.Footnote 2 We do not always have good information on all of these elements, so that we should bear in mind that income comparisons are one possible explanation of the Easterlin Paradox, rather than being the definitive explanation. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 considers the varieties of evidence we have that individual well-being does indeed depend on income comparisons. Section 3 then raises a number of objections against dismissing income and GDP per capita as a well-being policy tool, even if there are income comparison effects in subjective well-being. Last, Sect. 4 concludes.",10

The fact that most countries routinely include in their national surveys at least a basic indicator of happiness reflects the value that these days countries and governments give to the promotion of happiness for their people. Happiness is a proxy of “human development” at the societal level. Happiness is modifiable—we are not doomed by our genes to be unhappy. Four important aspects provide supportive evidence for the long-term modifiability of happiness: First, the inequality in the level of happiness observed between and within countries; second, the time trends in country-specific happiness; third, the nation-specific shapes of the curves plotting Cantril’s Ladder Score of happiness on age (Steptoe et al. 2015); and fourth, migrants’ happiness level is closer to the happiness level of residents in the destination rather than in the home country (Frank et al. 2015). According to the most recent World Happiness Report, inequalities in happiness are increasing within countries and are themselves an important determinant of a countries happiness level. According to the report, about 75% of the difference in happiness between countries and regions is explained by the following six key factors: GDP per capita; healthy years of life expectancy; social support; trust; perceived freedom to make life decisions; and generosity. Yet, this reflects an ecological association rather than an association of parameters collected at the individual level. Furthermore, determinants of happiness are likely to differ by the happiness phenotype studied. The construct validity of “happiness” is difficult to demonstrate. There are reasons and interests in exploring the determinants of the different facets of happiness and well-being. Steptoe et al. (2015), for example, listed the following three dimensions of well-being: life satisfaction (evaluative); recent happiness or sadness (hedonic); and purpose (eudaimonic), but other definitions exist.",7

However, they are also required to produce a wide range of merit goods, to correct undesirable outcomes of the market process, and to pursue social fairness and income equality through redistribution.Footnote 2
 This paper focuses on this last aspect (redistribution) and addresses important issues so far ignored by the literature: It investigates under which circumstances a given level of tax pressure, consistent with the electorate’s desire for redistribution, can provoke imbalances; how such imbalances can be redressed; and what happens if they are not. In order to pursue our analysis, we imagine an economy in which the population chooses the desirable amount of redistribution in favour of those in need, and charges the politicians with the power to collect the resources required (tax revenues). However, in this economy the politicians do not restrict themselves to carrying out the task assigned by the taxpayers. They also pursue their own self-interest through fund misappropriation and various forms of rent-seeking.Footnote 3 Sometimes, misuse and rent-seeking are relatively moderate, and are tolerated by the electorate when economic performance and the quality of expenditure are considered adequate. But it may also happen that the electorate strongly deplores the policymakers’ misbehaviour. Under such circumstances, tensions emerge. In this latter case, therefore, policymakers must decide whether to strike a balance between their own self-interest and people’s expectations, or ignore public opinion and carry on and run the risk of being voted out. Certainly, redistribution, taxation, and rent-seeking have been the object of a huge literature. Yet, their interaction has not been studied, and the analysis of the tensions that might emerge has been ignored. In order to fill this gap, we examine a context within which various phenomena are analysed simultaneously: the relationship between tax pressure and tax revenues, which harks back to Dupuit (1844/1969) or earlier; the intensity and features of rent-seeking, which depend on culture, constitutional arrangements, formal and informal controls; and the very goals of the lawmakers, who might pursue long-term visions, or focus on short-term electoral deadlines, or be captured and held hostage by powerful interest groups. In particular, we assume that the electorate’s leaning towards redistribution defines the limits to the tolerable tax pressure, while policymakers aim at prestige (vanity), rejoice in the quest for power, and engage in rent-seeking. Within this framework, the policymakers end up looking for solutions to please the electorate and meet their own personal goals. Sometimes a compromise is feasible. Under different circumstances, however, tensions emerge and reactions follow. In the short run, these reactions aim at producing a different political context. When this context fails to materialise, long-run scenarios emerge, within which taxpayers modify their beliefs, or try to evade taxation or consider leaving the country. Our analysis considers the legislators’ action within a democratic context and makes use of three variables in order to define the actors’ behaviour: populism, the policymakers’ own preferences, and the quality of public expenditure. The outcome of the policymakers’ action is “lawmaking”.Footnote 4 With this goal in sight, Sects. 2–4 illustrate the basic working of the model (taxpayers’ preferences, economic performance and rent-seeking). Section 5 examines the connection between people’s preferences and lawmaking and identifies the conditions that allow equilibrium (absence of tensions). Sections 6 and 7 discuss what happens when tensions arise, while Sects. 8 and 9 interpret the results and conclude.",

Then again, some firms do not exhibit CSR. A large number of empirical studies have shown how introducing CSR affects firm performance. However, the results are mixed. In evidence, Margolis and Walsh (2003) survey 109 analyses of the relationship between CSR and firm financial performance and find a positive relationship in 54 studies, a negative relationship in seven studies, and insignificant relationships in 28 studies. The remaining 20 studies report mixed findings. Consequently, the potential for firm profitability to improve following the introduction of CSR remains controversial. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework of the oligopoly theory to enable us to understand which firms have an incentive to exhibit CSR as a means of maximizing their profits in a Cournot competition. Recently, some studies have examined socially concerned firms (SCF) whose owners maximize objective functions consisting of not only their own profit, but also CSR. For example, Ghosh and Mitra (2014) and Matsumura and Ogawa (2014) assume that firms care about both their own profits and social welfare.Footnote 1
 Ghosh and Mitra (2014) compared the equilibrium outcomes under both Cournot and Bertrand competition in a differentiated oligopoly model where each firm maximizes the weighted average of its own profit and social welfare. Matsumura and Ogawa (2014) investigate an endogenous timing game in which firms considering social welfare choose their own actions and the timing of these actions.Footnote 2
 
Kopel and Brand (2012) and Goering (2012) also consider SCF, but they regard firm objectives as comprising both profits and consumer surplus, with Kopel and Brand (2012), suggesting that the owner of the SCF offers the manager a contract including the firm’s profit and sales revenue to maximize the weighted sum of profit and consumer surplus and then examines the competition between a SCF and a profit-maximizing firm (PMF). Elsewhere, Goering (2012) considers a bilateral monopoly model with an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer (SCF). Overall, both studies focus on the effects of firm CSR on the competition when the levels of firm CSR are exogenously given. Only Goering (2014) and Brand and Grothe (2015) explore endogenous decisions on the level of firm CSR. Goering (2014) assumes that in a bilateral monopoly model, the retailer must maximize its weighted payoff, including both its own profit and its consumer surplus, as offered by the manufacturer. Because the manufacturer can control the payoff of the retailer, the manufacturer can derive its maximal profit, as derived in a two-part tariff scheme. Brand and Grothe (2015) also assume a bilateral monopoly model, such that both the manufacturer and the retailer maximize the socially responsible objective function, unlike Goering (2014) where it is only the retailer does, and show that both endogenously decide to pursue CSR in equilibrium. Accordingly, and as described earlier, all firms exhibit CSR in equilibrium. This paper analyzes endogenous decision making concerning the level of CSR in a delegation game to reveal how the firms’ CSR strategies may affect the outcomes of the quantity competition. The literature on delegation studies has established that the owner offers an incentive contract including sales revenue (Vickers 1985; Fershtman and Judd 1987; Sklivas 1987), market share (Jansen et al. 2007), and a rival firm’s profit (Aggarwal and Samwick 1999). This paper studies the delegation game in which the firm’s owner offers the manager a contract taking considering the weighted average of profit and either consumer surplus or social welfare. We then interpret CSR as an incentive contract regarding either consumer surplus or social welfare. We initially consider a benchmark case in which each owner offers managers an incentive contract consisting of a firm’s profit and consumer surplus before competing in a Cournot fashion. A number of studies have investigated incentive contracts concerning sales, market share, and rival firm profits, which to a greater or lesser extent affect its manager’s decision to produce aggressively. Using an incentive contract including consumer surplus, we derive similar results to those reported in several prior delegation studies. In brief, increasing the level of CSR can serve as a commitment device and thus make firms produce aggressively in the market. Decisions about the CSR level are then strategic substitutes. Thus, we show that the leader (follower) exhibits a higher (lower) level of CSR in a sequential-choice game than in a simultaneous-choice game. When each owner offers manager a contract consisting of a firm’s profit and social welfare, we derive the following results. As is the case of an incentive contract regarding consumer surplus (as in several existing delegation studies), increasing the share of social welfare in the firm’s objective can serve as a commitment device to produce aggressively in the product market. Therefore, each firm exhibits CSR. In the unique equilibrium, both firms maximize only social welfare and set their price at the marginal cost, despite competing in Cournot fashion. That is, the consideration of social welfare leads to a more competitive equilibrium outcome, as in perfect competition, than with consumer surplus. The decision concerning CSR is then a strategic complement.Footnote 3 It is well known that there is a second-mover advantage for strategic complements (Gal-Or 1985). Consistent with this, we show that the follower can derive a greater profit than the leader and achieve maximum profit when firms sequentially choose their CSR level, which is as derived by the leader in Cournot–Stackelberg competition where the leader chooses its output before the follower. In addition, the leader does not exhibit the CSR, whereas the follower does. To our knowledge, this study is the first in the strand of the oligopoly theory to suggest that not all firms necessarily exhibit CSR. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the existing literature on CSR studied from a variety of perspectives. In Sect. 3, we develop the basic model for the delegation game relevant to firm CSR. In Sects. 4 and 5, we derive the equilibrium outcomes when the owner offers the manager an incentive contract, respectively, including consumer surplus and social welfare in addition to the firm’s profit.

An enormous experimental literature addresses cooperation in a variety of laboratory approaches: Sect. 7 offers some general comments. We wish to contribute to it by adopting an extremely simple framework. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma (two persons) and one-shot, three-person, two-alternative Public Good Game. As defined by their experimental payoffs, these games display the following features: The payoffs are symmetric. They are played only once, i.e., they are one-shot games, without repetitions. Players have (at most) two options, a “cooperative” one and a “noncooperative” alternative (these are variously worded in their presentation to the experimental participants). The game has a strictly dominant strategy: the noncooperative alternative of a player strictly payoff-dominates the other one; in other words no matter what the choices of the other player or players are, the payoff to a given player is higher if she chooses not to cooperate than if she chooses to cooperate. Universal cooperation Pareto dominates universal noncooperation. Because of features (4) and (5), these games are often referred to as social dilemmas (Dawes 1980). Features (2)–(4) make the game strategically simple. Because of the dominant-strategy property, there is no need to refer to the (perfect) Cournot–Nash equilibrium for analyzing the game in the experimental payoffs, as is typically the case in repeated games. As long as players maximize the experimental payoffs, their optimizing strategy does not depend on their conjectures of the actions of the other players, and there is no need to refer to an equilibrium condition of consistency among conjectures and actions: a player does not even have to think what the other players are doing or what the equilibrium may be. Feature (3) distinguishes our three-person game from the traditional Public Good contribution game, where each player is endowed with a number of tokens: she can decide how many to contribute to the group account and how many to invest in her private account. In our setup, she only has two alternatives (“she has only one token”), as in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. In fact, this type of game has often been called “N-person Prisoner’s Dilemma” in the literature (Weil 1966). Because our setup removes the possibility of choosing “intermediate” strategies or “avoiding the extremes,” it eliminates some of the complexities in the interpretation of the experimental results in the traditional Public Good Game; see Kümmerli et al. (2010). We are concerned with two difficulties that may appear in experiments of this type. 
Confusion Recent experimental work (Bayer et al. 2013; Burton-Chellew and West 2013; Burton-Chellew et al. 2016; Houser and Kurzban 2002) have found a correlation between cooperative behavior and the participants’ confusion about the game (see also Yamakawa et al. 2016). The just-discussed strategic simplicity of our setup should help offsetting this difficulty. 
Experimenter effect In the words of Cooper and Kagel (2015) “… it is well known that experimental subjects have a tendency to do what they ‘are supposed to do’, trying to figure out what the experimenter wants and then doing it to please him or her”. Footnote 1In order to neutralize this effect, we developed a mechanism for paying the participants that made their decisions fully opaque to the experimenter.Footnote 2
 Our method provides additional evidence on two factors that affect the frequency of cooperation, namely framing and the number of players. We find a strong framing effect and a strong, negative numbers effect (there is less cooperation with three participants than with two). We have also aimed at uncovering the motivations of participants: in their verbal replies, many find cooperation attractive, but are averse at the risk that it entails. This has led us to a treatment that neutralizes that risk, which yields a marked increase in the frequency of cooperation. We first present our experiment (Sects. 2, 3) and its results (Sect. 4). Then we discuss the participants’ comments (Sect. 5) and our conjecture about their thought process (Sect. 6). Section 7 comments on the literature and on our contribution to it, whereas Sect. 8 suggests an extension to any number of players. Section 9 concludes.",3

When we talk about trade liberalization and economic integration, we are interested in measuring financial integration. In this research, we try to provide such a measure in order to verify the financial integration level of two European countries, Greece and Portugal, which were both strongly affected by the global and European crisis in different ways that depended on their specific economic conditions. Greece and Portugal may be considered as “medium size economies” in the European Union, and they are both deeply touched by the crisis. Although both countries suffer from similar problems, such as high public debt and difficulties in budget and trade balances, they have some differences. The problems of Greece are related to its heavy public debt, while the problems of Portugal mostly depend on its deficits. Furthermore, while Greece is still significantly in crisis, Portugal is slowly improving. As a result, it is interesting to compare both countries. The economic and financial crisis that started in 2007 from the USA first touched European countries in 2008. It was followed by a public debt crisis in Europe. These crises affected various economic variables in the affected countries. In this paper, we intend to determine whether the global and European economic crises influenced the financial integration level in the countries we study. We consider a 14-year period from 2000 to 2013 using quarterly data. Choosing this period, if we consider 2007 or 2008 as the start of the crisis, we have an almost equal period before and after the onset of the crisis. This helps us to more efficiently analyze and consider the conditions before and after the crisis. As our period is short, we use quarterly data to have more observations. Also, we believe that quarterly variations and effects have large roles in the results of our analyses. The financial integration level of a country is a measure of its attachment to international financial markets. This attachment helps the country to find an access to foreign financial resources, as well as welcome foreign investment for financing domestic economic projects. The level of such an integration, and also the variations of this level due to factors like global or regional crises, could have important impacts on a country’s economic plans, including its financial and commercial relations with other countries. The objective of this research has been, on the one hand, to study and compare the financial integration level and its variations due to the crisis in the two countries of our study, which are affected in different ways by the global and European crises, and on the other hand, to verify the usefulness of the Feldstein–Horioka thesis as a known but also paradoxical method for measuring international financial integration.",
64,3,International Review of Economics,10 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0271-x,The role of the private sector under insecure property rights,September 2017,Yohei Tenryu,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Interest in studying the relationship between the growth rate of an economy and property rights has been increasing. A large number of historical and empirical studies claim that one of the most important and robust explanations of the differences in economic growth is the occurrence of variations in the institutions regulating property rights (North and Thomas 1973; North 1981, 1990; Knack and Keefer 1995; Acemoglu and Robinson 2001, Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2005; Easterly and Levine 2003; Rodrik et al. 2004; Acemoglu and Johnson 2005; Justesen and Kurrild-Klitgaard 2013; Justesen 2014, 2015; Markus 2015). Developing countries generally have a weak property rights system, and it is widely recognized that such a system can function like a set of shackles, crippling economic progress. Theoretical research in the context of the common-pool problem supports this fact (Gordon 1954; Lancaster 1973; Levhari and Mirman 1980; Reinganum and Stokey 1985; Haurie and Pohjola 1987; Benhabib and Radner 1992; Tornell and Velasco 1992; Dutta and Sundaram 1993; Tornell and Lane 1999). This is called the tragedy of commons. The tragedy of commons occurs when property rights over a productive asset or resource are not secured or cannot be enforced. The typical examples involve cattle grazing in a common pasture by many husbandmen or the joint exploitation of a marine fish population by a finite number of competing fishing fleets. Other good examples include productive assets or resources related to forestry, underground oil, and hunting. In an economy with assets commonly used, each economic agent freely extracts assets without taking the protection of them into account. This noncooperative behavior leads to an excess use of and underinvestment in common assets. Furthermore, the excess use is accelerated by a windfall gain in productivity on common assets. A series of studies by Tornell and Velasco (1992), Lane and Tornell (1996), Tornell (1999), and Tornell and Lane (1999) firstly demonstrated that a higher rate of return on common assets may increase the exploitation of them and thus reduce the rate of economic growth, making a country worse off. This other type of the tragedy of commons is specially referred to as the voracity effect. The voracious behavior of agents has been also attracting widespread interest in multiple areas within economics and political economy (Lindner and Strulik 2004; Mino 2006; Long and Sorger 2006; Itaya and Mino 2007; Di John 2009; van der Ploeg 2010; Arezki and Brückner 2012; Strulik 2012). A novel proposition to alleviate overconsumption of common assets has been pointed out by Tornell and Velasco (1992), Tornell (1999), and Tornell and Lane (1999), who suggest that the private (shadow, informal) sector plays an important role in that process. In the model they present, they introduce the private sector into the economy with multiple interest groups and the common (national, official) sector. Each group appropriates a resource from the common sector and, in the private sector, can use it not only for its consumption but also for investment to accumulate private capital stock. Private capital is secured property not accessible by the other groups, but it is less productive. In other words, groups in the economy have respective private sectors and accumulate their own capital. Their research has shown that, under some circumstances, the introduction of secure but less productive capital stock increases the growth rate of the common sector. However, their research focuses on only one direction of capital flow from the common sector to the private sector. A significant body of research has discussed the importance of the other direction of capital flow, namely from the private sector to the common sector. Schneider (2008), for example, showed empirically that a fraction of the earnings in the private sector are immediately spent in the common sector. Loayza (1996) used an endogenous growth model to show that an increase in the size of the private sector negatively affects growth. He also found this result to be observable empirically by using data from Latin America. By contrast, this negative correlation between economic growth and the private sector has been rejected by calculations for Canada and New Zealand.Footnote 1 In addition, Schneider (2008) has shown that the private sector has a positive effect on economic growth. Thus, the role of the private sector in economic growth remains ambiguous. Other lines of literature on the common-pool problem and the voracity effect are as follows. Berkes (1986), Pinkerton (1989), Ostrom (1990), and Tang (1992) demonstrated that under some conditions, local groups using a common property regime could manage common assets quite well and suggested that government and private property were not the only way to manage their assets. These studies focus on how to manage efficiently the common asset but do not consider the private assets. Benhabib and Radner (1992), Tornell (1997) and Lindner and Strulik (2008) assumed that agents use trigger strategies. Benhabib and Radner (1992) showed that an efficient trigger-strategy equilibrium exists. Tornell (1997) and Lindner and Strulik (2008) analyze the features of endogenous property rights. Mino (2006) and Itaya and Mino (2007) considered variable labor–leisure choices by changing the linear production function to an increasing-returns production function. They showed that the overconsumption of the common assets could be improved. Strulik (2012) used a Stone–Geary utility function instead of a CRRA utility function in order to reconsider the voracity effect. He showed that voracious behavior is situation specific and occurs when an economy is in decline and sufficiently close to stagnation. Lindner and Strulik (2004) presented the long-run equilibrium and development dynamics in the neoclassical growth model and a simple model of endogenous growth in the absence of secure property rights and compared the results with the outcome in a corresponding model with secure property rights. They showed that there exists a considerable gain in the level and growth of consumption from establishing secure property rights and that economic performance without property rights worsens with an increase in the number of competing social groups. These studies considered only common assets. Long and Sorger (2006), on the other hand, dealt with not only common assets but also private assets. They extended the Tornell and Velasco (1992) model by adding a private appropriation cost and utility from wealth and showed that an increase in appropriation cost lowers the growth rate of the common capital stock. In their model, however, the capital flow from common to private is not considered. The aims of this paper are to study how the introduction of capital flow from the private sector to the common sector affects the growth rate of an economy, and how this is related to the voracious behaviors of competing interest groups. In so doing, we extend the Tornell and Velasco (1992) model by introducing a flow of capital from the private sector to the common sector, postulating a scenario in which a fraction of each interest group’s private capital stock is invested in the common sector. In this situation, the obtained results are as follows. First, we show that the balanced growth rates are independent of the technology level in the common sector. This implies that there is no standard voracity effect in the sense that Tornell and Lane (1999) define. We also show that, when each group values the opponents’ private capital, their capital has a positive effect on a group’s equilibrium consumption strategy. Finally, we show that an increase in the contribution rate leads to an increase in appropriation, and hence the balanced growth becomes slow. The paper predicts that a contribution from the private sector to the common sector has a negative effect on economic growth. This suggests also that there exist other possible causes of voracious behavior. Therefore, our remaining sections in this paper provide a detailed analysis of this issue. In Sect. 2, the model, a solution concept, and each group’s maximization problem are described. Section 3 goes on to characterize the balanced growth equilibrium in a special case of the model. In Sect. 4, a general case will be considered and the balanced growth comparative statics will be numerically analyzed. Lastly, Sect. 5 discusses some conclusions.",

Payne,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Within the modernization theory set forth by Lipset (1959), it is postulated that education is crucial in fostering democracy. According to Lipset (1959), education enhances the interaction with others, encourages the spread of knowledge, and raises the benefit of civic participation through voting and organizing which empowers citizens to engage with government institutions. As noted by Acemoglu et al. (2005, p. 44), Lipset (1959, p. 79) states, “Education presumably broadens men’s outlooks, enables them to understand the need for norms of tolerance, restrains them from adhering to extremist and monistic doctrines, and increases their capacity to make rational electoral choices.” Lipset (1959, p. 80) further states, “If we cannot say that a ‘high’ level of education is a sufficient condition for democracy, the available evidence does suggest that it comes close to being a necessary condition.” The assertion by Lipset (1959) has generated several empirical studies as of late to determine whether or not education has a positive impact on democracy (see Barro 1999; Glaeser et al. 2004; Acemoglu et al. 2005; Bobba and Coviello 2007; Glaeser et al. 2007; Castello-Climent 2008; and Papaioannou and Siourounis 2008). The results of these studies have yielded somewhat mixed results using fixed effects and generalized method of moments estimation. However, unlike previous studies which rely on the use of panel data of 5-year intervals, we utilize time series data for a panel of 169 countries and the Bierens and Martins’ (2010) time-varying cointegration approach to answer the question posed by Acemoglu et al. (2005, p. 48), “Is there no long-run causal relationship between education and democracy?” Rather than rely on standard panel cointegration tests in which the long-run coefficient estimates are time invariant, we allow for the coefficient estimates to vary over time to better reflect how the long-run relationship between democracy and education has evolved over time. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the education–democracy literature. Section 3 presents the data, methodology, and results while concluding remarks are given in Sect. 4.",3
64,4,International Review of Economics,30 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0275-6,A social contract approach to sustainability,December 2017,Giuseppe Danese,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The modern large business company has gained importance as a major emitter of pollutants and user of natural resources. Heede (2014) finds that 90 companies (50 of which investor-owned and the rest under state control) caused 63% of human-made emissions between 1751 and 2010. About half of these emissions were produced since 1986, a clear sign that companies are increasingly responsible for emissions. James Gustave Speth aptly remarked that: “If capitalism is a growth machine, corporations are doing the growing. If growth is destroying the environment, then corporations are doing most of the destroying” (Speth 2008, p. 165). The firm’s role as polluter and user of natural resources is an instance of its ability to make an impact on the rights and welfare of a variety of groups and individuals, the “stakeholders” of the firm.Footnote 1 The term sustainability (cf. WCED 1987) refers to the need to ensure that current decisions by individuals and organizations regarding emissions and use of natural resources will not have a negative impact on the welfare of future generations. Sustainability is a topic that has attracted a large body of research in business studies (cf. e.g., Fox et al. 2010; Steurer et al. 2005; DesJardins 1998; Jeurissen and Keijzers 2004; Shrivastava 1995) as well as in economics (cf. the essays in Roemer and Suzumura 2007 and Endres 2010, Part 6). While trying to articulate their obligations to the stakeholders of the firm, present and future, managers might find themselves locked in a moral dilemma about the effect of any decision they make on some category (cf. Jensen 2001). Social contractFootnote 2 models in business ethics and economics have emerged as a possible answer to this problem. The two most influential models of the social contract of the stakeholders, Sacconi (2006) and Donaldson and Dunfee (1999), do not explicitly address, however, the problem of the firm’s obligations to future generations. This paper hopes to fill this gap by analyzing three reformulations of the social contract. The first views the stakeholders as heads of families concerned with their progeny. The second views the social contract as the result of a grand meeting of stakeholders from all generations. The third, which I find most defensible, views the social contract as the result of a hypothetical meeting of current stakeholders, who adopt a thick veil of ignorance. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 I briefly review a leading social contract account of the firm, Lorenzo Sacconi’s. I focus on this model because it incorporates a bargaining problem among the stakeholders from which an objective for the firm is derived. I then offer an assessment of this objective from the point of view of the sustainability agenda. After having argued that the model’s usefulness is limited in this regard, I move to possible amendments to the SC (Sect. 3). I then discuss in greater details the notion of reciprocity, which is central to one of the proposals. Final remarks follow.",1
64,4,International Review of Economics,05 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0276-5,"Corporate social responsibility, profits and welfare with managerial firms",December 2017,Luciano Fanti,Domenico Buccella,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the recent years, the debate on firms’ social responsibility has been raised more frequently also in the academic literature (e.g. Baron 2001, 2009; Jensen 2001; Goering 2007, 2008; Lambertini and Tampieri 2010; Benabou and Tirole 2010). According to a well-known classification (Garriga and Melè 2004), the most relevant corporate social responsibility (henceforth, CSR) theories and related approaches are focused on one of the following aspects of social reality: economics, politics, social integration and ethics. Needless to say, the realm of economics is that concerning our approach, according to which corporation is an instrumentFootnote 1 for wealth creation whose sole social responsibility is the maximisation of shareholder value (for instance measured by the share price) which in turn, in the standard industrial organisation literature, leads to a short-term profits orientation. In such a context (where the shareholder value maximisation is the supreme reference for corporate decision-making, as in the basic Cournot model), there is no room for CSR (unless the latter directly or indirectly positively affects economic costs of firms).Footnote 2
 In the context of the basic Cournot model, the conventional wisdom as regards the welfare effects of the introduction of social concerns in the firms’ behaviour argues that, in general, increasing social concern or responsibility of the firms is necessarily welfare improving. For example, this is the view prevailing in the European Union and between most scholars.Footnote 3 On the other hand, profits are expected to reduce adopting CSR behaviour, although recently it has been argued that shareholder value maximisation is not incompatible with satisfying certain interests of people with a stake in the firm (stakeholders) provided that it is specified a long-term value maximisation rather than the short-run profit maximisation, such as the “enlightened value maximisation” proposed by Jensen (2000).
 In this paper, we show that this conventional wisdom is not necessarily true, since the effects of adopting CSR behaviours on profits and social welfare may be also dependent upon (1) the interaction between the strategic market context in which the socially concerned firms operate; and (2) the choice of hiring or not a manager for delegating the strategic choices. For showing this, we adopt the Cournot duopoly model with managers following the managerial delegation literature (e.g. Vickers 1985; Fershtman and Judd 1987). As widely observed in real world, CSR rules are often adopted by large corporations where ownership and control are separated. In fact, according to the KPMG Survey of Corporate responsibility reporting (2013), 93% among the world’s largest 250 companies records CRS activities. Forbes (2014) reports the results of the Reputation Institute (2014) CSR survey, which confirms that the world’s top ten companies with the best CSR reputations are widely known large, managerial companies.Footnote 4
 In particular, we aim to answer the following research questions. First, which effect has firms’ social responsibility on quantity, price, consumer surplus and total welfare? Second, as to firms, could it pay off to be socially responsible? Third, as to consumers and society, is the adoption of socially responsible rules by firms really welfare improving? We assume that the shareholders may instruct their manager to pursue social objectives (represented, as usual in the literature, by an interest for the welfare of consumers); however, as in the standard profit-seeking world, the choice of the manager’s incentive contract by shareholders aims to maximise profits. This could mean that the stakeholder participation in governance is in hiring managers selecting the optimal output level according to the stakeholder interests; nevertheless, it does not extend down to stipulate manager’s contracts. The current paper contributes to the literature by providing with a description in “strategic” terms of the multi-various phenomenon of the CSR. Several scholars have focused their attention on the reasons that lead companies to embrace CSR behaviours (Baron 2001, 2009; García-Gallego and Georgantzís 2009; Benabou and Tirole 2010; Reinhardt and Stavins 2010; Lambertini and Tampieri 2010). Baron (2001) put emphasis on the fact that companies may strategically follow CSR rules because guided by their selfishness. In fact, “social activists” such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can directly exercise “social pressure” on companies to adopt “responsible behaviours” through threats (boycott, negative propaganda) or rewards (endorsements). As a consequence, CSR can simply be a keen response to that pressure. On the other hand, Benabou and Tirole’s (2010) standpoint is that several interacting motivations (ranging from pure altruism to material motivation, social and self-esteem concerns) lead firms to pro-social CSR behaviour. Moreover, as Reinhardt and Stavins (2010) argue, if there are customers willing to pay for ethical goods, and this can be profitable, CSR arises as a strategy like any other form of product differentiation: according to the basic economics, the opportunity emerges because of the presence of asymmetric information, economies of scale, intellectual-property protection and the successful defence of the ensuing niche against imitators. Nonetheless, the previous contributions do not deal with the issue of managerial delegation with firms of CSR-type, a subject which has been scanty studied in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, few exceptions are three recent articles: Goering (2007); Kopel and Brand (2012); Manasakis et al. (2014). Goering (2007) investigates a mixed duopoly setting in which a private non-profit CSR firm competes with a private profit-maximising company. The stakeholders of the CSR firm select a contract for their managers. The author focuses on the Stackelberg competition mode, in which the non-profit firm is the market leader and he shows that, in subgame perfect equilibria, the managers of the leading company generally will not be given the true objective function to optimise. Manasakis et al. (2014) study the incentives of firms’ owners to commit voluntarily to CSR activities in oligopoly. Their approach is slightly different because the socially responsible attributes are attached to products, with consumers forming expectations about their existence and level. In other words, those authors consider the “demand-side” (the consumers’) CSR preferences, while the above-mentioned works mainly focuses on the “supply-side” (the firms’) CSR preferences, in the sense that firms choose the quantity to supply to maximise also consumers’ interests. The key result is that hiring an “individually” socially responsible manager and delegating to him the CSR effort and market decisions represents a commitment device for the firm’s owners and credibly signals to consumers that the firm will undertake CSR activities. Differently from the two above-mentioned papers, Kopel and Brand (2012) investigate, similarly to the current paper, the “strategic” role played by CSR (measured by the interest for consumer’s surplus by shareholders) in a game-theoretic context in the frame of the Cournot model.Footnote 5
 Similar to Goering (2007), those authors analyse a mixed quantity-setting duopoly in which a socially concerned firm competes with a profit-maximising firm. Both firms may opt to hire a manager who determines the output to produce on behalf of the firm’s owner. To hire a manager and delegate the output choice emerges as subgame perfect equilibrium for both firms. In the case of similar cost of production, the CSR firm has both a higher market share and profit. The relationship between the share of consumer surplus the CSR firm takes into account and its profit is non-monotonic: in fact, as the share increases, the CSR firm’s profit first increases and then decreases. However, all those contributions assume that stakeholders may decide also on manager’s contracts and, in any case, they do not study an endogenously determined equilibrium in a duopoly with both CSR firms.Footnote 6 Hence, this paper aims to fill this gap. Although numerous articles have explored the empirical relationship between CSR performance and profitability performance, their results have often been contradictory (even within a given analysis) and, thus, no definitive consensus exists. For instance (1), most researchers have found only a negative relationship (see, inter alias, Bromiley and Marcus 1989; Davidson et al. 1987; Davidson and Worrel 1988); (2) some others have found an inconclusive relationship (e.g. Aupperle et al. 1985; Ingram and Frazier 1983); and (3) however, there is also an increasing number of articles showing a positive correlation between the social responsibility and financial performance of corporations (e.g. Griffin and Mahon 1997; Roman et al. 1999; Waddock and Graves 1997). It is shown that under managerial delegation, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) implies that both firms follow CSR rules, and the firms’ profitability is always enhanced by their sensitivity to consumer surplus. This means that, if managers are delegated to select the optimal output following CSR rules, then the choice of firms to be CSR is due to economic convenience instead of altruistic behaviour.Footnote 7 On the other hand, such a choice results to be welfare damaging, despite it aims to protect the consumers’ interests. These results contrast the conventional wisdom. The theoretical and empirical implications are rather intriguing. As regards the former implication, we recall that these unconventional results are obtained in a standard model in which owners instruct their managers to maximise not only the short-term profits (i.e. the shareholder value) but also the consumer’s surplus. As regards the latter implication, we note that our model may provide the theoretical basis, rather unexpectedly, also within the “instrumental theory” of CSR for explaining some of the empirical findings showing a positive correlation between CSR performances and profitability performances. Therefore, these findings may be important for the current policy debate on firms’ social concern, in particular as regards social welfare as well as the motivation for the firm’s owner to take into account the objectives of the stakeholders of his own firm. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the model setup, and Sect. 3, after having determined the SPNE in which both firms follows CSR rules, summarises the results. The last section concludes our findings.",41

Sugden also mentions that there is evidence from experimental games (as in the Market Game or the Trust Game) that cooperative behavior occurs quite frequently (Sugden 2015; see also Colman et al. 2008; Guala et al. 2013). To account for these observations, Sugden proposes to rely on the notion of team reasoning. As Sugden puts it: We need a theory: in which team members aim to achieve their common interests, not to maximise a common utility function; in which individuals act on team reasoning only if they have assurance that sufficient other members of the team will do so too; in which individually rational choice is not used as a benchmark for defining mutual benefit; and in which team reasoners can coordinate their behaviour by following preexisting practices that are less than optimal.Footnote 1
 To define the common interest of team reasoners, Sugden introduces the notion of “mutually beneficial practice.”Footnote 2 A mutually beneficial practice for an n-player game is a strategy profile which embodies two conditions. The first condition requires that each agent’s gain must be higher than his maximin payoff. The second condition requires that for any arbitrary group of agents there exists one group member for whom the gain with the practice is strictly higher than the gain he obtains when all nonmembers minimize his utility. We know very little about the conditions under which a mutually beneficial practice exists. Yet we know a little more about the existence of a Berge equilibrium in normal-form games. A Berge equilibrium is a strategy profile such that a unilateral change of strategy by any one player cannot increase another player’s payoff.Footnote 3 This paper provides two sufficient conditions under which a strict Berge equilibrium is a mutually beneficial practice. A strict Berge equilibrium is a Berge equilibrium in which a unilateral change of strategy by any one player decreases all the other agents payoffs. Our two sufficient conditions essentially ensure that a strict Berge equilibrium satisfies the first condition defining a mutually beneficial practice (that is, for each agent the equilibrium gain must be strictly higher than his maximin gain). We also show that in two-person two-action games a strategy profile is a mutually beneficial practice if, and only if, it is a Berge equilibrium in which the gain of each agent is higher than his maximin gain.Footnote 4
 The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we present Sugden’s mutually beneficial practice. Section 3 studies two sufficient conditions under which a strict Berge equilibrium is a mutually beneficial practice. Then, Sect. 4 illustrates and contrasts these conditions with three examples. Section 5 contains some brief concluding remarks.",9
64,4,International Review of Economics,04 July 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0282-7,"Trust, risk and time preferences: evidence from survey data",December 2017,Giuseppe Albanese,Guido de Blasio,Paolo Sestito,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A huge literature in the field of social sciences makes clear the importance of trust for economic transactions. It has been suggested that trust has a positive effect on economic growth (Knack and Keefer 1997; Zak and Knack 2001), international trade (Guiso et al. 2009), the development of financial markets (Guiso et al. 2004) and the functioning of the labour market (Aghion et al. 2011). Guiso et al. (2010) provide a recent review. Nevertheless, the definition and the measurement of trust are an elusive task. While trust is commonly identified in terms of beliefs about others’ trustworthiness (see for instance Gambetta 1988), recent literature has increasingly focused on the role of preferences in explaining trust (Fehr 2009; Sapienza et al. 2013). This might have important consequences. First, in a policy perspective, disentangling preferences from beliefs is essential: “preferences are not easily malleable, meaning that economic policy cannot shape them. Nor it is clear whether implementing policies that deliberately aim at shaping people’s preferences is desirable. The other component of trust, however, namely, beliefs about other’s trustworthiness, may be more easily affected” (Fehr 2009). Furthermore, from an econometric point of view, neglecting preferences when analysing the role of trust in explaining socio-economic outcomes can lead into a classical omitted variable problem, as trust endowments and socio-economic behaviour can both be affected by primitives. This problem, of course, is not peculiar to this field: for instance, previous literature (see Barsky et al. 1997) has shown that risk and time preferences may determine both health status and socio-economic outcomes, thereby causing the correlation between those variables. More in general, the interest in modelling preferences remains strong and scholars debate how these parameters could be introduced in economic models (see, for example, recent contributions by Masatlioglu and Ok 2007; Netzer 2009; Benhabib et al. 2010) and the importance of distinguishing between them (Andreoni and Sprenger 2012; Epper and Fehr-Duda 2015). Surveys and experiments are increasingly being used to elicit trust. Needless to say, measures of trust based on experimental games have several advantages owing to the controlled environment. However, if survey questions capture exactly people’s willingness to trust others, for the reason that answers are based on introspection about past behaviour, what we expect is that this measure will be influenced by the same factors that determine the daily act of trust. Moreover, survey data are widely available and have broad coverage, so that several papers use them when analysing the effect of trust at both micro level (e.g. financial decisions) and macro-level (e.g. growth, regulation). In short: much of the current debate on the role of trust for socio-economic behaviours is based on survey evidence (see, for instance, the review papers by Fernandez 2008 and Alesina and Giuliano 2015). It is crucial, therefore, to understand what the survey measures of trust actually capture, since both beliefs and preferences vary among individuals and populations. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the connection between trust, risk and time preferences in a large representative survey. To this aim, we first make use of the Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), in which a section on socio-economic behaviour was explicitly included for the purpose of this paper. On this regard, our investigation represents the first of this type using Italian data; more importantly, thanks to the 2010 SHIW design, we can distinguish the role of economic primitives for measures of trust featured by different degrees of “generalism” (while previous surveys do not allow to do this). However, we consider also the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to gauge the role of social preferences and personality traits, for which no proxy is available in the SHIW. Throughout the analysis, the reference definition is that of trust as a behaviour. This formulation is based on Coleman (1990). More recently, it has been restated by Fehr (2009), who shows that responses to the trust question might capture preferences other than beliefs about people’s trustworthiness. We add to this literature in several ways. First, we show that not only risk preferences but also time preferences are key negative predictors of self-reported trusting behaviour. Second, we document that this role of preferences refers to generalized trust, while the impact on trust in known people is quite different: risk aversion is positively correlated with an index of particularized trusting behaviour. The paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces the main argument: like other socio-economic behaviours, the decision to trust might depend on risk and time preferences. Section 3 provides the relevant empirical evidence. The last section concludes with a discussion of our findings.",44

65,1,International Review of Economics,04 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-017-0283-6,Do internal references lead to wage rigidity?,March 2018,Matthias Strifler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Based on abundant empirical and experimental evidence on fairness and reciprocity (Fehr et al. 2009; Falk et al. 2008; Bewley 2007; Bruni et al. 2008; Wilson and Dixon 2008), theoretical modeling by Danthine and Kurmann (DK) (2006, 2007, 2010) and Koskela and Schöb (KS) (2009) shows that internal referencesFootnote 1 can lead to a substantial increase in wage rigidity. These prominent studies find that the effect on wage rigidity is unambiguous, in case of both technology (KS 2009; DK 2007) and monetary shocks (DK 2007, 2010). Only DK (2010) find an ambiguous effect in case of a technology shock. All three models are at the core of the theoretical literature on internal references and wage rigidity. As such they set the standard of how we understand internal references and their connection to wage rigidity. Given these contradictory results in DK (2010), DK (2007) and KS (2009), this study analyzes the potentially ambiguous effect of internal references on wage rigidity in these models. The study provides calibration and parametrization results and analytical proofs which show that the effect is ambiguous in DK (2007) and KS (2009). In fact it is ambiguous in case of both, technology as well as monetary shocks. Furthermore, the study reveals that the unambiguity in case of a monetary shock in DK (2010) is not robust to a minor change of the references, which mainly consists of the inclusion of unemployment benefits into the external reference, respectively, outside option. Analyzing the model’s wage dynamics through impulse response functions shows that the internal reference can also increase wage volatility. Thus, the effect is equally ambiguous. As a consequence, contrary to the findings of the literature, there is a common pattern that internal references do not unambiguously imply wage rigidity. The intuition for this result is similar in all three models. The internal reference forms a weighted average with the outside option. Thus, an increase of the weight on the internal reference implies a simultaneous decrease in the weight on the outside option. Consequently, it is not sufficient to focus only on the effect the internal reference has on wage rigidity. What matters is the effect of the internal reference relative to the external reference. If the effect is relatively stronger, wage rigidity increases. If the effect is relatively weaker, wage rigidity decreases. This paper adds to the understanding of the effects of reciprocity in labor relations and its connection to, respectively, influence on wage rigidity. All three models discussed and developed upon in this analysis, build on reciprocity-based efficiency wage considerations. Reciprocity is thereby focused on worker behavior. Workers who care about fairness reciprocate a generous wage offer by providing a higher level of effort. This is also referred to as gift-exchange which is a specific form of reciprocal behavior namely positive reciprocity (see, e.g., Fehr and Henrich 2003). As firms understand and anticipate workers’ motivation, the wage-setting process changes considerably with its aforementioned complicated consequences for wage flexibility. Therefore, the specific analysis of wage rigidity and wage dynamics potentially leads to important insights regarding the nature of reciprocity in labor relations. As such the paper complements the literature on reciprocity in the workplace which thus far is more focused on microeconomic questions. Dohmen et al. (2009) provide survey evidence that positive reciprocity tends to increase effort and in turn makes workers receive higher wages. Dur (2009) in turn presents a model which reveals that reciprocity can lead to the opposite result: lower compensation. Such an outcome can result if the manager offers a lot of attention to the worker. Dur et al. (2010) show that more reciprocal workers are more likely to receive promotion incentives. Englmaier and Leider (2012) again find that reciprocity goes with generous compensation especially when output is a poor signal of effort. Manna and De Chiara (2016) present a principal-agent model where reciprocity can mitigate conflicts of interest. All three models analyzed in this paper, but especially DK (2007, 2010) provide a micro-foundation of workers’ preferences which follows a similar concept of reciprocity. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to shed more light on reciprocity in worker relations from a more macroeconomic perspective.Footnote 2
 Section 2 discusses the DK (2007) model and analyzes the equilibrium wage elasticity after real and monetary shock, respectively. Section 3 presents the DK (2010) model and discusses wage dynamics in case of a technology shock. A modification of the original model is introduced with focus on unemployment benefits, and wage dynamics analyzed after a monetary shock. Section 4 reviews the KS (2009) model and analyzes the equilibrium wage elasticity after a technology shock. The last section concludes. A full description and derivation of all three models is found in “Appendix”.",1

(1993) and Falk and Gächter (2002a, b).Footnote 1 The most popular explanations for employee motivation are worker engagement,Footnote 2 i.e., positive attitudes toward one’s own job or firm, and guilt aversion (Battigalli and Dufwenberg 2007). In this paper, we compare three different scenarios of employee motivation: a scenario wherein worker engagement hinges on the surprise or disappointment triggered by the wage offered by the employer, a second scenario where intention-based reciprocity drives worker engagement and a third scenario where a worker’s effort stems from guilt aversion. All three models developed here belong to the class of psychological games (Geanakoplos et al. 1989; Battigalli and Dufwenberg 2009), which refers to games where players’ expectations may enter their utility functions. The first scenario brings into play the surprise (positive or negative) of a worker (the agent) following a wage offered by the employer (the principal). Gneezy and List (2006), Bellemare and Shearer (2009) and Kube et al. (2006) show that workers respond to a surprise bonus, or to a wage higher than expected, by working harder. Choi (2014) and van Wesep (2010) also demonstrate that signing bonuses may trigger an employer–employee reciprocal relationship. Surprise is generally an important aspect of gift giving,Footnote 3 and an agent could return the gift of a higher-than-expected wage by working harder and vice versa. In equilibrium, strategies and beliefs must be consistent, and this induces the principal to randomize between a high and a low wage. When receiving the low wage, the worker is disappointedFootnote 4 and works less than if paid the low wage with certainty. We thus find that the principal may be worse off under this scenario than when facing an agent insensitive to surprise. In the second scenario, a worker may reciprocate a good treatment by working harder if he believes that the good treatment was not solely intended to increase the employer’s profits. This brings into play intention-based reciprocity, as introduced by Rabin (1993) and extended to sequential games by Battigalli and Dufwenberg (2009). This concept receives good support in experiments (Charness and Haruvy 2002; Charness 2004; Cox 2004; Falk et al. 2008; Bacharach et al. 2007; Stanca et al. 2009). We find that the principal fares better with an agent displaying intention-based reciprocity than with an agent only responsive to surprise. Compared to the surprise scenario, an employee reciprocating according to the principal’s intention makes “cold” calculations in terms of the amount of work he should exert in return. Such behavior is in line with Brackett et al. (2011), who show that employees in better control of their emotions are more productive. The third scenario introduces guilt in the relationship. Weber (1958) argues that the Protestant ethic moral justifies positive attitudes toward money and wealth accumulation, which is the root of the capitalist system and the success of the societies embracing it. According to Weber (1958), Protestants are endowed with a capitalist spirit based on pride associated with hard work and guilt associated with wasting time and talent. These themes are at the center of the Protestant (work) ethic scales developed by Blood (1969) and Mirels and Garret (1971). Whether Protestants have a better work ethic than, say Catholics, or whether work values create or result from the economic environment people evolve in is debated,Footnote 5 but such values are undoubtedly behind worker performance. As shown in Mirels and Garret (1971), Protestant ethic scores tend to be positively correlated with Mosher (1966)’s Morality-Conscience Guilt Inventory. This suggests that greater work effort may be the result of an employee’s guilt aversion (Battigalli and Dufwenberg 2007). Using the wage as a signal of desired productivity, the principal may induce a guilt-averse agent to work harder. Out of our three models, the guilt-aversion scenario yields the best outcome for the principal. The next section describes the general model and outlines the different scenarios. Section 3 discusses worker engagement with surprise, Sect. 4 discusses intention-based reciprocity, Sect. 5 discusses guilt aversion, and Sect. 6 concludes.",

A very substantial body of research on inequality has been accumulated, building on the potential of improved data and focused on clarifying concepts and measures, capturing trends, and understanding the causal processes operating in the economy. Inequality has now become the focus of remarkably wide-ranging attention, from International Institutions, Government Reports and finally, also academic journals across a variety of disciplines. As Tony Atkinson observed in a “pioneering” article (Atkinson 1997), the personal income distribution was brought in “from the cold” only at the end of the 1990s. The question is “why should economists ‘care’ about inequality”? Equity is a fundamental value in democracies. It is connected to the functioning of the economic system (Atkinson 1997). Economic inequalities can be conceived of as the outcome of the underlying economic process which produces other economic effects. Individual differences provide behavioral incentives to work, save, or take an entrepreneurial risk. Inequalities tend to be self-enforcing and self-sustaining. Inequality in one space or for one group may connect with equality in another space or for other groups. Linkages and effects among and between inequalities are not necessarily obvious, and their revealing requires analytical effort. More recently, considerable attention has been paid to the ways in which higher inequality could act as an obstacle to growth. Social protection and more broadly the Welfare State (e.g., via education and health care) can potentially provide an environment that stimulates rather than undermines economic growth. Even more important it is the understanding that policies might improve both equity and efficiency simultaneously and avoid the trade-off between them. Special attention has been paid to the role of institutions. Differences in institutions and policies are likely to play an important role in explaining the different levels and trends of wage and capital income inequality across countries. Inequality in income distribution in industrialized countries is very high and increases with the rise of per-capita income. A forty-year trend of increasing inequality, common to many advanced economies, deserves research to discover the forces which are deeply rooted “within modern industrial capitalism” (Solow 2014, p. 2). Growing inequality leads to the discussion of issues such as how different sources of inequality can be analyzed and what set of concrete proposals aimed at reducing it can be put forward. We can find some answers and proposals in two recent books: Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” (2014a) and Atkinson’s “Inequality. What can be done?” (2015). Piketty’s work is an impressive empirical research on inequality and its persistence over time, with particular reference to the “sustainability” of capitalist systems in which inequality is increasing. An empirical analysis of inequality in wealth and income distribution in the long run had never been carried out before Piketty’s book (Piketty 2014a, b). Therefore, it has already sparked and will continue to promote a very rich and innovative debate in the future. “Post-Piketty, the public-intellectual debate over inequality, economic policy and equitable growth ought to focus differently” argue the editors of a very recent book collecting essays from economists and sociologists (Boushey et al. 2017, p. 1). “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” and in the many reviews, comments, and critics that followed its publication are packed with so many topics, insights, comments, and observations. In this essay, we will focus mainly on the factors that can explain the trends concerning the concentration of wealth and personal income distribution. The functional distribution of income between capital and labor, the increase in capital share in national income, and the concentration of wealth are of course very important factors. The relation between them, which pushes toward greater inequality in income and wealth, is well identified in Piketty’s macro-setting. “Capital in the XXI Century” discusses trends in inequality of income and wealth in many countries, and in different periods, taking into account the relation between capital and growth. However, the personal income-generating process, and its links with inequality, is not really analyzed. In his last book, Atkinson (2015) brings his theoretical and practical experience to bear on the multifaceted features of income inequality. He presents a comprehensive set of policies that could bring about a genuine shift in the distribution of income in developed countries. Atkinson claims that fresh ideas are needed in order to reduce inequality. It is necessary to go beyond imposing new taxes on the wealthy. His quite ambitious set of policies requires an analytical innovative framework aimed at identifying the micro- and the macro-variables which are sources of personal income distribution and therefore of inequality. It is necessary to introduce a framework in order to “make a link between incomes at the macroeconomic level (national accounts) and incomes at the level of the household” (Atkinson 2009, p. 1). As Atkinson claims, the relationships between “factor shares … and inequality in the personal distribution of income … is the principal problem of political economy” (Atkinson 2009, p. 1). This framework, as we will show, can be set up starting from individual endowments and their links to the productive structure, which is what we can call the “generating function of personal income.” The outline of the paper is the following. After Introduction (Sect. 1), Sect. 2 introduces Piketty’s analytical framework. Section 3 discusses the “fundamental contradiction of capitalism,” that is how the inequality r > g in the long run leads to a higher concentration of wealth. In this section, the authors argue that Piketty’s approach is only partially suitable to explain growing inequality in personal income distribution. Section 4 introduces a general framework that can link functional and personal income distribution. The framework introduced here seems to be a suitable tool to take into account the fact that personal income distribution is inextricably tied up with different sources of inequality in the distribution of income from factors such as those related to the institutional and productive structures and those that come from the distribution of endowments and from individual/household entitlements. Remarks on the relevance of the proposed framework for the assessment of reducing inequality’ policies conclude the paper (Sect. 5).",2

Related studies have considered the use of written press, of radio, of TV, of the internet and, most recently, of social network sites (SNS). In fact, the use of SNS such as Facebook and Twitter has increased in recent years (e.g., Cole et al. 2016; Newman et al. 2016) and, therefore, plays an increasingly important role in the daily life of individuals throughout the world. Consequently, the use of SNS is an increasingly important factor shaping people’s life satisfaction (Stanca 2016). Investigating factors that have an impact on people’s life satisfaction has been the goal of happiness economists for years (Di Tella and MacCulloch 2006; Bruni et al. 2008; Dolan et al. 2008; Bruni and Porta 2009; Frey 2010; Becchetti and Pelloni 2013; Frey and Stutzer 2013; Frey et al. 2014; Weimann et al. 2015; Bruni and Porta 2016; Stanca 2016) and is, of course, of particular relevance. After all, people’s life satisfaction, which can be understood as a lasting, complete and justified satisfaction with life as a whole (Frey and Stutzer 2000), may have profound aggregate social effects. However, there is still very little research on how media users are influenced by social events, i.e., by occurrences such as national elections, economic crises as well as major sports events, which not only affect individuals (e.g., Odermatt and Stutzer 2017), but have consequences for a broader share of a society or even for the whole society in a country. After all, while previous research has investigated how specific social events affect people’s life satisfaction (e.g., Steiner et al. 2015), interactions between media use and social events have not found much attention so far. Therefore, in this article, I investigate whether and how social events affect media users’ life satisfaction. More specifically, this study investigates whether social events, which, as I argue, have different impact levels and consequences, affect media users’ life satisfaction differently depending on the type of media they use. Of particular interest are differences between less interactive media types such as written press, radio and TV and more interactive media types such as the internet in general and SNS specifically. After all, I assume that social events will trigger waves of emotional contagion, which, however, will spread more effectively through media types, which are more interactive and therefore will affect the life satisfaction of those individuals more effectively, who use these media types to a higher extent. Moreover, this study investigates whether social events reinforce and buffer the effects of media use on media users’ life satisfaction or whether they shape the directions of these effects. In the following, I will first give an overview of previous research, which has investigated how the use of different types of media or specific social events affect people’s life satisfaction. Thereafter, I will introduce my theoretical framework and formulate hypotheses. Afterward, I will describe the applied methods of this study, present and discuss the results and draw conclusions.",9

For example, under some assumptions, free competition determines the Pareto efficiency, which is a necessary condition for maximum social welfare. It has also been emphasized that social orders that are convenient for the community can emerge spontaneously over time from the interaction of individuals.Footnote 1 However, the assumption that individuals are selfish is too strong and pessimistic. It does not correspond to reality in many cases. One of the topics studied by Pier Luigi Porta, to whose memory I would like to dedicate this article, regards the non-selfish behavior of many individuals and the attention that they show for the common good. Many features are associated with this behavior, and numerous analyses have been proposed in this regard.Footnote 2
 This paper aims to analyze the extreme case in which all agents wish to pursue the common good. I have not found any treatment of this case, which is not important for describing economic reality (the angelic world is not on Earth), but it can be useful to look at the theme of social organization without linking it to the selfishness of individuals. The following question is relevant. In an economy with decentralized actions, is the common desire of agents to pursue the common good sufficient to achieve it? Alternatively, does the achievement of the common good, which all agents pursue, require that the choices of the agents are coordinated appropriately? The answer to this question is searched in this paper by framing the behavior of agents in the usual economic analysis. In the current economic theory, where economic decisions are decentralized, as in the economy of private property, the state of society is described assuming that the agents, who compose it, make choices, in the sense that the action of each agent is, by assumption, the action that he/she prefers among the actions that are available for him/her. A preference ordering is, consequently, associated to every agent. Under conditions normally accepted, this ordering is represented by a function, which is a (ordinal) utility function if the agent in question is a consumer or the profit function if the agent is a firm. Therefore, the choice of each agent is described by the maximization of an objective function constrained to the set of actions possible to him/her. Normally it also assumed that preferences of each agent are selfish, that is, for each agent, the objective function takes into account only goods pertaining to the agent in question. In the current economic theory, each agent (consumer or firm) performs the action that is the best, in the set of feasible actions, with respect to his/her selfish objective function. Often, in economic theory, also a social welfare function is introduced, which concerns the state of the society. The state is represented by the allocation of goods among the members of the society under consideration. This function indicates social preferences. That is, by comparing two possible allocations, it is socially preferable the allocation with a higher social welfare index. The social welfare function does not generally represent the preferences of an agent of the economy and there is not even a common opinion on its conformation among scholars. Let us assume the presence of a social welfare function and that at least a feasible allocation maximizes this function (this assumption is satisfied if the set of feasible allocations is compact, that is, closed and bounded). Attention is given in this paper to an economy in which agents have preferences all concordant with social welfare, which therefore represents the preferences of every agent. However, the choice of every agent is limited only to a specific set of possible actions, those of his/her competence. Consequently, externalities emerge, since the objective function of every agent depends on the state of society, not only on the variables that the agent under consideration chooses. The following definition and properties can be introduced with respect to this economy. An agent is angelic if his/her preferences can be represented by the social welfare function. In other words, an angelic agent behaves as if he/she maximizes the social welfare function. We can derive from this definition the following two properties of equivalence: an equivalence between selfish actions and angelic actions and, for a community of angelic agents, an equivalence between Pareto-optimal allocations and allocations of maximum social welfare. Let us take under consideration a selfish agent, i.e., an agent whose preferences on his/her actions are represented by an objective function that does not care about the influence of his/her choice on the well-being of other agents. The selfish choice of this agent coincides with the angelic one: (1) if the choice of agent under consideration has no direct influence on the action of any other agent, and (2) if, given the actions of the other agents, the selfish objective function determines the same choice that the social welfare function would determine. The Pareto-optimal allocations coincide, for a community of angelic agents, with the allocations that maximize the social welfare function. This result derives from the existence of at least an allocation of maximum social welfare and from the fact that, because of the Definition of angelic agent, no feasible allocation exists that some agent prefers to the allocation of maximum social welfare. Therefore, on the one hand, no feasible allocation Pareto-dominates the allocation of maximum social welfare (i.e., no feasible allocation is better for someone and not worse for someone else than an allocation of maximum social welfare) and, on the other hand, an allocation of maximum social welfare Pareto-dominates all allocations that do not maximize social welfare. The task now is to analyze under what conditions the choices of a community made up of angelic agents lead to socially optimal allocations and to compare the economic equilibrium of the angelic society with that one of the selfish society. Section 2 of this paper regards the case of a community in which no agent’s choice directly influences the choice of another agent. In this case, the economic equilibrium is parametric, as in the competitive equilibrium analysis. Section 3 is devoted to the case where such an influence exists, so that the economic equilibrium is strategic, as in the game theory analysis.",
65,2,International Review of Economics,13 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0294-y,"What are the ethics of welfare economics? And, are welfare economists utilitarians?",June 2018,Edward R. Morey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Whether it is, of course, depends on how one defines both terms. This first section starts with a definition of an ethical system. In the words of John Stuart Mill, an ethicaly system is simply “a method to test right from wrong.” Quoting from the JEL article Taking Ethics Seriously, Hausman and McPherson (1993). Welfare economists have sometimes thought that their techniques are virtually morally neutral, because they rest on innocuous and uncontroversial moral premises such as the Pareto principle. But the standard definition of a social optimum compares social alternatives exclusively in terms of the goodness of their outcomes (rather than the rightness of their procedures) and identifies the goodness of outcomes with satisfaction of individual preferences. These commitments to value only outcomes and to measure outcomes only in terms of individual utilities are neither neutral nor uncontroversial (see Sen 1979, and Sen and Williams 1982). For example, that Pareto improvements are always improvements, while obvious to welfare economists, is rejected by, and inconsistent with, most other ethical criteria such as virtue ethics,Footnote 1 Kantian and other duty-based ethics, ethics based on religion (sins are wrong, no matter how they affect well-being, WB), rights theory, and ethical systems that judge acts right or wrong based fully, or in part, on process and intent. John Rawls (1971) rejected it, arguing that increasing the WB of the better off at no cost to the worst off is not right. Pareto improvements, an objective inconsistent with most moral objectives, is a moral objective. “A moral principle can be viewed as a requirement to exclude the use of certain types of information in making moral judgements” (Sen and Williams 1982). Looking ahead, welfare economics excludes from moral consideration the specifics of the act, its cause, and the intent. It also excludes from moral consideration how a policy or act affects individuals who are not members of society. Also, it assumes that my behavior and choices are right for both me and society if they don’t affect others. Besides, “they [welfare economists] are [always] ready with advice on how to make life better” (Hausman 1998). So, my view is that welfare economics is an ethical system: put simply, the moral objective is to maximize some aggregation of everyone’s WB (welfare), the aggregation over only members of society.Footnote 2 Many economist ethicists are welfare economists—but not all are. But, at this point, caution is in order because I have not fully articulated welfare economics. An action could be the action of an individual (her behavior) such as her eating peanuts, smoking in a crowded room, or driving drunk, or a government policy such as going to war or using taxation to redistribute income from the poor to the rich, or a tax on carbon emissions. Since economists think on the margin, the welfare-economic question is typically not whether the action is right or wrong but what is the right amount—what are the right amounts of chocolate and global warming? My first inclination was to use the words “good” and “bad” actions, but will instead use “right” or “moral” and “wrong” or “immoral” as in “morally right” and “morally wrong.” The words “good” and “bad” are used in many ways, so easy to misinterpret. Sound good? Morally right sounds pretentious but is clearer. Morally wrong means it should not happen for moral reasons. Welfare economics can, in theory, judge, using its criteria, whether any action is right or wrong, but often cannot in practice. This is true of many ethical systems. In practice, policy makers are lucky when an ethical system gives us an indication of whether a specific action is right or wrong. Looking ahead, some readers will disagree with my characterization of welfare economics, citing examples of individuals who self-identify as welfare economists but who would disagree with my characterization of it. This is OK: the objective is not for you to agree or disagree with what I think welfare economists agree on; an objective is to evaluate the assumptions they make, and to consider whether utilitarian is the best word to characterize their ethics. An important thing to know about welfare economics is that most moral philosophers reject it as a criterion to parse right from wrong, most people do. More on this but only after we list some of its commonalities. [Section 7 reviews research on the moral judgment of regular people]. While many moral philosophers would argue that welfare consequentialism, including welfare economics and utilitarianism, is not the right way to parse right from wrong, my modest intent is to define them in relationship to each other, so the reader can judge. [My opinion is unlikely to change many minds. At the request of one of the referees, I will offer a few thoughts in the conclusion.] Only after welfare consequentialism and welfare economics are fully articulated, will I address the question of whether welfare economists are best described as utilitarians.",4
65,2,International Review of Economics,03 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0295-x,Supply management and household poverty in Canada,June 2018,Pierre Desrochers,Vincent Geloso,Alexandre Moreau,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the 1970s, the Canadian dairy and poultry industries have been regulated through a domestic supply management (henceforth, SM) system in which production quotas must be acquired by farmers in order to sell poultry (chicken and turkey), dairy products and eggs (table eggs and broiler hatching eggs) to processing plants, while import duties and quotas keep most competing foreign products out of the Canadian market (Heminthavong 2015). One long-standing and unambiguous result of this policy is higher prices for consumers, but it is only in recent time that attention has been devoted to the distribution of this pecuniary burden. Since these agricultural goods are basic necessities, their elasticities are likely to be very low and poor households are more likely to be disproportionately affected by higher prices than wealthier households. However, the body of peer-reviewed research on that particular aspect of the policy is small. While there are reports on the subject produced by policy groups, most of the peer-reviewed articles are concerned with the effects of supply management on farm productivity and the potential outcomes of trade liberalization. The policy’s regressive impact has often been noted, but rarely studied with the recent and notable exception of Cardwell et al. (2015). To evaluate the impact of SM on welfare, they assessed elasticities of each income group which allowed them to calculate the burden of the policy according to income levels (Cardwell et al. 2015). This allowed them to calculate that supply management represented a welfare cost equal to 2.29% of the income of households in the lowest income quantile compared with 0.47% for the highest income quantile (Cardwell et al. 2015: 10). Our main objective is to complement this analysis of the social and distributional impacts of SM by assessing its impact on poverty levels. In other words, our aim is to estimate the number of households pushed below the poverty lines as a result of higher prices. The focus on poverty provides an important complement to Cardwell et al. (2015) largely because the items affected by supply management are necessities that feature heavily in baskets meant to measure absolute poverty. Our methodology is as follows. First, we estimate the consumption of items regulated through SM and determine the price differential with a basket of identical goods imported from foreign markets. We then re-calculate two measures of “poverty.” One is the actual basic necessities (BNL) poverty line designed by Sarlo (1992[1996], 2013). We believe that this measure is the superior one as it is a measure of absolute poverty meant to reflect the inability to obtain a nutritious diet, appropriate clothing, safe housing and sufficient personal and healthcare items. In other words, it is meant to reflect the “predicament of those enduring real deprivation” (Sarlo 1992[1996]: XVIII). In this basket, dairy products alone represent 14.3% of the food component (Sarlo 1992[1996]: 63) and roughly 4% of the total basket (Sarlo 1992[1996]: 110–114). Adding eggs and chicken meat would only increase this proportion which indicates that goods under SM feature prominently in consumption baskets of people exposed to poverty. The other measure is Statistics Canada’s “low-income” (LICO) measure designed to capture households with an income below half the median income of the population. (LICO is thus a measure of relative rather than absolute poverty.) Using Statistics Canada’s Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID), we can then estimate both the number of individuals and households who fall below “poverty” thresholds in light of the financial burden resulting from SM policies. This methodology might surprise some readers as it does not use the actual quantities consumed and the observed elasticities of demand—which is the approach used in studies like those of Cardwell et al. (2015). However, this approach is justified given that we are attempting to measure the effect on absolute poverty. As our method consists in altering the positioning of the poverty line, it serves the purpose of estimating the number of individuals pushed into poverty as a result of SM. Our key results are as follows. Using the BNL line, we find that between 133,000 and 189,000 individuals fall below the poverty threshold as a result of SM policy. When using LICO, these numbers are between 140,000 and 161,000. In terms of households, the range is between 67,000 and 79,000. Our estimates of the cost of supply management are in line with those measured by other researchers, in terms of both dollars and financial burden relative to income. These numbers are also modest in terms of the share of the Canadian population in poverty or in low-income status—between 3 and 5% of that subpopulation and between 0.3 and 0.6% of the total population. Thus, while the absolute numbers may seem large, they affect a minor share of the Canadian population. Nevertheless, in light of the relatively small number of agricultural operations actually helped by SM measures, one can question the ethical nature of these policies.",2
65,3,International Review of Economics,04 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0296-9,Toward a “constitution” for behavioral policy-making,September 2018,Marco Fabbri,Michael Faure,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Whereas the economic approach to law has probably been the most powerful intellectual movement affecting law and policy-making in the twentieth century, the beginning of the twenty-first century seems to be marked by cognitive and social psychology. Researchers such as Tversky and Kahneman showed that many individuals are subject to a variety of cognitive heuristics and biases as a result of which they may not always maximize their expected utility.Footnote 1 Given that the direction of the aforementioned deviations from the rational (in an economic sense) behavior is often predictable, scholars have been able to produce models of decision making that include these behavioral anomalies.Footnote 2
 These insights from cognitive psychology have to a large extent been incorporated into the traditional economic analysis of law through the seminal work of Sunstein and Jolls,Footnote 3 leading to a new domain referred to as “behavioral law and economics.” The goal of behavioral law and economics “is to offer better predictions and prescriptions about law based on improved accounts of how people actually behave.”Footnote 4 Although there was originally some opposition to this behavioral approach,Footnote 5 leading law and economics scholars now largely recognize the importance of cognitive psychology also for the domain of law and economics.Footnote 6 More recently, governments and policy-makers have become interested in the implementation of the insights coming from behavioral sciences into the rule-making process. Indeed, the recently established area of behavioral policy-makingFootnote 7 aims to enhance policies that counteract biases and redirect patterns of behavior that are supposed to hurt people.Footnote 8 Therefore, the goal of behavioral policy-making is to correct decisions that produce “sub-optimal” outputs and to redirect them toward alternatives that make people “better off.” However, what does “optimal” mean in the context of behavioral policy-making? This article focuses on the important methodological problem of identifying a suitable welfare criterion for behavioral policy-making. We will argue that, despite the fact that behavioral interventions are implemented at increasing rate, no convincing theory has been advanced yet regarding how to identify the “optimal” choice and what it means to make individuals “better off.”Footnote 9 Traditional economic analysis relies on Samuelson’s theory of revealed preferences to determine its welfare criterion.Footnote 10 According to this theory, by observing the choices of individuals it is possible to discover their true underlying preferences. However, behavioral policies cannot rely on this preference-based criterion for optimality.Footnote 11 In fact, neoclassical utility maximization theory is based on the assumption that whatever action an individual voluntarily chooses must be welfare enhancing. Thus, it does not make sense to evaluate whether an agent is making a sub-optimal decision using a benchmark measure built on the premise that people always make optimal choices. Hence, the behavioral revolution left open a key normative question: which welfare criterion should be adopted for behavioral policy-making? It is important to emphasize that the problem of finding a suitable welfare criterion is a distinctive feature of behavioral policy-making. This problem is qualitatively different from issues faced by a policy-maker who assumes rational agents, such as the difficulty in choosing “optimal” levels of taxes or incentives. In fact, it is well known that fully rational (in economic sense) agents can still achieve a sub-optimal social outcome in cases where externalities or public goods are present. Policy-makers called to correct these market failures might face severe practical problems. For instance, imagine that a policy-maker wants to achieve an “optimal” level of pollution by imposing an environmental tax on a firm that engages in a polluting activity. To achieve optimality, the tax has to be set in such a way that the firm is fully internalizing the benefits and the costs of its activity. Setting the right tax might be complicated in practice, since the policy-maker has no direct access to information regarding the costs of pollution and the benefit of environmental protection. Therefore, the lack of a price for certain commodities that unambiguously reveals its market value imposes to the policy-maker the need to engage in some estimation procedures to indirectly retrieve this information. For instance, the market value of clean air can be estimated by identifying a set of residential houses sharing identical characteristics and comparing market prices of those located in proximity of a landfill with those far away from it. The problem of achieving optimal pollution levels is an information problem: as long as through some clever procedure the policy-maker acquires the market evaluation of a certain good as revealed by consumers’ choices, she can identify what the optimal level of pollution is (and so, how the environmental tax should be set). Conversely, this is not the case in the context of behavioral policy-making. Indeed, as we explain in detail in the next sections, the pillar of behavioral policy-making is that observed choices do not necessarily reflect consumers’ underlying preferences. Therefore, even if scholars would agree on a procedure to estimate the market values of a good as revealed by consumers’ choices, the problem of defining what “optimal” means would not be solved. So far few theories have been proposed, but no consensus has been reached, regarding how to identify these preferences. We contribute to the debate on the methodological problems of behavioral policy-making by taking a law and economics approach. Our contribution is twofold. First, we raise awareness against an important issue in behavioral policy-making that is at times overlooked by scholars and practitioners. Some recent contributions (reviewed in the next section) emphasize the problem of identifying individuals’ preferences faced by behavioral policy-making. We focus on the link between abandoning revealed preferences and the possibility for governments to make use of behavioral interventions to restrict citizens’ freedom. The revealed preferences approach, despite its aforementioned limitations set out by cognitive psychology, guarantees the respect of individuals’ freedom of choices. Conversely, rejecting the idea that people choose what they prefer without providing a solid alternative theoretical framework in principle countenance any freedom-reducing intervention, on the basis that individuals’ choices are “mistakes” or “products of biases.” In this article, we stress that abandoning revealed preferences does not simply create a methodological problem of preferences identification. Instead, in the absence of clear rules regulating the use of behavioral policies, it might also affect liberty and individual freedom. In the second part of the article, we propose a solution to the problems caused by the lack of a suitable welfare criterion. On the one hand, we aim at leaving open for policy-makers the opportunity to make use of the potential of behavioral policy-making and, on the other hand, we want to limit the possibility for the executive to justify freedom-reducing interventions. We argue that, for implementing behavioral policies in a safe way, the boundaries and domains of application of behavioral policy-making should be clearly defined ex ante, and we emphasize that it is necessary to agree upon precise procedural requirements. We therefore propose that behavioral interventions must adhere to guiding principles of the highest order, such as imposing special procedural requirements and including mandatory public participation to implement changes. By defining the rules of the game, the scopes and the limits of application, these “constitutional-type” guiding principles should regulate behavioral policy-making.Footnote 12
 We will proceed as follows. In the next section, we sketch the rise of the behavioral approach into policy-making. In the same section, we also summarize the criticisms that have been formulated by the scientific community on the use of behavioral interventions. Next, we focus on the methodological problem of behavioral policy-making and the many unresolved issues (3). We therefore propose a solution which focuses on procedures and rules (hence a “constitution”) that limit the possibility for the government to abuse its position (4). The conclusion summarizes the content of our proposal (5).",8

As some scholars have recently noted (e.g. Kopel and Brand 2012; Becchetti et al. 2016; Fanti and Buccella 2017a, b) and the specialised documentation such as KPMG surveys (2005, 2011, 2013, 2016a) reveals, an impressive as well as constantly increasing share of companies adopts CSR reporting: while in 2005, only to mention a few, 32% of US companies, 71% of UK companies and 90% of Japanese companies adopted CSR, in 2011 about 95% of the 250 world largest companies are reporting CSR activities and, finally, in 2013, 71% of 4100 companies surveyed in 41 countries shows CSR activities. As other important examples, we can mention that 31% of the top 500 Fortune companies shows detached CSR departments (ICCA 2010) and more than 10% of total EU economy (in terms of GDP), with more than 11 millions of workers (6% of total employment) (as the EU Commission documented), take into account social objectives. Moreover, the increasing creation of Socially Responsible Investment funds supporting CSR adoption encourages the growth of the share of CSR firms. In fact, as Becchetti et al. (2016, p. 50) report “socially responsible investment funds accounted for a share of around 11% of total assets under management in the United States in 2010 (Social Investment Forum Foundation 2010) corresponding to 2.71 trillion dollars”. On the other hand, it has been acknowledged that network industries in recent years are a fast-growing phenomenon. In such industries like mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) and related apps, and software, the utility of a particular consumer from using such devices or a software grows with the number of other mobile devices (and related apps) or software users: a positive network externality does exist. Among the industries which have experienced an extraordinary progress in CSR activities in recent years, it is remarkable to find in a leading position precisely network industries. For instance, according to a KPMG report, the technology, media & telecommunications sector presents a 79% of the companies surveyed reporting CSR activities, the highest levels among the surveyed industries. In particular, the telecommunication subsector shows the highest rate of CSR reporting, with a 87% of the companies (KPMG 2016a, b). In addition, the Reputation Institute global CSR survey reveals that companies in network industries are chiefly engaged in CSR activities. In fact, they have a primary presence in the world’s top ten companies with regard to the best CSR reputations: Walt Disney ranks 2nd, Google 3rd, Microsoft 7th, Sony 9th and Apple 10th. Moreover, consumers perceive companies in network industries as the most socially responsible: for instance, Google ranks 1st, Microsoft 2nd, Walt Disney 3rd, Apple 7th and Intel 10th (Reputation Institute 2016). Thus, it is natural to ask whether and how these two features—i.e. the presence of firms’ social concerns and network externality—jointly affect, through their interplay, the standard outcomes of strategic oligopolistic contexts. In particular, while the network externality is an exogenous market feature, CSR activities may be a firm’s choice variable and, thus, may strategically be used for enhancing its performance.Footnote 1
 However, the literature in economics has not jointly considered the endogenous choice to undertake CSR activities and the presence of network externalities. In this paper, we develop a Cournot model in which firms may choose, non-cooperatively or cooperatively, the level of CSR interest, that is, in line with the branch of the literature above mentioned, the share of the consumer surplus to be taken into account in their objective function. In detail, the model assumes that when the owners cooperatively choose the level of engagement in CSR, they remain competitive in the product market. In other words, concerning the choice of CSR, we have a semi-collusive behaviour, an aspect of the firms’ activities the Industrial Organization (IO) literature has largely studied in other fields.Footnote 2 A key question in the paper is whether CSR is good or bad for profits. As forewarned, the traditional result is that CSR may be in the interest of one firm to extend its own market share at the expense of the rival firm, but at equilibrium CSR results in a reduction of profits. Moreover, we investigate how firms engage in CSR activities under the two (non-cooperative and cooperative) choice regimes and how the level of CSR also influences output and welfare. A number of interesting and somewhat unexpected results are derived. In the following, we qualify the main assumptions of the paper. For simplicity, a duopoly context is assumed because, in the present multi-stage model, a larger number of firms would prevent the achievement of economically interpretable closed forms outcomes. Also, the product homogeneity allows for a more parsimonious parametric set, so favouring clear-cut interpretations of the results, while the assumption of non-durability of the product allows for a single-period analysis without the need to resort to a multi-period dynamic model. Moreover, we assume a standard demand function in which consumers are not socially concerned, differently from other models such as those of Manasakis et al. (2013) and Alves and Santos-Pinto (2008), in which consumers appreciate a socially responsible behaviour and owners decide whether to make CSR efforts in the production. As regards the network externalities, it is implicitly assumed that (1) products are fully compatible between them, so that the overall quantity produced in the sector is relevant for the consumers, not the quantity of the specific brand/product they patronise; (2) consumers base their demand on “expected” output, that is, firms do not commit to a given level of output at the moment that consumers decide on their demand; (3) consumers form rational expectations on “expected” output. The latter assumptions are the most used in the network literature; however, in principle, it could be assumed that products are not (or only partially) compatible or firms commit themselves to a determined output or, finally, consumers form non-rational—for instance adaptive—expectations.Footnote 3 Finally, the choice of modelling the firms’ CSR behaviour as caring not only for profits but also for consumers’ surplusFootnote 4 is the most frequent in the literature (Goering 2007, 2008, 2012, 2014; Lambertini and Tampieri 2012, 2015; Brand and Grothe 2013, 2015, only to mention a few); nonetheless, we are aware that there are CSR activities which pertain to the welfare of stakeholders, such as workers, business partners, citizens and the environment, which are different from the consumers of the product. The key findings of the paper are as follows. Under the non-cooperative endogenous choice of the level of social engagement, the equilibrium of the game is that both firms select to follow CSR rules. However, in contrast to the common wisdom, the Nash equilibrium of being CSR-type is Pareto-efficient for firms in network industries (provided that network effects are sufficiently intense): in fact, both firms are better off following CSR rules. On the other hand, in the case of cooperative choice of the level of CSR, the network effects have to be adequately intense to make CSR more profitable than profit-seeking. As regards social welfare, when the intensity of the network externalities is sufficiently low, the non-cooperative choice of CSR enhances, as expected, consumer surplus and social welfare; however, the adoption of CSR reduces profits with respect to the case of pure profit-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, when the network externalities are sufficiently intense, not only consumer surplus and social welfare but also firms’ profits—under both cooperative and non-cooperative regimes of choice of the CSR level—become larger than those under pure profit-seeking behaviour. However, since firms find more profitable to choose cooperatively than non-cooperatively a positive level of social concern, while for consumers and society as a whole the welfare is larger when firms choose the CSR level non-cooperatively rather than cooperatively, then there is a conflict of interests between consumers and society, on the one side, and shareholders, on the other side, on the regime of choice of the CSR level. Moreover, we note that the level of CSR is always increasing with the network effect under both regimes of the choice; however, the CSR level is larger under the non-cooperative than cooperative regime, although for increasing network externalities the difference tends to reduce. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. “Literature review” section presents the literature review. “The model” section introduces the model setup and analyses both the cases of non-cooperative and cooperative endogenous determination of the level of social engagement. The last section concludes outlining the future research agenda.",12

The change from the UN Millennium Development GoalsFootnote 1 to the new UN Sustainable Development Goals acknowledges the problem with a clear indication of the urgent need of a new economic paradigm.Footnote 2 In the new SDGs, the same definition of goal 12 (responsible consumption and production) and goal 17 (partnership for the goals) implies a move from a two-handed (state and market) to a four-handed approach for the achievement of the goals, with a close partnership among institutions, responsible corporations, and active citizenship. These novel features, acknowledged by international institutions, are at the root of the civil economy paradigm that we aim to illustrate in this paper by emphasizing in what it is different with respect to the traditional paradigm. Whoever reads, studies. or teaches a standard undergraduate microeconomic program can be easily aware that the theory shaping the structure and behavior of our socioeconomic system is heavily unbalanced toward two main goals: the creation of the maximum shareholder wealth and the generation of consumer surplus. In the basic microeconomic theory, labor is just a production input and a cost item, to be minimized by any productive unit in order to be efficient and win the competitive race. To put it in a historical perspective, the ideas of moral philosophers that created the consensus of modern economic theory were formed at the end of the eighteenth century and were heavily influenced by a world of poverty and scarcity. Such world stimulated them to set the goal of addressing this specific problem on the basis of a (reductionist) anthropological premise where human beings where essentially individuals whose utility/felicity could be maximized by providing a wider range and variety of goods and services at the lowest possible prices. The project was extremely successful since the invisible hand of competition (buttressed by antitrust institutions and rules, given that competition is not the natural instinct of producers but needs to be enforced by proper regulation) progressively created abundance of goods and services at low prices that produced large consumer surplus. And the goal of profit maximization was important to accumulate resources that could be invested to increase productivity and stimulate research and innovation. Founders of the modern economic thinking were obviously aware of market failures, that is, of the gap between private optimum and social optimum when economic action is left only to market forces. To tackle the problem, they created a “deus ex machina”, the benevolent planner, with the goal and power to solve them. In this way, they implicitly considered that a two-hand (market plus institutions) system was sufficient to address the problem. A deeper limit of this approach was, however, in its anthropological premises, or, put in other terms, the original goal of mainstream economics needs today to be reoriented, given what already achieved (in terms of productivity and variety of goods available at cheap prices), and the new challenges of the future. This is because the vast amount of empirical studies on the determinants of life satisfaction and sense of life (eudaimonic well-being) clearly evidence that the richness of human life, self-fulfilment, and human flourishing depend not just on what we purchase but also, and crucially, on the quality of human relationships, spiritual life and, for a crucial part, from the quality and dignity of labor.Footnote 3 The crucial importance of life sense for human beings is as well confirmed by the empirical literature on the nexus between eudaimonic happiness and health, where it is shown that poverty of sense of life is a mortality risk factor (Bachelet et al. 2016). In addition to it, the consumer utility maximization paradigm is unable to explain an important part of human behavior concerning identity choices. In this direction, new contributions modeling the individual as a purpose searcher before being an utility maximizer are slowly gaining way in the theoretical literature (Chater and Loewenstein 2016; Akerlof and Kranton 2000). A further problem in the traditional paradigm is that the dignity of labor is not necessarily independent from the competitive pressure that lowers prices. When price falls are not determined by technological innovation, we often find reduction in quality and dignity of labor beyond them. Until we will arrive to a point in which production process will be fully mechanized and factories will be without workers, the risk that the second factor contributes to explain low prices will be and remain strong, generating a trade-off between consumer and worker well-being. Based on these introductory premises, the goal of civil economics is that of addressing the limits of the current economic thought (and especially the suboptimal outcome it creates in terms of richness of sense of life) by proposing a change of paradigm (Bruni and Zamagni 2004, 2015; Bruni and Sugden 2007). This change of paradigm has its historical roots in the Italian school of thought that, in parallel with the development of the neoclassical vision, was pursuing a broader perspective where economic activity and material achievement were seen not as an end in themselves, but as a tool to pursue public happiness. According to the Italian school, the concept of individual happiness was related to the capacity of fostering happiness of others as essential to one’s own happiness (we would call it generativityFootnote 4 or civic fertility).Footnote 5 According to this view, and especially to the contribution of Genovesi (1765), the focus on the relational and interpersonal nature of human beings (beyond anthropological reductionism) that through trust, reciprocity, and equity could build those moral societal channels of communication that could create public happiness. Hence, while Smith was emphasizing the invisible hand of the market, Genovesi was stressing the fundamental role of the visible fabric of human virtues as crucial for the functioning of the economic system (Bruni 2006).Footnote 6
 In this paper, we will illustrate the main characteristics of this change and its straightforward consequences in terms of active citizenship and policy measures that may greatly help to achieve the desired transformation. Specifically, the difference of the civil economics can be synthesized in two points (see Table 1 for a comparative synthetic view of the two paradigms). The first point requires us to broaden our minds against anthropological, corporate, and well-being reductionisms: (1) human beings need not be homines economici (do not have exclusively self-regarding preferences) but can be “personae” looking for purpose in life whose relational skills are crucial for individual and social flourishing and whose cooperative, trust, and trustworthiness skills are crucial to solve social dilemmas and generate superadditivity;Footnote 7 (2) the corporate goal need not be profit maximization but can be the creation of value added in a frame of social, environmental and fiscal responsibility, thereby producing much higher and positive impact in terms of value and life sense; (3) “well-being,” or the indicator used as a benchmark for political economy, need not be the flow of goods and services sold in a given geographical area but can be a multidimensional well-being indicator proxying the stock of spiritual, economic, relational, environmental, and cultural goods that a community may enjoy in a given geographical area. The second distinctive feature of the civil economic paradigm concerns political economy and implies the move from a two-hand to a four-hand approach. Solutions to the problems we are facing (inequality, environmental sustainability, poverty of sense of life) cannot be generated by a system where only two hands (the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of institutions) are at work. In order to be effective, these two traditional hands need a strong support from the third hand of active citizenship and from the fourth hand of sustainable productive organizations. The two qualifying points of civil economics (going beyond individual, corporate, and well-being reductionism and moving from a two-handed to a four-handed political economy approach) are strictly connected with each other since the third hand (active citizenship) implies the rejection of anthropological reductionism and the fourth hand (responsible companies) the rejection of corporate reductionism. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we discuss how the civil economy paradigm challenges the three reductionist views. In the third section, we outline characteristics of the move from the two-hand to the four-hand system. In the fourth section, we explain why the vote with the wallet is a crucial lever in the four-hand political economy approach, and we explain how it works. In the fifth section, we discuss some policy solutions that can boost the civil economy paradigm, fully enhancing its potential in terms of solution of market and institutional failures and achievement of the common good.",19
65,3,International Review of Economics,31 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0300-4,How important is the type of working contract for job satisfaction of agency workers?,September 2018,René Petilliot,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Between 1997 and 2017, the number of agency workers in Germany has increased rapidly from 181,000 to 1,043,000. Consequently, agency workers represented around 3% of the total German labor force in 2017 (BA 2018).Footnote 1 Typically, employees are directly employed with their employer on either a fixed-term or a permanent working contract.Footnote 2 Agency employment, in contrast, is a triangular employment relationship where workers are legally employed by their employment agency but “with a view to making them available to a third party, who may be a natural or legal person […] which assigns their tasks and supervises the execution of these tasks” (ILO 1997, No. 181, Article 1.1.b). Agency workers function as a useful supplement to regular employees as they allow firms to better balance business cycle fluctuations and to reduce costs (Matusik and Hill 1998). The increased use of agency workers is, however, critically observed by researchers and politicians, because agency contracts are typically considered to be less favorable than regular permanent contracts (De Cuyper et al. 2008). On the one hand, researchers have indeed found that agency workers face poorer working conditions than regular employees, such as lower remuneration (Böheim and Cardoso 2009; Booth et al. 2002; Hamersma et al. 2014; Jahn 2010) and fewer training opportunities provided by the employer (Arulampalam and Booth 1998; Nienhüser and Matiaske 2006). Furthermore, workers on agency contracts are found to have a higher risk of social exclusion (D’Addio and Rosholm 2005) and of becoming unemployed (Antoni and Jahn 2009; Autor and Houseman 2010), which previous studies have identified to substantially reduce welfare (Clark and Oswald 1994; Kassenboehmer and Haisken-DeNew 2009; Winkelmann and Winkelmann 1998). More generally, Busk et al. (2017) show that relaxing regulations of the agency sector negatively affect agency workers’ well-being. On the other hand, agency contracts may function as stepping stones to permanent employment (Addison and Surfield 2006; Green and Leeves 2004; Hopp et al. 2016) and provide a way for workers to better balance work and family life (Morris and Vekker 2001).Footnote 3 Hence, there are several arguments for as well as against agency contracts, which makes it a priori difficult to judge whether such contracts are in sum less favorable than regular permanent contracts. Yet finding an answer to this issue is of interest to policymakers in all countries that have eased the use of agency workers in recent years or plan to do so in an attempt to make labor markets more flexible. To assess whether agency contracts are less favorable than permanent working contracts, researchers compare the utility identical workers—who only differ in their working contract—derive from their job. Traditionally, the utility derived from a job has been approximated by the earned wage. Yet, over the past two decades, researchers have increasingly started to use workers’ reported job satisfaction as an alternative and more direct measure of the utility derived from a job (see, for example, Clark 2001; Hamermesh 2001). Using job satisfaction has the advantage that unobservable or unmeasurable job characteristics, such as the relationship with colleagues, are captured in addition to objective job characteristics such as wages. In a literature review on the relationship between different work arrangements and job satisfaction, De Cuyper et al. (2008) find that workers who are employed on flexible contracts, such as fixed-term contracts, agency contracts, and seasonal contracts, as a group report lower levels of job satisfaction, on average, than workers who are employed on a permanent contract. However, in a meta-analysis, Wilkin (2013) stresses that workers on flexible contracts do not form a homogeneous group and that it is necessary to distinguish between those different types. Empirical evidence on the relationship between job satisfaction and fixed-term contracts is mixed. Chadi and Hetschko (2016), for example, provide evidence that relative to workers on a permanent contract, workers on a fixed-term contract are significantly less satisfied with their job. In contrast, Green and Heywood (2011) and D’Addio et al. (2007) find no such difference in reported job satisfaction. Empirical research on the relationship between agency employment and job satisfaction is more clear cut: in general, agency workers are found to be significantly less satisfied with their job than regular workers on a permanent working contract.Footnote 4 Using data from the first wave of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, Wooden and Warren (2004) show that male agency (casual) workers report significantly lower levels of job satisfaction than regular male workers who hold a permanent contract. Applying panel estimation techniques to subsequent waves of HILDA, Buddelmeyer et al. (2015) find that the difference remains when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The negative relationship between agency contract and job satisfaction has further been established by De Graaf-Zijl (2012) and Jahn (2015) in the Netherlands and Germany, respectively. A potential shortcoming of these studies is that they treat agency workers as a homogeneous group with regard to whether they are employed on a fixed-term or a permanent working contract. Not differentiating agency workers by their working contract may, however, result in biased estimates if agency workers on fixed-term contracts systematically differ from those on permanent contracts. For example, suppose that while agency workers on permanent contracts are as satisfied with their job as regular workers on permanent contracts, agency workers on fixed-term contracts are significantly less satisfied. In such a case, the difference in job satisfaction between agency workers as a group and permanently employed regular workers would be the result of the lower job satisfaction of agency workers on fixed-term contracts. Hence, we would mistakenly argue that agency employment is a bad policy instrument even though only employing agency workers on fixed-term contracts is undesirable but not employing them on permanent contracts. The first contribution to the literature of this paper, therefore, is to account for this potential source of bias by considering the type of working contract in a regression of job satisfaction on agency status. A second contribution is that by comparing agency workers on a permanent contract with regular workers on the same contract, the present paper provides a more thorough analysis of the difference in job satisfaction that is solely attributed to the status of being an agency worker. In this paper, I use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which allows me to control for a large set of personal and job characteristics as well as for individual fixed effects when regressing job satisfaction on agency status. Yet critically, there may still be unobserved factors that I cannot account for with the data at hand and, therefore, the correlations derived may not be interpreted as causal. I find that, first, even though controlling for the contract type agency workers are employed on, they are on average still significantly less satisfied with their job than regular workers on the same contract. Second, the difference in job satisfaction is entirely driven by agency workers on permanent contracts who are significantly less satisfied with their job than regular workers on permanent contracts. In contrast, agency workers on fixed-term contracts do not differ in reported job satisfaction from regular workers on both fixed-term and permanent contracts. Hence, a permanent contract per se does not automatically imply high levels of job satisfaction. The difference in job satisfaction between agency and regular workers on permanent contracts can at least partly be explained by changes in the reference point of agency workers who previously were regular employees, as the difference in job satisfaction becomes just insignificant when workers’ perception of just wages is controlled for. Since the difference in job satisfaction between agency and regular workers on fixed-term contracts is not affected by this modification, my results lend support to the conclusion that agency workers on fixed-term contracts regard their employment as a stepping stone into regular employment or as a mean to avoid unemployment, while agency workers on permanent contracts appear to be somehow trapped in this type of employment. In the course of this paper, I perform several robustness checks to validate my results. Yet they indicate that the estimates derived are not sensitive to the modifications made. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Information on the institutional background of agency employment is provided in Sect. 2. Section 3 describes the dataset and provides summary statistics. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy. Results, explanations and robustness checks are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",

65,4,International Review of Economics,23 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0304-0,An economic theory of altruism based on rankings in a stable social hierarchy,December 2018,Edmund H. Mantell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Most economic models are based on the assumption that rational people conduct their economic affairs in ways which maximize their own narrowly conceived self-interest. However, experimental economists have gathered overwhelming evidence in recent years that is apparently incompatible with the pure self-interest hypothesis.Footnote 2 The evidence suggests that altruistic attitudes strongly motivate many people. The international scholarly literature on the meaning of altruism and its implications is large and getting larger. For a review see Khalil (2004). Even its definition is unsettled. One formal definition proposed by two psychologists is “behavior carried out to benefit another without anticipation of rewards from external sources.”Footnote 3 This defines altruism in terms of both intention and behavior and is probably a typical definition among psychologists. However, not all behavioral scientists would accept this definition. Sociobiologists, for example, define altruism only in terms of behavior.Footnote 4 Still other behavioral scientists assert that altruism is not a property of behavior at all but rests entirely in the intentions behind the action.Footnote 5 In this connection it is perhaps worth noting that some evolutionary biologists are skeptical about the emergence of altruism as a heritable trait because it does not contribute directly to species’ reproduction. Altruism is often defined by evolutionary biologists—humorously but pointedly—as “that which cannot evolve.”Footnote 6 However, recently published research in the area of evolutionary game theory suggests a plausible adaptive mechanism. Fletcher and Zwick (2007) write: The evolution of altruism does not require either reciprocity or kinship. What is essential is only sufficiently non-zero-sum benefits for heritable altruistic behaviors and sufficiently non uniform interactions among individuals with these behaviors. This paper will derive a model embodying both the essentials described above; namely non-zero-sum benefits to individuals interacting in a stable population as well as non-uniform interactions among individuals who occupy different ranks in a stable social hierarchy. I do not propose to contribute anything to the discussion of the definition of altruism. This paper starts from the broad proposition that “altruism” denotes conduct wherein a rational economic actor (i.e., not an infant or an idiot) gives something of economic value to another but appears to gain little or no direct return from the beneficiary of his action.Footnote 7
 The kind of conduct described above poses an explanatory problem for some branches of economic theory. The fundamental basis of much of economics is the assumption that behavior should be assumed to be rational in the sense of maximizing only the utility of the agent. Altruism is interesting because it is behavior that appears to contradict this principle of self-interest. If altruism is motivated by principles that are incompatible with informed self-interest, then there will be a category of economic behaviors (e.g., charitable donations, intergenerational transfers of income or wealth and some forms of tax-based insurance) that are not explicable in purely economic terms. In a recently published compendium of the economics of altruism, Fehr and Schmidt wrote (Fehr and Shmidt 2006, p. 70): In order to fully understand the interaction between selfish and non-selfish actors, social scientists need rigorous formal models of other-regarding preferences. While the current models clearly present progress relative to the self-interest approach the evidence [reported in their paper] also makes it clear that further theoretical progress is warranted. There is still ample opportunity for improving our understanding of other-regarding behavior. The limitations on the current models of social preferences in the context of charitable giving were identified by DellaVigna (2009, p. 337): Even if we take for granted that giving is an expression of social preferences, it is difficult to use [current models] to explain quantitatively the patterns of giving in the field for three reasons: (1) These models are designed to capture the interaction of two players… (2) The utility representations [of the models] implicitly assumes only the experimental payoffs from, say, the dictator game. (3) [the models] overpredict giving. The theory developed in this article addresses issues (2) and (3). The objective of this paper is to bring together strands of theory from sociology, psychology and economics to create a testable theory of altruism compatible with utility maximization by rational individuals. The goal is to develop a theory with concise and testable predictions consistent with experimental results as well as being parsimonious in its data requirements.",2

Savings accumulated and invested in productive sectors facilitate capital formation for a growing economy. “The two gap model” also addresses the importance of savings for economic growth in developing countries (Iqbal and Rehman 1995).Footnote 1 The developing countries often face insufficiency of capital for low levels of national savings. As a result, most of these countries rely mostly on the foreign capital inflows to fill up the desirable resources by mobilizing limited domestic savings. Foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, foreign aid and overseas remittances inflow are sources of such inflows. Globalization facilitating mobility of human capital across the globe paves way for people to go and search for livelihood overseas. As a result, working overseas has become a surviving strategy for many youths. This resulted in the gradual increase in international migrants and the figure reached to 244 million by the year 2015. This figure is quite double compared to 173 million in 2000. Out of 244 million international migrants, 43% migrated from Asia origin (United Nations 2016). Remittances inflow from diaspora and migrant workers’ is an important source of income for many developing countries of Asia. Migrant remittances have a dynamic economic impact for the remittance receiving countries. This flow is the second large source of foreign capital flow after export and quite large compared to foreign aid and FDI. The high contribution of remittance to GDP of these countries is worth mentioning and it also justifies their dependency to such inflows. India, the top remittance receiving countries in the world received $62.7 billion remittance earnings in the year 2016. India is also the top emigration countries with around 14 million emigrants. Philippines, the third largest remittance receiving countries earned $31.1 billion in the year 2016 which accounts for 42% of export earnings and contributes to more than 10% of GDP. However, in the context of Bangladesh, there are almost 7.6 million Bangladesh migrants that made Bangladesh the 5th top emigration countries in the world. Now Bangladesh is the 10th largest remittance recipient country in the world with $ 13.7 billion sharing 6.1% of GDP.Footnote 2
 Remittances are directly sent to households and have a positive impact on household wellbeing. This increases the disposable income of recipient families and has a positive and significant effect on consumption expenses, savings behavior, health and education expenses and asset accumulation (Adams 1991, 2002). Remittance could play a crucial role for financial development by providing additional loanable fund to banking sectors in the form of savings, thus increasing the private credit. A number of studies including De-Arcangelis and Joxhe (2015) and Islam et al. (2013) on saving behavior of migrants show evidence that migrants save more than natives irrespective of their wealth and income. Even temporary migrants save more than the diasporas. This savings behavior enhances the likeliness of remitting more by migrants to their country of origin and saving more for future. On the other hand, Chami et al. (2005) reported the negative correlation of remittance with the GDP growth. They observed that remittance do not boost up the source of capital for GDP growth and economic development. Although, worker remittances have undeniable impact on poverty alleviation, improving livelihood and increasing consumption rate of the recipient, it showed no effect on the economic growth (Bajaras et al. 2009). Interestingly, the debating issue is partially summarized by Catrinescu et al. (2009). They observed that remittance can promote long-term economic growth in higher quality political and economic policies in combination with financial institutions. Remittances are considered as both a transfer of fund for consumption for the recipient households’ and as an alternative savings mechanism for migrants (Quinn 2005). Remittances have also become a factor for economic growth from the view point of financing productive investment (Cota and Gonzalez 2008). Remittances induce investment by raising the marginal propensity to savings and invest among the remittances receiving households’. There is also evidence that migrant household largely depends on remittances inflows to raise savings for investment and thus migration facilitates productive assets accumulation (Chiodi et al. 2012). The positive effects of remittances greatly differ among countries according to the relevant national policies and regulations and also on the financial system. The amount of savings and investment from remittances depends on the transmission mechanism of existing financial systems, financial intermediaries, cost of financial services, innovative remittance linked products and services. Encouraging savings from remittances for future productive use also differ based on the living standard and poverty level of the beneficiary households’. The savings from remittances are highly dependent on the financial mechanism for the shifting of remittances funds through different financial intermediary and access to financial services (Ratha 2006). In addition, foreign aid is also considered to affect the savings pattern of these developing countries. Many countries including Philippines managed to accelerate economic growth from foreign aid under postwar recovery programs (Adelman and Chenery 1966). There is also evidence of positive effect of foreign aid on the growth strategy of Bangladesh up to 1990s (Hossain 2014a). Up to 1992, India also was dependent on foreign aid and was among top-listed foreign aid recipient countries. Although FDI is an important source of foreign capital inflow, the study excludes it on the ground that it is a direct investment fund and different from remittance and foreign aid. The objective of this study is to investigate the long-run impact of remittance to stimulate savings in remittance recipient countries. This paper contributes to the macroeconomic impact of remittance through a comparative study on Bangladesh, India and Philippines that positioned among the top ten largest remittance recipient countries from 2008 and onwards. There are many cross-country analyses on the relationship between remittances and savings based on panel data (as described in Sect. 2 of this paper). Although panel data analysis provides an overall average result of sample, it is not enough to conclude the individual country effect. Country-specific case studies are useful to bring out the significant and particular aspect of each country and recommend policy consideration. This analysis attempts to analyze the long-run impact of remittances in augmenting savings rate among the above-mentioned countries using time series data from the period of 1980 to 2015. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review on this issue, followed by Sect. 3, the methodology part. Section 4 provides empirical results of the model. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and conclusion.",6

In order to build a strong relationship between the two, retailers not only offer a wide range of products, but also provide complementary services to the consumers, both of which together provides satisfactory and convenience experience of shopping for consumers. The retailing sector is considered as one of the significant pillars of the Indian economy, which is expanding at remarkable pace. India could be rightly referred as the nation of shopkeepers since a long time, as more than 15 million retail outlets have been established in the retail sector (Mukherjee and Patel 2005). Since the liberalisation of FDI policies started in the early 1990s, the Indian economy has welcomed many multi-national corporations (MNCs) to invest and was ascertained to receive the humongous amount of foreign investment in the future. The retail sector of India went through a gigantic transformation in the last two decades. In 2013, the market value of the Indian retail sector was the US $500 billion and is considered to be one of the top five retail markets with a population of 40 million engaged in it. The retail sector is expanding at a rapid pace, with a gradual shift in formats towards organised retailing. It is anticipated to reach at USD 900 billion by the end of 2017, representing compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 12% (Ernst and Young Report 2013). Retail sector provides employment of 8% to the total workforce and contributes over 10% of GDP to the economy (IBEF Report 2014). Retail sector is broadly divided into two major sectors: organised sector and unorganised sector. Currently, India’s retail sector is at a nascent stage where 92% of the retail sector is unorganised retail such as vendors, street markets, hole-in-wall shops, mom-n-pop stores and roadside hawkers. Unorganised retailing is categorised based on lack of knowledge about inventory control, supply chain management, government policies, taxation rules and standardisation of product. On the other hand, only 8% of the retail sector is organised (in USA 85%) which includes licensed retailers like hypermarkets, supermarkets, retail chains and mega-stores. Before the initiation of liberalisation of FDI policies, organised sector growth was slow due to significant restriction on consumer goods and consumerism. Slow growth was due to high taxation rate and rigid licensing policies on imported goods discouraging foreign investors towards consumer goods industry. The benefit towards economies of scale was affected due to lack of wide variety of products. Further, the development of scale was also limited due to restriction on interstate movement of goods and stock. Overall the growth of retail sector was constrained due to low income of the consumers followed by high taxation and poor government support. After the liberalisation and economic reforms in 1991, the sector started evolving; imposed restrictions were relaxed leading to the development of the economy. Thus, consumer good industry exhibited significant growth in the limited span of time. Many multi-national companies (MNCs) such as Sony, Samsung, and Kellogg’s entered in the market due to the removal of entry barriers (Mukherjee and Patel 2005). The government of India had been focusing progressively on changing economic reforms and liberalisation of the retail sector in order to attract foreign investors. Therefore, it led to the initiation of competitiveness among domestic enterprises through access to global formats, retail innovation, availability of goods to the consumers and increasing technology and management practices. The liberalisation of the retail sector to universal competition is likely to motivate retail rush and to transform retailing landscape and country’s ailing infrastructure in India. Organised retail trade is traditionally divided into two trades: single-brand retail trade (SBRT) and multi-brand retail trade (MBRT). Both trades enable growth in the retail sector; however, comparatively SBRT has liberalised more than the MBRTs which has been rather tightly regulated.Footnote 1
 After Independence from Britain in 1947, Indian economy remained fairly close. In mid-1980s, India faced a severe deficit of balance of payment. The growth in export sector turned negative, and industrial production recorded negative growth. Thus, an attempt to liberalise economy in 1987 was made to overcome balance of payment issue, but that did not succeed. Later in 1990–1991, India’s inflation rate was 12% with current account deficits of 3.1%. During that period, China was an attractive destination for foreign investors; however, India was still facing difficulty. In mid-1991, Indian government foreign exchange reserves were very low, only having enough dollars for two weeks’ worth of import. To overcome the problem, India had pledge tonnes of gold to Bank of England and Union Bank of Switzerland. After the disaster of 1991, neoliberal reforms were introduced which was never previously allowed; by opening the economy to initiate privatisation, changes in tax-reforms, deregulation of economic trade practices, allow international trades and investments, control inflation level. The policy of FDI under liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) was introduced (Kumar 2008). Initially, very few sectors such as manufacturing, mining were liberalised, but later, more sectors like service, telecommunications, retail were liberalised. The liberalisation is prone to affect various industries, and these effects may vary immensely across industries (Kamath 2007). This research is mainly focusing on the retail sector of India and the impact of liberalisation of FDI policies on retail sector of India. In 1997 (Fig. 1), the government of India has approved 100% FDI in wholesale cash-and-carry market with automatic approval. Later in 2006, FDI of up to 51% in single-brand retail was allowed by the government subject to prior approval. It was a vital decision and brought huge transformation for the Indian economy and retail sector as well. Between the year 2006 and 2010, 94 proposals had been recorded out of which 57 were accepted and implemented for single-brand retailing. The flow of FDI had increased heavily due to the liberalisation of the economy with FDI of $1.8 billion between 2000 and 2010 through retail sector singly (Shah and Parikh 2012). According to Earnest and Young report (2013), FDI is the best tool to enter in the attractive Indian market. It further explains that from last few years India’s retail sectors under single-brand retail have emerged as a big opportunity. Adding to it, the IMF’s World Economic Outlook report (2015) suggests that between years 2016–2018, Indian GDP growth will be even faster than China. Putting it together with a study by the PWC (2012) which states that, “Indian consumers are among the most confident consumers in the world”, it seems highly probable that we will see a surge in consumer spending. Perhaps, annual growth of 15–20 percent has been witnessed in the retail sector. Also, with a high rate of the population falling under 15–59 and being considered as a second largest populated country. A point to consider is that youth and elite consumers had an inclination towards brands and multi-brand supermarkets, whereas older generation and non-taxpayers preferred buying from convenience stores, discount stores (Jhamb and Kiran (2012). Economic betterment is considered to be due to the liberalisation of the FDI policies and rigid licensing systems. The retail sector is backbone of Indian economy and one of the fastest growing sectors (IBEF 2016). With that in perspective, this study focuses on the impact of liberalisation policies of FDI in India particularly on retail sector of India. Moreover, it investigates the trends and patterns of FDI flow in the economy and the implication of FDI flow in the organised retail sector. The government allowed 100% FDI in single-brand retail and 51% with multi-brand retail with some regulations in 2012. Therefore, following research is based on the impacts of liberalisation of FDI policy in India in retail sector in order to prove the consideration.
 Source: IBEF Report (2014), www.ibef.org Changes in FDI policies in retail sector between 1991 and 2012. The main rationale and purpose of this study are to shed light on the development of the retail sector in India in post-liberalisation era. Furthermore, to understand the growth of retail sector in the very short span of time, as it has been perceived to be related to the post-liberalisation of FDI. Concomitantly, the main research question this study is focusing on is to find what is role FDI has played in the retail sector in the post-liberation era? Although a limited number of studies have highlighted the post-liberalisation in the retail sector, the main contribution this study is intended to make is to gain awareness in the implications of liberalisation on India’s retail sector and more specifically in single and multi-brands. There is quite modest work done on the subject of this study, for instance, Kamath (2008) and later Singh et al. (2011) analysed the flow of FDI in India during pre- and post-liberalisation period and showed the trends and patterns of FDI inflow and outflow in India had increased since reform. Similarly, the study by Chopra and Kaur (2014) analyses the flow of FDI inflow and outflow after a post-liberalisation period. However, the present study only shows the trends and patterns of FDI inflow in Indian economy. An important point to emphasise here is that present study highlights mainly on the impacts of the liberalisation of FDI policies in India, particularly in retail sector. In order to deduce conclusion, several other aspects need to be considered; hence, we would be looking at the trends and patterns of FDI in Indian Economy, the implications of FDI in retail sector: organised retail over unorganised retail will be explored and also impacts of FDI flow in single-brand retail and multi-brand retail will be analysed. On the whole, the overarching aim and objective of this research are to deduce the impact of FDI had on the retail sector in India post-liberalisation. Further, it also aims to explore the dynamics of growth in the retail sector and challenges faced by the retail sector in the post-liberalisation world.",8
65,4,International Review of Economics,03 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0311-1,"Job satisfaction, job match quality and labour supply decisions",December 2018,Gaetano Lisi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Starting from the popular definition of subjective well-being proposed by Diener et al. (2002), job satisfaction can be defined as a person’s cognitive and affective evaluations of his or her job, namely, cognitive and affective evaluations in a specific area of life (workplace), rather than in global terms (life as a whole).Footnote 1
 Job satisfaction is very important for labour market outcomes, economic policies, personnel and human resource management, since it is closely related to several key factors, such as work perceptions (e.g. Harter et al. 2010), absenteeism (e.g. Drago and Wooden 1992; Wegge et al. 2007), work inequality (e.g. Card et al. 2012), turnover costs (e.g. Swider et al. 2011), newcomer adjustment (e.g. Bauer et al. 2007), leisure (e.g. Atrostic 1982), overtime work (e.g. Golden and Wiens-Tuers 2006), job search (Cornelißen 2009; Swider et al. 2011) and job change (e.g. Boswell et al. 2005; Cornelißen 2009; Chadi and Hetschko 2014). From a theoretical point of view, moreover, job satisfaction plays a key role in time allocation and labour supply decisions. Indeed, job satisfaction reduces the individual disutility of work effort, thus increasing worker productivity (see, e.g. Freeman 1978; Borjas 1979; Theodossiou and Zangelidis 2009). However, standard economic theory does not consider behavioural aspects, such as job satisfaction, that individuals value instead when making their choices. Actually, the introduction into popular economic models of behavioural elements or factors is necessary and very useful, since they allow to obtain better predictions and more effective policy implications (McFadden 1999). In this vein, this paper introduces job satisfaction into the traditional (neoclassical) theoretical model of labour supply. To the best of our knowledge, only two other papers have addressed this issueFootnote 2: Zimmermann (1990) and Rätzel (2009). In both models, however, job satisfaction (non-pecuniary benefit of work in Rätzel 2009) is a further input to the utility function, while this paper simply assumes that job satisfaction reduces the disutility of work, thus decreasing the utility of leisure. The proposed theoretical integration, therefore, is more straightforward. Nevertheless, the theoretical results are non-trivial. Precisely, this extended version of the standard model of labour supply can describe situations in which working produces utility beyond consumption, with the result that the disutility of giving up leisure time is lowered or even reversed. As a result, the paper is able to reconcile the standard theory of labour supply with the well-established finding of happiness research according to which working yields substantial non-monetary benefits (see, e.g. Warr 2007). In the empirical literature, job satisfaction is the preferred proxy for utility from work, as it depends on both monetary and non-monetary aspects of work (see, e.g. Cornelißen 2009). Instead, this paper considers job satisfaction as a determinant for utility from work. The difference is subtle but not negligible. The benefit of this approach is twofold. Firstly, it allows to highlight the (key) role of job satisfaction in time allocation and labour supply decisions. Furthermore, it suggests a very simplified empirical strategy, where job satisfaction is not the dependent variable of the regression model, but it is the parameter to be estimated. In this paper, job match quality is used as a proxy for job satisfaction. Concisely, it is assumed that higher job match quality is positively related to job satisfaction. This is not a novelty at all. Recently, in fact, job satisfaction is used as a measure of job match quality (Ferreira and Taylor 2011; Barmby et al. 2012). Unlike the related literature, however, the present paper specifies job satisfaction, and thus job match quality, in terms of appropriate collocation of the worker in the workplace, that is, the matching between the investment in education and the task assigned in the workplace that makes the worker more satisfied. Concisely, the higher the matching between the investment in education and the task assigned in the workplace, the higher the job satisfaction. This approach does not narrow the concept of job satisfaction, since our operational definition of job match quality refers to all benefits (both monetary and non-pecuniary) connected to an appropriate working collocation. In some cases, however, a lower job match quality (in terms of both educational and skills mismatches) could bring benefits for the worker, such as a better work–life balance (since the job lets the worker more freedom to meet certain family demands) or a high job security (since the worker has skills higher than those required by the job). Chevalier (2003) shows that there are over-educated workers who are rather satisfied with their job–education match. However, the assumption that over-education (probably the most known type of educational mismatch) negatively affects job satisfaction is very reasonable and empirically proved (see, e.g. Fleming and Kler 2011). Educational and skills mismatches have negative consequences on both wage and job satisfaction. Precisely, educational mismatches affect wages strongly, and skills mismatches are very good predictors of job (dis)satisfaction (see, e.g. Allen and van der Velden 2001; Badillo-Amador and Vila 2013).Footnote 3
 The rest of this paper is organised as follows: The next section briefly presents the standard (neoclassical) theory of labour supply, while Sect. 3 extends the model by introducing job satisfaction. Section 4 discusses the connection of this work with some recent papers on the relation between job satisfaction, job tenure and job change. Then, Sect. 5 performs an empirical analysis in order to test the empirical plausibility of the developed theoretical model. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the work.",4
65,4,International Review of Economics,17 August 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0313-z,Private capital inflows and stock market interface in sub-Saharan Africa,December 2018,Samson Edo,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa depend substantially on resources from private capital inflows to facilitate economic growth and development. These resources flow in mainly through foreign direct investment, foreign portfolio investment, and foreign public debt. In these countries, foreign direct investment takes a significantly large proportion, and it is again taken to have the most significant impact on economic growth, because it is relatively illiquid and cannot flow out easily at the first sign of trouble. Foreign portfolio investment possesses high liquidity that enables it to flow out easily when environment becomes unfavorable and its impact on economic growth is somewhat insignificant (Loungaui and Razin 2001). The foreign public debt component constitutes a lesser proportion than foreign direct investment, but the impact on economic growth is also considered significant. The inflow of private capital is very important to sub-Saharan Africa where the pace of economic development is slow due largely to inadequate financial resources. Available domestic resources have continued to fall short of the level required to propel rapid economic growth and development in the region, and in an attempt to bridge the resource gap, several countries resorted to massive external borrowing in the decades of 1960–1980. The public and private sectors borrowed huge sums of money from international capital market because of government ambition to promote economic liberalization and growth. The borrowing which was done at low interest rate, subsequently expanded in value as a result of rising interest rate, leading to heavy debt burden that caused stagnation of economic growth and development in the 1980s (Edo 2002). The debt crisis is largely attributed to weak macroeconomic framework that allowed growing fiscal deficit and excessive public spending on projects with low productivity. No factor explains more of the debt crisis than the wasteful allocation of resources instead of investing the resources on projects that could generate adequate returns (Dornbusch 1986). It took quite some time before the countries could come out of the debt problem in the early 2000s, prompting some of them to now rely on foreign aid and assistance which are inadequate to drive economic growth. This undesirable situation calls for more concerted efforts and policy measures that can encourage growth in the region and reduce the mounting socioeconomic challenges of high unemployment, increasing level of poverty, escalating crime rate, high level of out migration, etc. Policy makers therefore have enormous responsibilities in facilitating economic development in the face of rapidly growing population and paucity of financial resources in the region. The financial market school of thought driven by the IMF/World Bank has thus prescribed financial market as a veritable channel of attracting capital inflows toward economic growth and development in less developed countries. This school considers stock market as a strong and potent channel of capital mobilization across the globe. This assertion is driven by the fact that stock markets were very useful in mobilizing domestic and foreign investments for the development of Europe and North America in the nineteenth century (Weber et al. 2013). However, sub-Saharan African countries made no significant effort at exploring the stock market potentials for mobilizing investments in the two decades after 1960, until the IMF/World Bank proposed a development strategy in the 1980s that espoused the prominent role of stock market. The IMF/World Bank proposed a market-based strategy of economic development anchored on private sector driven investment, as a response to the external debt crisis and economic stagnation in Latin America and African Countries, which was canvassed through the Structural Adjustment Programs in the 1980s. In pursuit of this development strategy, the two multilateral institutions strongly advocated the establishment and strengthening of stock markets in developing countries, to enable them transmit appropriate signals to domestic and foreign investors, and also serve as a channel of investment. The stock market was therefore given prominence as engine that drives capital inflows and economic development. The response of sub-Saharan Africa to the new strategy is quite encouraging. As at mid-1980s when the initiative was launched, only four countries in the region (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Nigeria) had stock market, which later increased sharply to 24 countries in 2016. However, only 13 of these stock markets are considered to be relatively active, while others have been struggling and yet to be significantly active (Irving 2000). The number of independent countries in sub-Saharan Africa currently stands at 49, but 13 of them do not have functioning stock market and are not affiliated to any regional stock market. They are Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Comoros, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Angola, Guinea, Liberia, Gambia, Mauritania, and Sao Tome and Principe. In particular, Ethiopia with a population of 88 million is even the largest country in the world without a stock market. The country is one of about 40 countries without stock exchange out of over 200 nations in the world (Ethiopian Herald 2015). The importance of stock market in the economy cannot be over-emphasized. It is the center of activities in capital market where individuals and institutions invest in long-term financial assets such as equities, industrial debentures, industrial preference stocks, and government bonds. The market is therefore a veritable channel through which savings are channeled into investment and economic growth. The assertion by Hicks (1965), which states that savings is not an end in itself but a means to facilitating economic growth and development, may therefore be effectively realized with the existence of viable stock market. However, stock market does not thrive in a vacuum but requires appropriate macroeconomic framework and policies to stimulate its growth. The market is also driven by vibrant domestic private sector that generates desired return on investment. The growth in global stock market activities is largely driven by emerging markets in sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging stock markets are those that attract increasing inflows of foreign investment which in some cases dominate domestic investment. In the report of Demirgur-Kunt and Levine (1996), there has been a global boom in stock market growth and emerging stock markets have contributed significantly to the boom. The world stock market capitalization rose from $4.7 trillion to $15.2 trillion in the period 1985–1995, with emerging market capitalization jumping from < 4 to 13% of total world capitalization. Similarly, trading in emerging markets soared astronomically from < 3% of world total to 17%. Capital flows to emerging markets in the same period increased substantially, with portfolio inflows rising from less than $1 billion to $39 billion. The emerging markets have therefore become more integrated into the world capital market since the domestication of IMF/World Bank proposal on financial market reforms.",2
65,4,International Review of Economics,27 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-018-0314-y,Core infrastructure and industrial performance in Africa: Do institutions matter?,December 2018,Ekundayo P. Mesagan,Mustapha O. Bello,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The adequate supply of infrastructure services is a prerequisite for the structural transformation of any economy from the production of primary products to secondary products. The differences in the effective use of infrastructure explain one-quarter of the growth differential between Africa and East Asia, and more than 40% of growth differential between low and high growth countries (Hulten 1996). In Africa, infrastructure services are viewed as public goods with their provision entrusted to government monopolies. To this end, infrastructure facilities are often neglected since several African governments see it as a luxury and are therefore secondary on their priority lists. This makes the provision of infrastructure facility in the continent a mirage as infrastructure receives only a small proportion of private investment (Sheppard et al. 2006). In the cases where such are even provided, they are poorly maintained, leading to a general fall in amenities needed to provide industrial back-up (Ajakaiye and Ncube 2010; Bond 2016). This probably explains why African countries remains very frail in hasten economic developmental efforts. As observed in Chow (1987), most advanced countries achieved their development status through industrial growth. In the literature, it has been pointed out that infrastructure improvement can help lower the cost of private capital through a reduction in the overhead production cost and the replacement of unproductive private investment (Reinikka and Svensson 2002; Agenor and Blanca 2006). In addition, the provision of adequate electricity infrastructure can help stimulate capital investment (Omojolaibi et al. 2016; Mesagan et al. 2018). Moreover, improved transport between home and work, improvement in health and education, and more efficient work processes have been identified as channels through which infrastructure can improve labour productivity (Galiani et al. 2005). Pertaining to manufacturing output, the Manufacturing Environment IndexFootnote 1 (MEI) constructed in 2014 from World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitive Index, shows that only three African countries (Mauritius, Morocco and Kenya) are above the global average. Also, that of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is significantly lower on the average compared to those of Latin America and emerging developing Asia. Similarly, Africa commands a meagre 1.5% share of the world’s total manufacturing output in 2014 compared with a 21.7% share for the Asia Pacific and 17.2% for East Asia (UNIDO 2017). The poor performance of African manufacturing sector is connected with the poor infrastructure development (like transport, telephone and electricity) in the region. In Africa, infrastructure is a major constraint to running businesses effectively and it also depresses firms’ productivity by about 40% (Calderón 2009; Anders 2010). More so, the unavailability of stable electricity to boost industrial expansion leaves so much to be desired, thereby making African countries to lag in the quest for industrial development (Yepes et al. 2009). The African continent is also generally backward in overall provision of infrastructure globally. These differences are particularly large for paved road, telephone main lines and power generation. For instance, in 1970, Africa had almost three times the generating capacity per million people as South Asia. In 2000, South Asia had overtaken the region with almost twice the generation capacity per million people (World Bank 2009). There is considerable evidence that in most African countries, transport costs are much higher than in other world regions (Limao and Venables 2001). The consequence of this infrastructure deficiency is that it inhibits the growth of the continent’s industrial capability and consequently limits its development process (Seneviratne and Sun 2013). The missing link between infrastructure deficiency and industrial development can be attributed to lack of political will and weak institutional framework. This is important because even when the political will to provide the needed infrastructure for industrial expansion is weak, a strong institutional framework can help galvanise economic structures to bolster the infrastructure base of the country. As identified in Perry and Olivera (2009), Breisinger et al. (2014) and Eregha and Mesagan (2016), what is generally missing in countries with poor economic performance is not shortage of resource abundance, but weak institutional template. A very strong institutional support can provide the needed impetus for investment inflow, innovation and the development of new technologies (Ajide and Raheem 2016). Similarly, quality institutions reduce the uncertainty of social interaction among economic players, increase market efficiency and promote long-term infrastructure investments (Eregha and Mesagan 2016). Succinctly put, quality institutions are needed to mobilise domestic resources, as well as encourage the inflow of international capital to aid in the industrial development of an economy. This means that institutions have a role to play in the development of the industrial sector globally. As observed in LiPuma et al. (2013), sound formal institutions create robust environment for firms to thrive. Interestingly, in the literature, despite the several searchlights on institutional quality, there is a dearth of studies on whether institutions can play significant role in the nexus between infrastructure and industrial sector performance. In the literature, studies have only focused on the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth (Hulten 1996; Agenor and Blanca 2006; Calderón 2009), as well as infrastructure and income distribution (Calderón and Servén 2004; Seneviratne and Sun 2013). Studies like Anders (2010), Isaksson (2010) and Mesagan and Ezeji (2016) only focused on infrastructure and industrial performance, thereby neglecting the role of institutions in their models. This provides a strong motivation for the current study to address, and it represents our major contribution to the literature. This paper sets out therefore to examine the effect of core infrastructure on industrial performance in Africa. Also, it aims at determining the mediating role of quality institutions in the nexus between core infrastructure and industrial performance in Africa. In doing this, a panel analysis for selected African countries is conducted and the situation analysed. The rest of this study is organised as follows. Literature review is presented in Sect. 2, and stylised facts in the selected countries are presented in Sect. 3. Research methodology is presented in Sect. 4, discussion of result is presented in Sect. 5 while the conclusion is presented in Sect. 6.",7

The essential idea is central to Titmuss’s (1970) famous analysis of blood donation—an analysis that, at the time it was written, was well known to economists of social policy. However, it is only relatively recently that the theory has been taken seriously by economists. Arrow (1972), probably the greatest economic theorist of his era, acknowledged Titmuss’s argument but expressed puzzlement about it. Gneezy and Rustichini’s (2000a, b) report that fines for lateness in collecting children from a day care centre led to an increase in the incidence of lateness is now often cited as evidence of motivational crowding-out, but their favoured explanation of this observation—that it was a consequence of incomplete contracts—was much more conventional. Frey (1994, 1997) was a pioneer in applying the theory of intrinsic motivation to economic problems. His analysis draws on Deci and Ryan’s distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. According to the taxonomy proposed by Ryan and Deci (2000), an activity is extrinsically motivated if it is done ‘in order to attain some separable outcome’; it is intrinsically motivated if it is done ‘for its inherent satisfactions … for the fun or challenge entailed rather than because of external prods, pressures, or rewards’. Extrinsic motivations can be classified on an internal/external scale. They are more internal, and so more similar to intrinsic motivations, the greater the degree to which they go together with perceptions of competence, autonomy and relatedness. (‘Competence’ is self-explanatory. ‘Autonomy’ is the sense of an ‘internal locus of causality’—of being the cause of one’s own actions. ‘Relatedness’ is the sense that one’s actions are valued by ‘significant others’ with whom one feels connected.) The hypothesis of motivational crowding-out is that if an activity has both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, people tend to attribute extrinsic motivations both to other people’s and (crucially) to their own engagement in that activity, undermining intrinsic motivation. Thus, in Titmuss’s example, unpaid blood donation is attributed to motivations of altruism, reciprocity or public spirit. But if payments are introduced, giving blood (even by people who would have donated without being paid) tends to be attributed to the extrinsic reward provided by the payment. Given this conceptual scheme, it is difficult for any form of paid labour to be intrinsically motivated, although in the right circumstances a worker might have feelings of competence, autonomy and relatedness. The problem is fundamental to the whole idea of a market economy based on the division of labour. A worker contributes specialised labour to the production of some particular good in return for a wage that gives her a menu of opportunities to consume goods that other workers have produced. If this is how she understands what she is doing, her work is an activity that is done to obtain a separable outcome or external reward, namely the goods that other workers produce. She can be intrinsically motivated only if she would have wanted to do the work even if she had not been paid for it. But, to make sense of that idea, we have to imagine a situation in which there was no prod or pressure for her to spend her working day on any other, unwanted kind of labour. So it seems that we must imagine that, whether she worked or not, she would have been paid the same wage. Her intrinsic motivation would then be revealed by her choosing to work solely for its fun or challenge. Contributors to the literature of intrinsic motivation have tried to find ways of combining the economic reality of employment as an exchange relationship with the perception that there is gratuity on both sides—that, at least to some degree, the worker supplies her labour without intending to receive payment for it, and the employer pays the worker’s wage without intending to receive her labour in return. A variant of this idea can be found in Akerlof’s (1982) model of labour contracts as ‘partial gift exchange’. (In Akerlof’s model, the effort expended by workers is hard to monitor. An employer pays a worker more than her reservation wage; the worker responds by supplying effort in situations in which effort cannot be monitored.) Developing an idea from the psychological literature, Frey distinguishes between two types of intervention in a person’s working environment: Crowding-out effects take place… when an external intervention is perceived to be controlling. In contrast, when the intervention by the principal is understood to be supportive, intrinsic work motivation is unaffected or may possibly even rise… When employees get rewarded only if they have performed exactly according to their chief’s directions, their intrinsic work motivation is negatively affected. The more a reward is contingent on the performance desired by the principal, the more strongly the locus of control is shifted from intrinsic to extrinsic incentives, and the more work morale is crowded out. (1997, pp. 93–94) If rewards are separated from specific components of the general activity that is being rewarded, a perception of gratuitousness can be maintained. One way in which this separation can be achieved is through suitably chosen gifts: Non-monetary gifts in kind (for example, in the form of flowers, books or chocolates) constitute a conscious effort to disassociate the reward from any particular performance. Rather, these gifts are chosen so that the person’s self-esteem is acknowledged, thereby bolstering the recipient’s intrinsic work motivation. (1997, p. 95) The suggestion is that, by supporting intrinsic motivation, gifts can serve a useful economic function. They can be perceived as gratuitous acknowledgements of merit, independent of the economic value actually created by the recipient, while in fact inducing workers to create economic value. In the passages I have just quoted, Frey is discussing hierarchical workplace relationships between supervisors (or ‘chiefs’) and their supervisees. A ‘controlling’ relationship is being pictured as one in which a supervisor gives directions to a supervisee, and rewards the supervisee for acting according to those directions. In other words, the supervisor uses the reward mechanism as a means of intentionally controlling the actions of the supervisee. In contrast, the use of a gift as a reward is supposed to signal a relaxation of that control. Frey extends this analysis to the case of ‘honours and prizes’, where hierarchical relationships may be less explicit: A lot of trouble is taken not to grant these rewards as a response to a particular performance, but rather as a recognition of a person’s dedication to his or her work or career in general. Titles, orders and other honours (such as honorary doctorates) are normally given for one’s lifelong work, and are thus perceived by the recipients as a recognition of their competence, raising intrinsic motivation. (1997, p. 95) Take an example of an academic honour. Fellowships of the British Academy are honours to which neither material rewards nor particular duties are attached. Their recipients are scholars whom the existing Fellows judge to have achieved ‘distinction in the humanities and social sciences’. The Academy is not the employer of potential recipients; it is merely an institution that decides whether to honour them. Still, one might say that there is a hierarchical relationship between the two. To the extent that Fellowships are valued by their recipients, the Academy controls a reward mechanism that might be used to direct scholars towards particular activities. The Academy’s (rather secretive) procedures are careful not to specify explicit criteria for Fellowship awards that potential recipients might try to meet. Thus, as Ferey claims is typical in the award of honours, reward is disassociated from particular performance, in much the same way as when a supervisor gives a box of chocolates to a meritorious supervisee. But Frey also applies his analysis of intrinsic motivation to a very different case—the payment of labour in a competitive market: A monetary payment received through the functioning of the market constitutes a case where the reward depends on performance; in a perfectly competitive market the reward (wage rate) depends exactly on the marginal product performed. The price system therefore tends to substitute intrinsic with extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, a market reward may also indicate competence and then tends to raise work morale. (p. 94) Here the argument is not about hierarchical relationships of control. (In a perfectly competitive market, no individual agent has any control over prices.) The claim is that intrinsic motivation is undermined if the worker perceives his wage as the exact value of his services to a buyer, but not if he perceives it as an acknowledgement of his competence, independent of the actual value of what he does. Perhaps what Frey has in mind in the second case are the kinds of career-long salary scales that were once characteristic of the professions—scales that are restricted to people who enter a profession with the required qualifications, and then reward those people according to their seniority rather than their actual performance. The suggestion seems to be that, in order to preserve workers’ sense of autonomy, the relationship between buyers and sellers of labour needs to be construed as two-sided gift-giving rather than as the exchange of things that have equal market value. It seems that, for Frey, there is an equivalence between (on the one hand) payment-by-results incentive systems in hierarchical supervisor–supervisee relationships within firms, and (on the other) relationships between buyers and sellers of labour in competitive markets. By transferring the results of his analysis from the first case to the second, he is presenting markets as hostile to intrinsic motivation. I want to argue that the two cases are not equivalent.",7

Grant,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Most people think that the concept of incentives arose as part of the development of ideas about market economies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Footnote 1 But in fact, with very few exceptions, the term does not appear in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, or the authors of the Federalist Papers. Use of “incentive,” “incentives” 1800–2008

 The term, “incentives,” gains in popularity in the early twentieth century, particularly in the USA, and undergoes a shift in meaning at the same time.Footnote 2 The concept became important in the context of debates over socialism, scientific management of industrial production—sometimes called “Taylorism”—and, most important for my purposes here, behavioral psychology. Frederick Taylor published The Principles of Scientific Management in 1911. John Broadus Watson began publishing his theory of behaviorism in 1913. This is right around the time that the graph shows the beginnings of a dramatic increase in the use of the term. Behaviorism explains human behavior as adaptations to stimuli in the environment. There are no instincts or other internal sources of motivation—no intrinsic motivations. Human beings are passive, reactive, and malleable. Their behavior can be shaped by manipulating external stimuli—or incentives. Behavioral psychologists became interested in how incentives could be used to motivate learning, and they coined the term “incentive motivation.” There is a close affinity between these ideas and the ideas behind Taylor’s use of incentives for social engineering in industrial production. People will change their behavior in response to external stimuli. Scientific management is the knowledge of how to design incentives so that factory workers will be more productive. The psychological assumptions of behaviorism still shape our understanding of incentives—particularly the view that incentives are the only kind of motivation. As a result, we no longer see the wide variety of motivations at work in our lives—a child goes into the yard to dig a hole out of curiosity; people care for a sick relative out of love or sense of duty or both; an African-American child is inspired to pursue a political career by the example of Barack Obama, and of course, to be inspired is not the same as to be incentivized. Examples could be easily multiplied. We even have a new verb, “to incentivize”—I just used it—which is replacing “to motivate.” The graphs below show how new this term is and how quickly its use is growing, while to “motivate” is beginning to decline in usage at the same time. Use of “incentivize” 1800–2008

 Use of “motivate” 1800–2008

 The problem is that “incentivizing” is a much narrower idea than “motivating.” Imagine a meeting where a policy direction is set and the question arises, “How do we incentivize people to act in line with the new policy?” If we ask the question this way, we are likely to think of a much smaller set of options than if we asked, “How can we motivate people to act in line with the new policy?” The first question leads initially to thoughts of bonuses or benefits offered to individuals. The second question might include these things but also include a media campaign, or workshops with those groups most affected, and so on. We need to recognize that incentives are just one particular kind of motivation. So how do we specify the particular meaning of incentives, incentives in the narrow sense, and distinguish them from other forms of motivation? How might we distinguish incentives from rewards, punishments, and prizes or from wages and compensation, for example? It is certainly true that all of these things can be used to motivate people. But incentives necessarily serve this function, while rewards, punishments, prizes, wages, and compensation do not. People can win prizes without even knowing they were eligible for them. Clearly, in that case, the prize cannot have been a motivator. People who serve on juries in the USA are compensated a small amount, which certainly doesn’t motivate them to serve. Some people would continue to do their work, even if they weren’t paid for it. They aren’t actually motivated by their wages. Moreover, unlike incentives, prizes and rewards must be earned or deserved. They are a recognition of merit. Similar observations apply to the distinction between disincentives and punishments. Punishments can serve as a deterrent, and when they do, they are a disincentive. But punishment can be justly administered when it is deserved, even if it does not serve as a deterrent. Moreover, many disincentives are not punishments—for example, parking meters are a disincentive to drive downtown but certainly not a punishment for doing so. Wages are also an interesting case because they are both a motivator, like an incentive, and earned or deserved, like a reward. Wages are a form of compensation, which means “rendering equal” or a “recompense” or “equivalent.” They are a payment for value received or services rendered. Wages must be earned. So it makes perfect sense to speak of “fair wages.” But there is no such thing as a fair incentive. An incentive is a benefit designed as a motive or inducement to action. The right amount of an incentive is the amount it takes to produce the desired behavior. This is why large executive bonuses look fine to people who see them as incentives and grossly unfair to people who see them as a form of compensation. The former does not need to be earned, while the latter does. Incentives are a very particular form of motivation with distinct characteristics. Here is how I characterize what I call incentives in the narrow sense or incentives “strictly speaking.” Incentives are a particular kind of offer: A discrete prompt expected to elicit a particular response. An extrinsic benefit or a bonus that is neither the natural or automatic consequence of an actionFootnote 3 nor a deserved reward or compensation. An offer intentionally designed to alter the status quo by motivating a person to choose differently than he or she would be likely to choose in its absence.",2

Frey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Today’s world is characterized and dominated by the digital revolution. It has led to a quantification of ever more areas of human life and society as a whole. At the same time, we observe a strong increase, or even explosion, of the number of awards, which by their very nature are based on non-quantified, and often non-quantifiable performance. This paper seeks to present an explanation for this paradox: how can the two totally opposed developments exist and expand next to each other? Will quantification take over completely, leading to “omnimetrics”? On the basis of economic reasoning, the paper argues that this will not be the case. The value of, or preference for, awards is the higher, the stronger is the quest for quantification. While digitization takes over an increasing part of our lives, the non-quantifiable reasons for getting awards are getting more valuable. Due to this endogenous effect, the two major developments can coexist and support each other. The first section shortly outlines the urge to quantification in the digital world. The second section discusses the rise of awards as an opposite, but coexisting development. An explanation to this paradoxical development is explained in the third section, and the last section offers a generalization: The quantification not only raises the value of awards but also bolsters the importance of non-quantifiable aspects of life such as those related to friendship, love, and religious piety.",5

Materialism and status-seeking under Mortality Salience,March 2019,Elisa Ciaramelli,Caterina Giannetti,Raimondello Orsini,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"As humans, we are aware that our life will come to an end, and we experience terror at the thought of our own death. According to Terror Management Theory (TMT), dating back to the work of Ernst Becker (1973), the fear of death has a unique effect on human mental life, inducing overwhelming anxiety and threatening self-esteem. According to Becker (1973), individuals attempt to reduce this existential insecurity by adhering more tightly to the cultural beliefs, values, and worldviews shared with their social group. For example, previous research has shown that after a Mortality Salience (MS) induction (e.g., requiring individuals to focus on the thought of their own death), individuals exhibit more severe disapproval of violations of legal, social and cultural norms, a greater sense of social affiliation, ranging from social group identity to patriotic identification (Greenberg et al. 1997), and a more materialistic and greedier behavior (Kasser and Sheldon 2000). Although faith in shared cultural beliefs is an essential mean by which individuals secure protection from existential insecurity, it is not sufficient. Individuals also need to feel that they are significant contributors to their vision of a meaningful universe: they need to build and sustain self-esteem, showing they actually meet the standard of value prescribed by that worldview (Pyszczynski et al. 2015; Becker 1973). Thus, TMT predicts that under MS individuals would express stronger belief in their own cultural worldviews (e.g., focusing on material values), and also embrace behaviors associated with increased feelings of self-worth (e.g., high productivity). It has been noted, however, that contradictory worldviews at times coexist, for example with regard to the attitudes one should have toward money. For example, cultural norms encourage both generosity and the accumulation of material wealth, and the view that will prevail under MS will depend on the norms salient in a specific situation (Jonas et al. 2013). A substantial body of evidence supports TMT empirically, across a variety of measures, countries and demographic samples, showing that the thought of one’s own death affects a wide range of human activities, including risk-taking, economic choice, creativity, close relationships, sexual attitudes, identification with groups, and prejudices (see Arndt et al. 2004a; Solomon et al. 2004 for reviews). For example, previous psychological research has shown that MS has an important impact on individuals’ economic choices, generally inducing purchase of symbolic luxury goods (see, for example, Arndt et al. 2004b; Simon et al. 1997). Mandel and Heine (1999) had participants complete a fear of death scale or a control scale probing depressive thoughts and then evaluate a series of advertisements featuring a Lexus automobile, a Rolex watch, a Geo-Metro automobile, and Pringles potato chips. Participants reminded of their own death rated the Lexus and Rolex more positively than control participants, whereas MS had no effect on the appeal of low-status objects. Kasser and Sheldon (2000) reminded participants of death or a control topic (i.e., listening to music) and then investigated their fiscal expectations (e.g., their salary, the amount of money they expected to spend on luxury items) 15 years in the future. Participants’ fiscal expectations were inflated following a MS induction relative to the “listening to music” control induction. Despite the increasing numbers of research on this topic in psychology, the association between MS and economic behavior has not been fully investigated yet. The psychological motivation to preserve self-esteem under MS does not arguably act in isolation, but within a blend of multiple, interacting intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Economic incentives are an example and may interact with psychological instances. To what extent, for example, under MS individuals work harder to improve their self-esteem vs. gain more money? To what extent individuals desire luxury goods to affirm their self-worth or for their inherent economic value? The extant psychological studies on MS do not generally rely on incentive-compatible mechanisms (e.g., using cash to motivate the subjects), which are instead at the core of experimental research in economics. On the contrary, we believe that—in addition to self-esteem—economic incentives are strong drivers of individuals’ behavior, and their contribution to behavior needs to be controlled for, and clearly distinguished from that of motivations of different nature. The first aim of this study is to test one of the main predictions of TMT, i.e., whether MS increases effort and productivity as a mean to improve self-esteem, combining psychological priming techniques with an experimental economic setting. Priming refers to the activation of mental concepts through subtle situational cues (in our case, asking participants to think about their own death) to measure the psychological impact of primed concepts on subsequent tasks (see Cohn and Maréchal 2016). The experimental economic setting implies the adoption of an incentive-compatible mechanism. Importantly, we adopted a “flat-wage” scheme, such that participants received a fixed amount of money to perform a real effort task, regardless of their performance levels and therefore had no economic incentive to perform (see also Charness et al. 2013; Falk and Ichino 2006; Mas and Moretti 2009). Participants performed the real effort task under two experimental conditions: after a MS induction (i.e., requiring them to focus on the thoughts and emotions felt at the thought of their own death) and after a Music salience induction (i.e., requiring them to focus on the thoughts and emotions felt at the thought of listening to music) (see Kasser and Sheldon 2000 for a similar manipulation). Our aim is to test whether MS increases individuals’ productivity, as predicted by TMT, even when there are no economic incentives to perform, and therefore, individuals would be mainly driven by the quest for self-esteem. An additional aim of this study is to tease apart the effect of MS on self-esteem and status-seeking. Self-esteem refers to a person’s evaluation of, or attitude toward, him/herself (James 1890). According to TMT, self-esteem serves as a buffer against existential threat, by endowing individuals with a sense of self-worth capable to counteract the annihilating awareness of their mortal nature (Pyszczynski et al. 2004). Self-esteem proves indeed capable to reduce distal defences to reminders of mortality (Greenberg et al. 1997; Harmon-Jones et al. 1997). Several experimental studies have investigated the effect of performance feedback aimed at improving self-esteem on performance. Kuhnen and Tymula (2009), for example, showed that individuals’ utility is affected by (private) information regarding their performance. Kosfeld and Neckermann (2011) found that awarding individuals with a congratulatory card for the best performance increased productivity by approximately 12% (see also Blanes i Vidal and Nossol 2011). Although self-esteem is by definition resultant from one’s own assessment of the extent to which one meets cultural standards of value, validation coming from other people also plays an important role (Festinger 1954). Charness et al. (2013), indeed, found that individuals tend to make even more effort when they receive information on their rank publicly as compared to privately. Providing subjects with public (as opposed to private) feedback on their performance (e.g., their rank in a group) has an impact on social status, i.e., an individual’s relative standing in a social group (Leary et al. 1995; see also Rustichini 2008). Status-seeking is another strong incentive to performance. Different from self-esteem, status entails some form of public recognition and acts as a social signal of one’s competence and value (Rustichini 2008; Charness et al. 2013). Falk and Ichino (2006) and Mas and Moretti (2009) observed an increase in productivity in workers who observed each other output. Azmat and Iriberri (2010) carried out a natural experiment in a Spanish school where, for 1 year, students were provided with information on whether they were performing above or below their classmates’ average or the usual individual performance information. They found that providing public feedback information increased students’ grades by approximately 5%. Azmat and Iriberri (2011) also found that providing subjects with relative performance feedback boosted their performance and elicited feelings of dominance (see also Blanes i Vidal and Nossol 2011). Overall, these findings suggest that private feedback provides participants with incentives to perform even in the absence of economic incentives. However, public recognition constitutes an additional incentive to perform, having an impact on social status in addition to self-esteem. We predicted, therefore, that the effect of MS on productivity would be enhanced in a context where performance levels were made public, as this would increase status-seeking as a further mean to increase feelings of self-worth and contrast death-related thoughts. We tested the effect of MS on performance in a real effort task using a 2 (type of priming) × 2 (type of feedback) between-subject design. Participants were allocated randomly to two priming conditions: the MS condition and the Music salience condition. In both conditions, they could receive either Private feedback or Public feedback on their performance. In all 4 treatments, subjects performed a real effort task (i.e., a three-digit summation task). As anticipated, TMT predicts that under MS individuals would (1) express stronger belief in their own cultural worldviews (e.g., material values) and (2) embrace behaviors associated with increased feelings of self-worth (e.g., high productivity). Our main hypothesis (H1) is that, in line with prediction #2 from TMT, participants would perform better in the MS compared to the Music salience condition. To rule out the effect of economic incentives, subjects were compensated with a fixed amount of money regardless of performance (a flat-wage scheme). This way, any increase in productivity under MS would arguably depend on individuals’ quest for self-esteem (as opposed to economic incentives). Note that, economically speaking, under a flat-wage scheme, participants should not exert effort above the minimum (i.e., zero), because this is not compensated with cash. It is possible, therefore, that the effect of MS on productivity would be offset by the absence of economic incentives to perform induced by the flat-wage scheme. Under this scheme, therefore, it is possible that the main consequence of MS would be increased adherence to cultural worldviews (prediction #1 from TMT), as is the materialistic principle of least possible effort, leading to a relaxation—not an increase—of performance levels under MS (see Kasser and Sheldon 2000; Arndt et al. 2004b). We further anticipate, therefore, that the quest for self-esteem would be offset by the absence of economic incentives to perform in individuals high in trait materialism, who place disproportionate value in the acquisition/maintenance of material objects (Arndt et al. 2004), but apparent in individuals low in trait materialism, for which economic incentives are less salient. We additionally hypothesize (H2) that the effect of MS should be magnified when subjects are publicly informed about their ranking, as the drive to improve one’s social status in addition to self-esteem should constitute an additional incentive to performance and a further way to improve feelings of self-worth.",6

Consequently, micro-credit services had established by the local NGOs (Non-government organizations) in the last few years particularly in Bangladesh. They are providing a lot of attention to the welfare of the rural poor people (Ahlin and Jiang 2008; Hasan 1991; Hashemi and Schuler 1996; Rahman et al. 2003). Grameen Bank, BRAC (Bangladesh rural advancement committee), RDRS (Rangpur Dinajpur rural service) Bangladesh, ASA (Association for social advancement) and other Microfinance Institutions (MFI) in Bangladesh are working for improving lives and livelihoods of the poor people living in rural areas (primarily targeting the poorest of the society, especially women) (Wahid 1993; Mahjabeen 2008; BBS 2010, 2012; BRAC 1990; Bangladesh Ministry of Finance 2014; Rahman and Hossain 1986). Therefore, the GDP (gross domestic product) growth tends to increase from 6.5 to 7.6 since 2004 until at present state (IMF 2018), which represents the economic development status of Bangladesh. Furthermore, according to United Nations report published in (2005), micro-finance or micro-credit is defined as small-scale financial services to the poor and low-income people from rural areas, such as credit and savings accounts. Most of these investments or financial supports are profit oriented (Copestake 2007; Jehangir et al. 2002; Khatun et al. 2013; White 1992). Thus, the amount of loan, high-interest rate (national policy makers and also PKSF (Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation) fixed 12.5% interest rate or so-called service rate to be charged by MFIs to the poor people of the country) and early perseverance of microcredit payment; field workers make it difficult to generate quick economic return and thereby forces the borrowers into a grave sunken condition in the study sites (Rashid et al. 2011; Raihan et al. 2017). Microfinance is a powerful tool to fight poverty and help poor people from rural areas in order to raise their incomes, provide assets, empower women and uplift the entire community as well as mitigating themselves against external obstacles like natural disasters (Li et al. 2011; Mandelbaum 1988; CGAP 2004a; The Role of Micro-Credit in Poverty Alleviation 2009; Rahman 1986a, b; Ray 1987; Schuler and Hashemi 1994; Simmons et al. 1988). In Bangladesh, the idea of micro-credit system was originally proposed by a Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus (Hye and Islam 2012). These micro-credit services offered by NGOs particularly focus on financial or economic sectors (Rahman 2004; Rashid and Bashar 2010; Mason 1987; Pitt and Khandker 1998; Nilanjana 2013). For example, the micro-credit programs are engaged in agriculture, health, and sanitation, women empowerment, forest management, fisheries and educational programs (Revindo and Gan 2017; Li et al. 2011; Mazumder and Wencong 2013; Proshika 1999; Rahman 1986a, b; The World Bank Report 2016). These services are mostly provided in rural areas of Bangladesh in order to support their lives and livelihoods (Zohir et al. 2001; Uddin et al. 2012; Hasan 1998). Most of the people along the Jamuna River have no savings (Uddin et al. 2014; CARE 2000; Arndt et al. 2002; GoB 1993; GoB 1998). Therefore, they are not being able to go for big investment in the business sectors. However, a good number of NGOs are providing credit facilities to the poor people (Hashemi and Schuler 1993). On the contrary, local NGOs are working on women empowerment within the rural community by providing credits and handicrafts training (Mokhtar 2011; Hossain 1988). Despite these positive activities, some studies found that NGOs credit is not effectively reaching to the very poor people along the river Jamuna, Bangladesh (Goetz and Sengupta 1996; Khatun et al. 2013). Therefore, the previous researches have several limitations, which include spatial distributions of NGO with the strength and weakness of NGOs. The overall goal of this paper is to identify the micro-credit services provided by NGOs along the riverside of Jamuna. The study also seeks to investigate the areas, which still need such services to boost their lives and livelihoods. The broad goal of the study is to investigate the role of local NGOs in remediating poverty through micro-credit services in the landscaped along the riverside of Jamuna, Bangladesh. In the study area, around 3.5 million people inhabit chars which are mostly in the intervention areas, with around 1 million living on island chars that are surrounded by water for the majority of the year (Haque and Masahiro 2009; Hasan 1985). The significance of this study is to analyze micro-credit service provision of NGOs by providing GIS, GPS and Google Earth based-NGO’s baseline information of microfinance services and recording the physical location and basic portfolio data of all MFI branches (175 branches) in the study area mostly located in and along the Jamuna River Systems. The specific objectives set to fulfill this aim includes (1) to explore NGOs and its contribution in alleviating poverty; (2) to identify areas where NGOs have more/less concentration versus people dependent on its services; (3) to identify NGOs and its linkage with growth/commercial centers in the study area and finally (4) to investigate the socioeconomic attributes of the rural inhabitants who were part of this study. In this study, Sect. 2 talks about the literature reviews, Sect. 3 emphasizes on the methodology, Sect. 4 analyses the results and findings, Sect. 5 discusses about the findings of the current and previous researches, and Sect. 6 deliberates the conclusion with the strategic recommendations, limitations and contributions of current research.",

The problem of the management of common-pool resources has received relatively increased attention in economics. A common-pool resource (e.g., forestry, water, fishery and pastures) is non-excludable but rival.Footnote 1 Conserving common-pool resources is problematic because many individuals rely on the benefits of extraction for their livelihoods. Resources involving open access are much more vulnerable to over-harvesting than those with restricted access (Ostrom 1990). Joint users may harvest resources without gaining prior permission. The action of one agent affects the resource stock, which in turn affects the well-being of another agent through decreased resource availability. Common-pool resource exploitation is popularly known as the Hardin’s (1968) tragedy of the commons. Hardin’s (1968) metaphor is based on the assumption that human behavior is driven by selfish identity.Footnote 2 Individual selfish users are unwilling to pay the costs of conservation because the benefits of doing so are shared collectively. This paper offers a novel explanation for the conservation of a common-pool resource, namely economic agents who consider the resource conservation to be their major concern are driven by pro-social or pro-environmental identity. In the opening of Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments, “[h]ow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it” (Smith [1759] 1981, p. 9). Rizzolatti and Craighero (2005) describe that this famous sentence by Adam Smith contains the two distinct ideas. First, individuals are endowed with a mechanism that makes them share the fortunes of others. By observing others, we enter in an empathic relation with them. Second, because of our empathy with others, we are compelled to desire their happiness. Others’ unhappiness somehow intrudes into us; if others are unhappy, we are also unhappy. Humans have an innate interest in the fortunes of other people and desire for empathy with others. The individual in standard economic theory has a stable and consistent preference ordering over actions. However, the definitional unity of the self is called into serious question by the empirical inconsistencies of economic choices and by the need to construct multiple-self theories to explain them (Ainsle 2001; Bénabou and Tirole 2004). Our notion of identity follows in that it denotes a sense of self. The self-concept is an individual’s belief about the personal qualities and abilities. Based on the individual management of beliefs, Bénabou and Tirole (2011) develop a model of identity in which people care about who they are and infer their own values from past choices.Footnote 3 In their model, an agent who has built up enough of some asset continues to invest it even when the marginal return no longer justifies it. Our self-concept or identity has profound effect on the way we behave.Footnote 4 Akerlof and Kranton (2000) is the first attempt to emphasize the importance of identity for economic decision-making. In their framework, identity is defined as a sense of belonging to a social category which is exogenous. An individual is understood to have a sense of self when one associates oneself with others in one’s social categories and differentiates oneself from non-members.Footnote 5 Insofar as individuals internalize the code of conduct linked to a prescribed behavior, cognitive dissonance may be evoked when violating the prescription. Thus, deviating from prescriptions associated with the social categories is inherently costly and generates identity losses. An individual takes one’s identity as given and only reacts to belonging to a specific social category. The Akerlof–Kranton framework, therefore, does not explain how an individual can change identities or remain the same identity. Differently from their framework, this paper emphasizes the interplay of different identities. In the present paper, individuals actually choose who they are, that is, they endogenously choose their identity. This paper explores the idea of identity switching in the conservation of a common-pool resource. Identity switching plays an important role in differences in behavior. The paper studies the identity of individuals as a source of pro-environmental behavior. In the model, there are two different types of identities: selfish and pro-environmental. Individual identity is composed as a weighted sum of these types. Besides material payoff, the pro-environmental identity obtains psychological payoff related to the conservation of a common-pool resource. It is interpreted that the pro-environmental identity derives moral satisfaction from the resource conservation. I analyze the implications for identity switching from a selfish to a pro-environmental identity in the conservation of a common-pool resource. A different probability of identity switching prescribes a different behavior in which a different level of effort is selected in the resource extraction. By increasing the probability of identity switching from selfish to pro-environmental, the agent is expected to provide a higher activity level to the conservation. Then, resource sustainability can be attained. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes how identity switching affects resource extraction and conservation. Section 4 analyzes resource stock dynamics with identity switching. Section 5 concludes.",
66,2,International Review of Economics,28 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00317-w,The puzzling relationship between stocks return and inflation: a review article,June 2019,Somayeh Madadpour,Mohsen Asgari,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fisher (1930) hypothesis provides the basis for understanding the relationship between stock return and inflation. According to Fisher hypothesis, the real interest rate is neutral to the changes in expected inflation. The nominal interest rate, which is assumed to be the sum of the real interest rate and the inflation rate, manifests the changes in the expected inflation, leaving real interest rate unaltered. The hypothesis does not imply that real interest rate is a constant variable. In fact, the changes in real interest rate are due to the real sector shocks such as technology shifts. For years, the Fisher hypothesis has been at the center of attention due to its importance in macro- and micro-levels. In the governmental and central banks, the validity of Fisher hypothesis does indeed indicate that monetary policy is not effective due to the existence of the one-for-one relationship between inflation and nominal stock return and no relation between the real interest rate and inflation. For instance, in the contractionary monetary policy, the price of bonds (real interest rate) is increased to reduce the money supply and inflation, but if there is no relation between real stock return and inflation the contractionary monetary policy yields no real effect. Moreover, in the market, a fixed real interest rate has a huge implication for agents since it would have an effect on investment, savings, and asset prices. For example, imagine that the rate of inflation falls from 7 to 6% and additional declines are forthcoming. In this instance, agents may hold off on a major investment. Conversely, if inflation rates are already lower, agents will be affected to decrease their saving level and capitalize on prosperous financial terms. Besides, the awareness about stocks return–inflation relation could also enable borrowers to have profitable investment, which leads to economic growth and a powerful financial system too. Motivated by the implications and importance of the subject, many authors have investigated the relation between stock returns and inflation adopting different methodologies in different countries. The results of the studies, however, were not homogenous. In some studies, the coefficient of the relationship is in accordance with Fisher (1930) hypothesis (see, e.g., Woodward 1992; Phylaktis and Blake 1993; Mishkin and Simon 1995; Crowder and Hoffman 1996; Lee et al. 2000). In some other studies, Fisher hypothesis does not seem to be easily compatible with the reported results (see, e.g., Lintner 1975; Bodie 1976; Nelson 1976; Fama and Schwert 1977; Miller et al. 1976; Gultekin 1983; Solnik 1983; Kaul 1987; Nam 1993). The arising contradictory outcomes stimulate interest in finding the potential factors that drives the stocks return–inflation relation, leading to a comprehensive body of literature. Despite the considerable attention that the relation between stock return and inflation received in financial studies, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review paper to summarize the outcomes and the applied methods for providing a statistical guideline for future studies. This review paper aims to explore the literature on inflation–return relation and to classify these studies based on the sign and significance of the relation, geographical area, and the methods, but the paper does not provide a methodological treatise. Finally, the paper will bring into sight the gaps and opportunities that could be addressed for future research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, the classification based on the sign of the coefficient in each hypothesis is presented. The third section is devoted to representing the distribution by the geographical region, hypothesis, the sign of the coefficient, and the methodology on which literature is being reviewed. Finally, the fourth section contains a brief conclusion on the subject matter.",6
66,2,International Review of Economics,08 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00321-0,Voluntary versus enforced tax compliance: the slippery slope framework in the Brazilian context,June 2019,Fábio Pereira da Silva,Reinaldo Guerreiro,Eduardo Flores,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The tax collection is closely related to the state of social welfare. Tax collection can be defined as the primary source for managing government spending and enabling the public investment needed for the population’s well-being. In contrast, tax evasion has the potential to negatively and significantly affect a country’s economic development (Siqueira and Ramos 2006). Several studies involving taxpayer behavior initially emerged from the economic field, and they were solely grounded in the supposed rationality of individuals. In this context, two manuscripts have been highlighted: Allingham and Sandmo (1972) and Srinivasan (1973). These studies were based on the theory by Becker (1968) of crime and punishment, which accepted the classical economic paradigm according to which individuals adopt rational behaviors; in the taxpayers’ case, the decision to pay or evade taxes results from a comparison between the financial benefits and the risk of being punished. Thus, the authors estimated the maximum risk of punishment, and the greater tendency of taxpayers to act honestly. However, it has been observed that the rational economic paradigm does not fully explain taxpayer behavior, this limitation by determining that, although the likelihood of a tax punishment is minimal, a large proportion of the world’s population complies with their tax obligations, a finding that led to conclude that other factors are involved in taxpayers’ decisions and that they are not motived exclusively by the desire to maximize economic return (Alm and Torgler 2011; Alm et al. 1992, 2012b). Furthermore, the existence of other agents who influence the willingness to pay taxes is an idea that has been avoided in debates on the theme, especially in Brazil. The interaction of these agents affects an individual’s behavior, and it has great importance in analyzing the practices of tax evasion (Leviner 2008). Generally, there might be a type of psychological agreement involving all of these agents, particularly taxpayers, the government, and the regulators. Alm et al. (2012b) and Kirchler (2007) claimed that, when there is a trust-based interaction, citizens will be more likely or sensitive to paying their taxes, resulting in a reciprocal, cooperative environment. Conversely, the enforcement exercised by authorities might also be a source of influence on proper taxpayer behavior. According to Kirchler (2007), there are two types of tax environment. The first is a police-like environment, in which taxpayers are seen by authorities as potential evaders; this paradigm is called “crime paradigm” and it is based on the economic rationality (Allingham and Sandmo 1972; Srinivasan 1973). To avoid tax evasion, tax supervisors focus on audits, diligences, and penalties. Otherwise, Kirchler (2007) found that there is nearly a customer relationship between taxpayers and tax authorities, that is, a service-based environment in which the former is addressed as a client by the latter and contributes by paying taxes and in return receives good-quality services and adequate treatment. This exchange among both parties gives rise to a cooperative context that, as a consequence, reduces tax evasion. The fight against evasion, in this approach, occurs by increasing service quality, dutiful interactions, and the reasonable treatment of taxpayers, with authorities seeking to advise taxpayers to comply with standards and not only to punish them. Consequently, a new paradigm arises, called the “service paradigm,” which is opposed to the classical economic rationality. According to this new approach, taxpayers’ behavior is influenced by factors other than the wish to maximize individual utility; instead, they are influenced by other motivations, such as the interaction between the parties involved in tax matters. Brazil shows a prominent tax environmental to the assessment of both paradigms due to the higher tax burden and, consequently, the higher evasion. During 2015, for example, an estimated total of 678 billion reais average per month in taxes were collected in Brazil,Footnote 1 while the total amount of tax evasion was estimated to be 183 billion reais,Footnote 2 i.e., almost 27% of the total value collected. In this context, this paper aims to assess the two main trends in tax compliance, the “crime paradigm” and the “service paradigm” using evidence from Brazilian taxpayers. In this context, the research question of this manuscript is how are the Brazilian taxpayers’ behaviors affected by their interactions with tax authorities and government? Furthermore, Brazil provides an interesting context to this kind of evaluation due to the fact that for a couple of years reforms in the Brazilian taxation system has been discussed focusing on taxpayers and not solely companies. Additionally, this paper contributes to the development of public policies taking into consideration insights from the real Brazilian taxpayers. Additionally, the Brazilian is the largest one of the Latin America and according to Torgler (2003a), that is a lack in the academic literature about the trends in tax compliance in Latin America because of the studies concentration in the USA. The remaining of this paper is structured as follows: literature background, providing a deep analysis about both paradigms previously mentioned; methodological approach, demonstrating the research strategy to achieve the manuscript purpose; findings analysis and discussion; and conclusions.",1
66,2,International Review of Economics,18 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00322-z,Variation in nominal and real effective exchange rates: evidence across developed and developing countries,June 2019,Magda Kandil,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Recent episodes of heightened volatility in the global economy have brought to the fore the importance of exchange rate fluctuations to macroeconomic performance. Many central banks have realized that in an open capital account, the degree of flexibility of the exchange rate cannot be managed independently of external pressures induced by divergent monetary policies, which determine capital flows. Even under a flexible exchange rate system, monetary policy should aim to target the exchange rate to strike the right balance between external stability and domestic priorities for the macroeconomy. Hence, the degree of independence of monetary policy could be severely undermined in an open capital account in the face of capital pressures that could divert the exchange rate from a target for external stability against the backdrop of limited international reserves capacity to mitigate such volatility. In addition to capital flows, domestic economic conditions determine movements in the exchange rate with respect to major trading partners, i.e., the effective nominal exchange rate. Cyclical downturns could have adverse effects on the trade and financial accounts of the balance of payments. External balances are determined by exports and imports, which primarily determine the trade and current account balances. Further, the financial external balance is primarily determined by FDI and portfolio flows. It is expected that trade and external balances vary with the business cycle. During booms, exports and imports may increase. The net effect on the trade and current account balances will depend on the relative elasticity of exports and imports to the business cycle. Financial inflows increase in response to improved economic conditions. But, they could be induced by developments in the global economy as money flows across borders in search for the best return on investment given perceived risks of the underlying fundamentals. Furthermore, macroeconomic policies could exacerbate (pro-cyclical) or mitigate (countercyclical) the effects of aggregate demand shocks and external financial flows on the macroeconomy. Recent developments in the world economy have drawn attention to potential adverse effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the macroeconomy. In equilibrium, movements in the exchange rate track underlying fundamentals that anchor agents’ expectations and guide production plans. Hence, fluctuations in the exchange rate in response to domestic and/or external factors could create misalignments that impact on macroeconomic performance. Misalignments reflect unexpected pressures on the exchange rate in the form of overvalued or undervalued exchange rate. Such deviations may affect the demand and supply sides of the economy differently, with varying effects on real growth, price inflation, and components of aggregate demand. By construction, the nominal effective exchange rate accounts for openness, capturing import and export channels, to major trading partners. A depreciation of the domestic currency increases the price of imports and boosts export competitiveness. Both channels are inflationary. A higher cost of imports increases the cost of intermediate and final goods with direct and indirect effects on price inflation. Further, higher demand for exports increases inflationary pressures, at least in the short-run, in light of constraints on productive capacity and the output supply. Higher cost of imports has often been emphasized as a major determinant of the pass-through of exchange rate shocks to the macroeconomy, particularly in small open economies. Through the supply-side channel, depreciation may result in higher cost of intermediate goods for production in developing countries [see, e.g., Bruno (1979) and van Wijnbergen (1989)]. Moreover, constraints are binding on the availability of final goods in the domestic market. Domestic substitutes for imported goods, particularly capital goods, are not readily available in many developing countries. As a result, the output supply may shrink on higher cost of imported inputs. Further, the cost of final goods would go up on account of a higher cost of imports.Footnote 1 Exchange rate fluctuations also determine the effects of terms of trade shocks on domestic price inflation. The inflationary effects of terms of trade shocks could be reinforced on price inflation, depending on the degree of flexibility of the exchange rate. For example, positive terms of trade shocks (a higher price of exports, relative to imports) could have a large inflationary effect, absent flexibility of the exchange rate to appreciate. Positive terms of trade shocks would increase liquidity and domestic demand, including for imports, increasing inflationary pressures. In contrast, negative terms of trade shocks (a higher price of imports relative to exports) would have a larger inflationary effect under a flexible exchange rate system. Depreciation would increase the domestic price of imports, reinforcing the inflationary effect of the negative terms of trade shock. Under a flexible exchange rate system, a negative term of trade shock reinforces the increase in the cost of imports and inflationary pressures. However, absent flexibility of the exchange rate, a positive term of trade shock, translates into higher liquidity and demand for goods and services that could prove inflationary. Under both scenarios, fluctuations in the exchange rate are key to the transmission of terms of trade shocks to the macroeconomy. Fluctuations in the exchange rate are, in turn, key to macroeconomic performance and external stability. The exchange rate is considered one of the most important factors influencing export performance. This idea has mainly originated from the seminal work of Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) whereby devaluation of a country’s currency improves the trade balance by stimulating demand for the new cheaper exports and restraining demand for the now more expensive imports. However, three conditions must be satisfied if devaluation is to lead to a higher value of exports (Berman and Berthou 2009): (i) Export prices are set in the exporters’ currency and there is no pricing in local currency, (ii) foreign demand is sufficiently elastic, and (iii) exporters’ supply is also sufficiently elastic. If elasticity is low, which is typically the case in the short-run, then devaluation (depreciation) will have little effect on the trade balance (Metzler 1948). Dornbusch (1987) identifies a different set of conditions under which depreciation can stimulate exports. If foreign unit labor cost abroad is lower than in the domestic economy, wages are sticky, and domestic and foreign goods are not fully homogeneous, then the effect of depreciation in boosting competitiveness is not realized in the short-run absent flexibility in the labor market. Certainly, the effects of the exchange rate movement on the macroeconomy are well documented, both in the theoretical and in the empirical studies (Auboin and Ruta 2011). Nonetheless, most empirical studies have focused on the effect of depreciation on output, with little emphasis on the channels through which the trade balance and domestic policies impact on competitiveness and the real effective exchange rate. The aim of this research is to focus on the recent experience of exchange rate volatility by studying variation in the effects of shocks to policy variables and external balances on the real effective exchange rate. To understand sources of volatility in the real effective exchange rate, its nominal and inflationary components, the analysis will consider changes in the nominal effective exchange rate, capturing bilateral movements in the exchange rate and domestic price inflation. Higher domestic inflation, relative to that in major trading partners, is likely to undermine competitiveness and the prospect of improved external balances during an economic boom. In contrast, spending on investment contributes to capacity building and eases constraints on the supply side. Hence, investment spending stimulates real output with little inflationary effects. Through this channel, the external balances are likely to improve during economic booms. Macroeconomic policies could further help external competitiveness by targeting higher growth and lower inflation. The data under investigation are for a sample of 29 advanced countries and 19 developing countries between 1973 and 2013. Estimation coefficients will measure the effects of fluctuations in export growth, import growth, monetary growth, and the growth of public spending on movements in the real effective exchange rate and its nominal and inflationary components. The evidence will inform policy makers to capitalize on external openness toward stimulating the economy and ensuring the best results for economic performance and external stability, without unduly exacerbating macroeconomic imbalances and subsequent adverse effects on the economy. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the empirical framework. Section III presents the time-series results. Section IV offers cross section analysis across the groups of advanced and developing countries to assess the implications of the time-series evidence. The first part analyzes co-movements in the responses of nominal and real effective exchange rates and price inflation to various shifts across the groups of developing and advanced countries. The second part analyzes determinants of variation in the time-series correlations between movement in the real effective exchange rate and its nominal and inflationary components across the two country groups. Section V offers a summary and conclusion.",

The ideas and doctrines of Jansenism were already breeding in the Netherlands and in France. But at the very same time the Counter-Reformation, the doctrine and practice of the Jesuits, and the action of the Holy Office were gathering momentum across Italy, Spain, and Portugal. It is from this contradictory double development that civil economy will be born in the eighteenth century. Even before Martin Luther, a notable difference had existed between Latin Catholic Humanism and the spirit of north Europe. Prior to the Christian saints, the Italians had worshipped their household gods (the penates) and other Roman deities and held processions in their temples. Roman Christianity transfigured the social culture they had created; but it found space within it in which it could grow and take a mediated form. This syncretic culture included from ancient times its own mode of urban and commercial life. Below the Alps therefore, the market already existed before the diffusion of the Calvinist spirit and to this day it continues to exist with own distinctive character. In medieval times the accumulation of wealth drew such strong opposition that greed was labelled a capital vice; people were taught to cultivate an ethics of self-contentment and not to envy those above them. The Gospels and the message of Christ were unambiguous about money and wealth; and the economic ethic of the first millennium AD, as shaped first and foremost by the Early Church Fathers, contained a strong critique of money and of the pursuit of wealth in which the attainment of true wealth was deferred to the heavens. Even the notion of private property, while sanctioned as a legitimate individual right, was «much tempered and closely bound up with the rules as to the social use of property» (Fanfani [1934] 1935, p. 126). The development of early trade practices and the foundation of the Franciscan and Dominican orders favoured the shift to a more open view of trading activity and investment and even of money lending, even if most Franciscan thinkers moved much further towards individualism and away from notions of the common good than did the Dominicans’ activity (think for instance of Peter John Olivi, Scotus and Occam). Nonetheless Christian ethics did not evolve into a fully-fledged capitalistic ethic; nor did it encourage the accumulation of wealth in the ‘valley of tears’ for its own sake: «Wealth is thus a gift of God, and therefore not to be condemned. But men must not seek it so eagerly as to forget to lay up treasure in heaven, and they must walk carefully» (Fanfani Ibid., p. 127). From the first centuries of the Christian era, wealth is sublimated into a means and a sign: «The most striking aspect for someone trying to comprehend the social views inherent in early Christianity is the radical transformation and broadening of the idea of wealth from a means to satisfy earthly needs and pleasures into a nobler path to the heavens». The framework established by the Church Fathers, which went on to be a major influence in medieval culture and was itself informed by the Greeks, by Seneca, Cicero and the Romans, hinges on the notion of need: wealth that is not meant for, or exceeds, the satisfaction of needs is illicit: «His [of the miser] horse, his land, his servant, his gold is worth 15 talents; he is worth 3 soldi» (quoted in Barbieri 2013, p. 118).Footnote 1 It is not incorrect to say that ‘Christian and capitalistic virtues correspond in name but not in signification […]. Certainly no one can deny that such men as the Bardi, Pitti, Datini, acted in a capitalistic manner, and, though baptized Christians, introduced a capitalistic mode of life among their Catholic contemporaries. But we deny that in so doing they were acting in conformity with Catholic social ethics. […] Only unawares can Catholics truly conforming to their faith have favoured the development of capitalism—as understood in the sense we have already many times defined. Or else, only by consequences that humanly and practically could not be foreseen, could certain actions on the part of real and true Catholics have favoured capitalism’ (Fanfani [1934] 1935, pp. 151–154). Yet it was exactly this brand of anti-wealth and anti-capitalist Christian spirit that during the second millennium that nonetheless apparently allowed Florence, Venice, Paris, Lisbon, and London to thrive with wealth and usurers, as well as Rome with its boundless luxury. Fanfani then raises another interesting point: «This fact makes us ask ourselves if it be indeed true that Catholicism always opposed the capitalistic spirit as it revealed itself in a Catholic age» (p. 170). And: «If Catholicism and Catholics did not pave the way for the advent of capitalism, when and where did this come about? In Protestant countries after Luther’s revolt? Many declare that it flourished in such countries, but as for its birth, no one now denies that it took place before the Reformation, and hence in Catholic countries, among Catholics» (Fanfani, Ib. p. 160). His answer is that the capitalist spirit emerged prior to the Reformation out of certain ‘deviations’ from the Catholic ethic as a reaction to a new set of circumstances affecting Europe between the fifteenth and sixteenth century. The merchant began to benefit from a set of exemptions unavailable to other social actors: «In medieval economic society the only individual who could easily and often find himself in a position to act otherwise than in conformity with pre-capitalist economic ideals was the merchant» (p. 177).Footnote 2 This shows the prevailing opinion of the morality of commerce and of the markets in the Middle Ages. Suspicion and caution towards merchants and their activity remained ingrained within the Southern European Humanism, whereas, after the Reformation and through the Calvinist equivalence of wealth as blessing, the pursuit of profit has been turned from vice into the highest virtue of the capitalistic ethic—a transformation that has come to affect all forms of life on our planet. However, the main point in Fanfani’s argument is that the real conflict behind the Reformation was not theological, but civil: a clash between the Germanic world, organized around an archaic and feudal order, and Italian and Latin Humanism: «As it came into contact with the Latin world imbued with a new humanistic vocation and exhibiting the soft traits of the Renaissance, the Germanic world retreated in horror. Luther thought ill of the nature of this renewed spirit and responded» (Fanfani 1968, p. 508). Hence: «The Reformation, which in him found its beginning and its energy, was first and foremost a protest, and only afterward a restoration. […] That world that revolved around man, in which others—objects, time, mind, pray—were aimed at enhancing the individual enjoyment of life was seen as heresy in the eyes of his/its first followers» (ibid.). This argument is not dissimilar from Max Weber’s: «And what the reformers complained of in those areas of high economic development was not too much supervision of life on the part of the Church, but too little» (Weber 1976 [1905], p. 5). Luther’s protest, even more than Calvin’s, mostly targeted the Roman and Italian Humanism and Renaissance and not exclusively their theological deviations (like the indulgences) or the corruption of the clergy. It was, all in all, an anti-humanistic and anti-Renaissance critique that extended to the Counter-Reformation: «The Latin world reacted to the Protestant critique, but its reaction was primarily ecclesiastical. Thus came the Counter-Reformation that, sharing into the original criticism of Protestantism to the ideals of Humanism and of the Renaissance, detached the latter from its own and made it so that men, without forgetting the arts, the letters, and the discoveries that had been perfected with Humanism and the Renaissance, could use them to live a life lightened by Christian values» (Fanfani 1968, p. 509). Therefore, according again to Fanfani: ‘Humanism-Renaissance and Protestantism walked the same path, they were two moments of a single revelation that man gave to himself: the “naturalistic” revelation’ (Ibid.).",4

This system worked according to its very own mechanistic “laws” that could be analysed using an increasingly formalized language and mathematical analysis. Since the eighteenth century, the idea gained ground of what Seabright has called “cooperation with no one in charge” as an ideal state of market economy (Seabright 2004).Footnote 2 The role of the state extended mainly to setting and enforcing an external framework or rules of exchange, within which this “natural” interplay of economic forces would be allowed to freely unfold. This would allow maximizing the allocation of productive resources in a Pareto-optimal way, avoiding Nash equilibria and other sub-optimal features (e.g. Mokyr 2009, ch. 4). Adam Smith’s absolute advantage and Ricardo’s comparative advantage argument added to this vision of the market process as free trade and laissez-faire. There had been predecessors of this tradition in the early modern doux commerce discourse and Natural Law theory, and free trade ideas—however crudely defined—can be found as early as Antiquity (Irwin 1998). But until very recently such notions remained heterodox. Only post-1800 economic discourse would accept and them as mainstream and then depict as eternal truths, or “normal” conditions in the market process.Footnote 3 There existed, however, an alternative theory or philosophy of the market process. This theory agreed with later laissez-faire visions that free markets were principally good ways of maximizing welfare. But such conditions were never thought to obtain spontaneously. They were never to be found as the natural state of things. Rather equilibrium and equality in market exchange had to be created by design, established from outside. This arbiter in the market process, setting and enforcing the rules of good economic behaviour in the market place, was the prince, ruler, and—in the later visions—the state. This state was considered as proactive since it had to constantly supervise the market process and intervene where disequilibrium, rent seeking, usury prevailed, or any other injustice or unlawful exploitation. The state had to set rules of good market behaviour, be ready to enforce good governance in the market; set the rules of exchange by currency and monetary regulation, supervision of market exchange, price and quality controls for essential products, such as grain, meat, sometimes cloth. The state or ruler was also called to intervene where disequilibrium prevailed on the international-competitive stage, e.g. when a domestic industry failed to export or compete on interregional markets. Then, the ruler had to take proactive means to stimulate the market process by improving the quality of the goods manufactured for the market, employing rewards, bounties and other encouragements, as well as tariffs or import (and export) bans. These measures have been commonly called “mercantilism”, and particularly for the German-speaking countries, “Cameralism”.Footnote 4 Both are misnomers, first because central elements of the so-called mercantilist vision of the market process had been known to mediaeval economic thinkers of the Scholastic spectrum, long before the mercantilist or early modern period. This included market regulation, and the prohibition of some manufacturing imports when they harmed the common weal. In the same way, they continued to be applied by the capitalist nations of the West long after the early modern or mercantilist age had ended and the first, second and third industrial revolutions were in full swing (1770s–1970s). Price controls, import bans, tariff protection and other such “mercantilist” tools have belonged and still belong to the key tools of economic policy or “Governing the economy” in the capitalist nations of the West post-1945. Moreover, as new research on the crossroads between history of ideas and the history of economic analysis has shown, Cameralism was by no means chiefly or exclusively German. The cameralist genre can be found in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Sweden, Italy, Denmark-Norway, Finland, even Russia (Seppel and Tribe eds. 2017). The European heritage in modern economic analysis has in many ways been focused on classical Anglo-Saxon liberalism which, as scholars in the nineteenth century realized, never really represented mainstream thinking outside the Anglo-American economic episteme. Adam Smith, John Locke and the French Physiocrats all represented beginnings of modern economic analysis, but not the beginnings. The idea goes that it was during the eighteenth century that thinkers first began to develop the idea of abstract models and the economy as a mechanism of circulation that could be analysed by studying its basic principles and working mechanisms that were thought to hold true and be eternally valid regardless of circumstances, context, time and space. The tools to be used in this analysis were abstraction, reductionism, ideal-type, ceteris paribus clause and an increasing degree of mathematicizing (Morgan 2012). But new research strongly disagrees with the proposition that the invention of modelling and abstract economic analysis was original or peculiar to the Lockean and then Physiocrat and classicist tradition in economic analysis, suggesting instead that the writers of the mercantilist-cameralist ilk were no strangers to abstract models and thinking of the economy in aggregates (Elmslie 2015). In many ways, the reconfiguration of the global political landscape after 1945 meant that for the first time in history Anglo-Saxon economic analysis would become the mainstream in the western world. The history of economic analysis would accordingly be written in similar fashion and tone post-1945. This was also the time when Luther’s and other continental authors were either forgotten or depicted in decidedly derogatory terms of a binary primitivism versus advanced economic knowledge approach, manifested in the idea that the history of economic analysis could be written as a history of progress (e.g. Mokyr 2009; but see Magnusson in Rössner ed. 2016; Schefold 2014).",1

There is a specificity and an originality, not just to Luther’s own economic thinking (cf. Peukert 2010; Singleton 2011; Rössner 2015, 2017), but also to the economic and social ordering of countries and regions that were influenced by Lutheranism (cf. Cantoni 2014; Nelson 2017). Lutheran economic thinking constitutes a living and diverse tradition, being renewed by each generation—contemporary examples are Duchrow (1998), Ulrich (2005) and Jung (2009). In this article, I want to contribute to a fuller understanding of the development of Lutheran economic ethics, specifically through a further study into the economic thinking of the twentieth-century Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945).Footnote 1 Although the ethics of economics was not his main focus, throughout his works he engages consistently with the question of the Church’s message and mission with regard to economic life. In developing his own approach, Bonhoeffer makes recourse to Luther, while at the same time renewing Lutheran thinking on the economy. A number of recent studies are beginning to bring his thoughts on these matters to light (cf. Duchrow 1983; Green 1994; Pangritz 2009; Frick 2010; Rasmussen 2010; Falcke 2011). In this article, I want to contribute to that endeavor. Specifically, I will describe three different aspects of his views on the role of the church vis-à-vis economic life, namely (1) his insistence on the Church as an inclusive community, as exemplified in the relationship between Church and proletariat; (2) the guardianship role of the Church in relation to economics, as explicated in his doctrine of the divine mandates; and (3) the role of Christian professionals in economic life.",

According to Rich (2006, p. 99), faith is an ‘act of trust supported by love.’ This interpretation of faith as based on trust and love is common to Christianity in all its diversity. The Lutheran distinctive lies in the ‘sola,’ faith alone.
 The foundational doctrine of sola fide seems to stress individuality. Religion is something private, between me and God, and because of this the institutional role of the church as mediator is severely downsized. It is not the faith of the church and all the saints, but my personal faith which justifies. Although I sympathize with the central meaning of justification by faith alone, I am also concerned that a superficial understanding of this core doctrine, because of its individualistic bias, can become a theological license for a neoliberal market logic, severing the market from social realities and communal life. There is a real danger that individualism and consumerism are lifted onto the metaphysical level. Luther by formulating the sola fide principle made a rather bold statement in his days, unfortunately creating an unintended schism within the Western church. Luther and those within his social network profited from being able to access new techniques of printing and publishing and were able to bring about the social change others had sought before them. Recognizing that Luther was running a ‘multimedia campaign’ is a valid sociological reading of the Reformation.Footnote 1 A slightly different approach is to give an account of Luther’s views on economics against the background of the Late Medieval feudal system, for example, of his position on the poor, profit, greed, trade and usury (Peukert 2010; Lindberg 2016.Footnote 2 Luther’s theological message, however, is often neglected in the social sciences, although his radical view on ‘justification by faith alone’ has clear implications for social, economic and political ethics. Deirdre McCloskey rightly notes that ideas, also theological models, help understand how the ‘great enrichment’ could take place in Northern and Western Europe. According to her, the Reformation is the place to look for its origins: ‘The dice were rolled by Guthenberg, Luther, Willem of Orange and Oliver Cromwell’ (McCloskey 2016, p. xxxv). Yet these ideas are not static as they developed in a process being challenged in their unique contexts and interacting with other views articulated during the ages of enlightenment and secularization. Accordingly, the sola fide is such an idea that deserves to be explored as a spiritual undercurrent (Geistesgeschichte). Then, as now, it provides a general direction for a Protestant moral theology (theologia viatora), always reforming itself (semper reformanda) in light of contemporary social challenges. This is why we must feel free to apply his thought beyond the sixteenth-century context and construct a moral theological model that can deal with the fundamental questions in current economics. As we at the beginning of the twenty-first century are searching for an economics that takes into account environmental issues, human flourishing, justice and limits of growth, we might need to deconstruct some of the misunderstandings about Protestant individualism. Yet there exists a huge historic gap between Luther’s late middle ages and our global economic world. In order to overcome it, I propose to study in more detail the twentieth-century Lutheran mediator Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who wrestled intensively with the ethical meaning of sola fide; Martin Luther is omnipresent in Bonhoeffer’s writings. In fact, there are no theologian Bonhoeffer cites more often than Luther, according to DeJonge (2017) about 870 times, and almost always approvingly. Luther’s thinking apparently penetrated Bonhoeffer’s, and the latter, closer to home, can help us understand the former. Moreover, the Bonhoefferian perspective on sola fide chimes with recent interest in Protestant humanism, where the human person is primarily seen as a social being (Zimmermann and Gregor 2010). The purpose of this essay is to explain that the sola fide doctrine as expressed by Luther and contextualized by Bonhoeffer has a relevance for a wider audience than just theologians. Its central thesis is that the Lutheran doctrine of ‘sola fide’ should not be used as a vindication for neoliberal individualism, but instead provides a theological basis for an economics that prioritizes well-being and social capital. For if it is through faith that we identify with the crucified Christ, it means that we should be willing to face the needs of others in the real world. The essay is a contribution, from a Protestant theological perspectiveFootnote 3, to an economics of communion which gives priority to reciprocity and love. A more profound understanding of the theological primacy of sola fide and sola gratia (‘by grace alone’) completely erodes the foundations of the meritocratic ideology of the current market. To explore the social and ethical meaning of justification by faith alone, I will first briefly explain what we mean by sola fide, supposing that most of my readers are not acquainted with theological vernacular. Here we uncover the close connection between individualism and sola fide. Second, I will explain why Lutherans maintain a negative view of the human condition, since this anthropological position is significant for the Protestant ethic of economics. This view implies that only faith and God’s grace can help us overcome our irresistible tendency to (do) evil. Third, I will explain the social dimension of faith, and finally, we take a closer look at Luther’s understanding of work, a job or a profession. To come full circle, Luther’s conception of vocation only makes sense against the background of sola fide. I will conclude with some exploratory connections to an economics of community and gratitude.",
66,3,International Review of Economics,02 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00320-1,Individual and social fides: the contribution of Reformation to the ontology of economics,September 2019,Emilio Di Somma,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is never easy for philosophers/theologians to establish a dialogue with scholars of economics. On the one side, economists tend to relegate philosophical/theological consideration to the realm of personal beliefs; on the other, philosophers and theologians tend to express idealized judgments on economics and economic systems. However, I believe there is a presupposition, inherent to the current understanding of economics, which is damaging to both economic analyses and their philosophical discussions: the presupposition consists in believing economics a “hard science” which would look to an independent and totally objective reality. Despite the work of many philosophers and scholars in the twentieth century, who tried to analyze economic systems in their historical and cultural contexts,Footnote 1 the contemporary public debate still struggles to understand that economics, to make sense of its own claims, has to presuppose a set of “ontological statements” which are, before being political, ontological and cultural in nature. This essay is not only an attempt to develop an analysis in this direction, which would look at economic theories from a philosophical/theological point of view, but also has to be understood as an invitation for scholars of both fields to fill the current existing gap in approaches and methods regarding this problem. The hope is that the view of a scholar from the outside of economics would still inspire scholars within this field to seriously engage in discussions about the history, purposes and cultural features involved in the subject of economics. This essay, therefore, wishes to address what is believed to be a central historical crossroad that allowed the development of economics, and other social sciences, in the modern era. Such development would not have been possible without the transformation of the fundamental ontology through which European and Christian societies understood the world around them and their own social structures. I identify the turning point of such transformation, as other scholars, philosophers and social scientists have done, with the Reformation, which was the center and cause of major cultural, political and scientific development. Philosophers and social scientists like Taylor (2007), Cavanaugh (2008, 2009) and Blumenberg (1983) have developed such interpretation of the Reformation as the historical event in which the cultural and political landscape of western civilization has been utterly transformed. My interest in the Reformation as a religious, political and cultural upheaval lies in the fact that I identify Luther’s reforms not only as a shift in the landscape of political/religious authorities of the time, but also as a crucial moment in which the ontological landscape of western civilization has been radically changed. My argument is that the fundamental, ontological, assumptions of economics are based on the ontological revolution represented by Luther’s theology, and Reformation more generally, in a fundamental way. Such that economics would be unthinkable without the Reformation. With the Reformation, a world has died and a new one has risen to take its place. This new world has been the necessary ontological presupposition that allowed the development of modern economics and social sciences, as we know them today. It provided the ontological hypostases that legitimized the assumption on which such sciences are founded today. I propose to analyze such transformation through the study of the concept of faith and its fundamental transformation through the Reformation. In fact, in the Christian, medieval, context, faith was not just the trust, or the commitment, toward the divine figure of God and the authority of the Church. It presupposed an ontological structure of the world that was implied whenever a particular statement about the world was expressed. It was possible to have faith in things because they represented a higher order that structured the universe itself. The Reformation, instead, transformed our understanding of the phenomenon faith and changed radically the ontological relation that inhabitants of western societies established with their own world. This new ontological ground created the necessity to develop new epistemic tools, new forms of knowledge, to properly understand and categorize this new reality. To such revolution, Luther provided a fundamental contribution through his theology. This contribution is stronger in two fundamental features of Luther’s theological elaboration. The first is his interpretation of the concept of faith as a personal relation with God. The second lies in his fundamental theological anthropology, in which human beings become more and more passive subjects of the history of salvation and lose their predominantly active role within the realization of God’s plan. In Luther’s theology, the human being becomes a dichotomic system of spirit and flesh. An example of this transformation can be found in his commentary to the letter to the Galatians, where Luther redefines the concept of faith by separating it from any social/intellectual or existential relation. Faith becomes a passive righteousness (Luther 1796), belonging to the true Christian life, a righteousness that is independent from works, laws and ceremonies. Luther advocates for a righteousness gifted from Christ and the Holy Spirit, abandoning all other active forms of righteousness (Luther 1796). The Christian faithful possesses faith in God not because of a cosmic order external to himself, nor as a matter for the intellect or by the observance of ceremonies. Faith becomes personal trust in the sin-forgiving grace of God. Faith is described as the product of the impression that the Divine word makes on the individual heart and conscience from their creation. It is not a product of reason. It is no longer to be understood as something that can be attained through the proper framework and through reason and acknowledgment. Now it is a mystical product of the grace of God. This theological, radical, transformation is relevant for the birth of economics as a discipline because it represented the historical moment in which the human individual was perceived as such, a single entity before an organized world. The human individual is not anymore part of a community, and willing instrument of the harmony established by God. It is, instead, a here and now entity, conceived outside from his social position. This transformation represented the theological and theoretical ground through which modernity could develop its own ontology of the individual as an independent and autonomous being from its own social/environmental context. The individual was not understood as determined by his/her surroundings but as an independent datum; he was immersed in a nature that was equally independent and factual. This represented the fundamental shift in the Christian ontology, which allowed the development of modern sciences, including economic and social ones, as I will argue in the following pages of this paper.",

Ordoliberals embrace competitive markets, but they simultaneously profess a strong technocratic state to safeguard competition against monopolies and political power (Mudge 2008; Bonefeld 2010, 2012; Davies 2014). Other characteristics of ordoliberalism include a strong commitment to low inflation, tight antitrust regulation of competitive markets, rigid enforcement of debtor responsibilities, and a watertight separation between government borrowing and central bank lending. In other words, ordoliberalism has several features distinguishing it within the ‘neoliberal thought collective’ to which scholars in general assign it (Mirowski and Plehwe 2009). It is not rooted in the individualism of classical, Austrian and Anglo-Saxon versions of (neo-)liberalism. In this paper, I show that the political and economic theory of early ordoliberalism and the diagnosis of the political and economic turmoil in Germany during the interwar years in response to which it was first formulated can only be adequately understood by taking into account the deep Lutheran Evangelical faith and philosophical and theological engagement of the main protagonists like Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Alfred Müller-Armack, Constantin von Dietze, Alexander Rüstow and Wilhelm Röpke. As Manow (2001) has shown, the founding fathers of early ordoliberalism in the 1930 s through the 1950 s were all devout Lutheran Evangelicals. This Protestant heritage in ordoliberalism has played a decisive role in the post-2008 North-South split in Europe (Magatti and Martinelli 2016; Hien 2017). Emphatically, the argument advanced here is not that the early ordoliberals were driven by religious and theological concerns as opposed to economic theory. By contrast, my argument is that according to the early ordoliberals there was no such opposition. Economic, political, philosophical and theological arguments are intertwined by them as a matter of course. Consequently, I argue, their religious and philosophical outlooks fundamentally shaped their core economic concepts like ‘competition order’. While traditional history of economic thought generally operates (somewhat anachronistically) from a distinctly modern conception of what is economic and what is not economic—relegating, for instance, theology to the non-economic elements in the sources that are hence often disregarded—I seek to trace the lines of demarcation made in the sources themselves and to analyse the (sometimes very diverse) ways in which ‘the economic’ is conceived in them compared to our contemporary conception. I am not the first to analyse the role played by religious concerns in early ordoliberalism (Goldschmidt 1998; Manow 2001; Jähnichen 2010; Bonefeld 2017a; Hien and Joerges 2017b). The originality of the present contribution, therefore, lies in a more specialized question in the existing literature. While the traditional history of economic thought has focused narrowly on the ‘economic’ (in the modern sense) aspects of early ordoliberalism, in the more narrow scholarship on the intellectual roots of ordoliberalism the widespread view is that the main theological heritage in ordoliberalism comes not from Protestant, but from Catholic sources. In particular, research has emphasized the explicit reference to Thomist scholasticism in the name that ordo-liberalism chose for itself. The article shows that while the Thomist tradition is not entirely absent, the main concern in early ordoliberalism was rather with Lutheran worldly Ordnung than with Catholic cosmic ordo. Both may be translated into English as ‘order’, but they have very different meanings, they designate different areas of applicability, reflect different intellectual concerns and generate different problems and debates with different historical roots. In brief, the Latin ordo in the Catholic tradition refers to Divine order, while the German Ordnung in the Lutheran tradition refers to the ordination of worldly authority by God. While Weber analysed the Calvinist trajectory of influence on modern Northern European and Anglo-Saxon economic thinking, the specifically Lutheran heritage is at first a more difficult one to grasp, since Luther himself opposed the power of money in all its shapes and forms: religious (indulgence), political (papacy), economic (usury) and private (luxury) (Bruni et al. 2016). But as argued in this article, the Lutheran heritage in the case of ordoliberalism does not come with Calvinist culture or liberal Protestant social movements, nor does it consist in the adoption of specific economic dogmas from Luther’s writings. Rather, ordoliberalism developed from a distinct complex of concepts and problems related to the question of social order (Ordnung) rooted in the distinct Lutheran Evangelical tradition of ‘political ethics’ in Germanophone countries during the interwar years. Thus, from a historical perspective ‘ordo-liberalism’ would be better designated as Ordnungs-liberalism. Section 2 discusses the ‘archaeological’ methodology to the historical study of theories (Libera 2014). Section 3 presents the dominant view that ordoliberalism is rooted in the scholastic concept of ordo and assesses the extent to which this heritage is relevant. Section 4 argues that early ordoliberalism is marked by far more profoundly by Lutheran Evangelicalism and the concept of Ordnung. The section also traces this concept from the Bible via Luther and Lutheran ‘political ethics’ to the founding fathers of ordoliberalism in the 1930 s through the 1950 s. Section 5 concludes and discusses the implications of this shift of focus for our understanding of ordoliberalism as an influential modern economic theory.",2
66,4,International Review of Economics,20 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00325-w,Did the Easterlin Paradox apply in South Korea between 1980 and 2015? A case study,December 2019,Michiel Slag,Martijn J. Burger,Ruut Veenhoven,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In 1974, Easterlin presented data on the USA, showing that average happiness had not increased between 1946 and 1970, in spite of tremendous economic growth over these years, and that personal income was related to personal happiness in the United States of America (USA), rich Americans being happier than their poorer compatriots. Easterlin observed that at one point in time, happiness varies directly with income both among and within nations, but over time an increase in income does not go hand-in-hand with an increase in happiness. Since economic growth translates to higher incomes, this finding seemed contradictory and came to be known as the ‘Easterlin Paradox’. Easterlin explained this phenomenon assuming two cognitive mechanisms, ‘adaptation’ and ‘social comparison’, both of which will nullify the effect of income gains. Adaptation neutralizes the effect of extra income when aspirations rise at the same rate and social comparison keeps happiness at the same level; ‘a riding economic tide lifts all boats’ and any difference with references groups (the Jones’s) remains the same. Together these notions are known as ‘relative income theory’. Easterlin’s counter-intuitive finding has been the cause of considerable research on the effect of economic growth on happiness in nations, later studies being able to draw on a growing body of data, both for more countries and for longer time-series. The results of these later studies are mixed. At the macro-level, several investigators have found a small positive effect of economic growth on average happiness in nations, e.g. Hagerty (2000), Hagerty and Veenhoven (2003), Stevenson and Wolfers (2008), Diener et al. (2013) and Veenhoven and Vergunst (2014). Easterlin disputes these findings (Easterlin 2005, 2016; Easterlin et al. 2010) and still argues that economic growth has not made us any happier. Rather than just checking whether or not the Easterlin Paradox is true, several investigators have looked for the conditions under which it applies or not. At the macro-level of nations, Diener et al (2013) found that the effect of economic growth is more robust when measured using average income, than with GDP per capita, while De Neve et al. (2018) argue that the Easterlin Paradox can be partly explained by the asymmetric experience of positive and negative economic growth. Other studies have examined under which social circumstances GDP per capita growth goes hand-in-hand with increases in happiness. Oishi and Kesebir (2015) found that economic growth has increased average happiness only when economic growth is equally divided across the nation’s population, while Mikucka et al. (2017) found that economic growth has a positive effect on subjective well-being when accompanied with decreasing income inequality and increasing social trust. Likewise, Bartolini et al. (2013) argue that if economic growth does not come with a reduction in (the quality of) social capital or relational goods, then happiness can well rise. Focusing specifically on the economic crisis, several studies have found that the negative impact of an economic crisis on subjective well-being can be alleviated by institutional and social trust (Helliwell et al. 2014), social capital (Gudmundsdottir 2013), and the presence of unemployment support programmes and employment protection legislation (Morgan 2018), and good quality of governance (Arampatzi et al. 2019). Many studies at the micro-level within nations have confirmed that people who earn a relatively high income tend to be happier than their less well earning fellow citizens. Follow-up studies have shown that income increases result in a positive change in an individual’s happiness (Senik 2004; Frijters et al. 2004; Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2005; D’Ambrosio and Frick 2012; Vendrik 2013). Slag and Veenhoven (2018) provide a recent review of the available follow-up studies on this topic. Micro-level studies on the effect of adaptation and social comparison on an individual’s happiness have found both positive and negative coefficients. According to the relative income theory of Easterlin (1974), these effects should be consistently negative to cancel out the positive effect of income on happiness, but the data suggest that comparison can also boost happiness. This indicates that the Easterlin Paradox does not hold under all circumstances (Slag and Veenhoven 2018). So far, the data suggest that economic growth does not always work out on happiness in the same way; the Easterlin Paradox may apply in many cases, but it is not an ‘iron law’; context dependency is more plausible. Economic growth is likely to involve various effects on happiness, and the balance of these effects is likely to vary across situations. If we have to choose whether to foster economic growth for the sake of human well-being, we must know in which conditions economic growth has affected happiness most and least. In this regard, Easterlin’s study shows that economic growth has not added to happiness in the USA since the end of World War II (Easterlin 1974, 1995). Later studies in Europe have shown that economic growth has added a little to average happiness in most European nations (Hagerty and Veenhoven 2003; Stevenson and Wolfers 2008). Since most research on the Easterlin Paradox has focused on Western nations, we are only limitedly informed about the effect of economic growth on happiness in East-Asia. The Easterlin Paradox seems to apply to China, in which rising GDP per capita has been accompanied by decreasing happiness levels (Brockmann et al. 2009; Easterlin et al. 2012; Li and Raine 2014). On the contrary, Japan is a clear case in which there is a positive association between income increases and increases in average happiness (Stevenson and Wolfers 2008). Likewise, Lim et al. (2017) found no sufficient evidence of the existence of Easterlin Paradox in Taiwan and Malaysia in that they found a positive association between income and happiness over time, at both the micro- and macro-level. In this paper, we considered the case of South Korea for which good data is available (cf. Sect. 2.1). Having examined at the macro-level effect of economic growth on average happiness, we then tested whether or not the relative income theory of Easterlin applied at the micro-level. South Korea is especially interesting, because this country is one of the fastest growing economies of this time with an average yearly growth of 7.3% since 1967. Since it is likely that the effect of economic growth on average happiness is small, this effect will be better visible when there is large variation in GDP. Furthermore, median and average income in South Korea show more or less similar growth between 2006 and 2014, which indicates that economic growth in this country was equally divided in this era. Based on the World Values survey, Easterlin et al. (2010) concluded that there was no relationship between long-term growth and increases in happiness in South Korea. Using new macro- and micro-data, we will reassess. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: the data are described in Sect. 2, the analysis is discussed in Sect. 3, the results are presented in Sect. 4 and conclusions in Sect. 5.",7
66,4,International Review of Economics,16 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00326-9,The foundation of the right of property: Rosmini as Genovesi’s interpreter,December 2019,Paolo Santori,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The renewed interest in the Italian modern tradition of economic thought (Bruni and Porta 2003; Bruni and Zamagni 2007; Milbank and Pabst 2016; Bruni and Santori 2018; Dal Degan 2018) paved the way for new analyses of the history of economic thought. These researches tend to investigate the Southern tradition of Civil Economy (represented by Antonio Genovesi and his fellows), which spread in parallel with the Northern tradition of Political Economy (Adam Smith and his fellows). Neapolitan civil economists of the eighteenth century conceived market as a place in which civic virtues and public trust play a key-role as well as self-interest and invisible-hand mechanism. In their perspective, commercial society was ‘civil’ as it constituted a ‘civilizing’ factor with respect to feudal society. Besides, it has a direct bearing on the good of the civitas, i.e. the common good of society. Differing from Northern Political Economy, the Southern notion of market conveys another domain of social life in which people can flourish and express their relational nature. Hence, before being an inquiry on ‘The Wealth of Nations’ (Smith), Civil Economy focused on ‘Public Happiness’ of societies. While there have been inquiries concentrating on the core (Bellamy 1987; Bruni 2013, 2017; Pabst 2018) and the roots (Zamagni 2010; Bellamy 2015; Bruni and Santori 2018; Santori 2019) of Civil Economy, there is still space for the analysis of its ramifications in the successive centuries. This research attempts to contribute to depicting the reception and influence of Civil Economy in the Italian intellectual scene of the nineteenth century. The object of analysis will be the confrontation between two authors living in different ages, or, as I would rather formulate it, the critical confrontation of one with the other’s work. The actors involved in this debate are the philosopher and economist Antonio Genovesi (Castiglione, Salerno, 1713–Naples 1769), founder and main exponent of Civil Economy tradition, and the philosopher and theologian Antonio Rosmini Serbati (Rovereto 1797–Stresa 1855). Rosmini was a leading figure in the Italian philosophical and political debates of the nineteenth century. Due to his polemics against socialism and communism, he is usually considered among the father of Catholic Liberalism (Piovani 1997; Novak and Adams 2015; Mingardi 2017), ‘Personal Liberalism’ (Rosmini et al. 1997) and ‘Economic Liberalism’ (Felice 2002). In recent years, these classifications have been discussed by Carlos Hoevel (2007, 2013). In his book The Economy of Recognition, Hoevel argued that Rosmini’s economic and political view was based on a new interpretation of the Hegelian category of ‘recognition’. The comparison proposed in this paper is aimed at inquiring a further hermeneutical hypothesis, namely Rosmini as an ‘heir’ of the Italian civil economists of the eighteenth century. Owing to the expanse of interests and genuine intellectual curiosity shown by Genovesi and Rosmini, a systematic analysis would be too perplexing. Therefore, I intend to draw a comparative reconstruction of their legal and economic standpoints, based on two different anthropological and ontological models, in the wake of studies that have incidentally underlined the relationship between the two systems of thought from the perspective of Philosophy of Law (Albini 1859; Mattirolo 1871; Botto 1992) and of economic thought (Hoevel 2007, 2013; Baggio 2015). The main theme I will draw attention to is connected to the foundation of the right of propertyFootnote 1 and, more precisely, to laws governing the last-will acts, i.e. succession of property ab intestato, testaments, legations and donations mortis causa.Footnote 2 Rosmini directly challenges Genovesi’s thought on the matter. That was not a marginal issue for both authors. For civil economists, it constituted one of the core contents of their polemic against feudal society and the inherited privileges of landlords. My aim is to examine the implication of the ‘social’ nature of mankind in both authors through the consequences that this anthropological claim produces on their views on the right of property. Both Genovesi and Rosmini tried to combine ‘the classical and Thomistic view of man as a rational and social animal directed to virtue with modern liberal principles of natural rights and individual human dignity’ (Kraynak 2018, 5). As far as the issues this paper analyzes are concerned, I suggest that Rosmini has a proclivity for the modern liberal tradition, whereas Genovesi strongly contemplated the Aristotelian and Thomistic account on the ‘social’ nature of human being. In the Conclusion, I will consider if this hypothesis can be extended to Rosmini’s and Genovesi’s social and economic philosophy as a whole. These issues are still of interest today. Thomas Piketty (2013)’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century harshly criticized the high concentration of wealth and capital in few hands, listing the topic of ‘merit and inheritances’ as one determinant factor of this situation. Moreover, the debate on the taxes on inheritances is still ongoing both at the academic (McCaffery 1994; Beckert 2008; Scheve and Stasavage 2012) and the political level. My research method will be evaluative. After emphasizing the significance of Genovesi’s work in the formation of a young Rosmini, I will turn to the analysis of his criticism towards Genovesi’s anthropological and juridical model, with the aim of determining whether he actually grasped the latter’s peculiarities. At the same time, I will question the feasible mediations derived from the reading of other authors, contemplated by Rosmini as ideal successors to Genovesi’s thought—above all, I would mention Giandomenico Romagnosi and Melchiorre Gioia. Adhering to this interpretative framework, some of the differences signalled by Rosmini between his own thought and Genovesi’s works will be mitigated, while others, that may seem marginal, will rather be accentuated. The main question set against the backdrop of the paper regards the possible inclusion of Rosmini into the Italian Civil Economy tradition, characterized by the emphasis on civic virtues and reciprocity (Bruni and Zamagni 2007; Bruni and Sugden 2008). Does Rosmini’s anthropology integrate with the civil economists’ one? If so, does it produce similar views of society and market? The right to mutual assistance, theorized by Genovesi and just foresaw by Rosmini, will constitute the hermeneutic crux to start to address this broad philosophical issue.",
66,4,International Review of Economics,03 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00327-8,"Debt sustainability, structural breaks and nonlinear fiscal adjustment: empirical evidence from Algeria",December 2019,Abderrahim Chibi,Sidi Mohamed Chekouri,Mohamed Benbouziane,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"This study focuses on the fiscal policy sustainability which has received much attention during the last two decades, as budget deficits in developed and emerging countries have deteriorated. To further deepen the commentators, investors and analysts, insight and get some sound and efficient strategies which seeks to address some questions relevant to the research development of whether public finances in the EU countries and in the USA are on a sustainable track. In less developed countries, the public sector is usually more fragile and prone to shocks than in the developed countries. In view of the fact that the public sector of these economies is more vulnerable to exchange-rate fluctuations, commodity price fluctuations (like the price of oil), changes in interest rate on government debt, sprees of high inflation and political turmoil. This alarming reality motivates the researcher to examine the economy of Algeria which is virtually based on exports of oil, natural gas and related products which is dominated by the state. The hydrocarbon sector is responsible for 40% of GDP and over 95% of export earnings. In the 1990s, the Algerian political and social situation suffered from a series of political troubles since 1988–1998, and the low oil price undermined the degree of freedom of the authorities. These events followed years of economic downturn which the country experienced in the eighties after the oil price slump that caused a deterioration of Algeria’s deficits and public debt. At the end of 1993, the Algerian economy was in bad conditions: recession, unemployment close to 30%, a budget deficit equal to 8.7% of GDP, an increase in the money supply (+ 21%), a deficit on the balance of trade exacerbated by a fall in the exchange reserves until they could cover only 6 weeks of imports and a debt burden of 82% of GDP. To attain macroeconomic stabilization, the 1994 IMF program has realized strong fiscal adjustment supported by tight monetary policy, exchange-rate modification and a strict incomes policy. The factors that constrained the country were moderated in the 2000s: the ‘events’ came to an end, the dinar was more stable, the oil price increased, and this resulted to a positive balance of trade and a banking system with excess liquidity. Algeria experienced stable and moderate inflation. High oil revenues had been designed to reduce the public debt and to protect public expenditures from fluctuations in the budget surplus due to unpredictable variations in the oil price. Following the decline in oil prices in mid-2014, large fiscal and external imbalances emerged once again in Algeria, and fiscal savings were rapidly depleted. According to the Ministry of Finance, during the first 2 months of 2016, the Algerian budget deficit deteriorated to 1404 billion dinars (about $ 14 billion), which in fact has increased to 240% with regard to the same period in 2015. Tax revenues decreased to 20.2% which was affected by a fall in oil prices. Budget expenditures have risen rapidly, where it shifted from 1223 billion to 2040 billion Algerian dinars (66.9%). Official foreign exchange reserves decreased from 22.5 months of imports at the end of 2016 to 18.6 months in June 2018 (about $ 80 billion), and the drop is expected to continue. The deterioration of Algeria’s terms of trade led to a 20% nominal depreciation of the dinar since mid-2014. In 2018, the real value of the exchange rate depreciated to 8.8%. For most MENAP oil exporters,Footnote 1 the fiscal adjustment needed to absorb the oil price shock which is unprecedented. In this regard, many countries adopted significant deficit-reduction measures, while drawing down financial buffers, where available, or borrowing to smooth the adjustment to lower oil prices. In 2016, budgets indicate that the only policy effort will be intensified (Fig. 4 in Appendix). Also, experts stressed that additional consolidation efforts will be needed over many years to ensure medium-term debt sustainability and will contribute in supporting the restoration of the external rebalance (Fig. 5 in Appendix). Since 2009, despite abundant liquidity, the fiscal deficits of the Algerian central government have been financed mainly by borrowing from public entities and drawing down fiscal savings. From 2009 to 2016, Algeria recorded a cumulative fiscal deficit of 8.297 billion dinars (equivalent to $75 billion). Of this amount, 46% was financed using the deposits of public entities—a practice tantamount to central government borrowing but not reflected in government debt statistics.Footnote 2 Another 42% was financed by drawing down savings in the FRR.Footnote 3 The deposits of public entities financed the bulk of deficits during 2009–2013, whereas savings in the FRR have been the main source of financing in the last 3 years. Only 6% of the cumulative deficit was financed by net domestic debt issuance.Footnote 4 Net foreign borrowing has been negligible (see Fig. 6 in Appendix). Algeria has not externally borrowed since it received its last disbursement from the IMF in 1999. Government Debt to GDP in Algeria averaged 47.72% from 1991 till 2014, reaching a high record of 174.3% in 1995 and a low record of 8.32% in 2013. Government Debt to GDP in Algeria is reported by the Algerian Bank. Nevertheless, despite some new loans, government debt increased from 8.8% of GDP in 2015 to 32.88% of GDP at the end of 2018 mainly reflecting the materialization of fiscal risks in the form of supporting the public enterprisesFootnote 5 (see Figs. 8, 9 in Appendix). To provide an insight into the current large financing needs over the medium term with savings in the FRR near the statutory floor of DA 740 billion (see Fig. 7 in Appendix), Algeria launch a domestic debt issue in first April 2016 as it seeks to diversify financing sources. The debt, with a maturity of 3–5 years, will hold an interested rate of 5.0–5.75%, but the size of the issue has yet been determined. Each bond will be valued at 50.000 dinars ($462); individuals and firms can be registered at post offices, bank agencies and central bank branches as well. Despite all the available means, the public authorities have succeeded in attracting only 400 billion dinars, or an equivalent of $ 3.6 billion (36% of the value that must be collected). At end-2016, Algeria’s domestic debt amounted to DZD 3.407 billion (equivalent to 19.9% of GDP). From this amount, DZD 978 billion consisted of regularly issued Treasury securities with maturities ranging from 13 weeks to 15 years. Most of this debt is held by public banks and insurance companies. The National Bond for Economic Growth, a local-currency bond issued by the government in 2016, accounted for another DZD 569 billion. The remaining DZD 1.861 billion resulted from government operations to support public enterprises. Most of these operations took place between 2009 and 2016. Government-guaranteed domestic debt amounted to DZD 3163 billion adequate to 18.5% of GDP. At end-2017, about 53% of outstanding Treasury securities were held by the central bank, mostly the remaining public banks and insurance companies. Outstanding external debt is generally on concessional terms and owed to official bilateral creditors. At end-2017, public external debt represented 2.4% of GDP ($ 4.1 billion). Actually, the government allowed to resort directly and indirectly foreign borrowing through the adoption of financing formula project and concession soft loans which is most prominent in the Algerian–Chinese agreement (Chinese loan over a long term) to finance a project of the new Algerian’s port, which is estimated to cost $ 3.3 billion. Algeria has also resorted the African Development Bank to benefit from a loan of 1 billion dollars to finance part of Sonelgaz (Algerian public enterprise for gas and electricity) projects. All these challenges involve us to deal with some questions relevant to follow a line of investigation: First, are Algerian public finances meeting their intertemporal budget constraint? Second, is the sustainability of public debt robust to structural breaks and/or shifts in fiscal policy regimes? Third, is there any evidence of asymmetric and/or nonlinear fiscal adjustment back to equilibrium? And what is the speed of the process of fiscal consolidation? In this context, the aim of this paper is to analyze the technical basis of financial soundness and state solvency, and provide some evidence on the sustainability of public debt in Algeria, especially, when fiscal policy is conducted as a nonlinear process, which has been hardly treated in the literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section two deals with the theoretical foundation of fiscal sustainability. Detailed empirical evidence is at hand in section three. Section four focuses on the methodology used as well as the main results. The last section offers some conclusions and recommendations for decision-makers.",

Frey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"At the end of the last century and the beginning of the new century, economists gained great insights into the determinants of subjective well-being. They were informed by social psychologists who dealt with the issue earlier than economists did (Kahneman et al. 1999). Happiness research was taken up by the media and was recognized in the general public. It became general knowledge that national income per capita is not directly linked to people’s well-being. The Kingdom of Bhutan officially proclaimed that its policy is to further happiness and not GNP. In the social sciences, happiness research is an excellent example of an interdisciplinary approach not dictated from above but an efficient way to learn from each other. This applies in particular to economics and psychology, but beyond also to philosophy, sociology and political science. They are all engaged in finding ways and means to raise human happiness. For economists educated in strict neoclassics, it came as a surprise that human well-being can be measured, and that it can serve as a useful approximation to the theoretical concept of utility (see, e.g., Weimann et al. 2015; Kahneman and Krueger 2006). Hicks and Robbins, who in the 20s and 30s of the twentieth century were dominant scholars, were convinced that it is impossible to measure utility. As a result, a microeconomic theory was developed which does not rely on measured utility. Above all, this approach made it possible to empirically estimate demand function. This was quite an achievement, but over time it became clear that this approach cannot cope with important behavioral regularities (for an early statement see Sen 1977). These shortcomings have at least partly been overcome by happiness research which starts from the—well-founded—assumption that subjective well-being can be captured by careful representative surveys. Happiness research has produced many novel and also surprising insights into what individuals’ value. It suffices to mention some examples: One of the largest negative effects on happiness occurs when people lose their job and become unemployed. This is only partly due to the concomitant income loss (this effect is kept constant in the multiple regression approaches) but rather to the fact that people experience a strongly reduced feeling of self-worth, and that they are no longer part of society. In contrast, in neoclassical economics work is taken as a burden or cost, and receiving an income without work would be optimal. That unemployment has a strong negative effect on well-being has been found in a large number of studies. It has, for instance, been shown that the self-employed, who work harder and on average receive lower incomes than people employed in organizations, are happier (Benz and Frey 2008). Happiness research emphasizes the importance of social relationships to one’s family and friends, an aspect disregarded as a welfare contributor in orthodox economics. This is an aspect long ago focused on by the Italian movement of civil economy.Footnote 1 Giving and volunteering are found to raise happiness. This stands in contrast to orthodox economics where it is assumed that gaining additional income raises utility. Happiness theory supports the notion that procedural fairness matters for individuals. There are conditions under which a less favorable outcome is preferred if the process has been considered fair (e.g., Lind and Tyler 1988; Hollander-Blumoff and Tyler 2008). Today, economic happiness research is widely accepted in the academic profession though there are still quite a number of scholars who find that utility is not well approximated by empirical measures of happiness. Especially young researchers have become strongly engaged in the subject. Hundreds of scientific articles have appeared since the beginning of the twenty-first century.Footnote 2 Not surprisingly, there are signs of marginally decreasing insights. It is difficult to come up with really new results. Rather, most contributions are devoted to a very specific issue, and the advance in our knowledge about happiness is restricted. This is a normal process in every new field.",15

Two opposite visions of the role of the State emerge in analyses of community governance: communities governed by the State, in other words societies with State, and communities self-governed by private agents, called stateless societies. In the first case, following Stiglitz (1989), the State produces the goods and services which are essential to community life (public goods) or alternatively plays the role of an organiser managing these goods and services, which are accessible to all members of the society (common goods) (Ostrom 1990). In the second case, societies without State can be governed by private agents if market mechanisms and other institutions are able to enforce cooperation and coordination without a State. This lively debate is also found in the political economy literature (Acocella 2018), where the State is generally considered a benevolent dictator or a benevolent policy-maker. Different views have been proposed in this strand of literature, e.g. the hypothesis of a State controlled by a lobby or governed by a partisan or political party, whose main or unique goal is to pursue the lobby interests of political party members.Footnote 2 The main studies that focused on agent behaviour cover the theory of altruism and reciprocity and the selfish and altruistic behaviour of agents when they interact or they have to contribute to a public good. In the altruism theory of Margolis (1982) the agents act non-selfishly and are motivated by a concern for the welfare of others. An alternative approach, for example, suggested by Harsanyi (1980) supposes that agents pursue self-interest while being subjected to moral constraints, which are rules that everyone should follow in their own interest.Footnote 3 Following this line, Sugden (1984) introduced the reciprocity principle in the supply of public goods through voluntary contributions and compared it to the Margolis altruism theory and to the rule called the “Kantian” principle. Roemer (1996) introduced the formal definition of Kantian allocation and, more recently, he called Kantian behaviour a cooperative kind of optimizing behaviour that produces Pareto efficient outcomes and solves different kinds of commons’ tragedies (Roemer 2015).Footnote 4 Levine (1998) examined a theory of altruism where the players’ payoffs are linear in their own and their opponents’ monetary income, showing that, in a market game, the theory of altruism and the theory of selfish players result in exactly the same predictions. Finally, another strand of economic literature studies how a community’s private and public goods are provided and how they are protected from risks, such as plunders. For example, the community could be raided by external individuals, or plundered by agents that are part of the community. In both cases, the community has to protect its production from damage and pillage, but the defence action taken can be more or less efficient. In particular, Olson (1993) stated that “roving bandits” make anarchy inefficient and a “stationary bandit” such as a dictator who monopolizes and rationalizes theft in the form of taxes can increase the efficiency. Kurrild-Klitgaard and Svendsen (2003), following Olson (1993), showed that, in a world of roving bandits, a sub-optimal provision of public goods and of security exists. Thus, the most efficient bandits can monopolize violence, levy taxes and provide public goods to improve the efficiency. For Leeson (2007) it is possible to transform roving bandits in travelling traders by transforming the incentive to banditry into an incentive to trade, and by reducing the producers’ costs associated with trade. Young (2016) explained when competition among roving bandits does not lead to the emergence of a “non–predatory state”. Moselle and Polak (2001) argued that poverty may result in statelessness rather than vice versa, when “predatory states” emerge from organized banditry. Skaperdas (2001) stated that organized crime can emerge in the absence of State power. Grossman (2002) showed that having a “king”, who can enforce a collective choice to allocate resources thereby securing the product for the producers, may be better for both producers and potential predators compared to not having a king. To link these three strands of literature, we introduce a comparative analysis of efficiency level in various political frameworks, by means of three tales and one letter: the “production tale”, following Hume (1740), the “defence tale”, which comes from our interpretation of the contribution about agencies made by Nozick (1974), the “Leviathan tale” as narrated by Hobbes (1651), and the letter written by Vilfredo Pareto for Benjamin Tucker’s anarchist periodical Liberty (Pareto 1889). Our contribution is also related to the theoretical model of Baker and Bulte (2010) that presents the incentives motivating the defending population to agglomerate into larger groups to better defend against attacks, and the model of Konrad and Skaperdas (2012) that examine a theoretical setting in which protection can be provided by self-governing groups, even though self-governance faces long-term viability problems because welfare can be as low as, or even lower than, welfare in the absence of State. Compared with these papers, our model allows us to consider a single framework for both the issue of common defence and the problem of governance.Footnote 5 The model we use to represent the three tales and the letter describes a community of two agents (or two groups of agents), A and B, who live in a valley where corn production is purely the results of man’s labour. The harvest can be damaged by bad weather unless a protection against severe weather is installed. There are early and late season varieties of corn and the harvest is not simultaneous, but B’s corn ripens first. The valley is not naturally defended from marauders who are not part of the community and thus outsiders could steal part of the harvest if the agents do not defend the corn they cultivate. Hence, opportunism may arise in various forms inside the community, as we will demonstrate. In our model, bad weather and marauders could undermine the existence of the community and damage its members. A and B can cooperate to manage the problems arising because of bad weather and marauders: they can either defend the valley and protect the harvest from bad weather by themselves, through self-governance, or thanks to the coordination of an institution such as a State. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the production and the defence tales, and models the game between the two agents in absence of a State. Section 3 presents the Leviathan tale and Pareto letter, and studies the equilibria of the game in the presence of a bipartisan and a partisan State. Section 4 concludes the paper.",1

Asongu,Paul N. Acha-Anyi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The success and burgeoning economic prosperity of China over the past decades have led to growing debates in academic and policy-making circles over the relevance of the Washington Consensus (WC) in twenty-first-century development (Asongu et al. 2018).Footnote 1 Narratives have varied from, inter alia: lost decades with the WC (Fofack 2014); the Beijing Model (BM) more adapted to the twenty-first century (Nijs 2008; Huang 2010); development strategies based on a mixture of the WC and other successful development strategies (Fosu 2013a); preferences in economic versus political rights in a development approach (Moyo 2013); while institutions promote economic growth (Acemoglu et al. 2005, 2019), institutions could be more endogenous to economic prosperity in Africa (Anyanwu and Erhijakpor 2014); and scale of preference in rights between developing and developed countries in the era of globalization (Lalountas et al. 2011; Asongu 2014a). The debates have largely erupted because a strand of authors maintains that the poor performance of some developing countries is traceable to the WC (Fofack 2014, p. 6). The WC that is based on government failures includes policies of marketization, privatization and liberalization (inter alia), while the BM is based on government regulation and prudence in liberalization and privatization (Nijs 2008). Akomolafe (2008) has suggested that developing countries should stop looking at the West for instructions because China which is now prospering at breathtaking pace was in a similar economic stalemate as most African countries about 5 decades ago. However, while it opted to recourse to internal solutions to address its economic issues, Africa decided to follow prescriptions from the WC. The disappointment in development has led to growing distrust in Western policies, coupled with among others: colonialism, slavery, manipulations during the Cold war, corruption by companies from the West and neocolonialism (Robinson 2009). Moreover, the relevance of this study is also consolidated by the recent international financial crisis, the launching of the New Development Bank as well as the Belt and Road Initiative which are contributing toward rethinking and reshaping the global architecture of international cooperation and governance (Das 2008; Garnaut et al. 2009; Huang 2016). China has responded to the above growing frustrations by carefully tailoring its foreign policy to reflect opposite feelings. China’s unconditional and non-interference approach is igniting a lot of interest in the tendencies of Sino-African relations (Taylor 2006; Asche and Schüller 2008; Besada et al. 2008; Biggeri and Sanfilippo 2009; Ortmann 2012). Moreover, the Chinese model has some elements that are consistent with the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (Asongu et al. 2018). The present study complements the existing literature by putting some structure on views and agenda for an African development consensus. It presents the existing African consensus or New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) in light of growing narratives; discusses the Washington Consensus and Beijing Model as development models; and presents arguments and schools of thought. The resulting agenda consists of: establishing complementarities based on recent narratives in the literature; reconciling schools of thoughts; and reflecting the Moyo (2013) conjecture on underlying assumptions from Piketty (2014) and Kuznets (1955). This main agenda centers on tailoring an African consensus from the underlying narratives, inter alia, the: WC, BM, Moyo conjecture, NEPAD, schools of thought and emerging development paradigms such as the New Structural Economics and Liberal Institutional Pluralism. While the New Structural Economics has recognized both State and market failures but failed to provide a unified theory, the Liberal Institutional Pluralism has left the challenging concern of how institutional diversity matter in the development process. These post-Washington Consensus schools are relevant to the positioning of the study because they articulate a contemporary era of multipolar development models. How the attempt to reconcile the schools of thought and paradigms improves the knowledge about Africa’s development is provided in Sect. 3. Reconciling the two dominant models of development (i.e., the WC and BM) remains a critical challenge in the literature. Hence, by presenting views of and challenges for their reconciliation, the study substantially departs from the extant Sino-African development literature which has largely focused on presenting policy syndromes, schools of thought and debunking the myths surrounding the nexus. Moreover, the literature on the asymmetric Sino-African relationship has been substantially documented (Alden 2006; Giovannetti and Sanfilippo 2009; Elu and Price 2010). This bulk of the literature has presented, among others: the short-term positive effects of the nexus (Duclos 2011); decisions of investments that are based on resource motivations and poor governance (Renard 2011; Kolstad and Wiig 2011; De Grauwe et al. 2012); the need for multipolar development strategies (Tull 2006); push and pull factors motivating Chinese investments (Biggeri and Sanfilippo 2009); hard political views of the nexus (Taylor 2007); identification and explanation of the West’s evolving suspicion of the nexus (Huliaras and Magliveras 2008); debunking myths surrounding the nexus (Asongu and Aminkeng 2013); and suggesting strategies and solutions to the documented policy syndromes (Asongu and Ssozi 2016). In light of the above, this study is a response to the need for building complementarities between the WC and the BM. This is essentially because the WC prescriptions to African countries during the past 30 years have largely not delivered on the promises (Bartels et al. 2009; Tuomi 2011; Asongu 2012; Darley 2012). Hence, it is politically correct for China to use this frustration as an instrument in its foreign policy. The present study which focuses on the complementarity between the WC and BM also departs from documented African-oriented development models. These include: the Africa’s Priority for Economic Recovery (APPER 1986–1990); the Lagos Plan of Action for Economic Development (LPA 1980–2000); the African Charter for Popular Participation for Development (1990); the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programme for Socioeconomic Recovery and Transformation (AAF-SAP 1989); the 2001 NEPAD (OAU 1980, 2001; Adedeji 1999; Bujra 2004); more self-reliance by African countries for better development (Fofack 2014); and a stream of studies on development strategies covered by Fosu (2013a). In the light of the above, this study contributes to the extant literature in the following ways: definition of the WC and the BM; reconciliation of dominant development models in the short term and long term; and postulation of a unified theory of economic development. The paper postulates a unified theory that reconciles the WC and the BM and also presents a case for economic rights and political rights as short-run and long-run development priorities, respectively.Footnote 2 The rest of the study is presented as follows. The views are presented in Sect. 2. Section 3 discusses the resulting agenda, while Sect. 4 concludes.",6

The main plank of criticism against the AE and RE approaches is that rather than examining the influence of expectations on individual behavior, these approaches examine the influence of determinants of expectations formation behavior, taking expectations as given (see Gertchev 2007, for an elaborate exposition of this viewpoint). As regard the cobweb model, it has been criticized, as already mentioned, mainly for its naïve price expectation-formation approach obvious implications of which are price risk and volatility. It is true that in a given situation, all individuals may not entertain similar price expectations, and price expectations may not be realized always. While forming expectations, some may even assess expectations of other individuals, as observed by Alexander (2011, p. 3). This is all possible. Whatever the academic merit of the debate on relevance of cobweb price expectations for decisions making in the agricultural sector, it is not unusual to notice their influence on farmers as suggested by Ramaswami et al. (2003) and Singh et al. (2004) and various other studies.Footnote 2 Notably, much of the context in which the cobweb theory was conceived has changed today. Emergence and growth of futures trading in agricultural commodities has opened a way of price risk management for the producers. Even as they act on their previous price experience, they have before them futures market as an additional marketing channel to rely upon should they be apprehensive of realizing their price expectations. Besides price risk, there is another important aspect of futures market, namely its role in relation to price stability which is a controversial government policy-related issue especially in predominantly agricultural economies like India. A lot of empirical research and intensive debate is underway in India and elsewhere relating to various aspects of futures market—risk management, price stability and price discovery. Whether futures markets mitigate or accentuate price instability is an intensely debatable issue among academia and policy makers. The debate assumes renewed interest and urgency during periods of price variations that are large and unanticipated and lead to sub-optimal decisions. The arguments attributing the blame for the unexpected steep price rise, particularly in the agricultural food commodities, to the futures market are often somewhat out of context and ill-conceived. In fact, there are so many factors that may be responsible for the problem—institutional financial investors, market manipulators, faulty government policies, inefficient regulatory system and, to some extent, vagaries of nature. In a country like India, it is often the experience that sometimes the havoc created by nature, in terms of excessive rains (floods), or acute drought conditions, includes a vast area extending over, at one time, the northern states (producing agricultural commodities like wheat, sugarcane or vegetables which are widely used in rest of the country, as well), and at some other time the southern states (producing coconut, tea, coffee, black pepper, etc., which find huge demand in the north, as well). These regional concentrations of major crops create shortages and price volatility in the wake of nature’s outrage. In that case, insurance business may continue to be viable, producers may partly be compensated (crop insurance/financial relief from the government), and traders (hoarders) may have an opportunity to flourish even, but ultimately, only the gullible consumers remain exposed to the nature’s ‘unkind cut’! Evidence on the relationship between futures trading and price volatility is mixed. Some studies have come forward with evidence to show that futures market accentuates price volatility. It has been argued that the huge amount of money invested in commodity futures by financial investors and speculators is responsible for the problem. To mention a few of the studies in this regard, we have, for instance, Sahi (2007), IIMB (2008), Nath and Lingareddy (2008), and Gilbert (2010). Kedarnath (2011) observes that prices have gone up sharply after the introduction of commodity futures contracts in India. Despite this, the study emphasizes the need to strengthen these markets rather than curbing the same. On the other side, there are analysts, for instance, Morgan (1999), Paul (2008), Singh (2000), Nitesh (2005), Murphy (2008), Sahoo and Kumar (2009), Dasgupta (2004) and Sanders and Irwin (2010), who do not see futures market responsible for the problems which the critiques attribute to them. The thrust of their arguments is that the allegation that futures market promotes price volatility distorts spot market price and creates artificial scarcity by allowing unnecessary hoarding is a misconception. From among several studies subscribing to this position, we may mention Morgan (1999), Paul (2008), Singh (2000), Nitesh (2005), Murphy (2008), Sahoo and Kumar (2009), Dasgupta (2004), Sanders and Irwin (2010) and Sahadevan (2012). There is a section of analysts which believes that the evidence, available on either side, is not conclusive. Abhijit Sen Committee (2008) set up by the Government of India to examine the impact of futures trading on food inflation concludes that the cause and effect relationship between futures and spot prices cannot be established conclusively, and this is still debatable. It is argued that there are so many unsettled issues which necessitate more research on the nature and causes of the problem from a wider perspective. In particular, the emphasis should be on removal of aberrations in futures markets. The need for, and the nature and scale of, regulatory intervention in these markets deserve to be duly recognized for necessary action as mentioned in Kolamkar Committee Report (2014). Strengthening the existing legal and institutional framework and creating a powerful independent regulatory authority are essential for effective regulation of commodity futures markets and their healthy growth. Ashok et al. (2017), Robles and Cooke (2009) and Irwin et al. (2009) and some other authors share this viewpoint. Taking an overview of the debate, it may be concluded that evidence on the relationship between futures trading and price volatility is mixed and inconclusive. There should be an effective legal and regulatory mechanism to curb aberrations and mal practices in futures markets. Those who advocate their outright abolition may well be reminded of the popular proverbial ‘Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.’ The present paper is an attempt to examine how the initial cobweb price implications (price stability vis-à-vis price volatility) would change with the presence of futures market included in the ‘cobweb’ scheme of analysis. If in the current cropping year price is observed to be ‘high,’ farmers may be expected to adjust their production and allocation decisions (for the next period) in terms of how much to produce and how to allocate the planned output as between post-harvest spot market and futures market, applying their judgment appropriately to ‘discount some of the increase,’ as conceptualized by Nerlove (1958, p. 231). This agricultural commodity marketing scenario justifies the need to revisit the cobweb model and resuscitate it by considering agricultural commodity market and the futures market as alternative marketing channels. An overview of the research in this area shows that studies have been conducted considerably to consider the behavior of agricultural prices and risk within the broad cobweb context. Peck (1976), Boussard (1996), Wieland and Westerhoff (2004), Diseci and Westerhoff (2009) and Mitra and Boussard (2008, 2011) are noticeable works in this regard. More recently, Xie and Wang (2017) has used the cobweb theory to explore the influence of agricultural price fluctuations on grain production in China. The need to explicitly integrate futures market in the cobweb-oriented analysis remains still to be adequately addressed by researchers in this field. The present paper is an attempt in this direction. Besides the linear perceptions of demand and supply functions, two basic features of the initial cobweb model, namely lagged supply function and the absence of inventories, have been retained in this paper. Additionally, following assumptions have been made. One, futures contracts are transacted over the early part of the crop-year when hedging interest tends to be net short. Two, over this part of the year the spot price is equal to the price observed in the commodity market at the end of the previous crop-year. Lastly, hedgers and speculators are assumed to form their price expectations in the light of price experience at the end of previous crop-year (hereafter the terms, ‘crop-year’ and ‘period,’ are employed interchangeably). The inclusion of futures market in the cobweb reformulation produces significant results. One, it is found to generate only convergent time path of price despite the commodity demand–supply slope ratio assuming more than unity value over a reasonable range. Two, the speed of convergence is positively related to the hedging propensities of producers and buyers and the price responsiveness of speculators. Lastly, contrary to the usual belief, the futures market benefits both farmers and consumers in terms of average unit price which they receive or pay as a result of their transactions in futures market and commodity market (post-harvest). Significantly, this ‘price’ is found to be largely stable, overtime. Structurally, the paper is organized under four sections. Section 2 includes determinants of the behavior of hedgers and speculators. The emphasis is on examining how market perceptions of hedgers (that is commodity producers or farmers, on the demand side, and commodity consumers and users such as millers, grocers, etc., on the demand side) and speculators influence the demand and supply conditions in the futures market, hence, the equilibrium strike price. The decisions of hedgers about the proportion of the planned demand and supply quantities (of the commodity) which they would want to transact in the futures market and the post-harvest may be expected to be based on the strike price, given their hedging propensities and commodity market price expectations. Accordingly, analysis of determination of equilibrium strike price (futures market) and equilibrium commodity price (post-harvest market) are included in the subsequent two chapters—strike price in Sect. 3, and commodity price in Sect. 4. Given the basic theoretical approach to the behavior of hedgers and speculators, and the equilibrium conditions (for the two markets), it becomes interesting to examine implications of the reformulated cobweb model in relation to price stability and price interests of producers and consumers. This is the subject of enquiry in Sect. 5. Conclusions are specified at the end.",

67,2,International Review of Economics,27 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00337-6,Do social networks promote homeownership?,June 2020,Jeffry Jacob,Abdul Munasib,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We test if the size of one’s social networks has any measurable impact on one’s housing tenure decision. Since the homeownership decision is frequently associated with a change of location, researchers have often emphasized the importance of modeling tenure choice and mobility decisions jointly. Several empirical studies have established that tenure choice and mobility decisions are correlated (Boehm 1981; Ioannides and Kan 1996; Ioannides 1987; Kan 2000; Özyildirim et al. 2005; Zorn 1988). The agent-based dynamic models of tenure choice pose mobility and tenure decisions as joint decisions (Ioannides and Kan 1996; Özyildirim et al. 2005).Footnote 1 Social networks in large part are tied to the physical location, and the mobility decision and the level of social networks are intricately related (Glaeser et al. 2002; Durlauf and Fafchamps 2004; Munasib 2005). On the one hand, since social networks are valued by the individual (Dasgupta 2003; Munasib 2005) and mobility depreciates social networks, high levels of local social networks, therefore, create greater transaction costs of relocation and, thereby, a disincentive to move. On the other hand, social networks may encourage homeownership which is frequently associated with relocation. While in some cases there may be a tension, in other cases households may even decide to buy a home and settle down in their current location because of their local social networks. Therefore, estimating the effect of social networks on the joint mobility–tenure choice decisions is likely to be more meaningful. We use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 1997–2000 (Strauss et al. 2004)—a large-scale survey of Indonesian households—and estimate the effects of local social networks on the housing tenure decision. We look at it from two angels: First, we estimate the effect of social networks on the current homeownership status (the ‘contemporaneous’ model), and then, we estimate the effect of social networks on tenure transition between the two observed periods (the ‘transition’ model), the latter being more informative. In both cases, we treat tenure choice and mobility as a joint decision process. The estimation of the effect of social network on the joint tenure–mobility decision, however, is complicated by the fact that social network can be endogenous. First, there is the possibility of individual unobserved heterogeneity—the traits that are associated with greater socializing behavior may also be systematically associated with the likelihood of moving and the likelihood of owning a home. Second, since homeowners are invested in the location of their homes, they are likely to have higher levels of social networks compared to non-owners (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1999).Footnote 2 This could be more important in the contemporaneous model. And finally, households expecting to move have a lower incentive to invest in building up local social networks; this is more of a concern in the ‘transition’ model. To account for this potential endogeneity bias, we devise instrumental variables that would explain social networking behavior at the individual level. We use variation in different levels of geographical disaggregation that, we assume, affect household’s social networks and its tenure choice differently. In particular, we assume that the geographical unit that is more relevant for the tenure decision is village, whereas social network is more affected by the individual’s social position at the district level (see Sect. 4.2 for more details). We appeal to the recent literature on economics of identity and construct a measure of social distance, which we use to instrument the social network measures (see Sect. 4.2 for a description of the instruments). We use a two-stage estimation procedure. Another contribution of this study is the use of extensive social network measures. First, we use participation in local groups as a proxy for local social networks. The popular measure ‘number of associational memberships’—the so-called ‘Putnam’s Instrument’ popularized by Robert Putnam (Putnam 1995)—has a special place in the social capital literature. It is arguably the most commonly used proxy for social capital.Footnote 3 However, simply using the total number of memberships for each individual is not likely to produce an adequate measure of social networks for the household. We take the following steps to arrive at more refined measures. First, we focus only on the memberships that actually proxies for local social networks. We include only those organizations that are tied to the physical location.Footnote 4 This is particularly important in the context of tenure–mobility decisions. Second, since our unit of account is the household, we use the number of unique group memberships. We assume that once a household member participates in a group, the entire household has access to that group’s networks. Thus, a household whose members participate in several different groups will have more social networks than a household where all members belong to the same group. And finally, there is the question of intensity.Footnote 5 To account for intensity of participation, we include two more measures: the amount of time spent in these organizations and cash contribution to these organizations. (Note that both are intensity measures with real trade-offs.) We also construct an index—a multilevel index of social engagement—that combines the three above-mentioned measures (see Sect. 4 for details). Overall, the results indicate that social networks (SN) increase the chance that a household will continue to be a homeowner in both periods and also choose to not move to a different community. Among various SN measures, the SN measure capturing group membership (SN01) has the strongest impact on continued homeownership. A one standard deviation increase in SN01 lowers the relative risk that a household will transition from ownership to non-ownership by 28%. Further, SN01 increases the odds that a household will transition from not owning to owning within the same community, rather than move to a different community.",1
67,2,International Review of Economics,05 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00338-5,"Christianity, democracy, and Maritain: a reading of a path of meetings and retreats",June 2020,Paulo Reis Mourao,Pedro Miranda,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most relevant European thinkers after World War II was Jacques Maritain. From the foundations of the United Nations to his work as one of the directing authors of Concilium Vatican II, Maritain demonstrated his influence throughout diverse scientific fields, namely economics and political science. The complex debate promoted by Jacques Maritain regarding the relevance of certain indispensable elements in democratic life—namely moral and spiritual preconditions—has launched a vast discussion that will be revisited in this paper. Starting with Maritain’s geniality, we will develop a review of the relevant literature toward a definition of three major vectors: (a) the relevance of structural socioeconomic conditions for the flourishment of democratic institutions; (b) the institutional role of faiths, idiosyncrasies, and beliefs in democratic dynamics; and (c) the possibility of analyzing and discussing democratic institutions without considering the explicit/implicit religious and moral beliefs of the citizens/electors. It is not novel that a “return of history” is being witnessed, with alternatives to the democratic regime being established [reinforced by the presumed performance and economic success achieved by autocratic regimes, as theorized by Kagan (2009)]. For others (see Simone 2015), “democracy has failed” (and, in particular, in the space of Eurasia, with regimes that defy the democratic regime like Russia, Iran, Turkmenistan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brunei, or the United Arab Emirates) with the emergence of “new despotisms” (Keane 2015, p. 49). Finally, political and electoral participation has not been satisfactory. The abstention, lack of democratic passion conveyed by citizens, and the distance between representatives and represented people have become non-negligible issues. Almost seventy years ago, Jacques Maritain wrote that (1952, p. 18) without “an [sic] heroic ideal of the liberation of human life,” civilization would not escape its complete destruction. Furthermore, in order to gain peace and not merely watch the end of war, an intellectual and moral reform was imposed. In the abyss of despair, a work of purification existed in which a heroic faith seemed impossible to the oppressor and his lackeys: “To have, not in formulas but in reality, the feeling and respect of the dignity of the people, requires a heroic inspiration and a heroic belief that strengthens and vivifies reason” (1952, p. 70). Furthermore, “a democracy fully resolved upon social justice and the changes which it demands, determined to put an end to the hegemony of money, animated and penetrated from all sides by an heroic spiritual flame, is not only in a position to rid Communism of its pretexts but has also the power to draw in its wake and restore to its own ideal the greatest number of those who were attracted to Communism” (1952, pp. 97–98). The question of the “ultimate foundations” of democracy was also present in the “political liberalism” revisions that writers like Rawls were keen to recognize—in particular, in “Justice as Fairness.” Moreover, the idea of democracy as a “state of mind” or a “way of life” with a set of requirements of a certain nobility of treatment among citizens also refers to T.S. Elliot’s notion of Christianity—not of a theocracy, but rather as a well-formed society shaped by this ideal: a society that was Christian in its behavior, choices, and options without needing the spiritual to take care of the storm. Thus, the relevance of the reflection centered on Maritain’s thought can be easily located. This is well expressed in recent publications about his work. For example, as Toledo Báezo (2015) mentioned in a critical review of Clement (2015), Maritain’s restlessness remains in today’s thinkers, including concerns about “true” or “false” democracies. This paper looks at one of his major works, “Christianity and Democracy,” which includes the genesis of the European debate emerging from World War II. It provides a detailed reflection on democracy, religion, Christianity, and society. Starting with Maritain and “Christianity and Democracy,” this paper will discuss how these two universes—Christianity and democracy—have lived in permanent tension and fickle distances. Section 2 outlines the role of Jacques Maritain in this debate, focusing on a critical reading of “Christianity and Democracy.” Section 3 reflects on the debate of these two post-Maritain universes, highlighting the moments when the Christian churches revealed themselves as either companions or proselytes to democratic systems or as critical prophets of democracy. Section 4 concludes the paper.",
67,2,International Review of Economics,06 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00339-4,Remittances and disaggregated energy consumption in Bangladesh,June 2020,Anupam Das,Adian McFarlane,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper expounds on the issues related to the relationship between remittance inflows and energy consumption; uses Bangladeshi data to conduct a set of statistical exercises based on the consumption of natural gas, electricity, petroleum, and coal over the 1980 to 2016 period; and discusses the policy implications of the findings. Over the past three decades, remittance inflows have been an important source of external financing for developing countries. International remittance inflows grew from a modest US$65 billion in 1990 to almost US$400 billion in 2016 (World Bank 2019). Bangladesh is one of the top ten remittance recipient countries (World Bank 2016). Since the early 1990s, remittance inflows have risen dramatically in Bangladesh. These inflows increased from US$0.78 billion (2.5% of GDP) in 1990 to US$13.6 billion (6.1% of GDP) in 2016. The magnitude of remittance inflows to Bangladesh is larger than that of its official development assistance and net earnings from exports (Paul et al. 2011). The right axis of Fig. 1 shows the trend in remittance inflows and the consumption of coal, electricity, natural gas, and petroleum (all in the natural logarithmic form) from 1980 to 2016. Remittance inflows and disaggregated energy consumption in Bangladesh. Notes: (1) Data sources are World Bank (2019) and U.S. Energy Information Administration (2019). (2) Coal is in short tons, electricity in kilowatt per hour, petroleum in thousands of barrels per day, and natural gas in billons per cubic feet Along with the sharp increase in remittance inflows, Bangladesh has experienced a concomitant rise in income and energy consumption. In 1990, GDP per capita in Bangladesh was less than US$400. By 2017, it rose to over US$1000 per day, which placed Bangladesh in the lower-middle income group (World Bank 2019). At the same time, per capita energy use in Bangladesh has climbed from 120 kg of oil equivalent (koe) in 1990 to 222.22 koe in 2014 (World Bank 2019). As shown in Fig. 1, over the last four decades, there has been a steady increase in the consumption of different types of energy. Existing studies have mainly focused on the statistical relationship between various types of energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions. A relatively unexplored area in the literature is an examination of the relationship between remittance inflows and different types of energy consumption. One exception is Akçay and Demirtaş (2015). They found that remittance inflows directly increased the demand for energy by augmenting disposable income of households in Morocco in the short-run and long-run. Additionally, the authors posited that remittance inflows can spur capital accumulation that would in turn increase the demand for energy to sustain the associated rise in economic activity. Given the existing literature, our paper contributes to it by examining the causal relations between remittance inflows and the consumption of natural gas, electricity, petroleum, and coal in Bangladesh. This paper is the first explicit analysis of the relationship between these variables in general, and for Bangladesh in particular. We determine the nature of the  causal relationship between remittances and the consumption of natural gas, electricity, petroleum, and coal. We use the autoregressive distributed (ARDL) lag bounds testing approach to cointegration and vector autoregression (VAR) lag augmented Granger causality testing. The main results are threefold. First, there are bidirectional long-run equilibrium cointegrating relationships between remittances and electricity and between remittances and natural gas. Second, a one-way long-run cointegrating relationship runs from coal consumption to remittances. Third, there is no long-run cointegrating relationship between remittances and petroleum, but a short-run Granger causality running from petroleum consumption to remittances exist. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the existing literature. Section 3 discusses the data and methods. Section 4 presents the econometric results. The final section concludes and provides the policy implications of the findings.",9
67,3,International Review of Economics,11 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-020-00345-x,Strategic trade policy with socially concerned firms,September 2020,Luciano Fanti,Domenico Buccella,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A long-lasting and influential tenet in the theory of strategic trade policy is that the use of export subsidies allows to shift more of the oligopolistic profits towards one’s own country. This belief dates back to the pioneering contributions of Brander and Spencer (e.g. 1984a, b, 1985) and is standard in current international trade’s textbooks. Among the several surveys of this literature, we mention Grossman and Richardson (1985), Krugman (1986), Dixit (1987), Helpman and Krugman (1989) and Brander (1995). The essential features of the Brander and Spencer’s models can be resumed as follows. There is an industry with one firm in each of two countries which compete on quantities (Cournot) in a third market. In such an industry, each firm would aim to convince the rival that it is producing a larger quantity, forcing the latter to reduce its production; in other words, it would act as the Stackelberg leader to raise its profit at the expense of the rival. However, to be really convincing, one firm should be able to commit itself to the threatened larger production. A government’s export subsidy policy provides the “commitment” that the national firm exports more in the third market. In essence, a subsidy policy secures the profit shift in favour of the national firm, and if this shift more than counterbalances the cost of subsidy, then the subsidy policy improves the national welfare.Footnote 1 On the other hand, the government’s commitment to the policy instruments cannot always be taken for granted. In other words, if the government lacks that commitment, the timing of the game will be different so firms will move first anticipating (eliciting) the government reaction in the form of tax or subsidy, as in the pioneering work of Carmichael (1987) (see also Leahy and Neary 1997; Neary and Leahy 2000; Baghdasaryan and Žigić 2010; and the review paper by Žigić 2011). The subsidy policy, however, presents the drawback that it lowers the total profits, in the sense that the aggressive behaviour produces a gain for the aggressor lower than the loss inflicted to the aggrieved, inducing a unilateral incentive to be aggressive. In terms of a game-theoretic approach, it means that when the governments of the exporting countries are interventionist in subsidising exports to third countries, a Prisoners’ Dilemma emerges, and both lose. By contrast, it is known by Eaton and Grossman (1986) that with price competition, both countries can gain when one of them follows the strategic policy of taxing exports in order to restrain the production and thus to maintain high prices.Footnote 2 In any case, an important element of the strategic trade policy identifies the types and characteristics of industries to be targeted with the subsidy policy instrument, because the “identification of these characteristics is a preliminary step toward translating theory into practical policy proposals” (Spencer 1986, 70–71). While the pioneering academic literature on the strategic trade policy dates back to the 1980s, in recent years, it has known a renewed interest, also in the light of the resurgence of the rhetoric and debate on the new governments’ interventionism by the main actors in international trade to mitigate the effects of globalisation on national economies (see, for example, Scott and Glass 2016). Recent contributions have analysed how (1) the presence of cross-ownership (Fanti and Buccella 2016a); (2) different bargaining agendas in unionised labour markets (Bandyopadhyay and Bandyopadhyay 1998, 1999, 2001; Bandyopadhyay et al. 2000; Fanti and Buccella 2016b); and (3) the presence of managerial delegation (Fanti and Buccella 2017a) affect the strategic trade policy. However, in recent years, industries with new characteristics such as the presence of socially concerned firms appeared in various countries. In this work, we precisely focus on the firms’ adoption of corporate social responsibility (hereafter, CSR) rules. Since the pioneering “paper is built around what seems to us an important part of the modern international environment” according to the words of Brander and Spencer (1984b, 19), we believe that the extension of their framework to another important part of the modern international environment which is currently represented by firms’ CSR behaviours is worthwhile and in the spirit of the original literature. Indeed, Campbell et al. (2012) argued that “little research has been done on the motivations, either strategic or altruistic, behind CSR by Multinational Enterprises in host countries”. According to KPMG, the adoption of CSR behaviours is a prevailing worldwide business practice. In fact, 73 per cent of the top 100 companies surveyed in 45 countries in 2015 have reported the completion of CSR activities, with an increase of 9 percentage points with respect to 2011, when 64 per cent of the companies surveyed issued CRS reports. In addition, 92 per cent of the world’s 250 largest companies indexed in the 250 Global Fortune Index have performed CSR actions, among them widely recognised giant exporters such as Volkswagen Group, Samsung Electronics, Apple, GM, BMW, Ford, Nestlé, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, CocaCola (KPMG 2011, 2015; Fortune 2015). As a consequence, it is interesting to investigate whether CSR is a valid characteristic for targeting with subsidy policies an industry. In particular, we question whether the firms’ social responsibility has relevant effects on the social welfare outcomes of the strategic trade policy above discussed. This assumes particular relevance because the firms’ social responsibility is commonly perceived as a factor of welfare improvement, at least for the countries in which consumers are located. In the present context, we consider the so-called consumers’ friendly CSR which measures the firm’s (and, therefore, supply-side) social interests through the inclusion of the consumer surplus in the firm’s objective function to be maximised. The rationale for the adoption of this approach is because “consumers (beside shareholders) emerge as the most important stakeholder group when it comes to having an impact on a firm’s approach to sustainability” (Kopel 2015).Footnote 3 The research on CSR firms has been mainly carried out on the aspects of private provision of public goods and private elimination of a public bad (Bagnoli and Watts 2003; Kotchen 2006; Besley and Ghatak 2007), and the motives that lead companies to be socially responsible (Baron 2001, 2009; Porter and Kramer 2006; Benabou and Tirole 2010; Lambertini and Tampieri 2012, 2015; Kopel and Brand 2012). In an appropriate game-theoretic context, Fanti and Buccella (2017b) have analysed the firms’ strategic decision of adopting CSR behaviours; however, those authors consider only firms that operate in a domestic market context, while they abstract from issues related to international trade in the presence of governments’ strategic policies. In an international trade context, Wang et al. (2012), Chang et al. (2014) and Chao et al. (2016) studied the impact of the domestic firm and foreign exporter’s CSR behaviours on the government’s optimal tariff application in an import competing model. However, none of them deals with the issue of the export tax/subsidy policy within the Brander and Spencer’s frame, developed when the adoption of firms’ CSR behaviours was not a widespread phenomenon as nowadays. This paper contributes to the literature on CSR by investigating the so far unexplored interconnections with strategic trade policy. It revisits the cornerstone model of the strategic trade policy literature at the light of the increasing diffusion of social interests by firms. To analyse the impact of the firms’ social responsibility on social welfare and the interactions with the strategic trade policy, we propose a three-stage game characterised by the following timing. In the pre-play stage, governments choose whether to implement the trade policy. In the first stage, the exporting countries’ governments set the optimal subsidy (tax) to maximise their own welfare, given by the exporter firm’s profits minus (plus) the subsidy spending (tax revenue). Finally, in the second stage, the firms simultaneously and independently choose their output: that is, we assume that firms choose production levels following their respective governments’ commitment to trade policy decisions. We apply the backward induction method because the solution concept adopted is the Sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). The main results of the paper are as follows. First, while the received literature on CSR firms (at least in the basic Cournot model) mainly considers that consumers and social welfares (resp. profits) are always increasing (resp. decreasing) in the weight of the social concern assigned by the firm in its objective function, we show that the interaction of the firms’ social concerns with the strategic trade policy produces “mixed” rather than univocal results on the social welfare and its components. Second, given that the objectives of the firm and the government are no longer aligned because the exporting firm now cares also about consumers in the third country, it may happen that the firm produces more than a Stackelberg leader. Therefore, we show that the presence of socially concerned firms, on one hand, alters the selection of the policy instrument (which may be shifted from a subsidy to a tax when firms’ social concerns are sufficiently intense to discourage excessive, profit-reducing production) and, on the other hand, generates a rich variety of SPNE equilibria as well as their efficiency properties. In particular, with regard to the emergence of endogenous equilibria, we show that a shift from the interventionist regime in both countries (as in the traditional model) to an asymmetric SPNE (in which the prisoners’ dilemma situation does not materialise anymore) can be generated by adequately high firms’ social concerns. The rationale for this result is as follows: if one country taxes its champion, it reduces also aggregate output such that the other country will benefit and decide not to pursue any strategic trade policy. More interestingly, this asymmetric equilibrium always Pareto dominates the free-trade regime. Moreover, in order to check the robustness of the results above mentioned, we have endogenized the choice of the “optimal” CSR parameter by firms. In such a case, numerical simulations have shown that it is welfare-preferred to intervene with a small export tax. Under the endogenous CSR parameter’s choice, we have also investigated the case in which the government lacks the commitment to the policy instruments, showing that in the game between governments, the results of the basic framework (two asymmetric equilibria in which the intervening government taxes export) are confirmed, but firms do not find profitable to engage in CSR (or, even, they find profitable to engage in the so-called CS Irresponsible activities). It is worth noting that the game-theoretic approach proposed in this paper is the fundamental methodology for revealing the not straightforward effects of the interconnections between CSR in an industry and the strategic trade policy, because the “application of basic game theory is a feature of strategic trade policy that distinguishes it from much of the previous work in international economics” (Spencer and Brander 2008). The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 develops the model of strategic trade policy in the presence of CSR firms. Section 3 studies the governments’ policy selection and derives the game equilibria. Section 4 discusses the welfare implications. Section 5 briefly discusses some extensions of the basic model. Finally, Sect. 6 closes the paper with an outline for future research.",4
67,3,International Review of Economics,06 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-019-00340-x,"The relationship between public capital stock, private capital stock and economic growth in the Latin American and Caribbean countries",September 2020,Renato Santiago,Matheus Koengkan,António Cardoso Marques,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"One of the primary goals of governments around the world is to ensure that their countries achieve a sustainable economic growth path. In this sense, many studies have been produced to understand the effects of a vast number of variables on growth. The purpose of these studies is essentially to help policymakers in developing appropriate growth strategies. Within the extensive literature on this field, we found a large number of relationships which should be intensely studied. One example is the relationship between public investment and economic growth. Although the vast majority of economists agree on the vision that public capital stock has a positive effect on a country’s economic output, some scholars are more sceptical regarding this positive effect. There is no doubt that public capital stock is essential to a country’s economic activity: it increases the aggregate output, enhances the economy’s physical and financial resources, reduces private sector costs (Erden and Holcombe 2006), contributes to the advancement and maintenance of human capital (Ramirez and Nazmi 2003) and contributes to higher long-run growth and an increase in the aggregate demand in the short run (Barbiero and Darvas 2014; Group of Twenty 2014), for example. However, even though countries need roads, airports, schools and hospitals (among others) to grant a sound and sustainable economic performance, there are some factors which may lead public investment to have a biased effect on the economy. For public investment to obtain good results (i.e. raise a country’s output level), economists should take into account the degree of economic slack and monetary accommodation of the countries, their investment efficiency (public investment management) and how they will finance the public investment (IMF 2014). The most apprehensive views point to the distorting effects that higher taxes, associated with public investment financing, can have on growth as a reason for governments to be more cautious with their expenditures (Fisher and Turnovsky 1998). Also, regarding this matter, it is important to cite the work of Liaqat (2019), who uses panel vector autoregression (PVAR) to analyse the relationship between public debt and capital formation, finding evidences of a crowding-out effect of debt on investment. (This effect is lower in high-income countries.) This outcome once again shows the importance that the means that the governments use to finance public investment have in countries’ general macroeconomic stability. Finally, some authors stress the small macroeconomic multiplier of public investment as another reason to not increase public investment (Perotti 2004). Moreover, the effect of public capital on growth can also depend on the relationship between public and private capital, given that if they act as substitutes (instead of complements) and compete with each other, it can generate a “crowd-out” effect on investment in the private sector (Erden and Holcombe 2006). Additionally, if we look at the law of diminishing returns, the effects of the increase in public investment on economic growth can also depend on the existing capital stock: “an increment to the public capital stock would have a small (large) output effect if the capital stock in the previous period was large (small)” (Romp and De Haan 2007; p. 9). Following the IMF (2014) report “Is It Time for an Infrastructure Push? The Macroeconomic Effects of Public Investment”, in the last 30 years, public capital stock as a share of output has declined significantly worldwide, with infrastructure levels of developing countries being shown to still be far from the levels of the countries considered as advanced. Although, as these countries develop, their necessity for public investment increases and, despite the possible positive effects that public investment would have on their growth, their high public debt and lack of investment efficiency make it advisable to weigh several factors before advancing with public investment programmes. The pressure surrounding public investment strategies in developing countries have increased with a substantial number of failed projects in the past (Gupta et al. 2014). Given this last statement, researching the effects of public capital stock on the economic growth of countries such as those in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region becomes increasingly important. Results from empirical studies can shed some light on the macroeconomic effects of public investment in these countries and help policymakers in developing countries to draw up growth-promoting strategies. More importantly, they can help to ensure that past mistakes will not be repeated. With respect to the sample of this study, we can start by saying that after the debt crisis of the 1980s, LAC countries suffered from an intense depression which negatively affected various economic aspects of the region. One of these aspects was public investment, which was increasingly reduced, as was all public expenditure, according to the drastic economic adjustment and stabilisation programmes implemented in the region to overcome the crisis effects. The results from Ramirez and Nazmi (2003), who analysed nine Latin American (LA) nations in the period 1983–1993, are evident: both public and private capital contribute to economic growth, and the excessive reduction in both private and public investment are detrimental to economic growth. This can indicate that maybe the chosen plan (a cut in government expenditure) was not the most appropriate and that maybe these countries should have improved some other factors, as investment efficiency, instead of reducing their investment levels. More recently, according to the report “Regional Economic Outlook, April 2016, Western Hemisphere Department: Managing Transitions and Risks” (Faruqee 2016), LAC competitiveness is compromised by the state of the regional infrastructure. This report seems to imply that the region needs to continue to progress in this field, or else run a risk of the infrastructure shortfalls gradually hampering the region’s growth. For the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the region should improve public investment management processes and practices and put some effort into maintaining existing infrastructures. The report also claims that both fiscal policy and fiscal institutions should play a serious role in this progress. Moreover, there are some additional studies related to the specific topic of the LAC infrastructure gap, which should also be mentioned. Examples of these studies are those by Castellani et al. (2019), Ruiz-Nuñez and Wei (2015), and Fay (2000). The general idea behind the results of these studies is that there is a lack of public investment in the LAC region and that, in order to close its identified infrastructure gap, some additional effort should be made by their governments, i.e. they should increase their spending in order to solve this problem. In some situations, the strategy can start with the improvement in existing infrastructures, rather than start investing in new infrastructure. However, this situation will need to be accompanied by these governments to develop sustainable financing methods and strategies. Despite the idea that more significant public investment is needed to overcome this gap, further research is required to realise what the cost and benefit of public investment are if LAC countries desire to overcome this gap and whether the increase in public investment will benefit the long-term and short-term growth of this region; alternatively will it crowd-out private investment and, thus, hurt these economies? In this sense, this study will try to answer these questions empirically in order to be able to help LAC governments develop their public investment policies. Given the advance in the econometric techniques and the release of the “Investment and Capital Stock Dataset” by the IMF (2017), we believe that the study can and should be expanded on the effects of the public capital stock (and of capital stock in general) on the economic output of the LAC region. The central question of this study is then: what are the effects of public capital stock and private capital stock on the economic growth of the LAC countries? Furthermore, we will also explore some of the links between these three variables, thus being able to answer the questions raised at the end of the eleventh paragraph of this introductory section. Finally, this study is organised as follows: Sect. 2 presents the literature review; Sect. 3 describes the data and methodology; Sect. 4 shows both the empirical results and their discussion; and Sect. 5 concludes.",17

67,3,International Review of Economics,05 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-020-00347-9,Endogenously choosing the timing of setting strategic contracts’ levels and content in a managerial mixed duopoly with welfare-based and sales delegation contracts,September 2020,Yasuhiko Nakamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper revisits the endogenous timing game, called the observable delay game, in the fashion of Hamilton and Slutsky (1990) in a managerial mixed duopoly. The managerial mixed duopoly is composed of one public firm with a welfare-maximizing owner and a manager employed by the welfare-based delegation à la Nakamura (2015, 2019c) and one private firm with a profit-maximizing owner and a manager employed by the sales delegation (the FJSV delegation) à la Fershtman and Judd (1987), Sklivas (1987), and Vickers (1985).Footnote 1 In a mixed oligopolistic industry in the real-world economy, public enterprises are common in several important sectors such as energy, steel, banking, telecommunications, and the postal service.Footnote 2 In this paper, similar to Nakamura (2015, 2019c), we refocus on the case in which the owner of a public firm provides his manager with a managerial contract equal to the weighted sum of welfare plus the difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus with respect to the welfare-based incentive parameter. Meanwhile, the owner of a private firm provides his manager with a managerial contract equal to the weighted sum of his profit and his sales revenue with regard to the FJSV incentive parameter.Footnote 3 This paper clarifies the relationship between the equilibrium market configurations and four market structures from the viewpoint of social welfare: (1) the socially preferable market structure (i.e., the market structure(s) under which social welfare is the highest), (2) the market structure(s) under which the private firm’s profit (which equals its owner’s payoff) is the highest, (3) the market structure(s) under which consumer surplus is the highest, and (4) the market structure(s) under which producer surplus is the highest. We examine a managerial mixed duopoly with the endogenous determination of the timing of setting the public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and with the welfare-based delegation and the FJSV delegation. In the context of an entrepreneurial mixed oligopoly in quantity competition with homogeneous goods, under which the owners of public and private firms decide their strategic contracts’ levels, Pal (1998), a seminal paper, using the observable delay game in the fashion of Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), explored the case of an equilibrium after both the public and the private firms endogenously choose the timing of setting their strategic contracts.Footnote 4 Likewise, Bárcena-Ruiz (2007) discussed an endogenous timing game similar to that in Pal (1998) in a differentiated goods, price-setting mixed duopoly with differentiated goods.Footnote 5 Matsumura and Ogawa (2014) considered the importance of the change in the (a)symmetry of the objective function between public and private firms by introducing the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR).Footnote 6 Furthermore, Barros (1995) and White (2001), as pioneering papers in the context of a homogeneous goods managerial mixed duopoly with the FJSV delegation, examined the impact of FJSV delegation contracts on market outcomes by taking into account the internal organizational structure in both public and private firms.Footnote 7 Moreover, Nakamura and Inoue (2007) analyzed whether the owners of public and private firms prefer to determine their quantities when the goods produced by both of them are differentiated, while Nakamura and Inoue (2009) considered the same analysis in the context of price competition with differentiated goods. Bárcena-Ruiz (2013) explored the determination under which the owners of public and private firms prefer when to provide their FJSV delegation to their respective managers in the context of price competition with differentiated goods using the observable delay game à la Hamilton and Slutsky (1990). Considering that firms in an oligopolistic market in the real-world economy decide whether to select not only their strategic contracts’ levels in the early or late periods, but also their strategic contracts’ content (their prices or quantities), the analyses in Sun (2013) first discussed the endogenous determination of the timing of setting each firm’s strategic contract’s level and content in an entrepreneurial private duopoly. Meanwhile, Din and Sun (2016) dealt with a similar problem in an entrepreneurial mixed duopoly comprising one welfare-maximizing public firm and one profit-maximizing private firm.Footnote 8 Subsequently, in a managerial private duopoly with the FJSV delegation, Nakamura (2018b) further extended the model in Sun (2013). More precisely, Nakamura (2018b) proposed a model in which the owners of two managerial private firms simultaneously announce the timing of setting their FJSV incentive parameters and strategic contracts’ content (their prices or quantities) in the observable delay game à la Hamilton and Slutsky (1990).Footnote 9 Then, Nakamura (2018b) showed that when the goods are substitutes, the equilibrium market structures are composed of quantity competition (with the simultaneous setting of the FJSV incentive parameters) and two types of asymmetric market structures with respect to strategic contracts (with the sequential setting of the FJSV incentive parameters). By contrast, when the goods are complements, the equilibrium market structures comprise two symmetric forms of competition in terms of the strategic contracts, namely, quantity and price competition (with the simultaneous setting of the FJSV incentive parameters). Furthermore, in the context of a managerial mixed duopoly with the FJSV delegation, Nakamura (2019a) and Nakamura (2019b) investigated the models of (1) and (2) in the full observable delay game à la Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), namely, (1) the timing of setting the FJSV incentive parameters/their strategic contracts’ content and (2) the timing of setting their strategic contracts’ levels and content as endogenously determined by their owners.Footnote 10 In a similar economic case to those in the above works, Nakamura (2019c) paid attention to how changes in the managerial delegation contracts employed in a public firm, namely, from its FJSV delegation contract to its welfare-based delegation à la Nakamura (2015), influence the equilibrium market structures and policy implications with respect to social welfare in the full observable game (in which the owners endogenously determine the timing of setting the public firm’s welfare-based incentive parameter and the private firm’s FJSV incentive parameter as well as their strategic contracts’ content).Footnote 11 Moreover, Nakamura (2019c) shed light on the following two equilibrium market structures: (1) the public firm’s owner (with his quantity contract) is the leader and the private firm’s owner (with his quantity contract) is the follower in determining the incentive parameters and (2) the public firm’s owner (with his quantity contract) is the follower and the private firm’s owner (with his price contract) is the leader in determining their incentive parameters. Furthermore, the highest form of social welfare is achieved in equilibrium market structure (1). This paper extends the approach of Nakamura (2019c) by shifting the decision-making of the public and private firms’ owners from the timing of setting their incentive parameters to the timing of setting their strategic contracts’ levels and content.Footnote 12 More concretely, this paper considers the full observable delay game with the pre-play stage in which owners endogenously announce the timing of setting their strategic contracts’ levels and content in a managerial mixed duopoly along with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations. Table 1 classifies existing work on the endogenous market structures in a managerial mixed duopoly based on the following two factors: (1) the type of managerial delegation contract employed within a public firm [the FJSV type or the type à la Nakamura (2015)] and (2) which of the incentive parameters and the strategic contracts the owners of a public firm and a private firm endogenously choose the timing of setting. In this paper, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, we first investigate the equilibrium market structures in the full observable delay game, according to which owners endogenously determine the timing of setting private and public firms’ strategic contracts’ levels when their strategic contracts’ content is fixed: (1) the q–q game in which the owners of the public and private firms have their quantity contracts, (2) the p–p game in which the owners of the public and private firms have their price contracts, (3) the p–q game in which the public firm’s owner has his price contract, while the private firm’s owner has his quantity contract, and (4) the q–p game in which the public firm’s owner has his quantity contract, while the private firm’s owner has his price contract. In an observable delay game in which the owners endogenously determine only the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels, we find that except for the p–p game in which the homogeneity of the goods produced by firms 0 and 1 is sufficiently high, at least one of the equilibrium market structures in each game can become the socially preferable market configuration (from the perspective of social welfare) in all four games. Thus, except for the p–p game (in which the homogeneity of the goods produced by both the public and the private firms is sufficiently high), in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, provided that their strategic contracts’ content is given, it is not necessary for the relevant authority (including the government) to regulate owners’ free determination of the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels based on their individual incentives (from the perspective of social welfare).Footnote 13 Second, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, we analyze the game in which owners only endogenously determine public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ content when the timing of setting the levels (of both firms) is fixed, namely, (1) the SSws case in which the public and private firms’ owners simultaneously determine their strategic contracts’ levels, (2) the LFws case in which the public firm’s owner is the leader, while the private firm’s owner is the follower (in determining their strategic contracts’ levels), and (3) the FLws case in which the public firm’s owner is the follower, while the private firm’s owner is the leader (in determining their strategic contracts’ levels). In the SSws case, as shown by Nakamura (2015, 2019c) as well as in this paper, no equilibrium market structure exists under the pure strategic contract. Furthermore, there is a unique mixed strategy equilibrium market arrangement, according to which the probability of the private firm’s owner choosing the quantity contract is higher than that of the public firm’s owner selecting it.Footnote 14 In the LFws case, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, it makes no difference for the private firm’s owner to choose between his price and quantity contracts provided that the public firm’s owner’s strategic contract is fixed. On the contrary, in the LFws case, it is optimal for the public firm’s owner to select his quantity contract irrespective of the private firm’s strategic contract for any degree of homogeneity of the goods produced by both the public and the private firms. As a result, the two market formations (i.e., the q–q game and the q–p game) can become the equilibrium market structures under the pure strategic contract class. Furthermore, in the LFws case, from the perspective of social welfare, both the q–q game and the q–p game can become the socially preferable market configurations from the standpoint of social welfare. Thus, in the LFws case, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, it is not necessary for the relevant authority (including the government) to regulate owners’ free determination of public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ content from the viewpoint of social welfare. By contrast, in the LFws case, neither the q–q game nor the q–p game (as equilibrium market formations) can become the market structure under which the private firm’s profit (which equals its owner’s payoff) is the highest among the three cases for any degree of homogeneity of the goods produced by both the public and the private firms. In the FLws case, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, it makes no difference whether firm 0’s owner chooses his quantity or price contract for any degree of homogeneity of the goods produced by both the public and the private firms when firm 1’s strategic contract is fixed. By contrast, the private firm’s owner uses a dominant strategy upon selecting his quantity contract when the public firm’s strategic contract is fixed. Consequently, in the FLws case, the q–q and p–q games can become equilibrium market structures. Both of them can become not only socially preferable market configurations, but also market formations under which firm 1’s profit (which equals its owner’s payoff) is the highest among the four cases for any degree of homogeneity of the goods produced by both the public and the private firms. Thus, in the FLws case, it is not necessary for the relevant authority (including the government) to prescribe a regulation to freely determine firm 0’s and firm 1’s owners’ strategic contracts based on their owners’ individual incentives from the perspective of both social welfare and protecting the private firm. Lastly, in the full observable delay game in which owners endogenously determine the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, the two types of market structures, namely, (1) \((q^{1}_{0}, p^{2}_{1})\) and (2) \((q^{2}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\), can become the equilibrium market formations for any degree of homogeneity between the goods produced by both the public and the private firms. In addition, in a managerial mixed duopoly (which entails the endogenous determination of the timing of setting the public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels as well as the welfare-based and FJSV delegations), the highest form of social welfare is achieved in (1) \((q^{2}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\), (2) \((p^{1}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\) and \((p^{2}_{0}, q^{2}_{1})\), and (3) \((p^{2}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\) among all 16 market structures. Hence, \((q^{2}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\) (as one of the two equilibrium market structures) can become not only the equilibrium market configuration, but also the socially preferable market arrangement from the perspective of social welfare. In the observable delay game (in which owners endogenously determine the timing of setting firm 0’s and firm 1’s strategic contracts’ levels and content), \((q^{2}_{0}, q^{1}_{1})\) (as one of the two equilibrium market structures) can become the socially preferable market arrangement. Thus, it is not as necessary for the relevant authority to prescribe a strong policy to regulate owners’ free determination of the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content based on their individual incentives from the standpoint of social welfare, which is provided by the government. Conducting similar analyses of the three cases with respect to the payoff of the private firm’s owner (which equals his profit as well as consumer and producer surpluses) in addition to the case with regard to social welfare, we confirm the need to regulate the timing of setting both the public and the private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content based on their respective incentives. As a result, the relevant authority must prescribe a strong policy to regulate owners’ free determination of the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content based on their individual incentives from the viewpoint of (1) the private firm’s profit, (2) consumer surplus, and (3) producer surplus. This is because the market structures under which the private firm’s owner’s payoff as well as consumer and producer surpluses is the highest cannot coincide with the equilibrium market structures for any degree of homogeneity between the goods they produce. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we formulate a differentiated goods mixed duopoly model in which owners endogenously determine the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content in a managerial mixed duopoly along with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations. In Sect. 3, we consider the game in which owners endogenously determine only the timing of setting the public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels. This game is subdivided into four games based on their strategic contracts’ content, namely, the q–q game, the p–p game, the p–q game, and the q–p game. Subsequently, in these four games, we derive the equilibrium market outcomes under the pure strategic contract class and compare them with the socially preferable market structures from the perspective of social welfare and the private firm’s owner’s payoff (which equals his profit as well as consumer surplus and producer surplus). In Sect. 4, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, we conduct similar analyses to those in Sect. 3 in the game in which owners endogenously determine only the timing of setting public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ content provided that the timing of setting their levels is fixed. In such a game, we derive the equilibrium market structures and compare them with the socially preferable market formations from the standpoint of social welfare and the private firm’s owner’s payoff (which equals his profit as well as consumer and producer surpluses).Footnote 15 In Sect. 5, in a managerial mixed duopoly with the welfare-based and FJSV delegations, we explore the full observable delay game in which owners endogenously determine the timing of setting the public and private firms’ strategic contracts’ levels and content. Section 6 concludes with several remarks. In “Appendix”, we present the market outcomes of the four games (except for the public firm’s welfare-based incentive parameter and the private firm’s FJSV incentive parameter as well as both firms’ payoffs). Furthermore, for the four cases (i.e., the q–q game, the p–p game, the p–q game, and the q–p game), we describe (1) the public and private firms’ equilibrium incentive parameters, (2) their owners’ equilibrium payoffs, and (3) the ranking order of the public and private firms’ payoffs and their intuition. We also provide concrete proof of Proposition 1, the main proposition.Footnote 16",

Odhiambo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Fiscal policy plays an important role in the management of economies in both developed and developing countries (Easterly and Rebelo 1993). Through taxation and budget execution, fiscal authorities are able to generate and appropriate the resources necessary for investment in both human capital and the provision of public goods that are complementary to private capital (Aschauer 1989). To successfully implement fiscal policy, therefore, governments must be able to raise enough revenue to meet the expenditure needs. In practice, however, governments are seldom able to run balanced budgets, usually resorting to deficit financing. Consequently, the debate on the determinants and consequences of budget deficits has received much attention in the existing literature. There is now a voluminous amount of literature on the causes and effects of fiscal deficits. However, the existing theoretical and empirical literature is inconclusive about the drivers of fiscal deficits. The Ricardian theory postulates that fiscal deficits are not determined by any macroeconomic factors nor do they precipitate any macroeconomic consequences in the long run (1989; Seater 1993). The Keynesian theory espouses a linkage between fiscal deficits and growth, whereby governments may expand expenditure during periods of recessions to stimulate productivity growth. In the Keynesian postulation, therefore, deficits can help to stimulate national income and consumption, savings, and capital formation, thus ameliorating conditions for economic growth (Barro 1990; Pelagidis and Desli 2004). The twin-deficit hypothesis advances the idea that budget deficits and current account deficits are related and that the former causes the latter. The twin-divergence hypothesis postulates that budget deficits arise out of current account deficits (Kim and Roubini 2008). The last strand of theoretical literature relates budget deficits to political motivations. Within this realm budget deficits may arise out of political conflicts of interest to win public support and elections (Roubini and Sachs 1989a, b); political polarization (Alesina and Tabellini, (1990a, b); and conflicting interests over public resources (Weingast et al. 1981; Baron and Ferejohn 1989). Within this literature, therefore, budget deficits tend to arise where budget institutions are weak and cannot exert constraints on the budgetary process (Alesina et al. 1999). The literature indicates that unsustainably high fiscal deficits are associated with macroeconomic instability arising from undesirable consequences for a wide range of other macroeconomic variables, including: interest rates (Laubach 2009), current account balances (Abbas et al. 2011), investment (Arora and Dua 1993), inflation (Catao and Terrones 2005; Lin and Chu 2013), exchange rates (Kim and Roubini 2008), and growth (Adam and Bevan 2005). This paper reviews the extant theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of fiscal deficits, considering both macroeconomic and political factors behind the persisting high deficits across many countries. A review of the literature on the determinants of fiscal deficits is timely, given that persistent deficits are fast leading to an accumulation of government debt, especially in low- and middle-income countries (World Bank and IMF 2018). Many developed countries within the OECD are also burdened by large and persistent fiscal deficits (Mercan 2014). We find that both political and macroeconomic factors are important determinants of fiscal deficits, with the quality of economic management and budget institutions particularly important in determining the size of the deficits. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the theoretical literature. Section 3 discusses the empirical literature. Section 4 concludes with a brief discussion and implications for future research.",14

Long-term growth of gross domestic product (GDP) generally leads to improved overall health conditions in a society; however, short-term fluctuations may bring negative consequences. For example, data from the USA have shown that short-term GDP growth may have a negative impact on public health in terms of the prevalence of medical conditions, specific morbidities, activity limitations, and the utilization of medical care (Ruhm 2003). Similarly, recessions may lead to lower mortality rates (Neumayer 2004). However, Svensson (2007) finds the opposite effect–mortality was higher during a recession in Sweden. Efforts are ongoing to examine how lifestyle choices may change with business cycles. Within a business cycle, individual lifestyles can change with respect to alcohol consumption. Also, in times of economic growth and rising real income, alcohol consumption may increase. Fenwick and Tausig’s (1994) psychological study mentions increased alcohol consumption due to work-related stresses in times of economic growth. However, alcohol consumption may also increase in times of recession in response to having more leisure time due to unemployment (Dee 2001). Increases in alcohol consumption during recessions can also occur as self-treatment of stress, sometimes resulting in episodes of heavy drinking and associated negative externalities, such as violence, driving under the influence, etc. (Winton et al. 1986). Due to these opposing effects, it is, ex ante, impossible to predict with confidence the direction in which alcohol consumption will develop; whether it will move pro-cyclically, i.e. increase with economic growth and decline with economic recession, or counter-cyclically, i.e. increase with economic recession and decline with economic growth. This phenomenon has been generally investigated but with varying results. Ruhm and Black (2002) studied US data and found that alcohol consumption appeared to be pro-cyclical. On the contrary, Johansson et al. (2006) used panel data from Finland and suggest that alcohol consumption behaves counter-cyclically. The conflicting results stem mainly from selection of methods, variables, the time period examined, and the location. The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption and the business cycle for the Czech Republic, as an example of a country with different institutional and cultural background from those already studied, to confirm the external validity of the previous studies (e.g. Ruhm and Black 2002; Johansson et al. 2006). In the Czech Republic, alcohol consumption is generally considered publicly acceptable and alcoholic beverages are relatively inexpensive (and consumption rates are high compared to many other countries), as opposed to the USA, where the public is less tolerant, and alcohol is relatively more expensive. High alcohol consumption paired with relatively low prices compared to Western Europe and the USA can lead to alcohol playing a much larger role in daily life in countries like the Czech Republic. For example, in the USA, the average yearly consumption of pure alcohol is about 9.8 L per capita, while in Finland it is 10.7 L per capita. In the Czech Republic, alcohol consumption is significantly higher, at 14.4 L per capita. In the period 2010–2016, alcohol consumption in the Czech Republic increased by 2.9%, although the average consumption in the European Union decreased by 1.5% (World Health Organization 2018). I examine whether the economic cycle, operationalized using the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic in 1994–2016, had an impact on alcohol consumption, and if so, to what extent, and in what direction. Previous studies have used both aggregated and individual data and have mostly relied on alcohol consumption data from legal sales or surveys. However, this approach may not be ideal since it covers only legal consumption. In Central and Eastern Europe, higher production and consumption of illegal alcohol can reasonably be expected (Popova et al. 2007), particularly in times of economic recession, and therefore using data including only legal sales can produce biased results. Prior related studies have not used data on hospitalizations for liver cirrhosis, even though it can be posited that data on cirrhosis better captures consumption of black-market and self-produced alcoholic beverages, which may form a greater market segment in times of economic recession. This study applies a novel approach in that, instead of studying alcohol consumption, I use the number of first hospitalizations of patients in which the main cause of hospitalization was cirrhosis of the liver. I argue that this proxy variable better reflects the real total alcohol consumption in the population, since it covers the effects of consumption of both legal and illegal alcohol and that of self-produced alcoholic beverages. Related studies on the topic have used alcohol-related mortality data (e.g. Johansson et al. 2006). This may also be a more suitable variable than alcohol consumption, but not all cases of deaths should be included, since other factors might have been the real cause of death even if the patient had an alcohol-related disease. Another contribution of this paper to the literature is that, in order to capture the real impact of the business cycle on individual lifestyle choices, I use the unemployment rate instead of GDP growth. As argued above, unemployment resulting from an economic downturn can have major impacts on a society in terms of creating stress that many people may choose to self-treat via an increase in alcohol consumption. This study confirms the hypothesis that a higher real unemployment rate did indeed lead to increases in the rate of diagnosed liver cirrhosis. Last but not least, this is the first study on the relationship between alcohol consumption and the business cycle, divorce rates, and the price of ecstasy (MDMA) which may be considered a substitute for alcohol. The first section of the paper presents a review of related literature, in which I examine the theoretical framework of related studies and the social costs of alcohol use. In the second section, I use a fixed effect method on panel data covering all Czech regions where hospitalizations of new patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver was used as the proxy variable for alcohol consumption. Liver cirrhosis data comes from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic (ÚZIS) database, and the rest of the data was obtained from the Czech Statistical Office (ČSÚ) and the National Drug Enforcement Headquarters (NPC). The final section discusses conclusions and policy implications.",6

Decapitations, mass executions and hanging of bodies are common events across many parts of Mexico (Bunker et al. 2010). Beyond any rhetoric from national and international media, violence is currently a visible phenomenon in public spaces. Although expressions of violence have always occurred sporadically in Mexico, the frequency and brutality of recently observed violence are incomparable to previous periods. Spikes in the rates of violence, usually generated by war, have a negative impact on mental well-being. For instance, de Jong et al. (2003) provide evidence of mental health disorders among the population living in post-conflict communities in Algeria, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Palestine. Similarly, Scholte et al. (2004) find an immediate increase in depression rates among Afghans after the launching of the “War on Terror.” Moreover, Priebe et al. (2010) suggest a long-lasting significant effect of war exposure on anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorders for individuals living in the former Yugoslavia. Also, Jayasuriya et al. (2016) study the effect of conflict on depression and anxiety in Sri Lanka, showing an increase in mental distress across several levels of violence in different conflict zones. The current literature also covers the effect of war on subjective well-being. Van Praag et al. (2010) study the effect of the Lebanon War on life satisfaction of Israel’s population, finding a very slight impact. Shemyakina and Plagnol (2013) study the case of the Bosnian War, suggesting a significant causal effect of conflict on subjective well-being. Coupe and Obrizan (2016) discuss the impact of war on happiness in Ukraine, showing a substantial effect in conflict zones as opposed to non-conflict zones. This paper is the first attempt to estimate the effect of violence on mental well-being among adults in Mexico, amid a conflict known as the “Mexican Drug War.” Footnote 1  The research question asks whether the spread of violence—not related to ethnic or international disputes but rather to organized crime—has an impact on mental well-being of adults in Mexico. To infer causality, the empirical strategy consists, on the one hand, of a multilevel analysis for mental well-being outcomes at the individual level and, on the other hand, of a difference-in-difference approach for aggregate mental well-being variables at the municipality level. Results suggest no effect of violence on clinical (diagnosis or using antidepressants) and non-clinical (feeling sad or depressed) mental well-being for adult males and on clinical mental well-being for adult females. Yet, findings indicate a statistically significant effect of violence on non-clinical mental well-being for adult females in Mexico. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes the relevant features of the Mexican Drug War and the expansion of violence. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy to estimate the causal effect of violence on mental well-being. Section 4 presents results and robustness tests of the suggested findings. Finally, Sect. 5 discusses the economic implications of these results.",

The concept of ‘team reasoning’ or ‘we-thinking’ has been proposed by Hodgson (1967), Regan (1980), Gilbert (1989), Hurley (1989), Searle (1990), Bratman (1993), Tuomela (1995, 2007), Hollis and Sugden (Hollis and Sugden 1993) and Hollis (1998), to give ‘a more social conception’ (Hollis 1998, p. 104) of human rationality. Within economics, it has been developed by Sugden (1993, 2000, 2003, 2015, 2018) and Bacharach (1995, 1997, 1999, 2006), to solve some puzzles that arise in game theory, especially linked to coordination and cooperation (Colman and Gold 2018; Gold and Colman 2020; Smerilli 2012). The basic idea of those theories is that, when dealing with a particular decision problem, some agents may seek an answer to the question: ‘What should we do?’, thus acting as members of a team rather than as isolated agents. As argued by Colman and Gold (2018), it is difficult to deny that real people often engage in some form of team reasoning; but still there are sharp divisions about the circumstances under which team reasoning occurs. Within economics, in particular, Bacharach and Sugden have provided two different analytical frameworks, entailing different views about the cognitive and psychological mechanisms that underlie team reasoning. Moreover, Sugden’s account of team reasoning has been subject to partial revisions, modifications and restatements over time, progressively extending its domain of applicability and becoming enriched with suggestions from different strands of thought. The resulting framework is extremely complex and seems to show some conflicting implications (Gold and Colman 2020). Therefore, a reconstruction is needed to understand how team reasoning is supposed to work and under what kinds of assumptions, as well as what kinds of interactions it is meant to describe. In short, this is a question about the explanatory power of team reasoning. This paper is an attempt to provide an answer by reconstructing Sugden’s version of the theory. My reconstruction covers the period of 1982–2015, and follows both a historical and an interpretative approach. I chronologically divide the evolution of Sugden’s team reasoning into four main periods. For each period, I show what elements in the theory have changed and which have remained constant. More precisely, I will show how changes in the definition of the problem translate into changes in the conceptual framework.Footnote 1 Moreover, I illustrate how those changes are influenced by Sugden’s work in different research areas. For this purpose, I move forward and back in the chronological order to reconstruct the continuity of different lines of thought. I also show how Sugden’s reflection on team reasoning often seems to share some of Bacharach’s intuitions, although following a different path.Footnote 2 This paper is structured as follows. In the first section, I analyse some contributions prior to 1993 to highlight the ‘big questions’ driving the formulation of the theory of team reasoning. In the second section, which covers the period of 1993–2000, I examine Sugden’s first two main contributions to the theory of team reasoning, which I use as a baseline. In the third section, which covers the period of 2001–2007, I analyse some contributions to team reasoning, as well as previous and subsequent works, with a focus on the concept of salience and the evolution of conventions. In the fourth section, I summarise and examine the contributions in the period of 2008–2015. The fifth section concludes.",2

Hargreaves Heap,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Bob Sugden has returned, magisterially in his new book to the themes of his seminal work of the 1980s, The Political Economy of Welfare, Rights and Cooperation (Sugden 1986). In this paper, I shall reflect on the key points of continuity and change and where that leaves his argument commending the market to us, as citizens, as what we should agree among ourselves to regulate our lives. One way of appreciating what has and has not changed with the new volume is to name check the enduring influence of some of the ‘greats’ in economics across the two books, and note the arrival of new ones in The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural Economist’s Defence of the Market. The enduring influences are Buchanan, Hayek and Hume. They provide two things in both books: a distinctive defence of the market and a distinctive, ‘contractarian-based’, approach to what economists should be doing when offering ‘policy advice’. The new arrivals are Mill and Smith. Although the title of the book is a nod to Mill, I shall argue that Smith is the key, and a troubling, new addition. He arrives to plug a gap in Hume’s argument for relying on mutual advantage but, I suggest, he brings some uncomfortable baggage for a central argument in The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural Economist’s Defence of the Market. The idea of ‘mutual sympathy’ plugs a psychological gap in Hume over why individuals who care about own advantage should follow rules that, while mutually beneficial, do not always maximize own advantage. ‘Mutual sympathy’ does this. However, it is also potentially double-edged in its effect on the argument. It may, as Sugden argues, cement psychologically individual commitment to institutions of mutual advantage, but I shall argue in Sect. 3 that it also introduces another consideration into the evaluation of institutions: mutual respect. This need not blunt the argument for the market as an institution of mutual advantage so long as markets do not undermine the scope for mutual respect. The trouble is, I shall argue in Sect. 4, they might. Before I develop the idea that introducing Smith may be double-edged in more detail, I shall discuss in the next section two other modifications to his argument for a society of mutual advantage. They arise from two important developments since he wrote The Political Economy of Welfare, Rights and Cooperation. One comes from inside the academy: the rise of behavioural economics and ‘nudging’ as a kind of policy intervention. The other is the increase in inequality in most rich countries. His response to both significantly sharpens both his defence of the market and his model of the economist as policy adviser, that is, someone who needs a loudspeaker to address fellow citizens rather than a comfy chair to sit in while whispering in the ears of would-be social planners. In the last section, I conclude by bringing Hayek back into the argument as a source of scepticism over whether we will sign up, ‘contractarian’ style, for institutions of mutual benefit. Put simply, he points to why we might well want more from our institutions. Indeed, what more we want has an obvious connection to the earlier argument on the double-edged nature of Smith’s ‘mutual sympathy’ and so reinforces this point.",3

At a fundamental level, behavioral economics challenges standard normative or “welfare” economicsFootnote 1: Specifically, the lack of well-behaved or “integrated” preferences—along with all kinds of well-known older objections (e.g., Hausman and McPherson 2009; Hausman 2012)—make preference-satisfaction decidedly unattractive as a measure of well-being.Footnote 2 Real-world preferences are evolving and context-dependent—in one word, they are too messy to serve as a reliable foundation on which to build evaluative statements on economic outcomes and processes. In their stead, Sugden puts people’s chances to choose out of as many options as possible—a notion he calls the opportunity criterion. This made its first prominent appearance with Sugden (2004).Footnote 3 His is an explicitly contractarian approach, with the ambition to offer a notion of improvement that every single citizen can readily accept as serving his or her interests. Sixteen years on, work at the intersection of welfare economics and ethics that is explicitly informed by behavioral insights is still rare—which makes Sugden’s contribution all the more valuable and inspiring. In this note, I will try to give a very brief summary of what I consider to be the key points of Sugden’s opportunity criterion. Then, I will outline what, in my view, is missing in his approach. I think the missing parts are relevant insofar as they risk making the whole criterion less attractive to the general public than might be the case with the alternative approach that I am about to suggest. As a contractarian, Sugden should care about that, since contractarians must “sell” their understandings of what is (likely to be) in everyone’s interest to the general public. My ideas here build, on the one hand, on earlier attempts presented in Schubert (2015) and criticized by Sugden (2015). On the other hand, they are inspired by a certain interpretation of James M. Buchanan’s concept of personal identity, in the sense described by Dold and Schubert (2018), owing much to Dold (2018), Lewis and Dold (2020), and Rizzo and Dold (2020). The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, I describe, in a nutshell, the problem behavioral economics poses for normative economics, the attempt by behavioral welfare economics (BWE) to cope with that problem, and Sugden’s opportunity criterion as a response to BWE, which he rightly sees as a failure. Subsequently, in Sect. 3, I present my main objections against his view as well as the contours of an alternative “opportunity to learn” criterion. In Sect. 4, I try to defend one of its pillars, namely James Buchanan’s account of the “artifactual person” against Sugden’s most recent critique, as elaborated upon in Sugden (2019). Section 5 concludes. My key claim will be that in our age of behavioral public policies, my “opportunity to learn” criterion provides better safeguards against the encroachment of individual autonomy by nudges and ever more sophisticated behavioral algorithms than Sugden’s opportunity criterion.",3

After thirty-two years, Sugden owed his readers a monograph integrating the research that he has done across economics and philosophy. TCOA lives up to the expectations: it includes the most advanced contractarian justification of the market system since Gauthier’s Morals by Agreement (1985); a devastating critique of Libertarian Paternalism; and a new interpretation of the findings of behavioural economics for the design of social policy. There is enough material in TCOA for several commentaries, so I will have to be selective. I will try to keep my eyes on the forest rather than on a single tree, metaphorically speaking, focusing on the general implications of Sugden’s contractarianism. In the second section, I will highlight the Humean roots of his approach, in particular Sugden’s commitment to design institutions that will be acceptable to people as they are. Section 3 is devoted to a central problem of Sugden’s theory, namely the problem of defining the extent of redistribution or the amount of social insurance that is required to compensate people for their brute bad luck and ensure that market institutions work to everyone’s advantage. Sugden argues that mutual advantage must be measured relative to a baseline, and that the baseline is the status quo. In Sect. 4 I will argue that this idea may conflict with the Humean principle of taking people as they are: in the real world, the baseline will be determined in large part by people’s expectations, as well as their relative bargaining power. Section 5 tries to reconcile this fact—and the large amount of redistribution that it implies—with the ideal of democratic equality. In a well-functioning society, redistribution is needed not only to ensure that everyone benefits from market institutions, but also to protect the rich from the poor, the poor from the rich, and more generally to safeguard the cooperative attitudes that are necessary for the well-functioning of institutions.",3

On Sugden’s contractarian account,March 2021,Paolo Silvestri,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“We should have the courage to say that taxes are a beautiful thing. It is a very civilized way of contributing all together to the payment of essential [public] goods like education, safety, healthcare and the environment.” In 2007, the then Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa (1940–2010), made this claim on a national TV show. He did have the courage, but was overwhelmed by an avalanche of sarcasm and mockery.
 But what happens when taxpayers have the freedom to choose how to spend a share of their tax money, that is, where to allocate it or whom to give it to? This is the case of Percentage Tax Designation Institutions, known in Italy as “Otto per mille” and “Cinque per mille”. Every year nearly 18 million Italians—about half of the citizen-taxpayers—voluntarily give, via this institution, a share of their taxes to beneficiaries pursuing purposes of public utility. Every year, the Italian state redistributes around 1.7 billion euros of this tax money to the beneficiaries chosen by the taxpayers. Every year, following the publication of the results of the annual redistribution by the Italian Internal Revenue Service, in the newspaper we regularly find headlines and quips aimed at the former minister, which sound more or less like this: “Here are the taxes that we pay willingly.” “Percentage Tax Designation Institutions” (henceforth “PTDIs”), also known as “Percentage Philanthropy Laws”, are fiscal institutions through which taxpayers can freely designate a certain percentage of their income tax to entities whose main activity is of public interest: churches, third-sector organizations, political parties, etc. PTDIs came into force in some Southern and Central-Eastern European countries—Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Slovakia and others—several decades ago. The Italian “Otto per mille” came into force in 1990, and later became the institutional reference model for Hungary, which, in turn, became the model for other East European countries. It was instituted as a mechanism to finance either churches and religious confessions or a state fund for social/humanitarian purposes. Later, in 2006, the Italian legislator enacted the so-called “Cinque per mille” (henceforth I will use the abbreviated forms “8 × 1000” and “5 × 1000” to mean the respective “institutions”). The 5 × 1000 was introduced as an institution aimed at implementing the constitutional principle of horizontal subsidiarity and as a way, via taxpayers’ designations, to channel funding to third-sector organizations and other entities providing public goods or services. Even though these institutions have been in place for many years, few scientific studies have attempted to provide a conceptual and explanatory framework capable of casting light on their theoretical and practical potential.Footnote 1 In his latest book, The Community of Advantage (2018) (henceforth “TCOA”),Footnote 2 Robert Sugden provides a theoretical account of the Italian 8 × 1000 in line with, but also further improving, the paradigm of “voluntary exchange” (Wicksell 1896/1958; Lindahl 1919/1958; Buchanan 1968).Footnote 3 This particular tax institution is explained by Sugden (xi) as one of those forms of regulation that “would be justified as ways of expanding opportunity for mutually beneficial transactions” and, more particularly, as a liberal and “contractarian approach to the provision of public goods” (171). Sugden has the merit of being the only scholar (as far as I know) to have attempted such a theoretical, contractarian account with regard to this tax institution. Therefore, it deserves the utmost attention. This article is an attempt to push forward the frontier of knowledge of PTDIs, while reflecting on Sugden’s contractarian account and, where possible, improving it. I will first explain, in Sect. 2, the main characteristics of the Italian PTDIs—namely, basic facts and functioning, the set of opportunities open to the taxpayer, rules of choice and redistribution mechanisms. In Sect. 3, I will reconstruct Sugden’s account of the 8 × 1000 against the background of his treatment of public goods and his contractarian approach within and beyond the voluntary exchange tradition. In order to test the validity of Sugden’s account and its normative premises—the opportunity criterion and the correlated freedom of choice—in Sect. 4 I will introduce some possible objections mainly related to Sugden’s (possible) neglect of the implications of both the PTDIs redistribution mechanisms and the default options over taxpayers’ freedom. I will also consider some limits intrinsic to the analogy between these mechanisms and the voting system as well as the way they go beyond the voluntary exchange paradigm. Section 5 concludes.",3

Robert Sugden’s recent (2018) book, The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural Economist’s Defence of the Market (henceforth CA), reproposes Mill’s question with reference to relationships among citizens, rather than among countries. His answer is a convinced “yes”. Finding advocates of the market among mainstream economists is not an arduous task. Yet, Sugden is not one of them, having devoted most of his scholarly work to overcome the usual rational-choice theory view of economic actors, and also having shown, for one thing, that markets do not neutrally reveal pre-existing preferences, but shape them as well.Footnote 1 His vision of market interactions is original and insightful. His starting point is contractarian à la Buchanan. So he is a resolute defender of the right to pursue one’s own stated objectives (with the limit of not damaging others), and deems the market is there to ensure “the pursuit of mutual benefit by individuals who are concerned with their own interests” (CA, p. 29). Yet, Sugden does not confine economic actors to an individualistic logic. Instead, he regards them as sensitive to the expectations of counterparties, and also capable of overcoming social traps by taking courses of action jointly advantageous. Moving between the positive level—with the support of experimental evidences to which he has himself contributed—and the normative level, Sugden sees it possible that economic actors operate in the market in adherence to its telos: creating mutual benefit. For attaining this collective aim—he recommends—let agents engage in those transactions that they see beneficial to themselves; but once inside a transaction, let them do so that their counterparties end up with an adequate benefit too. If economic agents view their interactions in this light, and conduct them accordingly—he argues—the Community of Advantage can really come true; with the additional consequence that: “… people come to see one another as cooperative partners rather than as rivals, and this perception tends to support more general attitudes of social solidarity and good will” (CA, p.2).",1
68,2,International Review of Economics,03 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-020-00358-6,"Generativity, aging and subjective well-being",June 2021,Leonardo Becchetti,Davide Bellucci,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Mill “Those only are happy, I thought, who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness, on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way” (Mill, 1893: p.117) The act of programming our (car or smartphone) satellite navigator to drive or walk toward a desired destination has become one of the most common actions in our lives. The most important decision when deliberating about such action is to choose and write where to go. Once this choice has been made, the decision on “how to go” is taken by the satellite navigator that is programmed to minimize the time needed to reach the chosen destination. In a similar way, in the more general issue of life direction, the crucial decision for rational and maximizing individuals consists of defining the destination that maximizes their own life sense and satisfaction as a goal for their life journey. After this decision is taken, rationality plays the role of the satellite navigator ensuring consistency between means and ends. This is why understanding drivers of life satisfaction is one of the most important topics in social and economic research if scholars and policymakers want to understand human action and choices. Our paper aims to provide an original contribution to this important field of the literature by investigating an absolutely new and unexplored concept in economics (generativity) and testing its role as a driver of life satisfaction, with empirical findings that open the way to important considerations for social and economic policies. The concept of generativity in social sciences originates from the seminal work of Erikson (1993 and 1998). According to the psychologist, human beings live eight stages of psychosocial development.Footnote 1 Generativity is the positive response to the seventh stage concerning a crucial period of adult life going, according to Erikson, between 40 and 65.Footnote 2 This is a phase in which individuals continue to build their career and relational life and feel themselves “generative” when they believe to contribute positively with their work and activities to the life of their inner and outer circles (family and communities). In the same direction, Fisher (1995) contributes to this literature by considering generativity in older age as a fundamental factor concurring to successful aging. He notes that for elder people, the possibility of feeling useful to the growth and development of someone else represents an essential aspect to perceive life as meaningful during its later stages. According to Erikson, generativity consists in the sequence of four verbs: to desire, to give birth, to accompany, to let it go. This means that it is originated by the desire/willingness to pursue some socially desirable goal and that it comes into act with the birth of an action/activity. Generativity can grow and prosper only if the action/activity is cultivated and if the “originator” has the intelligence to understand that the activity cannot survive if it remains only on his/her shoulder. In this sense, financial markets can be conceived as playing an important role for economic generativity by easing the creation of companies and the intra- and intergenerational transfer of their property, that is, financial markets help to “give birth,” “accompany” and “let it go” corporate organizations that create economic value. Using a language closer to that of the economics and welfare literature, we can define generativity at individual level as the act of an individual using his/her available set of doing and being (capabilities) and the states of being and doing (functionalities) for doing things that he/she expects may have positive effects on the life of other human beingsFootnote 3 and, through them, also indirectly on his/her own life. As such, capabilities and functionings are necessary but not sufficient conditions for generativity (as they affect generativity power but they may not become generativity in act). In a sense, the above definition of generativity operationalizes a well-known say of GenovesiFootnote 4 and John Stuart Mill (see our quote at the beginning of the paper) on happiness conceived as the unintended effect of a life dedicated to an activity that can contribute to the improvement of the mankind or of at least one other human being. The positive effect on one’s own life and on life of other human beings implied by generativity includes valuable social and economic initiatives, altruistic actions but also relational life. The concept of generativity aims to provide an original contribution to the ample literature of the determinants of subjective well-being. As we know a starting point of this literature is the Easterlin paradox with its descriptive evidence on the decoupling between per capita GDP and the share of very happy individuals in the US after the Second World War. The paradox illustrates the fact that GDP is not a synthetic measure capturing sufficiently well neither subjective well-being nor even economic satisfaction of the individual, which is better measured by household disposable income net of the cost of crucial goods such as education and health.Footnote 5 Stimulated by the always wider availability of data on life satisfaction and life sense, the empirical literature on their drivers has evolved in several directions (for a survey on the life satisfaction literature see, among others, Veenhoven 1993; Frey and Stutzer 2002; Blanchflower and Oswald 2004; Clark et al. 2006; Becchetti and Pelloni 2013
). The usefulness of subjective well-being in the economic literature has grown in parallel with evidence on its effects as predictor of relevant economic variables such as job quit and productivity (Judge 1992; Staw and Barsade 1993; Judge et al. 2001), self-assessed health and mortality (Becchetti et al. 2019; Idler and Kasl 1995; McCallum et al. 1994; Benjamins et al. 2004; Idler and Angel 1990 and Appels et al. 1996) and insurgence of chronical illnesses (Becchetti et al. 2019
), to its usefulness to calculate the value of nonmarket goods with the compensating variation approach (Welsch 2002 and Luechinger 2009; Luechinger and Raschky 2009; van Praag and Baarsma 2005; Frey et al. 2009) and its importance for measuring satisfaction of citizens and voters for policymakers. The life satisfaction literature has created a closer integration among social sciences (investigating the role of peer comparisons from sociologyFootnote 6 and hedonic adaptation from psychology for instance) and has helped to go beyond the “consequentialist” utilitarian approach by which satisfaction is univocally defined by the outcome and not by circumstances lived during the action that led to the outcome itself.Footnote 7 A line of conflict in the subjective well-being literature has been that between life satisfaction and the Amartya Sen’s capability approach. While life satisfaction has the unique advantage of being not “paternalistic” (since no one else than the individual involved may evaluate his/her own life satisfaction), it also suffers from the “happy slave” Sen’s (1985) critique,Footnote 8 by which even the most deprived can paradoxically declare themselves satisfied with their life if the level of their expectations is so low to eliminate any hope for improvement. The generativity approach proposed in this paper lies somewhat in the middle. It looks at the life satisfaction and life sense effects of the generativity concept to test whether the latter concretely satisfies self-declared subjective well-being. In this sense, it proposes an extension of the capability approach where generativity occurs only if the available set of doing and functionings (driven by good health, economic well-being, education) is effectively geared toward an activity through which individuals contribute positively to subjective well-being of other individuals. In a nutshell, if the capability approach concerns mainly (even though not exclusively) freedom and potential (akin to the Aristotelean concept of “power”), the generativity approach concerns the freedom and potential that is put into specific actions (akin to the Aristotelean concept of “act”) to pursue activities that can positively contribute to well-being and self-fulfillment of other human beings. The literature on generativity has found developments in the last decades especially in social psychology where a generativity index has been elaborated (the Loyola Generativity Scale) and its impact tested with a Generativity Behavioral Checklist (GBC) (McAdams and St. Aubin 1992 and 1998; Aubin et al. 2004). Shahen et al. (2019) test the effect of generativity on subjective well-being using the GBC. Other contributions investigate the nexus between generativity and the environment (Jia et al. 2015 and 2016, Matsuba et al. 2012), while others the role of altruism as mediator in the link between generativity and life satisfaction (Hofer et al. 2016). Our paper, by testing the effect of generativity on subjective well-being, aims to provide an original contribution to this literature in several respects. First, we do not use an ad hoc created survey but test the effect of generativity on an international survey (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe SHARE) representative at country level. The advantage is that of testing our research hypothesis on larger numbers and a wider set of countries at the same time. We as well decompose generativity into three parts and introduce two new “generativity in power” indicators, while our “generativity in act” indicator is what is closest to LGS and GBC based on the SHARE database. As well, the test for the existence of a gross effect and a net effect after controlling for the concurring loss of locus of control is a novelty of our approach. In this respect, we highlight a trade-off in the generativity-well-being relationship based on the negative relationship between generativity and locus of control. The characteristics of the SHARE database are such that our analysis is concentrated on people aged 50 and above. This is a limit but is also related to the original concept of Erikson considering generativity the stage for evolution in an adult phase of life. We hope that our work will stimulate further research to test whether similar findings occur when looking at younger generations As a measure of generativity, we use an index of activities that unambiguously produce positive effects on the lives of other human beings. Since these activities are mostly correlated with our leisure time, they do not fully capture the generativity/nongenerativity component correlated with professional life. In order to overcome this limit, we use the job taxonomy of the SHARE database to define professions that are more/less generative. We therefore end up with two variables measuring generativity mostly in leisure and in working time, respectively. Our findings show that the first (leisure) generativity measure contributes positively and significantly to life satisfaction and more so to life meaning. We as well find that generativity is more precious (has a higher marginal utility) for those individuals with lower individual generativity power (i.e., with living conditions that make generativity more difficult such as older respondents, respondents with lower income and health). Our hypothesis on the job generativity measure is as well not rejected since jobs with higher generativity potential contribute more significantly to life satisfaction and life sense. We also find that the gross effect of generativity in act on subjective well-being is smaller than the net effect. This is because generativity in act is correlated with lower control over one’s own life that, in turn, negatively affects life satisfaction. Our findings therefore identify a trade-off where “freedom for” (individual generativity in act) reduces “freedom of,” but nonetheless positively contributes to life satisfaction and life sense.",4

68,2,International Review of Economics,07 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-020-00363-9,Corporate social responsibility in a supply chain and competition from a vertically integrated firm,June 2021,Jorge Fernández-Ruiz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In recent decades, there has been an increased awareness of the importance of firms’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (see for instance KPMG (2017); UN Global Compact and Accenture (2019)) and numerous studies devoted to the analysis of its different facets.Footnote 1 In particular, some of this literature studies the effects of CSR when a manufacturer and a retailer are engaged in a vertical supply channel in a bilateral monopoly. The present paper adds to this literature by introducing the existence of competition from a vertically integrated firm into the analysis. The vertical relationship between a retailer and a manufacturer gives rise to the well-known problem of double marginalization, as studied in the seminal work by Spengler (1950) in the context of a linear bilateral monopoly. Brand and Grothe (2015) also consider this framework, where double marginalization leads to the famous statement phrased as the question “What is worse than a monopoly? A chain of monopolies” (Tirole 1988, p. 175). Brand and Grothe (2015) analyze the effects of firms’ social concern in this context.Footnote 2 They examine the endogenous non-cooperative choice of the degrees of social concern by the manufacturer and the retailer and show that both of them find it profitable to choose positive degrees of social concern. These choices soften the double marginalization problem and lead to a Pareto improvement relative to a situation where firms pursue pure profit maximization, since they result not only in higher profits for both the manufacturer and the retailer, but also in lower prices and higher consumer surplus and social welfare. Ouchida (2019) extends Brand and Grothe’s (2015) analysis to consider the cooperative choice of firms’ degrees of social concern and finds that it leads to higher degrees of firms’ social concern than those under the non-cooperative scenario and that these choices completely solve the double marginalization problem. The present paper extends Brand and Grothe’s (2015) study by introducing competition from a vertically integrated firm into the analysis. Just as in Brand and Grothe (2015), it considers a retailer and a manufacturer engaged in a supply chain, but it examines a situation where they face competition from a firm that is vertically integrated and therefore does not suffer from the double marginalization problem.Footnote 3 In this context, it is known that the retailer and the manufacturer are at a disadvantage in comparison with the vertically integrated firm and have incentives to integrate, as studied by Greenhut and Ohta (1979). Here, however, instead of considering vertical integration between the retailer and the manufacturer, the impact of introducing social responsibility into their objective functions is studied. Both non-cooperative and cooperative choices of their degrees of social concern are considered, as studied by Brand and Grothe (2015) and Ouchida (2019), respectively, for bilateral monopoly. The aim of the current paper is to study how the effects of social responsibility on the double marginalization problem in a bilateral monopoly extend to the case where the vertical supply chain faces competition from another firm. It explores the simple case where this competitor firm is vertically integrated and thus does not face a double marginalization problem. This approach allows to study how the use of social responsibility by a manufacturer and a retailer engaged in a vertical supply chain compares with the use of simple vertical integration by a rival firm in a competitive environment. The main results of the paper are as follows. In contrast to the bilateral monopoly case (Brand and Grothe 2015), a retailer and a manufacturer that are engaged in a supply chain and non-cooperatively select their degrees of social concern choose to pursue pure profit maximization if they face competition from a vertically integrated firm. This puts them at a disadvantage with respect to their vertically integrated competitor, who produces an output higher than theirs and obtains profits higher than their joint profits. The paper also examines the case where the retailer and the manufacturer choose their degrees of social concern cooperatively, as in Ouchida (2019). It finds that in this case they do choose positive degrees of social concern and that these choices give them a competitive edge over their vertically integrated competitor, and both their output and their joint profits are higher than those of their competitor. The paper finds as well that, in comparison with the case of pure profit maximization, the positive degrees of social concern cooperatively chosen by the manufacturer and the retailer lead to higher output and profits for the retailer and the manufacturer and lower output and profits for their competitor. Moreover, they lead to lower prices and higher consumer surplus and social welfare. The paper finally considers an extension where the vertically integrated firm also chooses its own degree of social concern. It turns out that this choice depends on whether the retailer and the manufacturer choose their degrees of social concern on a cooperative or a non-cooperative fashion, adding another dimension to the difference between these two frameworks. It is worthwhile to remark that among the different approaches to CSR that emphasize its various different aspects,Footnote 4 in this paper CSR refers to a firm incorporating into its objective function the interests of parties different from its shareholders. More specifically, this paper concentrates on the firm’s commitment to incorporate consumers’ interests,Footnote 5 in the form of a fraction of Consumer Surplus, into its objective function. It studies the use of this commitment for strategic purposes,Footnote 6 that is, it investigates the “profit-maximizing” caseFootnote 7 for the use of CSR (See Carroll and Shabana 2010). The remainder of this introduction puts the present paper in the context of the general literature on CSR, reviewing the work most related to it. The profit-enhancing nature of CSR also appears in work by Lambertini and Tampieri (2015), Kopel and Brand (2012), Fanti and Buccella (2017a, b) and Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020), among others. For instance, Lambertini and Tampieri (2015) (see also Lambertini and Tampieri 2012) find that a firm that commits to being socially responsible, in the sense of taking into account environmental issues and consumer surplus, obtains higher profits than its profit-maximizing competitors provided that the market is large enough. This is in the same vein as Kopel and Brand (2012) who also find that a firm that incorporates a fraction of consumer surplus in its objective function obtains higher profits than its profit-maximizing competitor. Similarly, Fanti and Buccella (2017a) study firms’ decisions on whether or not to adopt CSR rules—where this means including an exogenous given fraction of Consumer Surplus in its objective function—for strategic reasons in a duopoly model with differentiated products. They find that, depending on the degree of product differentiation, different equilibria may arise, including both firms following CSR, none of them doing so, or having asymmetric equilibria where one firm follows CSR and the other one does not. Fanti and Buccella (2017b) also analyze the strategic adoption of CSR in a duopoly model, but they consider the case where firms are run by managers. They find that in equilibrium both managerial firms adopt CSR. On the other hand, Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020) also consider the strategic use of CSR in imperfectly competitive markets, but their study assumes an arbitrary number of firms in a continuous choice framework. They show that the endogenous level of CSR is positive for any number of active firms, but it is lower if this number is higher, and that equilibrium profits are smaller in comparison with a situation without CSR. They also consider an entry deterrence game and show that an incumbent monopolist can use CSR to deter the entry of another firm. The results in both cases reveal that the use of CSR may increase market concentration. There are also papers where the profit-enhancing nature of CSR appears in the particular case of a manufacturer and a retailer engaged in a vertical relationship, in addition to the work by Brand and Groethe (2014)) and Ouchida (2019). They include García et al. (2018), who incorporate a manufacturer’s cost-reducing R&D investment in a non-cooperative framework and examine an endogenous timing game, and Li and Zhou (2019), who consider the joint effect of the manufacturer’s cost reduction and the retailer’s promotion effort in a cooperative scenario. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 undertakes its analysis: Sect. 3.1 studies the case where firms’ degrees of social concern are exogenous, Sect. 3.2 considers their endogenous choice under a non-cooperative scenario, and Sect. 3.3 turns to the case where they are cooperatively chosen. Section 3.4 extends the model to the case where the vertically integrated firm also chooses its own degree of social concern. Section 4 concludes.",3
68,2,International Review of Economics,08 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-021-00366-0,Corporate social responsibility in unionised network industries,June 2021,Luciano Fanti,Domenico Buccella,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Today, network goods, whose utility increases with the number of users who consume the goods, are of extreme relevance. The massive expansion of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and their relative software and apps provide an effective example.Footnote 1 In several cases, network industries are characterised by an oligopolistic market structure whose labour force can be unionised. On the one hand, tech corporations such as Silicon Valley giants Apple and Facebook are not unionised, and their attitude towards organised work has fluctuated between aversion and clear hostility (Quartz 2017). On the other hand, in other network industries, a different unionisation path can be recognised, for example, as seen in the US wireless career provider industry. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics data, after the deregulation in the sector and the shrinking workforce at Baby Bells, the percentage of unionised workers declined from 42.4 percent in 1983 to 21.8 percent in 2002 (The New York Times 2006). Large operators such as Verizon Wireless have discouraged unionisation. In their view, organised labour hinders their ability to move workers, cut costs, and make the necessary changes to compete in a high-tech industry. The management of Cingular Wireless, now called AT&T Mobility, made an opposite move with respect to its rivals. In 2004, the company acquired AT&T Wireless. Since July 2005, the Communications Workers of America, the largest union operating in the US telecommunication sector, recruited 16,500 former AT&T workers at retail stores and call centres nationwide as union members, sending the message that organised labour can serve as a management ally. Indeed, the AT&T Mobility market shares increased from 26.6 percent in 2011 (CNNmoney 2011) to 34.07 percent in 2018 (Statista.com 2019). Furthermore, in recent years, other several large companies in network industries have become unionised. For instance, in September 2015, 38 full-time bug testers employed to review apps for Microsoft voted to create a union, the Temporary Workers of America (BloombergBusinessweek 2015). On January 4, 2021, hundreds of employees at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, launched a union (open to full-time workers as well as contractors at the tech giant), called The Alphabet Workers' Union, in which 226 of the group's members signed union cards with the Communications Workers of America (CNN.com 2021). Because a vast body of literature in industrial organisations has acknowledged the unions’ crucial role in oligopolies (see, inter alia, Dowrick 1989, 1990; Horn and Wolinsky 1988; Correa-López and Naylor 2004), it is appropriate to study the effect of unionisation in those industries. In addition, several large unionised companies in network industries also engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, one of the most worldwide attention-catching phenomena during recent decades. In fact, according to KPMG, CSR engagement is currently a dominant global business practice. In 2002, only 23 percent of the top 100 companies surveyed in 45 countries have reported the realisation of CSR activities. Those figures have increased to 75 percent in 2017. Closer examination of the 250 Global Fortune Index companies (the world’s 250 largest companies) reveals that those figures have risen from 45 to 93 percent. Network industries are in a leading position among the sectors that have witnessed a striking development pace with regard to CSR activities. Indeed, according to recent KPMG reports, among the surveyed industries, the technology, media, and telecommunications sector demonstrate the highest percentage, with 79 percent of the companies reporting CSR activities (KPMG 2005, 2017). In detail, the telecommunication subsector has the largest share of firms reporting CSR activities, with 87 percent of the companies (KPMG 2016a, b). Moreover, the Reputation Institute global CSR survey reveals that companies in network industries have established a major presence in the world’s top ranking with regard to the companies with the best CSR reputations: Microsoft ranks 5th, Sony 6th, Intel 11th, Google 14th, and Philips 18th (Reputation Institute 2019). Empirical studies have determined that labour unions can take different positions with regard to CSR, especially if CSR can affect bargaining issues (Colombo et al. 2019). Empirical evidence exists that unions have a proactive role in advancing social responsibility, particularly concerning the broader social and environmental issues; their involvement seems to improve the possibility that companies positively counteract such demands (e.g. Brammer 2011). On the other hand, other contributions have revealed that unions can play an antagonistic role with respect to CSR, mostly when those activities give the impression of (1) weakening the unions’ main objectives to raise employment and wages (e.g. Fredriksson and Gaston 1999) and (2) providing a new strategy for union avoidance (e.g. Marens 2010). Indeed, unions are commonly believed to perceive CSR activities to threaten employees when companies spontaneously develop precise social and environmental conduct which generates a trade-off with employees’ interests or when unions believe companies consider them not to be specific stakeholders but in the same vein of other internal or external actors (Greenwood and Anderson 2009; Preuss 2008; Van Buren and Greenwood 2011). Because of the relevance of network industries in contemporary economies, and given that the joint presence of network externalities, unionisation, and CSR activities within a firm are widespread observed facts, a comprehensive analysis of the interconnections between network externalities, unionisation, and CSR is well timed. In fact, the interplay of these elements can affect the standard outcomes of strategic oligopolistic contexts. In fact, on the one hand, by altering production (labour) costs, unionisation can influence the consumers’ expectations with regard to total sales and the final prices of the products, with consequent impact on the commercial/business strategies of the operating companies. On the other hand, the presence of CSR can impact the union wage setting for companies and their profitability: network externalities are an exogenous market feature; however, CSR activities can be a firm’s choice variable strategically used to enhance its performance. Furthermore, other plausible rationales for the network firms to assume involvement in CSR can be: (1) to create a signal effect: in fact, having relevant lock-in effects, the companies’ engagement in CSR represents a clear signal to influence buyers' expectations and demand. Therefore, not adopting CSR behaviours and losing one client from the installed base generates a double penalty for the company: one is the product unit lost, and the other is the lower consumer utility. Consequently, the lower willingness to buy/demand among those who will evaluate the purchase in the future. Another point of plausible rationale is (2) the size of their markets imply large budgets for communication strategies and corporate identity, and CSR is amongst the recent trends. According to Garriga and Melè (2004), the concept of CSR can be interpreted in several ways. The most relevant approaches concentrate on one of the following aspects of social reality: economics, politics, social integration, and ethics. CSR can be broadly defined as a “company’s verifiable commitment to operating in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner that is transparent and increasingly satisfying to its stakeholders” (Katsoulakos et al. 2004). For instance, CSR cover activities ranging from the adoption of codes of conduct and customer relationship management (economic aspects) to environmental actions, labour practice indicators, standards for suppliers, and philanthropy (social aspects). Looking closer at the economics’ approach, which is relevant to this paper, a corporation is a tool to create wealth and whose unique social responsibility is to maximize shareholders’ value. As Nobel Prize-winning Milton Friedman (1970) clearly states, “the only one responsibility of business towards society is the maximisation of profits to the shareholders within the legal framework and the ethical custom of the country”. In detail, this paper focuses on one of the economic aspects of CSR adoption, that is consumer friendliness (consumer satisfaction) and implicitly, it is hypothesised as a stakeholder view of the firm (Freeman 1984). That is, managers aim to satisfy a variety of stakeholders, therefore departing from the standard objective of the pure profit maximisation, thereby influencing firms’ outcomes. In the standard industrial organisation literature (e.g. Cournot competition), to maximize the shareholders’ value coincides with firms’ short-term profit orientation. Therefore, in the framework of the basic Cournot model, it seems that there would be no room to engage in CSR activities in an industry at equilibrium: in fact, from the perspective of profit-seeking shareholders, an excessive amount of output is produced. Thus, such over-production would be unprofitable, unless CSR activities have a positive (direct or indirect) impact on a firm’s economic costs.Footnote 2 However, engagement in CSR can become relevant if firms start considering CSR as a strategic variable that can be used in oligopolistic markets. In fact, shareholders can see CSR engagements as a commitment device for their strategic choices in an oligopolistic framework aimed at maximising their profits by increasing its own market share in a manner similar to the managers’ incentives towards sales the managerial delegation literature analyses. Up to the current stage, a broad and expanding body of literature has disjointedly investigated the impact of CSR activities and network externalities on firms’ market behaviour. This paper addresses the following research questions: (i) Does the presence of unions modify the profit-enhancing role played by the choice of firms’ owners to be socially interested in network industry?; (ii) How does the choice of firms’ owners to become socially interested affect the welfare of workers and consumers and of the overall society?; (iii) Is the choice of CSR levels prior to or after the renewal of wage contracts better for owners (and the other agents)? To answer those questions, we use two three-stage games in which owners can cooperate in the choice regarding the CSR level structure. However, once the level of CSR engagement is fixed, companies compete in the product market. In other words, with regard to the choice of CSR, firms act in a semi-collusive way.Footnote 3 This is an aspect that the industrial organisation literature has broadly investigated in other fields in which firms compete in a dimension, generally price or quantity, because the competition policy prevents companies from colluding (explicitly) in the market for final products and services. Nonetheless, prior to the market stage, firms might collude on other dimensions such as investments on product quality (e.g. Foros et al. 2002), advertising (e.g. Dewenter et al. 2011), and R&D activities (e.g. Brod and Shivakumar 1999), because semi-collusion can turn out to be advantageous for them. We define two games by distinguishing the case in which wage contracts are stipulated prior to/after the decision of whether to engage in CSR.Footnote 4 We show that, when unions set wages prior to owners’ choice of the CSR levels (game A), CSR raises wages and employment, and therefore, workers in CSR-type firms achieve greater welfare. At the same time, the output expansion induced by the social responsibility—to the extent that the intensity of network effect is so great that prices are reduced less than the extent to which quantities are increased—enhances the firms’ profitability despite the induced wages raise. As a consequence, to be a CSR-type firm, increasing the welfare of owners, consumers, and workers, is a Pareto-superior choice. On the other hand, when owners choose the CSR levels prior to the unions’ wage-setting stage (game B), they tend to reduce the CSR level because, as first movers, they can observe that by selecting a high CSR level, they also induce an increase in wages, notably when unions are wage-aggressive. In comparison to the case in which unions set wages at the beginning of the game, this crucial effect on the wage costs side allows firms, on the one hand, to achieve higher profits. However, on the other hand, the CSR levels are always lower in such a case, and the choice to engage in CSR is less likely the more wage-aggressive unions are. Also, in this case, the owners’ engagement in social responsibility raises the welfare of owners, consumers, and workers, which leads again to a Pareto-superior outcome. Moreover, the comparison of the results under the two different timings with respect to the decisions on wages and CSR shows that, on the one hand, wages and profits are always higher, while on the other hand, the welfare of workers, consumers, and thus society as a whole are always lower in game B than in game A, despite the higher profits. This implies that: (i) firm owners should prefer to be a leader of their own unions in determining the sequence of decisions on CSR and wage contracts and (ii) the timing of the decision about CSR relative to that about the wage setting generates an unsolvable conflict of interest with regard to the economic agents’ welfare between the firms’ owners on the one side and consumers, unions (workers), and the overall society, on the other side. In conclusion, the noteworthy finding is that, in a network industry, also under unionisation, and regardless of whether the wage setting occurs prior to or after the choice of the CSR levels, being a CSR-type firm can lead to larger profits and thus higher welfare for their owners/stakeholders. In other words, the findings of this paper clearly indicate that the engagement in consumer-friendly CSR activities can be motivated by the selfish behaviour of the firms’ owners, revealing that the Friedman’s exhortation (that the firm must pursue only the owners’ interests) is satisfied. In the next section, we survey the relevant related literature. Then, in Sect. 3, we introduce the basic game model with unions and the endogenous choice of CSR activities by owners, under the two above-described sequences of moves. For comparative purposes, in Sects. 4 and 5, the results under each sequence of moves are (analytically and numerically) compared to equilibrium outcomes of the standard model without CSR. On the other hand, Sect. 6 compares the outcomes of the models under the two different sequences of moves and derives the main results. The last section sums up our findings and outlines areas for future research.",2

Genovesi, Dragonetti, Beccaria, Filangieri and Gioja all called for economic and legal reforms to remove obstacles to the spread of a new market society, which, in their view, would generate benefits for all (Mandolesi and Santori 2020). Recent literature claimed that such approach to privileges, positions of rent and merit as a justification for inequalities did not disappear from more recent Italian authors’ economic thought, but in some way these ideas have ‘continued to live as a karst river’ (underground river) (Bruni and Zamagni 2015, p. 43). The aim of this paper is to analyse the thought of two distinguished economists of the past century, Federico Caffè (1914–87) and Paolo Sylos Labini (1920–2005), focusing on their economic, cultural and moral critiques of the capitalist society of their times, trying to retrace elements connecting them and the authors mentioned above. In the first section, I provide a general view of the reformist program of Italian civil economists, focusing on their call for overcoming the feudal society and on their vision regarding privileges, virtues and rewards. The second section is dedicated to Federico Caffè, specifically regarding his critique of liberalism and his request for public policies and ideas grounded in the belief that economic science offers hope that ignorance and poverty can be eradicated (Caffè in Acocella and Franzini 1990). The third section is dedicated to Paolo Sylos Labini. Starting from his analysis of the origins of the Mafia in Southern Italy, I will try to retrace his critique of the economic injustices arising from privileges and from the ideology of meritocracy. Finally, I will offer some brief conclusions.",

At the theoretical level, the increase in the number of organizations may result in the growth of the total donations as a consequence of the amplification of the exposure of potential donors to charitable activities, which may have positive impacts on their sensitivity and their willingness to donate (Guo and Brown 2006; Graddy and Wang 2009). In addition, the increase in the number of organizations might be associated with the increase in their variety, both in terms of their types and in terms of their charitable purposes, which may positively affect the coverage of the spectrum of potential donors’ “ideologies” (Rose-Ackerman 1982), leading to an increase in the total amount donated.Footnote 1 Organizations could also be perceived by donors as coordinating to satisfy the needs connected to the provision of social welfare goods and services (Eckel et al. 2020). In this perspective, the number of organizations available for donations may generate in donors the perception of a certain level of need for donations, irrespectively from the charitable purposes of the organizations. If the organizations operate within the same sector, subjects may assume that they coordinate to satisfy a certain demand for social goods and services in that sector. If the same number of organizations operate with different charitable purposes, donors may assume that they coordinate to satisfy the same total need, but articulated in different social sectors. Per-capita collected donations may increase or decrease when the number of organizations increase, depending on the elasticity of donations to the number of organizations which, in turn, is affected by the magnitude of the effects on total donations described above. The existing empirical and experimental evidence on the effect of the number and variety of nonprofit organizations involved in fundraising activities on collected donations, surveyed in the next section, is mixed and may depend on a variety of conditions, such as the type of organization and how donation requests reach potential donors. Our study contributes to this strand of literature by providing an experimental analysis of how total and per-capita donations are affected both by the number of organizations and by their variety in terms of the type of organization and charitable purposes. Our results provide empirical support for a positive effect of the number of organizations on total donations. However, the increase in donations is less than proportional to the increase in the number of organizations that compete for gifts, resulting in a decrease in per-capita collected donations. Moreover, we do not observe any effect of variety on donations, either considering the types of organizations or the charitable purposes. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and highlights the main contribution provided by our paper to the existing literature. Section 3 describes the experimental design and provides some descriptive statistics on the sample of participants in the study. Section 4 illustrates the main theoretical hypotheses and experimental results. Section 5 concludes.",

Akinlo,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The impact of economic freedom on growth and quality of life in an economy has been extensively discussed in the economic development literature (Dollar and Kraay 2002; North 1990; Acemoglu et al. 2004; Acemoglu and Robinson 2008; Naanwab 2018; Belasen and Hafer 2013; Stroup 2007; Gehring 2013; Veenhoven 2000a; Gropper et al. 2011; Verme 2009; Inglehart et al. 2008; Ovaska and Takashima 2006; Graafland 2020a:2020b; Graafland and Noorderhaven 2020; Graafland and Compen 2012 and 2014; Graafland and Lous 2018; Nikoleav 2014; Feldmann 2017). The argument in the literature is that a nation that is passionate about enhancing the quality of life should implement growth-enhancing policies of the rule of law, fiscal discipline, and openness to transnational trade (Dollar and Kraay 2002). These assertions emphasize the role that institutions (i.e., economic or political) play in improving the quality of life. Several channels through which economic freedom impacts quality of life have been noted in the literature. As a matter of example, economic freedom affects income distribution and, in turn, leads to lower income inequality (Perez-Moreno and Angulo-Guerrero 2016). Economic freedom equally helps in promoting the economic growth of many nations (Aixala and Fabro 2009; Cebula 2013; Vega-Gordillo and Álvarez-Arce 2003). The channels through which economic freedom promotes the economic growth include income per capita, investment, growth per capita worker, foreign direct investment, among others (Cebula 2013; Gwartney et al. 2004; Quazi 2007). Similarly, increased economic freedom assists in reducing the barriers that exist in less economically free countries, thereby unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit of the poor (Vargas 2008). Furthermore, economic freedom also impacts the quality of life by (1) improving wellbeing (Graafland 2020b; Belasen and Hafer 2012; Stroup 2007), (2) influencing the happiness level of the people (Veenhoven 2000a; Gropper et al. 2011; Verme 2009; Inglehart et al. 2008; Ovaska and Takashima 2006), (3) affecting human capital investment and development (Naanwab 2018; Graafland 2020a; Feldmann 2017), (4) influencing corporate social responsibility (Graafland and Noorderhaven 2020), and (5) impacting life satisfaction (Graafland and Compen 2012:2014; Graafland and Lous 2018) and affecting the overall quality of life (Nikoleav 2014). The realization of the various benefits from improved economic freedom informed the high premium placed on it in the developed countries of the world and by multinational organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The IMF and World Bank have advocated and imposed policies to improved economic freedom and liberalization in nations, particularly Africa. The Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) introduced by the World Bank and IMF to tackle slow economic development, stagnation, and low quality of life in Africa were some of the significant economic freedom-enhancing policies in the 1980s. According to Chen and Ravallion (2008), the developing world has recorded a modest decline in the population of people living in absolute poverty since the 1980s, at an annual average rate of about 1% point. This development implies that the efforts targeted at improving the quality of life in developing nations have yielded an insignificant result. While Asian countries have recorded a substantial improvement in the quality of life of the citizens, the reverse is the case in Africa. Generally, there is a worsening level and spread of low quality of life in Africa (Chen and Ravallion 2007, 2008; Thorbecke 2013). For instance, a 2018 World Bank report predicted that by 2030, 9 out of 10 people living a low quality of life would live in Africa (World Bank 2018). Moreover, 27 out of the 28 countries with the highest number of people living a low standard of living are in Africa countries. Similarly, the Brookings Institution declared Nigeria as the country that has the highest number of people living a low quality of life (Kimenyi et al. 2014). Many studies in the literature have examined the relationship between some economic freedom policies and quality of life (Perez-Moreno and Angulo-Guerrero 2016; Nikoleav 2014; Graafland and Lous 2018; Hassan et al. 2003; Feldmann 2017; Gwartney and Connors 2010; Graafland and Noorderhaven 2020; Gropper et al. 2011; Verme 2009; Inglehart et al. 2008; Kaur 2007; Islam 1996; Islam Md. 2018; Ahmad 2017). However, many of these previous studies only used a single measure of the quality of life in their analysis (Hassan et al. 2003; Kaur 2007; Islam 1996; Islam Md. 2018; Ahmad 2017). Studies of Graafland and Compen 2012, 2014; Graafland and Lous 2018 used an index of life satisfaction in studying the impact of economic freedom on quality of life. Although these studies used an index computed from multiple indicators, the life satisfaction data used could be influenced by emotions, and therefore, highly subjective. Similarly, Nikoleav 2014 measured the quality of life by the wellbeing index of “Your Better Life” index of the OECD, which also combined both subjective and objective indicators. For this study, however, we use four objective measures of quality of life, namely per capita income, consumption per capita, life expectancy, and school enrolment. The four indicators cover four areas of quality of life: economic wellbeing, the standard of living, longevity, and human capital development. Also, a composite index of quality of life is generated using principal component analysis. No known study, particularly in Africa, has examined the economic freedom–quality of life nexus taking cognizance the multidimensional nature of quality of life. Also, most of the existing studies used the level of economic freedom as their measure of economic freedom. But few recent studies have shown that changes in the economic index value are more robust than the levels of the index in explaining cross-country growth variations (Heckelman and Knack 2009; Dawson 1998; Gwartney et al. 1999; de Haan and Sturm 2000). Taking this into consideration, our study used both economic freedom at levels and changes on economic freedom to explain whether fluctuations and increase/decrease in economic freedom value affect the quality of life differently. The paper is organized as follows: Sect.2 provides an overview of economic freedom and quality of life in Africa. Section 3 contains a brief review of the empirical literature. Section 4 discusses the methodology and data issues. This is followed by the empirical analysis in Sect. 5. The last section concludes the paper.",8
68,3,International Review of Economics,19 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-021-00375-z,Hierarchy and the size of a firm,September 2021,Tobias Hiller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, we apply the \({\text {wH}}^{{\text {My}}}\) value (weighted hierarchy value based on the Myerson value) introduced by Casajus et al. (2009) and Hiller (2014) to the problem of optimal size of the firm. Our approach is similar to the work done by van den Brink and Ruys (2008) using a value of cooperative game theory that takes hierarchies in firms into account. As in van den Brink and Ruys (2008), we analyze the influence of production technology on the size of the firm. To analyze firms within the framework of cooperative game theory, it is necessary to model hierarchies within this framework. One approach was presented by Kalai and Samet (1987). They used ordered partitions and weights to model hierarchies. Winter (1989) used a sequence of bargaining components in the sense of Owen (1977) to model hierarchies. Both approaches model levels in the sense of Lazear and Rosen (1981), Carmichael (1983) and Prendergast (1993). Another approach involves antimatroid games (Algaba et al. 2003, 2004a, b). Unfortunately, these approaches are unable to model a manager-subordinate structure. For hierarchies in firms, this structure is a main characteristic (Radner 1992; Meagher 2001). Another approach in cooperative game theory that is used to model hierarchies applies an undirected graph/network on the set of players (Myerson 1977; Borm et al. 1992; Herings et al. 2008). However, the problem with this approach is that all players are symmetrical in the graph; there are no superiors and subordinates. In van den Brink (2008) a directed graph/permission structure on the set of players is used to analyze the effects of hierarchies on players’ payoffs or to the wages of employees respectively. The basic idea of permission values is that a player/employee needs approval from all predecessors (Gilles et al. 1992; van den Brink and Gilles 1996). In van den Brink and Ruys (2008) the approach is used to determine the organizational structure of the firm by considering production technology. In van den Brink (2008) single dominance relationships, i.e., the influence of a predecessor on direct successors, are equally strong. It is, however, a plausible assumption that the relations among the players may have different levels of strength (e.g., different leadership styles could be modelled by weights). Using this idea to enhance the modelling of hierarchies, Casajus et al. (2009) introduced the \({\text {wH}}^{{\text {Sh}}}\) value (a weighted hierarchy value based on the Shapley value). In this approach a weighted directed graph is used to model hierarchies. Two elements form the basis of the \({\text {wH}}^{{\text {Sh}}}\) value. First, in order to create the output, all players work symmetrically together. In this step, the output is distributed to the players according to the Shapley value (Shapley 1953). In a second step, the weighted hierarchy reallocates a certain fraction of these payoffs. The weighted hierarchy has only allocational effects.Footnote 1 In Hiller (2014), the \({\text {wH}}^{{\text {Sh}}}\) value has been generalized for games with a cooperation structure/graph.Footnote 2 This approach takes account of the coordinating role in the distribution of output; the players do not work symmetrically together (first step). The player who coordinates the remaining players will be rewarded if there is a cooperative win. Again, in the second step of calculating the payoffs, the weighted hierarchy reallocates a certain fraction of the payoffs that players obtain in the first step. This paper applies the \({\text {wH}}^{{\text {My}}}\) value to analyze the question of optimal size of the firm. Our analysis is analogous to van den Brink and Ruys (2008). One result is that an increase of production technology increases the size of the firm. With respect to the theory of the firm, our approach could be a technical contribution. Other technical approaches with interesting insights for an optimal hierarchy are by Williamson (1967), Calvo and Wellisz (1978; 1979), Rosen (1982), Keren and Levhari (1979; 1989), Meagher and van Zandt (1998) and Meagher et al. (2003) for example. The remainder of our article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present some preliminaries. Section 3 provides results on the size of the firm. Section 4 concludes and outlines further research.",
68,4,International Review of Economics,02 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-021-00376-y,The ethics of care and the tragedy of the commons,December 2021,Vicente Moreno-Casas,Philipp Bagus,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The ethics of care is an approach to moral issues based on the feminist idea of care. In one of the most comprehensive works written on the ethics of care, Held (2006, 10) emphasizes that the ethics of care is focused on the “moral salience of attending to and meeting the needs of the particular others for whom we take responsibility.” Proponents of an ethics of care regard emotions such as empathy, sympathy, and sensitivity as essential for moral guidance and reject abstract reasoning as the only way to deal with a moral problem. The approach is meant to improve relationships within certain domains, such as the family or networks of friends, in which emotions are the primary moral guide. Since the emergence of the ethics of care in the 1980s, it has been continually compared with the ethics of justice. Gilligan (1982), who first used the term “the ethics of care,” expounded the idea of an ethic of care in contrast to the idea of an ethic of justice. So did other renowned authors such as Noddings (1984), Tronto (1993), Ruddick (1995), and Held (2006). In fact, the ethics of care appeared to be an alternative moral approach to dominant branches of ethics such as utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, and virtue ethics. According to care ethicists, the ethics of justice, which is concerned with the rational, self-interested, and autonomous individual who has to observe universal, impersonal, impartial, and abstract moral principles, cannot provide complete guidance for human behavior. Are the members of a family guided continually by such principles? Are not many decisions personal, partial, and based on emotions? The ethics of care responds to these questions by supporting care as a practice and as a value (Held 2006)—that is, not only to describe specific actions that are not guided by universal and abstract rules but also to advocate care as a moral goal that acknowledges responsiveness, sensitivity, empathy, cooperation, trust, actions directed by emotions, and relatedness. The contrast between the ethics of care and the ethics of justice is summed up by Held (2006): An ethic of justice focuses on questions of fairness, equality, individual rights, abstract principles, and the consistent application of them. An ethic of care focuses on attentiveness, trust, responsiveness to need, narrative nuance, and cultivating caring relations. . . . Whereas justice protects equality and freedom, care fosters social bonds and cooperation (15). Care valued relationships between persons and empathetic understanding; justice valued rational action in accord with abstract principles (62). However, the two ethical approaches are not incompatible. Many ethicists have written on the relationship between them. Some prioritize care over justice (Held 2006)–some even to the point of thinking care should replace justice as the central concept of morality (Noddings 1984)–and others vice versa (Barry 1995). A common thread is that care and justice should complement each other. The question, then, is to delimit concrete domains for the application of each ethic and to describe the interaction of these ethics. Noddings (1984) and others, in early work on the subject, posit that the ethics of care should be confined to the private sphere, whereas the ethics of justice should prevail in public realm. Tronto (1993) proposes to expand the realm of the ethics of care to the political domain and thus end the private/public dichotomy that characterizes some versions of the ethics of justice, a proposal that was later seconded by other authors such as Bubeck (1995) and Kittay (1999). Held (2006, 69), however, states: “We need different moral approaches for different domains.” She thinks that justice should be a principal value in the field of law, whereas care should be the primary value in the sphere of the family. However, an ethic of care may be suitable in public contexts as well. In fact, Held (2006) affirms that, provided that people are interdependent, the whole social fabric is sustained on care. From this view of the ethics of care a vast array of applications to diverse fields of study have been developed: sociology (England 2005), business ethics (Liedtka 1996; Solomon 1998; White 1992), philosophy (Held 2006; Pulcini 2013), political science (Tronto 1993), social psychology (Paillé et al. 2016) or even neuroscience (Colombo 2014). Among these fields is economics as well. Contrary to traditional views on economics from the perspective of justice, some authors have introduced new analyses from the perspective of care (Nelson 2011; Nelson and England 2002; van Staveren 2005, 2013). In this paper, we develop an application of the ethics of care to situations in which property rights are not well defined or, despite being well defined, are not enforced in practice, which results in the tragedy of the commons. We reckon that putting into practice the values advocated by the care ethicists can solve the economic problems of the tragedy of the commons. In order to accomplish our task, we first present a new interpretation of the interaction between the ethics of justice and the ethics of care grounded in the works of Friedrich A. Hayek and his conception of the limitations of knowledge. Secondly, we argue that an ethic of care can solve the problem of the tragedy of the commons. Finally, we provide two illustrations of the problem—fractional-reserve banking and environmental tragedies—and discuss how the ethics of care can cope with these two problems and lead to a beneficial outcome.",
68,4,International Review of Economics,22 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-021-00377-x,Participation in socio-cultural activities and subjective well-being of natives and migrants: evidence from Germany and the UK,December 2021,Eleftherios Giovanis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In recent decades, migration has become one of the world’s most prevalent phenomenon, and in many developed countries immigrants account for more than 10 percent of the population (United Nations, 2017). Consistently with the importance of this phenomenon, many academic studies and political debates have focused on the determinants of immigrants’ integration and inclusion in the host communities across several dimensions. The economic integration of migrants has been explored in a large body of the literature (e.g. Chiswick, 1978; Borjas, 1995; Danzer and Ulku, 2008). Many studies have explored the socio-cultural dimensions, such as the perceived national and ethnic identity of the immigrants, and the assimilation or socialization trajectories of cultural values and norms (Dustmann, 1996; Diehl and Schnell, from earlier studies, the first; De Palo et al., 2007; Bisin et al., 2008). The cultural, economic and sociological literature has extensively explored the determinants of participation in socio-cultural activities (Seaman, 2006; Ateca-Amestoy, 2008). Earlier studies have also considered the impact of ethnicity on cultural participation, particularly in multicultural societies, such as Israel, USA and the Netherlands, and they have focused on the differences in cultural participation between first and second-generation immigrants (Van Wel et al., 2006; Novak-Leonard, 2015). According to the UNESCO’s definition that can be found in its cultural statistics handbook, cultural participation can be defined as attendance and participation in any activity that increases individuals’ cultural and informational capacity and capital that helps them to establish their own identity and allows them to express themselves (UNESCO, 2012 p. 51). Such activities may take various forms, both active, such as performing in a theatrical play, writing music or creating any kind of art; and passive activities, such as attending a sports event, cinema or a concert. It is important to explore the relationship between participation in socio-cultural activities and SWB, as well-being can be a key driver of human capital, leading to improvement in productivity, and enhancing development. Nevertheless, the majority of earlier studies have mainly explored socio-economic, demographic and institutional outcomes as measures of integration, such as citizenship rights, religion, marriage and fertility choices, language, income and employment (Danzer and Ulku, 2008; Dustmann et al., 2012; Furtado and Trejo, 2013; Adsera and Ferrer, 2014; Beek and Fleischmann, 2019; Geurts and Lubbers, 2019). The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between participation in socio-cultural activities and the subjective well-being (SWB) of natives and immigrants in Germany and the UK. Socio-cultural activities are expressed or operationalized by attendance at sports events, art galleries, theatre, cinema, concerts of classical, jazz or pop music, visiting relatives, going to restaurants, and visiting historical museums and sites among others. Based on the data availability and the information recorded in the surveys we employ, we will consider both active and passive participation. SWB measures include life satisfaction, happiness and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Furthermore, we will explore not only the first-generation immigrants but also the second-generation, who are born in the host country to both migrant parents, and the 2.5 generation those who are born in the host country and one of their parents is immigrant. The justification of exploring Germany and the UK relies on the data availability. In particular, the surveys conducted in these countries are panel, allowing us to follow the same individual across a period of time. Second, the surveys record a rich information about participation in cultural activities, which is not available in the panel surveys of other countries. Third, there are very few panel surveys that record this information across different generations of immigrants, as we aim to explore in this study. Fourth, both countries have received a large number of immigrants from around the globe. Fifth, due to space restrictions, we limit our analysis to Germany and the UK; however, future studies may apply similar models to investigate the role of participation in socio-cultural activities in the SWB of natives and various generations of immigrants in other countries. The remaining sections are organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we discuss the conceptual framework and the earlier literature on the socio-cultural participation of natives and migrants. In Sect. 3, we present the methodology applied and we describe the data employed in the empirical work. In Sect. 4, we report the main findings, and in Sect. 5 we discuss the main concluding remarks.",7

Available data indicate in recent times (from 1998 to 2013) a surprising increase in mortality rates for all causes driven by a surge in mortality for suicides, opioid overdoses and alcohol related liver mortality for white non-Hispanics in the US, in spite of the marked decline in mortality in other US population groups and in almost all the other high-income countries. The effect is concentrated in the middle age (45–54) cohort and has led to a decline in life expectancy at birth in spite of the ongoing medical progress. A tentative explanation proposed by Case and Deaton (2015a, b) is a disadvantage progressively growing from one age cohort to the next for the low educated in terms of access to well paid jobs in the labour market, marriage, child outcomes and health. As emphasized by Deaton (2015), this disadvantage produces failure to keep up with expectations in material and social outcomes regarded (Durkheim, 1897) as a crucial driver of human despair. Ruhm (2018) discusses the identification of the causality link beyond the despair death evidence and observes that, in the Deaton and Case (2015) interpretation, social and economic conditions lead to drug abuse and death, while a reverse causality nexus from drug abuse to worsened social and economic conditions cannot be excluded. If this is the case, the role of social and economic conditions on despair deaths would be overstated. The conclusion of Ruhm (2018) is more directed towards the reverse causality nexus since changes in economic conditions account for less than one-tenth of the rise in drug and opioid-involved mortality rates. Along this line a group of authors (Roux 2017; Ruhm 2019; Masters et al. 2018) argue that highly addictive new drugs have played per se an important role. Dow et al. (2019) seem, however, to find on the contrary evidence for causality going from economic conditions to despair deaths. They wonder whether economic policies can address the problem and find that a rise in minimum wage and earned income tax credit could reduce non-drug related suicides. The main contributions mentioned above are much less in conflict with each other than they may seem to be. Case and Deaton (2015a, b) acknowledge that economic factors are not the only drivers of the phenomenon and that social factors matter, consistently with what argued and found by Ruhm (2018). The same concentration of the phenomenon on white non-Hispanics is a paradox and implies that poor economic conditions cannot be the only rationale explaining the phenomenon. Why black and Hispanics groups (belonging to the same low income-low education cohorts) do not display the same mortality dynamics? And why is Europe not affected in the same way by the phenomenon as shown by the 2019 report of the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addition (EMCDDA 2019) and Alho et al. (2020)? The difference is in part related to European policies of much more severe restrictions on opioid prescriptions and on higher reliance on treatments that combine medications for opioid-use disorder (MOUD) with psychosocial interventions (EMCDDA 2019). Higher effectiveness in actions to contrast the phenomenon needs, however, to be accompanied by policies of prevention based on empirical analyses of factors leading to addiction as those developed in our paper. The despair death stylized facts (and paradox) suggest that it would be of great interest for the subjective wellbeing literature to look at its object of study from a different angle. Instead of solely focusing on the drivers of life satisfaction using values of cognitive, affective or eudaimonic wellbeing in ascending order,Footnote 2 a specific investigation on the drivers that make individuals precipitate to states of depression (where the risk of despair death is much higher) would help us understand causes and device policies to prevent despair deaths. This investigation has relevant consequences and can provide useful insights for social and economic policies. As is well known depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the world. Depression has severe economic consequences in terms of loss of productivity and health expenditure. Evans-Lacko and Knapp (2016) analyse the cost of workplace depression in terms of absenteeism and pre-senteeism in eight countries and find that it accounts for a ratio between 0.1 and 4.9 percent of country GDP. Becchetti et al. (2019) find that individuals declaring that their life has poor sense have higher mortality rates in the following years. There are several different things that can cause depression ranging from biological to environmental factors. The goal of our paper is to provide a contribution in this direction by analysing drivers of high states of depression for respondents to the European Social Survey with the goal of providing useful insights for preventing the phenomenon of the US despair death crisis in Europe. There is obviously a trade-off in the choice of our dependent variable. On the one side, depression can hopefully not lead to suicide or other causes of despair death. On the other side it allows us to find a larger number of positive cases strongly correlated with that negative outcome and allows us to exploit the richness of survey data where we have a wide array of sociodemographic variables together with expression of tastes and values. Our findings confirm that depression is correlated with a mix of economic and non-economic factors. If income and monetary factors play an important role, non-economic factors such as education, gender and failure and shocks from relational life are as well all important components accounting for around 85% of the explained variability of depression in our sample. These results are consistent with evidence from the life satisfaction literature where relational goods and non-monetary factors play an important role on subjective wellbeing.",2

In his view, the long-term objective of the economy is to increase the standard of living of the entire population, with a special care for the more vulnerable economic actors (Lonergan 1998). While understanding economic activities of individuals as embedded within the social, cultural and institutional conditions of a given community, Lonergan shares with other economists the conviction that innovations play a key role in explaining economic growth and social wellbeing. Through innovations, according to Lonergan, entirely new economic sectors that did not previously exist come into being (Schumpeter 1939). However, for Lonergan, an economic behavior at the microeconomic level of the firm based on the continuous maximization of short-term profits may yield a vicious cycle and convert economic expansions into recessions and depressions. Lonergan’s analysis converges with the concerns of current scholars worried about social wellbeing and the place of people within economic processes (Lonergan 1988, 1998; Pirson 2014; Dierksmeier 2015; Porter and Kramer 2011; DeNeeve 2009; Couret Branco 2016). Since Lonergan’s ideas and theories have not been applied yet to any regional economy as far as we know, this paper is the first attempt to apply Lonergan’s understanding of economic activity to a specific case. The objective of this paper is to apply Lonergan’s account of social and economic development to analyze the transformations that took place in the Basque Country during the period 1980–1993, an interval through which this territory underwent a profound transformation. During these years, democracy was consolidated in Spain, the Basque Country recovered its political, economic, and fiscal autonomy within Spain, the Basque economy underwent an intense industrial restructuring, the Basque educational system experienced a profound transformation, and the standard of living rose considerably. The authors of this article believe that speed of these profound changes, as well as the size and scope of the region’s economy and population, make the Basque Country an excellent case study for applying Bernard Lonergan’s analysis. The paper structure is as follows; after this first introductory section, the second section presents the main features of Lonergan’s analysis of economic and social development; the third section describes the Basque socioeconomic performance between 1980 and 1993; the fourth section identifies features of the Basque case which a Lonergan-inspired account would especially highlight. Finally, main ideas and further questions are discussed in the concluding section.",1

Mishra,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"In September 2015, India being a member state of United Nations (UN) committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The 2030 agenda for SDGs has 17 goals and 169 targets to achieve peace and prosperity for people and the planet in a global partnership (UN, 2015). The SDGs are more universal and inclusive compared to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) introduced in 2000. Since 2001, such universal goals have acquired a new salience in development thinking. Although goals related to public health, can hasten advancement towards complex development goals (McArthur and Rasmussen 2018), attaining the SDGs will require deep, structural changes across all sectors in society. Moreover, the time bound characteristics of SDGs call for immediate action to improve health and education, reduce inequality, and accelerate economic growth. Such attempts need policy integration across sectors and active participation of governments as well as non– government actors in adopting policy priorities and ensure their effective implementation. This requires proactive measures on ground and periodic monitoring of targets in relation to the 17 SDGs to be realized within the stipulated period. As regard one of the potential strategies, investment in human capital through optimal spending in the human priority sectors (HPS) is considered to serve as a blue print for achieving the SDGs. It is believed that priority sectors deserve sufficient public spending in a sustained manner as spending in these sectors is considered as one of the drivers to augment human development and capabilities (Chakraborty 2003; Hong and Ahmed 2009). Besides, investing in people’s welfare is well recognized as a means to achieve economic as well as social development (Baldacci et al. 2004; Bloom and Canning 2003). So, to achieve the goals, India needs to spend on those sectors which are of utmost priority in addressing human development such as six HPS defined by Ramakumar (2008)Footnote 1 namely Education, Health, Nutrition, Family Welfare, Water Sanitation and Rural Development. However, this ideal prescription has to be strategically implemented in consideration of a focus on the marginalized and deprived on one hand and the resource constraint on the other. Such strategies might involve recognition of a demographic account conveying the size of the under– privileged and vulnerable in allocation of resources to obtain the optimum results. Given the stipulation of time and ideals of inclusion, it is rather pertinent to recognize the need for targeting the underprivileged towards attaining the SDGs. Failures in compliance with MDGs led to formulation of SDGs with a clear roadmap of monitoring indicators and prioritizing sectors of intervention. There is considerable amount of introspection into the failures of MDGs in the literature on which the renewed strategies for compliance with SDGs are made. Such strategies highlighted inter– sectoral coordination and optimization of limited resources in prioritization of intervention. Although recognition of HPS forms the fundamentals of the said strategy, there is no systematic attempt as yet in terms of its responsiveness in terms of the MDGs and population composition. Therefore, this exercise proposes to examine the pattern and responsiveness of the HPS spending of Indian states in terms of population demography. Thus, it derives a fresh understanding of whether the size of HPS expenditure of the Indian states has been done in accordance with demographic characteristics or not. The paper is arranged as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the literature gap and rationale of the study. In Sect. 3, we elaborate the materials and methodology used for the analysis. Section 4 presents the results and Sect. 6 concludes.",

The share of international migrants in 2019 was the highest in Oceania, North America, and Europe, with 21, 16, and 11% of the total population, respectively (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2019). According to the report “Statistics on Foreign Nationals Residing in Japan” by Japan’s Ministry of Justice (2020), the number of foreign residents in Japan rose to 2,829,416 individuals as of the end of June 2019, from a mere 850,612 individuals at the end of December 1985, a 232.6% increase. These data imply that developed countries, especially Japan, with its declining birthrate and rapidly aging society, have accepted an increasing number of immigrants. As Card (2001), Borjas (2003), and Dustmann et al. (2017) show, immigration has negative effects on the host country’s employment rate. Kemnitz (2003) also models the complementary relationship between unskilled and skilled labor, finding that admitting unskilled immigrants raises the unemployment rate. However, while Japan has accepted an increasing number of immigrants, the average annual unemployment rate in Japan in 2019 was 2.2%, which is lower than the 2.7% unemployment rate in 1985, implying that immigrants might have no effect on the native unemployment rate.Footnote 1 Moreover, recent studies (Basten and Siegenthaler 2019; Esposito et al. 2020; Furlanetto and Robstad 2019) show positive effects of immigration on native citizen employment rates. Hence, immigration might not only revitalize the employment rate of the host country but also improve employment opportunities. These positive results, including some from a Japanese case, cannot be explained by the standard model described in Edo (2019), which is a framework for the effects of immigration in host countries based on the intensity of the capital–labor ratio from short- and long-term perspectives.Footnote 2 Thus, we should consider additional structural factors that might improve employment opportunities for the native population. In this study, we explore the structural indirect effects of accepting immigrants from the perspective of education. The educational perspective includes opportunities for the native population to teach immigrants language, culture, and the like, which are essential for them to work and live in the host country. While such educational opportunities improve the employment rate, they also burden the native population with financing workers’ wages as educators. These reinforced processes are underway, especially in Japan, which is experiencing a declining fertility rate and a sharp increase in the proportion of older adults. The revised law—namely, the “Act on Amending the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act and the Ministry of Justice Establishment Law”—was passed on December 8, 2018. This law establishes the new residential statuses of Special Skilled Worker (1) and Special Skilled Worker (2) in addition to the existing status of Trainees and Technical Interns, as well as the Immigration Services Agency.Footnote 3 To promote the acceptance of immigrants, acts such as the “Comprehensive Measures for Acceptance and Coexistence of Foreign Nationals” (CMA) were promulgated and came into force in 2019. The acceptance of immigrants with the status of Special Skilled Worker (1) has not proceeded as smoothly as scheduled, but the number of immigrants with this status gradually increased from 3,632 in 2019 to 42,653 at the end of August 2020.Footnote 4 An increased number of immigrants also implies an increase in the burden of education. The total budget related to the CMA was approximately 61 billion yen in 2018, 193.4 billion yen in 2019, and 350.2 billion yen in 2020. After the Immigration Control Act was revised in 2018, Japan finally began to enhance educational support for the children of foreign residents, which could be a burden for the native population. However, this might not be preferable to the native population, and policymakers should also consider the educational costs of immigration. Kojima (2016), however, reports that approximately 10% of elementary and junior high school students do not attend school because of the difficulty children and their parents have with learning Japanese.Footnote 5 Furthermore, 92.9% of immigrant junior high school students did not attend high school, though the average dropout rate of junior high school students in Japan was only 4.2% in 2020.Footnote 6 Kojima (2016) also explains how important it is for the education sector to improve language acquisition support in Japan. This implies that the public sector should increase education support to help the children of immigrants continue schooling and assimilate, such as by increasing the number of educators supporting these children. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided to increase the minimum number of teachers providing support as Japanese language teaching assistants to one teacher per 18 children in 2026 (Nikkei 2020). This suggests a shift in native workers from the production sector to the education sector—a transition that could pose an additional financial burden, which might decrease the number of children the native population will bear. Thus, the effects of immigration should be considered in the endogenous fertility rate model. Regarding the effects of immigration on education, Speciale (2012), for example, estimates that increases in the immigrant population have a small negative effect on public education expenditures in the EU-15 countries. In contrast, Mavisakalyan (2011) employs a gravity model and demonstrates that an increase in the proportion of immigrants raises private school enrollment across countries, thereby leading to a decrease in the share of public education spending. Other studies indicate a positive net effect of immigration on the high school completion and college enrollment of natives in the USA (Hunt 2017; Jackson 2015). These studies examine the effects of immigration from an educational perspective but do not consider the structural labor transition by examining the education sector through a theoretical lens. Albornoz et al. (2018a, b, c) consider educational structures in which student performance interacts with parental and teacher investments and school system resources and find a positive relationship between parental immigration costs and children’s academic achievements. They do not, however, consider the burden of schooling, such as financing the wages of educators, as well as the decrease in the labor force caused by an additional increase in the number of educators as a result of immigration. After incorporating the abovementioned features into the model, we analyze whether immigration improves the welfare of the native population. Considering the educational perspective of immigration highlights another unclear aspect of immigration, thereby contributing to the economic dimension of global immigration debates. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sects. 2 and 3 present the model and welfare analysis, Sect. 4 presents the discussion of the findings, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",

Investigations considering subjective factors are rarer, although, as studies from economics and more frequently from the wider social sciences in general show, these factors are also very important for individual well-being and life satisfaction. The well-known study of Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998), for example, demonstrated that much of the loss of life satisfaction from entering unemployment was non-pecuniary, and some of these non-pecuniary factors were subjective (for example self-esteem, feelings of loneliness and a lack of purpose). For other studies of subjective factors and well-being see Baumeister et al. (2003) and Ho et al. (2010). The meaning of happiness itself may be subject to different subjective feelings. Over the lifecycle, Mogilner et al. (2011) find differing meanings for happiness, notably excitement for young people, and a sense of peace for the not so young. In short, the inclusion of, or controlling for, subjective states and factors may even enhance collective understanding of how objective factors are related to well-being. This study is an investigation of a subjective factor: the association of what individuals think about the future—whether they are optimistic or pessimistic—and their life satisfaction now. Using nationally representative German panel data, evidence is presented that people who are pessimistic about the future, compared with people who are quite optimistic, are much less satisfied with life. Conversely, there is a life satisfaction premium associated with feeling optimistic about the future compared to being merely quite optimistic. Clearly, the thoughts that an individual has about the future are important for current life satisfaction; moreover, including a measure of an individual’s thoughts about the future substantially increases the explanatory power of well-being models. This empirical investigation uses four methods to establish this result: ordinary least squares (OLS); fixed effects (FE); System General Method of Moments; and FE following the entropy balancing procedure. All four methods point to the same result: a substantial relationship between what individuals think about the future and their satisfaction with their life. In finding this result, this investigation confirms and extends previous similar findings. For example, Becchetti et al. (2013) investigate life satisfaction via eleven sub-components and find that answers to the question “How often do you look forward to another day?” are an important contributor to an understanding of well-being. Senik (2008) uses Russian Panel data to link life satisfaction to an individual’s expectations about whether they and their family will live better in the next twelve months. These results suggest that individuals’ thoughts about the future should be more widely considered in well-being investigations than they are now; the resulting increase in explanatory power over “standard” well-being equations can approach 40%. Such thoughts are important determinants of current well-being and, in terms of size, of larger effect than unemployment which, as many studies show (including this one), is a major negative influence on well-being. Other research within economics has acknowledged the possibility that the thoughts and feelings an individual has about the future may have an impact on current well-being. Haucap and Heimeshoff (2014) investigate the causal effect of studying economics on well-being and find that perceived good future job prospects (which they suggest could also be a proxy for future income) are positively associated with student life satisfaction scores. Frijters et al. (2012) use a Chinese household cross section survey and show evidence that optimistic expectations are among the most important explanatory variables for general happiness. Using a wave of the SOEP, Grözinger and Matiaske (2004) investigate, in part, the impact of regional unemployment on overall life satisfaction. They argue that the greater regional unemployment is, the greater the fear about future unemployment, and thus the lower individual life satisfaction is. One study links the future and the present via climate change, with expectations about climate change demonstrated to have an impact on current well-being. The authors, Osberghaus and Kühling (2016), provide robust evidence that worsening expectations about future climate change negatively affect well-being, though the size of the effect is not large. A literature review about optimism provides a summary of the main findings from psychology, making positive links with it and subjective well-being, better health and business and career success while demonstrating that optimism is a nuanced concept (Forgeard and Seligman 2012). Similarly, Kleiman et al. (2017) link optimism, in part, to overconfidence and a sense of invulnerability. Generally, optimism seems to have been studied more than pessimism. A simple Google Scholar search supports this claim, with optimism resulting in over three times as many hits as pessimism. This might be slightly unfortunate: the results below suggest a greater impact on individual well-being of pessimism than optimism.Footnote 1 A recent study using the same data that this study uses finds that pessimism may better promote future physical health outcomes which may, in turn, promote well-being then, if not current well-being (Lang et al. 2013). Rather than discuss the concepts of optimism and pessimism, this empirical investigation uses many waves of a nationally representative panel dataset to investigate the association of life satisfaction with whether individuals are optimistic or pessimistic about the future. As a largely empirical study, the contribution to knowledge comes in the form of more empirical evidence, using more sophisticated methods than previously used to investigate optimism and pessimism. In addition, given the data and the sophistication of the methods used, it has also been possible to control for some future changes in an individual’s life that they may be expecting and thus may influence current optimism and pessimism. In summary, this investigation takes advantage of the longitudinal nature of the data, and the rich socio-economic information it contains, and employs different estimation techniques each with advantages. These advantages are discussed more in the next two sections, but as a brief summary the estimates control for some potentially important factors (all methods), account for individual unobserved heterogeneity (all methods apart from OLS), account for the potential endogeneity of optimism and pessimism with life satisfaction (System General Method of Moments), and employ a statistical procedure to generate substantial overlap between the optimistic and pessimistic with respect to observable control values (entropy balancing). The rest of this empirical investigation is organised as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data and methods used; the results are presented in two subsections within Sect. 3, which also discusses a variety of robustness tests; a discussion of the results and their implications is found in Sect. 4, which includes limitations of the investigation and suggestions for future research; and Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Most of the economic literature analyzing the labor market effects of digitalization focuses on the number of jobs that new technologies replace (e.g., Degryse 2016; Frey and Osborne 2017; Arntz et al. 2020). Yet relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of ICT adoption on jobs not replaced by digitalization, with only limited evidence on the mechanisms through which digitalization affects workers’ job satisfaction. However, firms’ ability to assess the way in which digitalization affects job satisfaction is crucial, because understanding through which channels digitalization affects workers’ job satisfaction might help them better evaluate the introduction of new technologies. Likewise, workers’ knowing how digitalization will affect their job satisfaction might help them to assess the consequences of increasingly diffuse work practices (e.g., home offices). Theoretically, digitalization can affect workers’ job satisfaction either positively (e.g., by decreasing the percentage of repetitive tasks and increasing that of interesting ones) or negatively (e.g., by increasing the level of stress or decreasing work-life balance). A growing body of literature at the intersection of economics and psychology suggests an overall positive effect of digitalization on workers’ job satisfaction and well-being (e.g., McMurtrey et al. 2002; Salanova et al. 2004; Golden and Veiga 2005; Day et al. 2010; Limbu et al. 2014). However, no study looking at how digitalization might affect job satisfaction has yet examined more than one channel through which that effect might operate. For example, Moqbel et al. (2013) highlight the role of social networks in increasing workers’ job satisfaction, while Martin and Omrani (2015) show that information technology use positively affects job satisfaction due to an increase in labor productivity. Thus far, no paper systematically identifies and assesses the multiple channels through which digitalization affects job satisfaction. This paper investigates ten channels through which digitalization may affect job satisfaction simultaneously. In all channels, digitalization affects job satisfaction by first changing some characteristic of the job itself, and then that change impacts the worker’s job satisfaction. Therefore, all of the channels through which digitalization might affect job satisfaction are changes in job characteristics caused by digitalization. Based on the theoretical framework of Castellacci and Tveito (2018), we identify ten channels through which digitalization affects job satisfaction. Specifically, we expect that digitalization decreases job satisfaction by increasing time pressure at work, by increasing the fear of losing one’s job, by deteriorating work-life balance, and by smoothing the transition between working hours and leisure time. Conversely, we expect that digitalization increases job satisfaction by making work more interesting, by reducing the proportion of repetitive tasks, by increasing productivity, and by increasing autonomy at work. Furthermore, we expect that digitalization also increases job satisfaction by making forms of working more flexible and by simplifying interactions with colleagues and superiors. We empirically evaluate the relative importance of the ten channels by using a survey conducted among part-time students and graduates of professional education and training (PET) colleges in Switzerland in 2019. Beyond general information on workers, our survey contains specific questions on digital transformation in the workplace, including asking respondents to evaluate statements about the effects of digitalization on different job characteristics and to self-assess the effect of digitalization on their job satisfaction. Respondents relate digitalization to the use of ICT, as well as the use of data and software in business processes. Having information on both the total effect of digitalization on job satisfaction and the effect of digitalization on single job characteristics allows us to assess the relative importance of the channels through which digitalization affects job satisfaction. Our results suggest that digitalization is positively associated with worker’s job satisfaction of PET graduates through the following channels: increase in work productivity, more interesting work, simpler interactions with coworkers and supervisors, grater workers’ autonomy, and flexible forms of work are positively associated with workers’ job satisfaction. Furthermore, our results suggest that an increase in time pressure derived by digitalization has only a moderate negative effect on job satisfaction. However, we find that the worsening work-life balance derived by digitalization but not by smoothing the transition between working hours and leisure time negatively affects job satisfaction. Finally, our estimates provide no evidence the reduction of repetitive tasks caused by digitalization has an effect on workers’ job satisfaction. Although the widespread notions that the fear of losing one’s job to digitalization negatively affects job satisfaction is confirmed, it remains small in magnitude in our sample. Furthermore, heterogeneity analyses on subset of workers suggest that the worsening of the work-life balance is more relevant for men, for workers aged more than 35 years (roughly the average age in our sample), for workers with an executive position, and for workers whose field of study is technology-related. For the interestingness of work, we find a larger effect for males and for workers older than 35. In contrast, the effect that digitalization has on job satisfaction through an increase in autonomy is lower for women, for young workers, and for workers who did not study in technology-related fields. In terms of productivity, we find that digitalization is more beneficial for women, for older workers, for workers without an executive position, and for workers who did not study in technology-related fields. Finally, the positive effect that digitalization has on job satisfaction by simplifying interactions with colleagues and superiors is larger for non-executive workers than for executives. This paper empirically contributes to the current debate on the impact of digitalization on job satisfaction. Concretely, we provide first evidence on the relative importance that these channels have in explaining the effect of digitalization on workers’ job satisfaction. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and describes the ten channels. Section 3 explains the estimation strategy, and Sect. 4 describes the data set. Section 5 presents the results and discusses the heterogeneity across workers. Section 6 concludes and discusses implications for future research.",4

Bennet et al. (2017) showed that founder CEOs are systematically overconfident, whereas other top-executives are underconfident. Moreover, Russo and Schoemaker (1992) showed that overconfident or underconfident behavior may also vary across professions by considering three groups of professionals: Shell’s geologists, public accountants, and weather forecastersFootnote 1
. Englmaier and Reisinger (2014) showed that hiring managers with biased beliefs can act as a commitment device in the oligopoly market, which is reminiscent of the mechanism highlighted by the strategic delegation literature including Fershtman and Judd (1987), Sklivas (1987), and Vickers (1985) (FJSV delegation)Footnote 2. In a framework à la Englmaier and Reisinger (2014) with biased managers with respect to the demand size in the market, Nakamura (2019) focused on how different types of managers selected by owners affect the equilibrium competition structures in the fashion of Singh and Vives (1984) by considering that each manager’s expectation of market size depends on their own type and the type of the rival manager. Most recently, Meccheri (2021) extended the approach adopted in Nakamura (2019) into a vertical structure with a common input supplier. The pioneering work by Singh and Vives (1984) has given rise to a vast body of literature analyzing the effects of Bertrand and Cournot competition on profits and welfare, as well as the analysis of the non-cooperative game on the choice of the strategy in a duopoly. The increasing emergence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities within each firm has been observed worldwide. Regarding a objective function of a CSR firm as the weighted sum of its profit and consumer surplus, Goering (2007) theoretically investigated the influence of managerial incentives on market outcomes in an asymmetric industry composed of one CSR firm and one profit-maximizing (PM) firm and subsequently Goering (2008) considered an asymmetric triopoly composed of one CSR firm, one PM firm, and a public firm which maximizes social welfare which is equal to the sum of each firm’s profit and consumer surplus. On the basis of the approach on the CSR objective function of Goering (2007) and Goering (2008), Kopel and Brand (2012) considered the hiring problem of whether a manager is endogenously hired or not in an asymmetric industry of a CSR firm and a PM firm. Fanti and Buccella (2017a) found that different equilibria arise: (1) all firms follow CSR rules; (2) all firms are profit-maximizing (PM); (3) asymmetric equilibria that one is a CSR firm while another is a PM firm exist; and (4) multiple symmetric equilibria are present. Fanti and Buccella (2017b) considered a similar problem to that considered in Fanti and Buccella (2017a) by adopting a managerial delegation contact between an owner and a manager within each firm. Furthermore, Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2018) introduced a different type of a CSR firm whose objective function is equal to the weighted sum of its profit and the surplus of its own customers, and subsequently, Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020) expanded the short-run analysis to the long-run one with free entry in the model that each firm endogenously determines the degree of importance of its CSR. Most recently, Garcia et al. (2021) studied the firm’s strategic choice of the degree of importance of CSR in a managerial delegation framework where a multiproduct CSR competes against a single plant firmFootnote 3.
 In addition, Matsumura and Ogawa (2016) considered the endogenous selection problem of the strategies within CSR firms in the fashion of Singh and Vives (1984). Although Matsumura and Ogawa (2016) modeled the weighted sum of a CSR firm’s profit and social welfare as its objective function, Fanti and Buccella (2018) regarded it as the weighted sum of its profit and consumer surplus. Subsequently, Nakamura (2021a) and Nakamura (2022) investigated the endogenous selection problem of the strategies for CSR firms’ owners by introducing the FJSV delegation contract into the model in Matsumura and Ogawa (2016) and Fanti and Buccella (2018). Nakamura (2021a) showed that the optimal strategy of each firm’s owner strictly depends on the degree of its rival firm, which changes along with a change in the degree of homogeneity between the goods, whereas Nakamura (2022) found that the optimal strategy of each firm’s owner does not depend on both, (1) the degree of homogeneity between the goods and (2) the degree of importance of its CSR. Nakamura (2021b) considered the endogenous selection problem of the strategies in an asymmetric duopoly composed of the one firm à la Matsumura and Ogawa (2016) and the other firm à la Fanti and Buccella (2018) and Nakamura (2021c) extended the model adopted in Nakamura (2021b) by introducing the FJSV delegation within each CSR firm. This study aims to contribute to the endogenous selection problem of strategies in an oligopoly composed of CSR firms in the context of the endogenous choice of managers’ types in the fashion of Englmaier and Reisinger (2014). In this study, regardless of the degree of homogeneity between the goods and the degree of importance of CSR firms, we show that Cournot competition (q–q game) can be observed in equilibrium. Provided that the owner of the rival firm selects a quantity as their strategy, a relatively more (less) aggressive manager is hired by the owner of the relevant firm when the firm’s owner i sufficiently emphasizes social welfare (profit) with a higher (lower) degree importance of CSR. The q–q game can be observed in equilibrium by manipulating the type of manager hired by the firm owner at any level of the degree of importance of each firm’s CSR, regardless of the degree of homogeneity between the goods produced by CSR firms and the degree of importance of CSR in the rival firm. Contrarily, when the asymmetry of the degrees of importance of CSR between both firms is sufficiently high, not only Cournot competition but also Bertrand competition can become equilibrium competition structures. Focusing on the case where the degree of importance of CSR for the relevant firm’s owner is sufficiently high, whereas the counterpart of its rival’s firm is sufficiently low, the owner of the firm sufficiently emphasizes social welfare and the manager of the rival firm is relatively less aggressive. Then, the owner of the relevant firm wishes to make both their manager and the manager of the rival firm more aggressive by decreasing the biased scale on the demand size realized by a hired manager and selecting a price. Therefore, in this situation, Bertrand competition, in addition to Cournot competition, can also become the equilibrium competition structure. In sum, when the owners of CSR firms can hire individuals who are likely to be biased with respect to the realization of the demand size as their managers, although the asymmetry of the degrees of importance of CSR between both firms does not yield asymmetric competition structures with respect to their strategies (which are observed in equilibrium,) multiple symmetric competition structures with respect to their strategies can be observed in equilibrium. This depends significantly on the difference in the degrees of importance of CSRs between them. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we formulate the basic model. In Sect. 3, we present the values and properties of the equilibrium market outcomes in each competition structure, provided that CSR firms’ strategies are fixed. Section 4 presents the main results of the equilibrium competition structures obtained in this study. Section 5 concludes the paper. In the supplementary material of this paper, we first show the property of the type of manager of firms i and j in the cases of \(\delta \) = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively. Second, we describe the payoffs for the owners of firms i and j in each game. Third, we compare the types of manages of firms i and j in the cases of \(\delta \) = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively, among the four games. Fourth, we describe the contents in Fig. 1a–d.",3
69,3,International Review of Economics,08 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00402-7,"Markets, merit and the dignity of labour",September 2022,Robert Sugden,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In June 2016, a majority of British voters chose that their country should leave the European Union. In November 2016, Donald Trump won the US Presidential election on a populist platform. Among the lesser consequences of those two events has been the emergence of a new genre of literature—the genre of Brexit/Trump anguish. Books in this genre are written by liberal or left-leaning journalists, political scientists, economists and philosophers. Their common premise is that Brexit and Trump supporters voted for political programmes that were—and that they should have known to be—contrary to their own interests and to the wider interests of their communities and nations. For the authors of such books, two features of these votes are particularly disturbing. First, Brexit and Trump were disproportionately supported by lower-income and less-educated voters—people whose interests left-of-centre political movements would be expected to promote. Second, those voters seemed to have deliberately rejected economic, political and moral positions that were almost unquestioned within the professional and intellectual communities to which the various authors belong. Indeed, a thinly-veiled theme in the Brexit and Trump campaigns had been resentment against (not to say contempt for) claims of expertise and moral rightness made by exactly those communities—the so-called ‘metropolitan elite’. Typically, the author’s response is to offer an explanation of these phenomena that treats the Brexit and Trump votes as misdirected expressions of understandable and at least partly legitimate discontent. Some authors look for ways of adapting the left-liberal consensus to respond to that discontent without compromising what, for them, are its most fundamental principles. In other cases, the argument is that the voters were expressing attitudes which, if properly understood, were in support of positions that the author has already defended and that are not in need of significant revision. In his recent book The Tyranny of Merit, Michael Sandel (2020) contributes to this branch of the genre. Sandel is the author of two previous books which develop moral critiques of markets and of kinds of thinking that, he argues, are propagated by an excessive use of market mechanisms and by economic theories that purport to justify those mechanisms. In Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?, Sandel (2009: p. 9) argues that justice is about ‘giving people what they deserve’. That requires judgements about ‘what virtues are worthy of honor and reward, and what way of life a good society should promote’. A major theme of that book is that the market generates incomes that are not properly aligned with the virtues of the people who receive them. In What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets, Sandel (2012: pp. 128, 203) argues that markets can corrode morality by fostering ‘market values’ which tend to undermine the civic virtues of solidarity, ‘shar[ing] in a common life’, and ‘car[ing] for the common good’.Footnote 1 In The Tyranny of Merit, Sandel tries to recast the discontent of the Brexit and Trump voters as a rejection of what he has characterised as market values and as an inarticulate plea for the restoration of civic virtue. Luigino Bruni and I (2013) have already presented critiques of Sandel’s 2009 and 2012 discussions of market values. In the present paper, I focus on two new themes that are prominent in The Tyranny of Merit. One is the idea of meritocracy, which Sandel presents as a market value that underpins the hubris of people who are economically successful and that humiliates those who are not. The other is the dignity of labour, which Sandel presents as a civic value that can be undermined by market forces. By making many traditional manufacturing industries unprofitable, globalisation has deprived working-class people of opportunities for meaningful work. According to Sandel’s diagnosis, the grievances that have fuelled populist politics ‘are not only economic but also moral and cultural; they are not only about wages and jobs but also about social esteem’ (Sandel, 2020: p. 18). Sandel’s primary concern is with these moral and cultural grievances. It should go without saying that any comprehensive explanation of the growth of populism must take account of deep changes in the British and American economies which, independently of any changes in social values, have affected the prospects of working people. These changes include the increasing importance of services relative to manufacturing, developments in digital technology that displace many forms of skilled labour (either directly or by allowing outsourcing to lower-wage countries), the effects of East Asian economic growth on international trade patterns, and (partly as a result of these changes) increasing income inequality. Clearly, these effects are transmitted through markets, but whether they are caused by markets, and whether they can be attributed to the dominance of market values in political discourse, is much less obvious. Sandel sometimes seems to conflate these three ideas, most obviously in his repeated references to an undefined ‘market-driven project of globalization’ (2020: p. 5, see also pp. 19, 184, 202, 213, 222). This is an example of a more general tendency in Sandel’s view of economics that I will say more about later—a tendency to treat economists’ statements about the facts of economic life as judgements of moral approval (and of moral approval of a very particular kind). For the moment, it is sufficient to say that my paper is a commentary on Sandel’s moral and cultural analysis of market values, and not a discussion of the underlying economic causes of the discontents that fuel populism. I will question Sandel’s claim that meritocracy is a market value and that the dignity of labour is not. I will argue that his account of a moral alternative to ordinary market institutions—a thinly described economy of republican virtue in which individuals’ economic rewards are aligned with their true merits—is deeply incoherent.",
69,3,International Review of Economics,19 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00394-4,Abilities and the structure of the firm,September 2022,Tobias Hiller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a recent paper, Hiller (2019) introduced production games within the framework of cooperative game theory. He was inspired by the team games approach introduced by Hernández-Lamoneda and Sánchez-Sánchez (2010). The main idea of Hiller (2019) is illustrated by an example. Imagine a firm has a task that requires a certain number of employees t. For example, we have \(t=3\). By adding a fourth employee, the firm will place the best three of the four employees in a team to achieve the task. If the firm has six employees, maybe two teams of three will be formed. In Hiller (2019) the worth of a group of employees is determined from the maximum worth of possible coalitions with size t. The ability of a single employee is modeled only indirectly by the worths of the coalitions he or she belongs to. Another recent paper also deals with teams and their structure within firms using cooperative game theory (Morelli and Park 2016) In their model, every employee has certain ability. For achieving a task, a certain number of employees t and a certain sum of abilities z are necessary. After the relative threshold is crossed, the worth of a team increases linearly with the aggregate ability of its members. Hence, there is no graduality of worths as modeled by t in Hiller (2019). The objective of our paper has two thrusts. First, the two theoretical approaches mentioned above are combined into one. Then, we determine the stable assignment of employees to teams for this approach. For the first step, we assume that every employee i has an ability \(a_{i}.\) These abilities of employees determine the worth of coalitions. Additionally, the graduality exists. Only the abilities of the best t (or any multiple of t) members of a team are considered for determining the worth of a team. With reference to our example from the beginning, the worth of a group with four employees and \(t=3\) is the aggregate ability of the three employees with highest ability. The main question is how to assign employees to teams and how this decision does depend on the heterogeneity of the employee’s abilities. We assume that the employees are rewarded for the worth created by their team. Our aim is to find stable structures of teams, i.e., the number of teams and their internal structure. A structure of teams in the firm is stable if there is no other structure that raises the wages of all employees in at least one new team. One could interpret these structures as enforceable from the point of view of the employer. A higher range of stable structures is associated with a higher degree of freedom for the employer in deciding on the firm structure. We analyze which structures of teams are stable in three steps.Footnote 1 First, we look at symmetric employees, meaning that all employees have the same ability. In a second step, we allow for two types of ability and finally, we analyze a firm in which every employee has a different ability. One result of all cases is that assigning more employees than necessary in a team lowers the stability of the team. In addition, a higher degree of heterogeneity, meaning that more levels of ability exist, leads to smaller opportunities for employers to structure teams; the size and composition of stable teams are more prescribed. For the purpose of the article, we use the framework of cooperative game theory. To model structures of teams in cooperative game theory, firm structures (FS, also called coalition structures) are used. These structures divide employees into disjointed teams (or components). To answer the question of how to reward the employees, a reward function for games with a firm structure is used. The most popular function is the \(\chi\) function (Casajus 2009). This function is team-efficient, meaning that the worth of the team is divided among the team members,Footnote 2 and reflects the outside options of the employees. The better an employee’s outside options (possibilities of cooperating with other employees in the firm), the higher the employee’s share within the team. Other reward functions for FS games being team-efficient and reflecting the outside options of employees are introduced by Wiese (2007) and Alonso-Meijide et al. (2015), for example. The problem of determining the optimal number and quality of employees in the firm is beyond the scope of his article. Some other missing aspects are mentioned in Sect. 5 by suggesting further research options. One line of related literature on how to structure teams are hedonic games.Footnote 3 These games model the formation of coalitions (groups) of players when players have preferences for one group over others (Banerjee et al. 2001; Bogomolnaia and Jackson 2002). One article using hedonic games and employees with different level of ability was developed by Barberà et al. (2015). They identify conditions under which stable structures consists of non-segregated teams. The result is similar to our result in the case of two level of ability. In this case, we also identify situations that result in one mixed team. Another approach was developed by Piccione and Razin (2009). Their article uses exogenous power relations over the set of coalitions of agents to determine a stable order (groups). This approach does not consider explicit how (heterogeneity of) abilities influences the set of stable teams. One model taking this aspect into account was introduced by Damiano et al. (2010). The model considers two effects: peer effect and pecking order. The peer effect means that individuals prefer to cooperate with more capable peers in the same organization. The pecking order effect models the opposite; the wish of individuals to be in a good rank according to their ability within the organization. In equilibrium, segregation occurs for the more capable and less capable individuals whereas the intermediate able employees are in mixed teams. Also, one result of our model is a segregation of employees of different abilities. In the case of only two level of ability, we have one mixed team. In the case of n abilities, teams are minimal heterogeneous. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Basic notations of cooperative game theory are given in Sect. 2. The next section introduces production games. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes with a summary of the results and some questions for further research.",1
69,3,International Review of Economics,12 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00395-3,"Commodity price volatility, inflation uncertainty and political stability",September 2022,Rexford Abaidoo,Elvis Kwame Agyapong,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"A stable political environment is one of the fundamental conditions that continue to inform and define policies geared towards spurring growth and development especially among emerging economies in sub-Sahara Africa. Generally, an economy is deemed politically stable when its populace restrict themselves to behaviour patterns that falls within acceptable limits imposed by political role, and expectations consistent with rule of law. Among developing economies in the sub-region however, political stability defines an economic state devoid of, or characterized by minimal incidence of instability or possibility of general unrest (regime change, political violence, economic or social policy-induced unrest, etc.). According to the World Bank, political stability defines a condition where there is less likelihood of politically motivated violence coupled with a low propensity for terrorism and regime change. A stable political environment is not only integral for growth and development among economies in sub-Sahara Africa; but also critical for economies and regional economic blocks around the world. The significance of a stable political environment to an economy’s productive health and well-being of its populace cannot be overstated. Impact of a stable political environment in the economic growth process is evident in how the condition specifically influence key components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. For instance, sustained growth in consumption expenditures (the largest component of GDP growth based on economic theory), and investments are mostly feasible in a stable political environment. A stable political environment in this sense, serves as the core feature around which productivity and economic growth revolves. In contrast, political instability, the antithesis of the condition in question, has been found to be inimical to productivity; ultimately constraining economic growth and development. Agitations, a major source of political instability often emanates from the form of political system (whether democratic or autocratic), income or economic inequality (see Blanco and Grier 2009); and quality of political institutions (see Goldstone et al. 2010; Ibrahim and Cheri 2013). One of the notable theories that has contributed significantly to the political stability/instability discourse is the resource curse hypothesis. The theory highlights a phenomenon where economies endowed with natural resource are often characterized by anemic growth, weak democratic governance, underdevelopment, propensity for social unrest, etc., compared to economies with relatively fewer natural resources. The theory among other things posit that when natural resources are mostly controlled by the few elite; or concentrated and manage by a small number of investors for the benefit of the minority in an economy (a feature of most economies in the sub-region), the condition has the potential to fuel agitations and unrest, ultimately leading to political instability all things being equal. Reviewed literature highlights notable empirical studies whose submission on political stability/instability or volatility have been based on the resource curse hypothesis (refer to Sachs and Warner 2001; Van der Ploeg and Poelhekke 2009; Bjorvatn and Farzanegan 2015; Koyuncu and Ünver 2020; Frynas and Buur 2020). Significant number of empirical studies, such as Alesina et al. (1996), Gyimah-Brempong and Traynor (1999), Fosu (2001), Jong−A−Pin (2009), Aisen and Veiga (2013), Tang and Abosedra (2014), Okafor (2017) and Murad and Alshyab (2019), have examined the role of instability or nature of political system on economic growth/development with varying conclusions. Other related studies focusing on the political stability/instability discourse have also examined the direct causal relationships between various economic variables such as inflation volatility, trade openness and income inequality, and the nature of the political environment (see Aisen and Veiga 2008; Blanco and Grier 2009). This succinct overview of the discourse on political stability/instability points to the crucial role prevailing political environment play in the economic growth and development process. Most of the studies reviewed so far, largely highlight the pivotal role prevailing political environment play in an economy’s performance or growth. This study, however, takes a different approach. We rather focus on how volatility associated with key internationally traded commodities as well as other macroeconomic and institutional indicators impact political stability among emerging economies. Specifically, this study is modelled on the assumption that observed variability in political stability among emerging economies in sub-Sahara African economies may reflect volatility in prices of key international commoditiesFootnote 1 and other key indicators. Globalization and growth in cross-border economic dependence in recent years continue to highlight the importance of price fluctuations for key commodities traded on the global market to the growth of engaged economies. Often, price of commodities traded on the world market tend to have significant upward impact on prices of other domestic commodities with the potential for growing agitations. For instance, persistent increase in the price of crude oil on the world market may lead to substantial increase in prices of fuel within local economies, thereby increasing the potential for agitations and unrest. The link between how various domestic commodity prices responds to volatility in price of commodities on the international market is explored by Kirikkaleli and Güngör (2021); the study showed that volatility in price of some commodities may have significant impact on price of other commodities all things being equal. For instance, variability in the price of energy products were found to respond to fluctuations in the price of other commodities on the international market. This conclusion by Kirikkaleli and Güngör (2021) highlights the need to critically examine dynamics of commodity price volatility; and the potential effect the condition may have on income levels and the political environment. Growing reliance on key internationally traded commodities by most emerging and developing economies means that persistent fluctuations in the price of such commodities have the potential to affect revenue forecast all things being equal. This condition may constrain efforts by policymakers to meet the basic needs of the populace leading to agitations and political unrest. In this theorized relationship, an economy’s global position (whether a net importer or exporter of key commodities); and the frequency of price movement among key traded commodities has the potential to shape its performance trajectory, and ultimately, the political environment. In this regard, among net importers, persistent upward price movement for key commodities on the global market may lead to an upward surge in prices of such products in the domestic market with potential for internal agitations and political unrest. For net exporters, however, frequent upward movement in the price of key export commodities could mean a boost in revenue to finance developmental projects and improved standard of living for the populace; a condition, which may rather promote a stable political environment all things being equal. Our review of the related literature suggests that although few empirical studies examining the relationship in question exist, none was designed to specifically examine the reverse condition where volatility associated with internationally traded commodities are rather presumed to explain variability in political stability; and the extent to which specific institutional variables moderates such relationship. This study examines how volatility in global prices of leading commodities affect political stability among emerging economies in the sub-region. The focus on emerging economies in sub-Saharan Africa has been informed by the fact that, unlike most advanced economies with systems designed to absorb such shocks from fluctuations in key commodity prices, most emerging economies in the sub-region are vulnerable to such shocks due to overdependence on few internationally traded commodities as main sources of revenue for development. Blanco and Grier (2009) in a related study focusing on the role of macroeconomic conditions, examined how inflation and inflation volatility influence political instability. A sample of 18 countries in Latin America were employed in the study; this study failed to find a significant relationship between inflation and political instability. Aisen and Veiga (2008) however found evidence suggesting that political instability is associated with volatile inflationary conditions; a submission highly inconsistent with the findings of Blanco and Grier (2009). Aisen and Veiga (2008)’s conclusion was further confirmed among economies on the African continent by Barugahara (2015) using data from 49 countries. Telatar et al. (2010) in a reverse study also concluded that overall, political instability rather influences variability in inflation rate. These aforementioned studies focusing on inflation, inflation uncertainty, and political instability to some extent suggest lack of conclusive or established relationship between key macroeconomic conditions and political stability/instability. To verify how these conditions influence political dynamics among economies in the sub-region, this study in addition to commodity price volatility, further examines the effect of inflation and inflation uncertainty on political stability among economies in the sub-region. Theorized dynamic relationships between commodity price volatility and political stability in this study are examined empirically using data spanning the period 1996 to 2019.

69,3,International Review of Economics,22 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00399-z,"Networks of solidarity economy, tools for local development and social innovation",September 2022,Carmela Guarascio,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The market exchange, as a “form of integration”Footnote 1 (Polanyi 1944, 1957, 1977), is regulating spaces that usually are inside other institutional structures, as the State and third sector (Cella 2008). It means that goods and services that need to be regulated by a specific form of integration, as, for example, the culture or the education, are instead regulated by the market exchange. This disagreement could create inequalities, raising questions about how it is possible to restore the equilibrium among regulatory forms and which are the actors of this action. The socio-economic model of the solidarity economy, by proposing the “plural economy” (Arruda 2006; Aznar et al. 1997; Razeto 1984), introduces a way of integration among many regulatory forms. The plural economy in fact, is the concept of interdependence among the reciprocity (third sector), the redistribution (state) and the exchange (market) (Laville 2000, 2009). It means that an organization refers its sustainability to many resources (private, public and communitarian). The movement of M.A.U.S.S. (anti-utilitarian movement in the social sciences), groups these regulatory forms into three forms of economy: non-monetary, market and non-market. The non-monetary economy brings together domestic administration and reciprocity. The market economy includes the market, and the non-market includes the redistribution. This subdivision highlights the diversity of the exchanges where material and immaterial flows of private, public and community nature intersect. This restores the complexity of plurality to the concept of economy, and it challenges also the hybridization of resources (Gardin 2008), namely the use of multiple resources, in implementing a development action. The study of these regulatory forms questions the nature of the society to be regulated (Bagnasco 2010), or at least some of its significant character or process, but it does not necessarily mean treating another economy, or more forms of economy, but rather an economy on different bases. Mingione (2009) explains that it would not be scientifically correct to identify other economies than today, but to highlight the regulatory logic to which the economy is subjected that differentiate the institutional and regulatory structures. In this sense, it seems interesting to study how producers into the Solidarity Purchasing Groups (SPGs), as a part of the Alternative food Networks (AFN), put together more than one regulatory form in order to be sustainable. SPGs are groups of people or family that decide to purchase products together applying principles of critical consumption, as, for example, in order to choose producers in ethical way, aiming to a sustainable economy, reducing waste and favoring a local economy, as a short food supply (Marsden et al. 2000). In Italy SPGs are GAS, “Gruppo di Acquisto solidale”. The term solidarity is strongly linked with the social movement of solidarity economy spread at national level. They have been studied under the point of view of consumers and the consumption culture (Vermeir and Verbeke 2006), and their political implication (Micheletti and McFarland 2009; Stolle et al. 2005). In Italy, the debate is strong around the implication of consumerism (Carrera 2009; Forno and Graziano 2012; Orazi 2011; Rebughini 2008). In contrast to the international supply chains inherent in the conventional food system, proponents of “alternative” food networks draw attention to the ability of these “new supply chains to resocialise or respatialise food, thereby allowing the consumer to make new value judgments about the relative desirability of foods on the basis of their own knowledge, experience, or perceived imagery” (Renting et al. 2003: p.398). This work aims to explore the producers involved into the SPGs, analyzing their business project. The analysis of producers into the SPGs seems interesting in order to highlight their role and impact on local development. The goal is to analyze how SPGs organize the economic transaction reorganizing the productive chain on local, ecological and ethical basis. It impacts on the concepts of enterprise, local governance and economic relationship, fostering a view of plural economy and social inclusion. In the network, there are a multiplicity of actors and yet the collaboration is not spontaneous. It is for this reason that the article wants to focus on the inside of the network to investigate the actors and flows that make up the network. The hypothesis is that plural economy impacts positively a local process of development, as long as members involved are based on an autonomous economic model, and they are members of a bigger network working for local governance. Even if in solidarity economy, there are different types of organization, from non-profit to profit ones, the article focuses on enterprises, often social enterprises (Borzaga and Fazzi 2011; Draperi 2007) because the autonomous economic model and the capacity of proposing social innovation are strongly linked in order to enhance a virtuous development process, as shown in the typology presented in the article. It is necessary to underline the relevance of the relationship among enterprise and non-profit organization that weave the social cohesion. There are many studies on the relationship between social capital and social organizations, into the promotion of a stronger social cohesion. Nevertheless, the article wants better to focus on the implications of enterprises involved that seems more difficult involved into a solidarity framework and that are studied under the framework of corporate social sustainability and less under this perspective. Firstly, the article analyzes the entrepreneurial characteristics of the producers involved in the alternative food network based in Italian region “Marche”, called ""REES"", that sell to consumers of solidarity purchasing groups. The article shows that an enterprise of solidarity economy bases its sustainability on a multiplicity of resources, instead of only monetary one. This gives the opportunity to reinforce cooperation inside and outside the enterprise that otherwise could be lost in the traditional market mechanism. There are ten variables considered in the study, as, for example, the cultural horizon of entrepreneurs, the relations with human resources, the networks with the local territory and the activism. Secondly, the article focuses on the capacity of plural economy in building a cooperative network among different types of members, impacting on local governance. Local networks enhance cooperation that is positive for local development, creating virtuous economic exchanges, as, for example, shown from the relationships among consumers and producers in promoting critical consumption. The paper is structured as follows: The first part is an analysis of data about members from the database of REES, the second part describes the indicators adopted to analyze the impact of producers on economy, and in the third part presents the results of the empirical analysis and the social implications. The method is a mixed method. The quantitative analysis refers to data elaborated by the author on REES and producers. The qualitative analysis is based on 34 interviews and on a participatory observation in the board of directors of the REES network and in some public, formal and non-formal meetings of the SPGs and the network itself. Interviews are divided among 12 interviews to enterprises, 15 to SPGs out of 40 members of the REES database (one of this is an “Intergas”, it means that groups together 8 others small SPGs), and 7 to responsible people. The contact with some SPGs was very difficult, as they were not willing to receive interviews, in others the consultation process within the groups to accept the interview was long, and sometimes it did not come to an end. Contacts were taken from the REES Marche site. The interviews submitted are of a semi-structured type. The sample represents all the provinces concerned. It does not aim to be a statistical figure related to the reality investigated, but it is useful in order to make some qualitative evaluations. Results of the article show four different types of solidarity organizations, mixing some variables referring to social innovation and co-planning with local institution about social dimension. In the case in which there is this kind of relationship, it is more direct for an organization to relate itself to local development and to start doing actions linked to local development in according with others organizations, as, for example, non-profit organizations. The solidarity economy organizations intend to build a more inclusive plural economy, and it means that they try to mix different resources to be sustainable: public, private and voluntary. The economic action of these organizations is necessarily focused on individuals as a part of the context that exercise a socio-political dimension (Forno and Graziano 2016), promoting sustainable actions. The cooperation among producers and consumers into SPGs is an example of how the economic relationship it is not based only on a market exchange, but they could occur different levels of interactions and tensions too. Into plural economy (Arruda 2006; Aznar et al. 1997; Razeto 1984; Roustang 1982, 2000), all actors involved in a transaction have the same responsibility in taking care of the relationship and the development process. Reciprocity is the institutional form by which exchanges are organized (Hillenkamp 2013). It could take the form of a gift, as explained by Mauss (1924), but generally it represents a form of exchange in which the currency is not usually present, and participants are bound by non-economic ties. There is a common building of consciousness of the political frame (Sassatelli and Leonini 2008) among producers and consumers that have the same goal of sustainability and critical consumption. For example, there could be a cooperative that sells a fair and solidarity good to the classic distribution actors. It enters as a part of a structured value chain, with which it maintains instrumental relationships in order to promote a solidarity product. Into this value chain there is no co-production of values, there is no reciprocity among actors, but only an instrumental relationship. Co-production in the literature means the action through which the consumer participates in the orientation of the organization's policies by orienting the production. In this sense, it is usually identified as “prosumer” (Toffler 1980) or “consum-attori”. Otherwise in a SPGs, consumers and producers work together in order to choose the most ethical products, cooperating in a common vision of critical consumption. Reciprocity in this sense assumes a strong institutional structure of values that supports relationships among actors. REES wasFootnote 2 a second level network of solidarity economyFootnote 3 that was born in 2004. It groups in fact other networks such as the “Pesaro Urbino RES”, the solidarity purchasing groups (SPGs), the district of solidarity economy (DES). In the network “REES”, there are different members: SPGs, together with public, private and public–private actors. They are also defined as actors of multilateral reciprocity, because members involved in the exchange have the same level of power in the relationship even if they are from different institutional forms and are not equal, as, for example, a public and a private structure. Multilateral reciprocity is different from the charitable association in which there is an unequal relationship among clients and organizations, or among cooperatives where the relationship is only among equals and members (Gardin 2008). This is a central concept and it means that solidarity economy, linked to multilateral reciprocity, tries to establish a symmetrical relationship among actors: workers, customers, clients. This idea links with an integrated development perspective as civic food networks claim (Rossi et al. 2013). It doesn’t mean that everybody has the same power in acting the relationship, but the same responsibility of being in the process with different levels of power. This definition states a particular power relationship that needs to be analyzed in depth. The REES network counts 395 members, including 59 associations, 292 companies, 40 solidarity purchasing groups (SPGs) and 4 public entities. The research takes into consideration producers and enterprises directly linked to solidarity economy district (DES) and solidarity purchasing groups (SPGs), intending to analyze the solidarity economy. Among associations the 80% is based on an environmental theme, with a strong presence of the macrobiotic movement (42%). Among these to emphasize the importance of the organic sector in the network, we find AIABFootnote 4 and AMABFootnote 5 Marche that deal with the promotion of organic production in the region. Foundations are a minimal part; instead, there is a strong presence of social cooperatives, fair-trade shops, and self-management mutual. The associations are distributed uniformly throughout the territory, except for the province of Ancona. The composition of the associations is rather voluntary, without employees. Among enterprises members of REES about 70% are profit-making companies, most of which are for farming and food production, most of which are organic. This peculiarity is due to the very origin of the movement: the environmental, ecological and biological networks. The rest are companies of other kinds, which cover all the legal statutes, there is 2% of big companies, around 21% of sole proprietorship, 41% as limited liability company and around the 4% of others. There are around 7% of social cooperatives, of which 21 are type B.Footnote 6 Among the non-for-profit economic organizations, A and B cooperatives, agriculture is not the dominant sector. They focus more naturally on a service sector, particularly type A social cooperatives focus mainly on health and social services. If we compare these data with the regional ones, the particular agricultural vocation of REES is very evident, with a strong prevalence of farms, and all that concerns the products or services related to this economic sector, such as educational farms, agritourist (Fig. 1). Comparison of the economic sectors in Marche Region and in REES network Source: our elaboration on Istat As far as geographical concentration is concerned, the distribution of REES member organizations is fairly homogeneous in the region. There are 13 company members that are not regional companies, but they come from Lombardy, Molise, Veneto, Tuscany, Umbria and Abruzzo. Rather, these are non-agricultural companies that supply products that Marche region misses. Pesaro Urbino is the province with the highest concentration of biological enterprises, and together with Ancona and Macerata, it has the greatest concentration also of non-agricultural companies. In these territories, in fact, the SPGs are more numerous, as the territories themselves are able of supplying an important range of products (Fig. 2). Distribution of organic enterprises and SPGs in Marche region Source: our personal elaboration on REES database and Istat Producers that adhere to SPGs are mostly small producers. The intention of the SPGs is, in fact, precisely to support organic producers who are unable to be sustainable on market. Officially on REES database, there are 40 registered solidarity purchasing groups. Other researches (Orazi, 2011) talk about 70 SPGs, with a pool of 3350 families involved in collective purchases. This difference in numbers is given by the fact that many SPGs prefer not to formally adhere to REES, but aim to constitute informal groups that are autonomous from to the network. A network of solidarity economy, Des Macerata, also joins the network. It is an informal association that at this time does not play an active role in the area. In 2014, the Piceno District of organic agriculture was established, with the specific function of carrying out the proposals related to organic farming, and which brings together other enterprises in the province of Ascoli Piceno. There is also another network, the Res Pesaro-Urbino, with 14 SPGs, about 495 households and 10 farms. The widespread presence of SPGs in the area outlines an important productive autonomy of the REES network over the territory. Most of the SPGs in REES were all born from 2006 to 2011 (Table 1), a period during which the attention towards this type of purchase was growing. After this period, the growth was steadily decreased, and in fact in the sample there are no recently established SPGs. This is also due to the fact that often many SPGs, above all recently established, do not register on the web site and prefer to remain autonomous from the network.Footnote 7 The products sold are mostly fresh, long-life food products. In the most numerous SPGs, orders are also made annually for non-food products, which cover the textile and hygiene sector. Normally SPGs chose to be an association. However, it is important to note that almost 50% of the sample affirm that they do not want to set themselves up, but they prefer to remain an informal group. Among the most recent ones, three are already constituted in informal groups, and they chose to establish themselves only a few years later in association. This choice is motivated by many as a rejection of traditional aggregation mechanisms, for which a formal associative structure would turn into a difficult issue to manage. Moreover, this condition helps them to foster a familiar atmosphere. On average, each SPG of the sample has 60 families, with around usually 20 families active in the order management. 20–30 members are the best option because this size allows a varied basket of products, and above all it allows the organization of many events, such as team building, excursions, shared meals, moments of shared training and leisure. This is perceived as necessary for the success of the SPGs, because it takes care of the solidarity part of the SPGs that is the base of the purchasing action. In public, discussion members usually state that it is important that a SPGs does not only become a buying group, but it invests on the solidarity part, that is made up of reciprocity among members. In many cases, non-active members were called to be an active part of the SPGs, working on orders and distribution. On average, a SPG buys goods for a value of 53,000 thousand euros annually,Footnote 8 and is supplied on average by 18 producers. Producers are often into agri-food sector, but there is a small part of them, around 7%, belonging to the textile and clothing supply chain, and hygiene products. On average, it could be estimated that all the consumers groups belonging to the SPGs, 60 family units for each SPGs, spend about two million euros each year. This business volume involves in critical consumption practices around 4,200 consumers, 2100 families, along with a substantial number of producers, around 18 on average for each SPGs, for a total of 170 producers, 77% of whom are not members of the Rees network. According to Istat data, in 2013 the added value of all economic activity in the Marche Region was 34 million euros. The value produced within the solidarity economy circuits, only considering the SPGs, it can be estimated that it represents about 5.50%. There are 292 companies that are members in the REES Marche. However, adding them all agricultural companies and small producers that supply their products to SPGs and that are not members of the REES,Footnote 9 we can estimate a total database of 422 economic subjects. Moreover, if we include the suppliers of interviewed producers themselves, the total database has about 584 economic subjects that double the number of formal REES members. This means that beyond the formal adhesion to the Rees there are several small and medium enterprises that are involved in generating profit within the solidarity economy, especially in the field of organic production. Referring in particular to the world of SPGs, we can say that many small companies that do not have space in the traditional market, are able to build a sustainable economic model within the solidarity economy network. They do not participate in the political part of the REES network because they are too small, or because they are not interested. However, in our opinion it is interesting to analyze this network, because it highlights the flows exchanged thanks to the interaction among producers and consumers. The following map (Fig. 3) is a current photograph of the interviewed SPGs. Only the organizations that have at least two relationships with the SPGs have been included in the scheme; it must be considered that every SPGs represents a vital world with a group of producers that sell exclusively to him. As we can see, each SPGs has its own relationships with some producers. Then, there are producers who weave relationships with several SPGs simultaneously, and therefore, they build their economic model mainly on SPGs sales, which we can identify as the hub companies that are at the center of the map. Among them there are seven producers that have from 6 to 11 links with SPGs (Table 2). Economic relationships among SPGs and producers Source: Our elaboration Among these seven companies, four sell food products, two deal with natural cosmetics and one with fair trade. Among these there are two that were founders of the REES. The first, established in 1980 as an organic farm, is very active in organizing cultural events in favor of the network on the nutritional value of organic products, critical consumption and environmental sustainability. 60% of sales are in Italy, and of these the majority in terms of turnover are dedicated to the sale to SPGs. The other one deals with fair trade and hosted the headquarter of REES. Among the Hub companies, there is a so-called Start-up of the solidarity purchasing groups. The entrepreneurial idea it was, in fact, built on consumers’ needs who have supported the entrepreneurial idea at the starting point, buying the product at the beginning of the year, and so supporting the first financial phase of the company anticipating money. The organization bases its entrepreneurship on natural cosmetics as required by consumers and on the reuse of waste such as used oil. This enterprise bases its sales mainly on the SPGs network, but today it also sells outside. In a reality of institutional weakness and fragmentation, the network has supported the process of creating a new organization that has entered the market, creating a sustainable economic model. Other companies in the network are very different from each other. They are not all REES members. 14% (46 out of 340) are members, the rest are farms, or small individual producers who are not members, but who sell an important part of their turnover to SPGs. Only a few relationships are among members of the network; very often the relationships are with suppliers or customers outside the network. This presents an open network with different connections, but also very weak from a representative point of view. Members of the network share a concrete cooperation in projects, such as cultural events. While as we have seen most of the companies that supply the product to the SPGs do not join the network, HUB companies, on the other hand, are all members except one. This confirms a political will to participate in the reality of critical consumption, as well as economic. This critical consumption is also strengthened by a transparent system of certification of product, among consumers and producers. As this consumer said: «Since we were born, we have tried to create internal certification systems, we have formed a quality group that meets producers. We discuss and meet a lot with producers» (consumer of a GAS – Pesaro). Even if in this part of monetary cooperation, it is relevant and it involves families in a solidarity circuit, in SPGs the non-monetary relationship is at the service of a more important monetary relationship that establishes the links between the organizations and the territory. In this sense, also enterprises involved can differentiate products, increasing economic power in a solidarity way (Becchetti et al. 2019). Many companies are located outside the region, around 15%. The rest are all regional producers. In these relationship among consumers and producers, it is fundamental the presence of a contract that is established at the beginning of the year. The producers undertake to produce organically and without pesticides; in the same way, consumers undertake to pre-finance production at the beginning of the year, and, therefore, to ensure the sale to the producer even if part of the harvest is lost. This pre-financing condition is a consumer's participation in business risk. It is in line with a relationship of trust and reciprocity that is not tied only into a monetary relationship, but also to a non-monetary one. It guarantees an economic sustainability to an otherwise weak producer, and moreover, it promotes a continuous investment in organic production that is a point of connection with the environmental commitment of consumers. In this way, REES network allows an economic sustainability to small local producers. The case of the start-up enterprise is a symbol of economic support for innovative structures. Support is also given to the definition of new products such as soap created from waste oil. The study confirms the existence of numerous types of organizations inside a network of solidarity economy. In identifying the different types of organizations, we have identified ten characteristics that if simultaneously present, outline different levels of social innovation and economic autonomy of organizations. One of the main goal of solidarity-based economic organization is to access forms of political territorial participation, which intersect development issues. This participation is influenced by the space granted by the public institution, but also by the space that their network offers them to carry out a political action. Feeling part of a network is an important part of the relationship; the active participation strengthens the advocacy and it identifies a collaborative dimension. The purpose of production for these organizations does not end in the product, but involves the whole process. The product, however, plays an important role; in almost all organizations there is a product or service related to the environment: natural cosmetics, organic food, reuse and recycling, natural packaging, fair trade. Raw materials are often chosen locally, and where this is not possible, “proximity products” are chosen in the sense of values of closeness to solidarity experiences. This is one of the important features for the analysis of innovation. «A whole series of values attracted me, respect for human beings and the environment that the world of solidarity brings with itself. Therefore, it is not the maximization of profit, but maximization of something else, which is not easy to achieve but should be the goal of any economic organization. Social enterprises, in fact, are social subjects, even if financialization has made them lose this aspect. It means that they cannot ignore the territory in which they operate. The word “economy” in itself speaks about the care of the territory, about social and environmental impact» (Interview n. 31 - Social entrepreneur) In almost all of the enterprise, we found incentives about a collaborative human resource management, in order to involve workers in the strategic governance of the enterprise. For example, in the majority of enterprises, there are many assemblies which are useful instruments to favor a collaborative dimension. Furthermore, training and worker’s welfare is a key issue, with many hours on trainings spent into organizations. Furthermore, a direct relationship with the consumer is envisaged. The client becomes a co-producer participating in the ideation of the product. Co-production links the two parts of the economic process, which in other contexts are unrelated. «Speaking with the producers we said why don't we build a project together? and we held various meetings, trying to understand how we could be useful as a social cooperative to develop awareness of healthy and organic food, of non-food products made with material that did not pollute the soils, that were fair trade and that respected the people who worked there» (Interview n.1 – Social entrepreneur) These organizations usually have a multifunctional economic model (Van der Ploeg 2006). This is a goal of economic sustainability, because it integrates different business within the production process, but it has also an environmental but, because the organization takes care to be into a solidarity supply chain, controlling the raw materials it uses, responding to sustainable standards. Even if the multifunctionality is a concept related to agriculture sector, we could intend the general tendency to diversify the core business in order to increase the flexibility. Finally, organizations always take care of a cultural dimension. In order to do that, they participate in cultural events in the area, and they join informal networks with other local associations. This cultural action is designated as a “pedagogical function of change” (Interview n. 1—Producer), involving the whole territory around main issues. This dimension is an active adherence to the networks of solidarity economy in which they recognize, creating advocacy campaigns towards social claims. Cultural dimension is, in fact, useful to create a shared action together with others into the networks but also outside. «Being part of this network creates awareness about fair trade and solidarity economy. For example, by filling the “Bilanci di giustizia” you work on the awareness of fair and healthy consumption. Moreover, one day we invited oil tasters to get used to a good olive oil, or a meeting on the ecologic insulation of buildings. In this way a shared awareness is created» (Interview n. 24 - A consumer of a local GAS) There are therefore ten dimensions, through which assessing an innovative solidarity economy organization (Table 3). A high innovation of the organization is considered when at least seven of these characteristics occur simultaneously, while those organizations presenting zero to two of these characteristics are not considered innovative. Therefore, four types of organization are outlined, based on the tension of the relationship between the two regulatory forms, the market and solidarity economy organizations. Therefore, there are two variables at stake for the study: the autonomy of the model, and the social innovation that they are able to propose. The autonomy of the model from dependence to public fund is essential for us, as it is the distinction for all those realities that present themselves with a non-autonomous economic model, based on public subsidies, and that are not included in the study (Table 4). When the autonomy from public fund is low, the organization mobilizes a few economic resources and does not have the strength to propose itself as a reliable economic model along time. “Type D” identifies an organization that does not have an autonomous economic model, and often does not present important product or process innovations. The relationship with the network is difficult; they usually are not an active part of the network. They remain tied in a dependent way to public funding and are not part of territorial supply chains. In the sample, this type identifies para-public organizations, mostly small organizations. “Type C” identifies voluntary organizations, informal and self-managed groups, that prefer to stay outside of market mechanisms. They realize cooperative actions at territorial and social level that, however, have a small impact, due both to their organizational dimensions, and above all to the degree of both political and economic interaction they reach. Indeed, they have a strong political activism, but they fail to produce an effective universal response to needs because they are often small groups, satisfying the needs of everyday life, but unable to answer to systemic challenges such as unemployment or environmental impact because they base themselves at the margins of the economic system. With the public regulatory form, they are not in antithesis, but they have no interest in building a lasting collaborative exchange relationship, because they perceive an important risk linked to institutionalization, and, therefore, many of them prefer not to mediate their needs through the network of solidarity economy. The relationship often ends in small requests as, for example, a room for a meeting. They are structured in a network, actively participating in the network of solidarity economy, and in numerous cultural and informative events on the territory. Their advocacy is often crucial, because they reinforce the social cohesion, and the contribution of volunteers makes these experiences unique. “Type B” represents market organizations taking care of social issues, with important results and impacts on social inclusion. Their products are innovative, but mostly the entrepreneurial activity and the organization it is very classic. They usually are not a cooperative, and even with a business status, they do not organize general assembly among workers or with stakeholders. This typology could identify also all those enterprises that take up the definition of social enterprise of Yunus (2011), for which the figure of the entrepreneur is central, in which innovation is concentrated. The product is completely distributed on the traditional market, and the supply chain in which they work is not completely linked to solidarity economy, even if their impact is strong. They hold an instrumental rationality for the purpose because the entrepreneur accepts a market transaction with “for profit” organizations because it is instrumental to his social but. Even if they belong to a network, they do not actively participate, because they find it more functional to participate in the federative and professional networks of which they are a part, such as, for example, fair trade shops, confcooperative, etc.; they are not usually involved in informal network experiences. In this sense, the network is seen as a tool to give visibility to their product. Network for them has a principal function of information and communication flows; in fact, the actions carried out by the organization are rather single and not shared on the net. The economic action itself does not involve directly beneficiaries or customers. To sum up, even if typeB is able to propose solutions to social claims, they remain anchored to a traditional governance inside and outside the organization. Finally, the typeA identifies economic organizations, which are based on an autonomous economic model, which responds to mechanisms of innovation in response to social needs. They achieve a decision-making space within territorial negotiation. Starting from a micro-economic level they intend to link the economic actions to the needs of a particular territory and to intercept the supply chains in which there are actors of the solidarity economy. This action strengthens not only the social but also the economic perspective of the action. The relationship with the network is very interesting, because it is perceived as a social movement. Nevertheless, they build relationship also outside the network, acting as an engine of an inclusive development, because they attract and promote innovation. Entrepreneurs are often activists who choose a certain economic activity for ethical and ideal choice. The majority of organizations are organic or offer an innovative and fair product and are recently established. In almost all of these companies, there is a need for reconstruction of the entire supply chain around the values of solidarity economy. The solidarity economy is made of a complex set of experiences, sometimes very different from each other, and of plural regulatory form. Nevertheless, thanks to this diversity it is able to promote mechanisms of change. The objective of the research was to analyze how the economic exchange in SPGs could impact on local development, investigating the economic relationship among solidarity network members and their concept of enterprise. The article analyzed the characteristic of enterprises with an autonomous economic model from public funds in order to be independent in proposing actions for local governance. First of all, the economic relationship build by REES members has a direct impact on local development, because it influences and encourages the birth of inclusive experiences. This is made from a series of features. The action of the network, in fact, is useful in sustaining organic small peasants that otherwise in the traditional market would have no space. Moreover, these organizations try to reorganize the productive chain on local, ecological and ethical basis, and this directly increases the production and consumption of fair products. Finally, new business linked to the idea of solidarity economy was born, the so called start-up of SPGs, thanks to a positive relationship among consumers and producers. This is strongly linked with an idea of social innovation in solving social claims, and it is directly linked with the promotion of a local and sustainable development. Secondly being a part of a network is very important for these organizations, because thanks to this they are able to influence each other on the construction of social cohesion, an indirect impact essential for a sustainable development. For example, not every organization is from typeA, but surely the strong social and political activism of typeC positively influences the action of enterprises of type A, that maybe otherwise would have put at first place only the goal of profit, hiding the plural economy. The solidarity economy uncovers one of the constituent features of enterprise, and that is the production process aiming to respond to social needs. Analyzing the organizations of typeA, in fact, we can affirm that when an organization bases its sustainability on plural economy it means that it perceives itself as interdependent with the system of which it is part, as a co-production action. Co-production is particularly explicit in SPGs. The economic principle of organized solidarity is conceived so that those who offer and those who demand jointly build the production of goods and services. It builds a symmetrical relationship among different actors. Consumers have the possibility of setting up new solutions to meet their needs and producers have the possibility to build a strong supply chain. Interactions among subjects, therefore, rise to a collective answer to needs, strengthening a social innovation approach. Thirdly, the local sustainable development is indirectly enhanced by the relationship of co-production with local governance, accessing forms of political territorial participation, also thanks to the role of the network. As we have seen in the map the members that work as “hub companies” have the characteristics to be an engine of development in the local governance, and the strength to be connected with other members. Thanks to activism of this actors in being involved in network’s actions, the network assumes a main role in the local governance, in order to manage issues linked to development, and to promote solidarity economy. These are not automatic processes, but the more the network can foster these relationships among hub companies and members of the network, the more it grows the opportunity of creating an inclusive social economy, building also supply chains based on values of solidarity economy. These company reorganize the technical space of the supply value chain, towards solidarity and fair rules. In this way, they have a political role in actions of advocacy towards social claims. Finally, the organizations perceive the network not as a closed space, but as a part of a bigger movement, and as a node of a solidarity supply chain. This strengthens the promotion of political actions, and it allows organizations to structure themselves into a supply chain in order to propose a whole economic process based on regulatory principles linked to reciprocity, for a more inclusive economy.",

69,3,International Review of Economics,22 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00398-0,Solving the income-happiness paradox,September 2022,Elias L. Khalil,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper proposes a solution of the Easterlin paradox, what this paper prefers to call the “income-happiness paradox.” Easterlin (1974, 1995, 2010, 2017) uncovered a contradiction in two sets of data regarding whether happiness tracks income. The correlation between income and happiness is positive in point-of-time data (i.e., cross-sectional data set within a country) as well as data across countries irrespective of level of prosperity. However, happiness does not rise with income in life-cycle data (i.e., time-series data spanning more than a decade) for countries where the average income surpasses about $75,000 threshold using 2010 price level (see also Kahneman and Deaton 2010). As “Appendix 1” details, there has been a wide-ranging debate about the Easterlin paradox and the two sets of data. This paper accepts the reality of the Easterlin paradox, in step of the assessment of most scholars (e.g., Kahneman and Deaton 2010; Deaton and Stone 2013). The cross-sectional data set is grit for the mill of the stylized economist—but it is anomalous for the stylized psychologist as best expressed by set point theory. In its textbook formulation, set point theory registers that whatever happens to substantive goods that the economist studies, and whatever happens to the consequent substantive utility that the economist studies, the person’s happiness returns to a pre-fixed set point (Brickman and Campbell 1971; Brickman et al. 1978). Conversely, the time-series data set is grit for the mill of the stylized psychologist—but it is anomalous to the stylized economist who espouses the eminence of income. In its textbook formulation, economic theory registers that whatever happens to substantive goods consumed, the outcome must reflect such change. That is, the person’s level of happiness must positively track substantive goods consumption.Footnote 1 This paper questions whether the inconsistency of the cross-sectional and the time-series data sets amounts to a paradox. If each set gauges a different kind of satisfaction, there would be no paradox. Some practitioners have reached the conclusion that we have two different kinds of satisfaction (e.g., Kahneman and Deaton 2010; Deaton and Stone 2013). Indeed, Deaton and Stone distinguish between “evaluative” and “hedonic” measures. Kahneman (2011, Chs. 37–38) calls them, respectively, “life satisfaction” or “life evaluation,” on the one hand, and “experienced well-being,” on the other. The distinction between the two kinds of satisfaction led Deaton and Stone to explicitly warn against the naïve use of “the term “happiness” or, indeed, subjective well-being”. They state that the term is unhelpful, as it is a catch-all term given the difference between the evaluative and hedonic measures: The important distinction between evaluative and hedonic well-being renders unhelpful the portmanteau uses of the term “happiness,” or, indeed, subjective well-being (Deaton and Stone 2013, 592). Kahneman also warns against the portmanteau use of the term “happiness”, as it is not indicative of a simple meaning: [W]e learned that the word happiness does not have a simple meaning and should not be used as if it does. Sometimes scientific progress leaves us more puzzled than we were before (Kahneman 2011, p. 407). This paper adds its voice against the portmanteau use of the term “happiness.” It also adds its voice against the use of the term “subjective well-being”—but for unrelated reason. As for the term “happiness,” we must tread carefully and specify the variety of happiness under focus. But for the term “subjective well-being,” the term connotes a confusing abridgment of two kinds of satisfactions or utilities. One is “well-being” à la economist’s concept “utility,” while the other is “happiness” à la alternative view of satisfaction that is supposed to escape the standard economist toolkit. Given that “well-being” is already subjective as far as the economist is concerned, the term “subjective well-being” is a pleonasm. If the term denotes something beyond the economist’s well-being, let us call it “happiness.” So, this paper uses the terms “well-being” and “happiness” as separate concepts—while avoiding the term “subjective well-being” as it amounts to conflating well-being and happiness. Indeed, this paper argues that well-being is “substantive utility” in the standard economist sense. Well-being or substantive utility function is a function of what can be called “substantive goods”. This paper prefers to use the term “substantive goods” and “substantive utility”—rather than “material goods” and “material utility”—to stress that substantive goods that occasion well-being is not limited to narrow “material” goods purchased by income. The set of substantive goods includes leisure, physical health, neighborhood security, environmental quality, marital status, and so on (see David et al. 2014). In this regard, the term “well-being” covers the empirical studies of social indicators that include these substantive goods—and even include mental health (e.g., Huppert and So 2013; Niemiec and Ryan 2014). However, the term “well-being” as used here does not cover empirical studies that include variables related to non-substantive satisfaction. Examples of non-substantive satisfaction, what is called here “transcendental utility,” includes: (1) reflection on current income while comparing it to an imagined past income; (2) imagining an aspired goal that lifts well-being above the normal, predicted path of the future; (3) familial/communal bonding (see Khalil 2021); and (4) hopeful disposition; (This paper ignores the latter two varieties of transcendental effects, as they are not pertinent to the solution of the income-happiness paradox). It is often the case that many empirical studies measures satisfaction by lumping “well-being”, i.e., substantive satisfaction that includes health, environmental quality, and other variables just discussed, with “happiness”, i.e., non-substantive satisfaction just defined (see David et al. 2014). The lumping is assisted with the “subjective well-being” portmanteau term (e.g., Pavot and Diener 2014; Miao et al. 2014; Cummins 2014; Gelatt 2013). Specifically, lumping takes place when well-being is not distinguished from religious engagement, which is better understood as non-substantive satisfaction (e.g., David 2014). Further, lumping takes place when aspired goal and comparison of income are combined to measure life satisfaction (e.g., Dumludag and Gokdemir 2022), when aspired goal, acceptance of current well-being, and social relations are combined (e.g., Vendrik 2013). In addition, many researchers suppose that if they take into consideration goods that cannot be purchased, such as social life and environment, they are discussing happiness, and not simply “economics” (e.g., Hendriks and Bartram 2016; Graham and Markowitz 2011). Such a supposition is based on defining economics à la Alfred Marshall’s sense, i.e., about material goods that are purchased, rather than about economizing the allocation of all arguments that make up the substantive goods function à la Lionel Robbins and Gary Becker (see Khalil 1996b). The conceptual axis upon which the proposed solution of the income-happiness paradox stands is the non-lumping of well-being and happiness. While well-being is a function of substantive goods that are not limited to purchased goods, happiness is another genus, transcendental utility. This paper defines transcendental utility as qualitatively different from substantive utility (well-being). This paper focuses on two varieties of transcendental utility mentioned briefly above: (1) the satisfaction from contemplating/ruminating a given well-being in light of an imagined well-being in the past; and (2) the satisfaction from aspiring/desiring an imagined well-being that can be achieved in the future. As stated above, the difference between the two facets of transcendental utility hinges on whether the context employed is an imagined well-being in the past or an imagined well-being of the future. The identified dual facet of happiness captures what Deaton, Stone, and Kahneman have identified as two different gauges of happiness. They have called them the “evaluative” and “hedonic” measures. This paper goes further and proposes a hypothesis of how these two measures or, what is the same thing, the dual facet of happiness, are linked. This paper argues that the link between the two measures is the key to solving the income-happiness paradox. It is a challenge to solve the paradox, as other attempts suffer from shortcomings. “Appendix 2” details the shortcomings of three major attempts: Kahneman’s, relative income hypothesis, and Easterlin’s. The proposed solution promises to supersede such shortcomings. The proposed solution is based on a framework laid in Sect. 1. The framework, first, delineates “well-being” from “happiness,” and, second, delineates the dual facet of happiness. While Sect. 2 analyzes one facet (happiness-as-aspiration), Sect. 3 analyzes the other (happiness-as-tranquility). Sections 4 and 5 present the solution. Section 6 concludes.",2

Taylor (2008) demonstrates that the existence of a provident fund and supportive financial benefits along with fair payments of the same bring workers’ satisfaction. Guest (2002) examines the work-satisfaction from the perspective of human resource management and shows that the work-satisfaction is associated with equal opportunities, family-friendly, and anti-harassment practices. It is recommended that worker-friendly human resource management be applied in the context of a partnership or mutual-gain framework. In the context of a developing Asian economy, Dharmasri and Vathsala (2012) investigate the work-satisfaction in the apparel-manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka. They find that ‘perceived organisational support’ moderates the relationship between ‘participation in decision making’ and effective commitment, and ‘participation in decision making and work-satisfaction’. In his recent study, Arslan (2020) aggregates three dimensions of financial, physiological, and psychological exploitations that cause labour dissatisfaction in the garments industry of Pakistan. In the context of the Indian experience, Thomas et al. (2010) explore the link between cultural behavioural traits, the potential effect of industrialisation, and multiple domains of the work-satisfaction. Their study demonstrates a statistically significant impact of both extrinsic and intrinsic moderating factors on Indian employees' work-satisfaction. Hechanova and Manaois (2020) find that satisfaction relies on ethical leadership that affects organisational norms and controls, and employees’ attitudes in the Philippines. In Malaysia, reward, referent, and expert powers are positively related to worker satisfaction with supervision. Moreover, both coercion and power influence satisfaction with supervision negatively (Junaimah et al. 2015). High-performance work systems are found significantly and positively correlated with the work-satisfaction in China (Ming et al. 2014). In the setting of garments global supply chain industry in Bangladesh, workers are striking imbalance family life; thus, the study suggests ensuring friends and family-related benefits like day-care facilities for female workers with children, transportation facility, and subsidised meal options at the staff canteen for employees (Syed 2015). Asma et al. (2017) examine the work-satisfaction of working mothers in the garments industry in Bangladesh. The study shows that organisational factors such as work conditions, wages, job security, and stress significantly influence mother employees’ work-satisfaction in this industry. Another study by Shabnam and Sarker (2012) finds that workers' level of satisfaction mainly relies on their amount of salary. Along the same lines, Zohir (2007) adds that workers' quality of life depends on festival bonuses,Footnote 1 attendance bonuses, and wage increments. Furthermore, Khatun and Moazzem (2007) take into account fair payment policies for the workers' satisfaction. They recommend several factors for deciding the minimum wage for industrial workers. For example, the minimum wage should be a living wage for the workers, an introduction of a unique wage structure for similar types of industry and adjustment of salary in relation to the economic development of the country. Although some research studies based on various nations demonstrate an inverse relationship between workers' wages and labour productivity (Kohpaiboon 2003; Hermawan and MSi 2011); those analyses disregard the nicety of neoclassical theory. The neoclassical theory makes it clear that a standard minimum wage regulation and an effective implementation procedure may boost labour productivity and benefit society as a whole (Gaffar Khan et al. 2019). Further, Sadovský and Matějková (2019) demonstrate that raising the minimum wage is not correlated with economic development. They believe that eliminating the guaranteed wage is a practical response to the situation and the demands of the economy. However, the authors’ approach may not be applicable in Bangladesh, at least for the following two reasons. Firstly, their study is based on European countries, and their socioeconomic and political structure is not the same compared to the South Asian developing countries like Bangladesh. Secondly, their study ignores the monopsony theory of minimum wage by Hirsch and Schumacher (1995). This theory is applicable when a single sector has market power through its production, and the Bangladesh garments-manufacturing industry is one such example. Contrary to the monopsony theory, Zdeněk Sadovský and Jitka Matějková’s study is not based on a single sector; instead, they take into account the whole sectors in a combined fashion of a country, which is contrary to the present approach of this study. In respect of wage and living standards, Syed et al. (2014) note that the garment workers in Bangladesh lag far behind the conditions of workers in other countries such as China, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. As a result, this industry is less efficient compared to the neighbouring competitive countries. For instance, the Bangladesh garments-manufacturing industry earns US$ 21.5 billion with an active workforce of four million in the fiscal year 2012–2013 while Vietnam earns US$ 17 billion with only 1.3 million workers in the same period. Though the garments global supply chain industry in Bangladesh has been playing a vital role in alleviating poverty, reducing unemployment and earning foreign currency, this industry is plagued by labour dissatisfaction. There are many studies covering human resource management, social, economic, and political areas of the garments industry; nonetheless, a few are in regard to labour satisfaction with the labour law. Through a systematic literature review, it is found that the previous studies are not comprehensive in terms of study areas, methods, and subject matters. Thus, this research study is indispensable to filling up the serious gap. The labour frustration occurs although Bangladesh enacts new labour legislation known as Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 to ensure workers’ satisfaction in all aspects. As the labour legislation commitment is to ensure legitimate rights and privileges for the garment workers, this study aims to find the factors under the labour legislation, which influence work satisfaction in the garments global supply chain industry. There are two objectives of this study: To analyse the provisions adopted under the national labour legislation; and To find the labour provisions under the national labour legislation, which influence the work satisfaction of the global garments supply chain workers in Bangladesh. Within this context, the paper addresses the following research question: What factors under Bangladesh labour legislation  influence the worksatisfaction of global garment workers in Bangladesh? This study assesses, evaluates, and analyses labour satisfaction under labour legislation in Bangladesh.",3

The test scores are here related to school characteristics and the link between student performance and school environment is analyzed at the quantiles. Most analyses rely on average values whereas it might be more effective for policy purposes to focus on the tails rather than on the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimated regression. OLS computes the conditional mean, and averages are not an appropriate indicator if the goal is to improve the lower scores and increase the general performance. Therefore, the selected model is estimated at the center and in the tails of the conditional distribution, by means of quantile regressions. We estimate the equation at various points of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable, such as for instance the first and third quartiles—representing respectively the lower and the higher scoring students—and other quantile of interest, like the deciles. The math performance of Italian students has significantly improved in year 2009 to remain stable afterward.Footnote 1 We focus on this improvement and look for its source not only nationwide but also at regional level, by sorting out two macro-regions, the leading north-center and the economically as well as educationally lagging south. The nature of the improvements, school or student driven, provide insights for policy makers to further advance the students’ performance having low/median/high math scores.Footnote 2 The results show improvements in school resources, like greater availability of computers and textbooks and labs, hindered by the widening of the gender gap and the worsening of the academic track, mostly attended by girls. The quantile regressions analysis for low, average, and high scoring students is complemented by a quantile regression decomposition to analyze changes over time. The changes in math scores are decomposed at various quantiles in terms of the impacts of the covariates (the school characteristics) and the coefficients (mirroring effects outside school control) to check whether the respective changes are due to variations in the explanatory variables over time, or in their impact on the math scores. Machado and Mata (2005) introduce the quantile regression decomposition, and Chernozhukov et al. (2013) provide inference tools. Decomposition analyses are usually computed on average using the Oaxaca (1973) Blinder (1973) approach, as in Gigena et al. (2011) or Barrera-Osorio et al. (2011) or Furno (2021). However, a decomposition based on averages does not allow us to investigate the tails of the student score distribution. Indeed, the impact of the coefficients and/or the covariates may change across quantiles and average values will not signal this behavior. Or the impact may increase at some quantiles and decrease in others. The result would balance on average thus hiding the tail behavior. Here, we implement the quantile regression decomposition not only with respect to time but also looking at regional characteristics, thus considering the impact of the Italian regional divide as well. This analysis provides results that would not emerge otherwise, and that can be summarized as follows. The average Italian math score has been below the OECD average up to 2006 and raised above the OECD average in 2009. To analyze the source of the improvement we implement a decomposition analysis over time, comparing year 2009 with the previous years. The analysis shows that school covariates steadily improved at all quantiles while the effect of the coefficients declined across quantiles changing its sign at and above the median, thus curbing the total change. The increase in math scores is explained by improvements in the school environment while the effect of the coefficients, which gathers the components unexplained by the variables of the model, improves in 2009 only for the lower scoring students. Next the student performance is decomposed at various quantiles separately in the north-center and in the southern regions, since the economic lag of the Italian southern regions is reflected in the education system (Seta et al., 2014).Footnote 3 In the north-center the increase in scores over time is linked to improvements in the explanatory variables, i.e., is due to improvements in school characteristics. The improvement is partially or totally counterbalanced by the opposite sign of the coefficients effect at all quantiles that becomes quite sizably at the top decile. In the southern schools the advances are due to favorable changes in both covariates and coefficients, the latter particularly ample at the lower deciles. The coefficients effects signal changes in the conditional distribution of students’ scores that are unrelated to school characteristics. They may be due, for instance, to an improved students’ attitude toward education. The combination of regional and temporal changes shows that the southern regions improvements have reduced the regional gap in 2009 but the gap is far to be closed. The regional decomposition within each period shows that northern school coefficients effects in 2009 are greater than in the south, although the increase/gap is smaller than in the previous period. In sum, the increased average performance in math can be related to a reduced regional gap and to an improved southern coefficients effect, which is possibly due to a more favorable disciplinary climate in southern schools. These effects could be further increased by rising southern school covariates, although the discouraging impact of a wide unemployment rate in these regions could curb the results. The novelty of the present work is in the quantile regression decomposition, which shows the dissimilar patterns of covariates and coefficients across regions and over time. These patterns cannot be evaluated by the Oaxaca-Blinder average decomposition analysis, and to the best of our knowledge such quantile-based decomposition of students’ attainment has not been analyzed elsewhere. The decomposition at the quantiles allows us to discriminate between coefficients and covariates effect for low/medium/high scoring students. The covariates effect shows an improvement in school endowment while the coefficients effect shows the presence of changes differing from school characteristics. The source of a discrepancy in the covariates—i.e., explained by changes in the covariates over time, and in the coefficients—i.e., not explained by the selected model, may differ across quantiles, as occurs in this analysis. The two effects may reinforce one another or may cancel out at some/all quantiles. It may be the case that an increasing effect of the covariates across quantiles counterbalances a decreasing coefficients effect, thus providing a stable overall discrepancy. In our model, the regional decomposition shows how the improved performance is linked to better educational resources in the north curbed at the top quantiles by worsened coefficients effect. In the south better resources are instead coupled with improved students’ attitude at most quantiles, particularly at the lower ones. These effects result in an overall reduction in the regional gap in students’ performance both at the top quantiles, due to the curbing coefficient effect in the center-north, and at the lower tail, due to the favorable coefficient effect in the south. The analysis provides clear policy implications. If the goal is the improvement of math performance of the low scoring students, at the low quantiles, the focus is on girls, on school size, on private schools, on math teaching in academic track, as shown by the simple quantile regression analysis. If the goal is to reduce the regional gap, the focus is on increasing resources to southern schools, as revealed by the quantile regression decomposition, coupled with policies quickening the job placement in the south. However, there is a wide-ranging debate on the role of school variables on student proficiency and the sole increase of school resources may not attain the goal.Footnote 4",
69,4,International Review of Economics,02 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-022-00405-4,Internalizing environmental damages and endogenous reimbursement in environmental conflicts: a game-theoretic analysis,December 2022,Sung-Hoon Park,Chad Settle,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Environmental pollution is a global problem, and environmental conflicts continue to increase as well. In the United States, 402 notices of intent to sue have been filed with the Environmental Protection Agency since 2013. In South Korea, 5,355 application cases for environmental disputes have been received since the establishment of the Central Environmental Dispute Mediation Committee (CEDMC) from 1991 to 2020, of which 1,289 (24.1% of all cases) have been received over the past five years. In general, the increase in environmental conflicts is interpreted as a waste of resources. But there is an interesting attempt in the United States to promote environmental conflicts — the private enforcement of federal environmental law through citizen suits.Footnote 1 Previous research such as Shavell (1982), Naysnerski and Tietenberg (1992), and Settle et al. (2001) argue that asymmetric reimbursement promotes environmental conflicts by increasing the expected payoff of citizens in court proceedings.Footnote 2 Asymmetric reimbursement means that if firms lose, they are required to reimburse some or all of the legal costs of the citizens, but if the firms win, they receive no reimbursement from the citizens. According to Naysnerski and Tietenberg (1992), as asymmetric reimbursement promotes environmental conflicts, firms will set up their autonomous efforts by installing anti-pollution facilities to avoid environmental conflicts.Footnote 3 These autonomous efforts will contribute to correcting inefficiency by internalizing external effects of environmental pollution. In this respect, asymmetric reimbursement has great significance in relation to environmental policy. However, preceding studies examining environmental conflicts with reimbursement for citizen suits focus their analysis on rent dissipation or social welfare, without considering the autonomous efforts of the firms (Baik and Shogren (1994), Park and Shogren (2003), Lim and Shogren (2004, 2005), Park (2010), Cherry and Cotton (2012), Chassé (2019)). Baik and Shogren (1994) and Chassé (2019) attempt to reconcile the effect of the two pre-commitments — an order of moves and a change in exogenous parameters such as each party’s ability to win the prize and the portion of reimbursement. Through this effect, Baik and Shogren (1994) and Chassé (2019) explore the efficiency of consequences of environmental conflicts between a firm and a citizens’ group. Baik and Shogren (1994) show that if the asymmetric reimbursement exceeds 50% of the group’s legal expense, a firm moves first and does not spend legal costs. Chassé (2019) shows that if a firm’s ability is greater than the citizens’ group, the result of Baik and Shogren (1994) can change — the firm moves first and the citizens’ group does not spend legal costs. The result of Chassé (2019) can be interpreted as follows. Each party’ ability can be described as a degree of fault or an objective merit of the case (Farmer and Pecorino, 1999; Hirshleifer and Osborne, 2001; and Park, 2010). Therefore, a high relative ability of a company means that the citizens’ group is at fault, and asymmetric reimbursement prevents the citizens’ group from participating in environmental conflicts. The result of Chassé (2019) is close to that of Park (2010). Park (2010) shows that if a firm is at fault, then it spends zero legal costs. In all of the aforementioned papers, if parties invest positive effort, relative to no reimbursement, asymmetric reimbursement increases the total amount of effort expended. In particular, Cherry and Cotton (2012) adopt the analytical method of experimental investigation to show that asymmetric reimbursement increases the social cost of enforcement. This study is different from the preceding studies in two crucial ways. First, previous studies do not take into account autonomous efforts by firms to reduce expected losses from environmental conflicts, while this study seeks to raise a model of ‘internalizing’ environmental conflicts by controlling pollution levels. Second, the preceding studies assume that the asymmetric reimbursement increases in proportion to the legal costs of citizens, but that the reimbursement rate is given. On the other hand, this study takes into account endogenous asymmetric reimbursement in which policymakers determine an optimal reimbursement rate to minimize the sum of the cost of pollution and the social cost. This distinguishes the current research from previous studies, and, as such, the results of this study differ from those of previous studies. In this article, we investigate if internalizing environmental damages and endogenous reimbursement affect the outcomes of the environmental conflicts such as total legal expenditures and the social costs. In addition, we examine what is socially desirable between symmetric reimbursement and asymmetric reimbursement. To do so, we investigate three types of environmental conflicts: a conflict with no reimbursement, a conflict with symmetric reimbursement, and a conflict with asymmetric reimbursement. Using a game-theoretic framework, we obtain three key results described below. First, both asymmetric reimbursement and symmetric reimbursement can induce a firm to discharge pollutants at a socially optimal level.Footnote 4 In this situation, environmental conflicts can go to settlement without going to trial. The result means that the reimbursements that promote environmental conflicts can ultimately reduce them. Second, if environmental conflicts go to trial, symmetric reimbursement incurs the total effort level caused by environmental conflict, the social cost and the total social cost as the sum of environmental damage and abatement cost, and the total social cost as the sum of ‘the social cost’ and the expected loss of the firm minus the expected payoff of the citizens’ group caused by the environmental conflict. Finally, a regulator can obtain an asymmetric reimbursement rate that minimizes the total effort level, the social cost, and the total social cost. This situation is likely to occur when the slope of marginal abatement cost is relatively smaller than that of the marginal environmental damage.",1

The economics of climate change has emerged as an area of contentions and concerns over the last few decades. The issue of climate change and its substantial economic impacts can be found in the writing of ancient Greeks and Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah in the fourteenth century (Gate 1967). Integration of nature into economics is the pioneering work started by Nobel Laureate William Nordhaus in the 1970s. The co-evolution of fossil fuels and global warming has inspired and provoked William Nordhaus to stimulate his research work in this field. The findings of the study by Nordhaus (2006) reveal that geography is an important source of difference in incomes in regions with high income. Temperature and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions have a close relationship. For instance, CO2 emissions increased about 1.9% per year while overall GHG emissions go up by 1.6% per year (IPCC 2007a). Nordhaus (2019) used the dynamic integrated climate change model (DICE) to assess the relationship of GDP growth with rising CO2 levels and also the effect of CO2 increase on the global average temperature. This rise in global temperature may result in a loss of around $15 trillion in 2150.
  Some of the empirical studies show an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emission and GDP per capita (Angelis et al. 2019). There is also empirical evidence that climate changes exert detrimental effects on food production, water resources, health, and the environment which may decline GDP (Stern 2006). However, few other studies find a positive as well as a negative association between per capita income growth, air, and water pollution (Shafik 1994; Kuznets 1955). The simulation results using the climate–economy model reveal that, in the presence of technological change, the impacts of capital accumulation on the economy are higher than the direct effects of climate change (Fankhauser and Tol 2005). Several scholars and researchers have shown serious concerns over the issue that how temperature, rainfall, and storms have influenced societies and thereby the economic performance of different economies (Carleton and Hsiang 2016; Dell et al. 2012; Colacito 2019). Changes in temperature exert adverse effects on the economic growth of 42 countries while it enhances the economic growth of 52 countries (Berg et al. 2021). A rise in mean global temperature would reduce the world output by 7 to 14% (Kalkuhl and Wenz 2020), 23% (Burke et al. 2016), 1.9% (Berg et al. 2021), and damages may range from 1% to 3.3% by 2060 (Dellink et al. 2017). The global average temperature is expected to increase by 2 °C by 2100 which will assert significant economic losses throughout the world (Malhi et al. 2021). Recently, a study by Newell (2021) investigated the relationship between temperature and GDP and finds no significant effect of temperature on GDP growth, whereas hot temperature significantly affects both GDP and agricultural production. The temperature rise has wide-ranging effects on economic growth as it reduces industrial output, agricultural outputs, and political stability (Dell et al. 2012). Some other studies have concluded that temperature is one of the significant climate indicators which has damaging effects on income (Adom and Amoani 2021; Hoang and Huynh 2021; Du et al. 2017; Dell et al. 2012; Alagidede et al. 2016; Lanzafame 2014; Sequeira et al. 2018; Deryugina and Hsiang 2014; Colacito 2019). Nevertheless, some other studies have concluded that it only affects the GDP growth of poor countries (Leta and Tol 2019; Henseler and Schumacher 2019). The hazard of climate also exerts damaging effects on the economy as temperature and CO2 emissions significantly reduce, whereas precipitation marginally enhances the economic performance of different countries (Ali et al. 2017). GDP growth significantly declines due to rainfall as it damages the production of agriculture and services sectors, whereas, for the industrial sector, its effects are not detrimental (Sangkhaphan and Shu 2019). Some of the studies used rainfall as an important indicator of climate change which has both negative (Tebaldi and Beaudin 2016; Dell et al. 2012; Alagidede et al. 2016) and positive effects on economic growth (Odusola and Abidoye 2015). Another study by Barrios et al. (2010) finds that rainfall is one of the important determinants of poor economic performance in Africa which can considerably reduce the economic growth of African economies relative to the rest of the world. Energy consumption boosts while CO2 emission damages economic growth (Bozkurt and Akan 2014). The findings based on the projections made by Pretis et al. (2018) reveal that rainfall is positively associated with both agricultural output and overall GDP. Variations in temperature above and below its historical norms affect economic growth significantly, whereas precipitation does not significantly reduce economic performance (Kahn et al. 2021). Minimum and maximum values of both temperature and precipitation are considered very important that assert both positive and negative effects on major crops of the agriculture sector (Pretis et al. 2018; Ali et al. 2017; Lobell 2017). Natural disasters have exerted adverse effects on economic growth worldwide (Atsalakis et al. 2020). Climate change significantly reduces economic output that requires revising the mitigation policies and implementing them without any further delay (Klenert 2020; Dietz and Stern 2020; Millner and Dietz 2015). The results of the existing studies on the relationship between climate change and economic growth differ due to the usage of different periods, variables, and methodologies. It is difficult to succinctly clarify climate changes and quantify their effects on different economic and social indicators. Table 1 presents the summary of the results of earlier related studies. The findings of the majority of the existing studies indicate that climate change in the form of changing temperature and precipitation asserts detrimental effects on economic growth. Despite several studies discussed the nexus between climate change and economic growth and conclude that climate change most of the time exerts adverse effects on economic performance (Burke et al. 2016; Dell et al. 2012; Pretis et al. 2018; Deschenes and Greenstone 2007; Alagidede et al. 2016; Kahn et al. 2021), there are some important gaps left in the literature. For example, we do not have enough empirical evidence on the asymmetric effects of climate change on growth. Similarly, to our understanding, there is limited empirical work on how deviations from the mean values of climate indicators affect economic growth. Besides, to the best of our understanding, limited literature is available that considers how and when extreme changes in climate indicators can exert adverse effects on economic performance. Finally, to our understanding, there is also very limited empirical literature that assesses the impacts of climate change on the economic growth of different continents and regions. Empirical evidence on such issues will enhance our understanding of how climate change is related to economic growth. This paper contributes to the existing literature on several grounds. First, most of the existing studies use only temperature and precipitation as climate change indicators. This study includes sunshine duration as a new explanatory variable. Second, consideration of the mean sea level pressure as an emerging indicator of climate change makes this study different from the existing ones. Third, for carrying out the empirical analysis, it is assumed that besides the average effects posed by climate change on economic growth, the extreme values of major climate factors also pose detrimental effects on economic performance. This paper tries to assess their effect on economic growth as they affect the agriculture sector adversely relative to other sectors. Fourth, temperature and precipitation trends deviating from their historical levels play a significant role to affect economic performance. It also aims to focus on the asymmetric effects of major climate indicators on the economic growth previously neglected. Fifth, climate does change continentally and regionally. The paper also contributes as it also focuses on the differential effects of climate change on different continents and a few selected regions. Finally, flood, drought, storm, and sea-level rise pose detrimental effects to the economic performance. This study highlights the detrimental effects posed by these hazardous climate factors too by using a dummy variable. The major novelty of this paper is the usage of three-dimensional analysis approaches, which make it comprehensive and distinct from the existing studies. The main objective of the paper is to investigate the relationship between climate change and economic growth in 179 countries over the period 1980–2020 and to produce new evidence on the climate–economy nexus. The main objective is achieved in three ways: first, this paper investigates the average impact of climate change indicators on economic growth in the short run and the long run. Second, it analyzes the climate–economy relationship by assessing the effects of extreme values (minimum and maximum) of major climate indicators as explanatory variables on economic performance. Third, it tries to assess the asymmetric effects of major climate change indicators on economic growth by using deviations from their historical means as the variable of interest. Fourth, it assesses that do natural disasters affect economic growth or not? Finally, it also aims to highlight the effects of climate change on different continents and a few regions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sheds some light on the existing theoretical support. Section 3 presents comprehensive material on empirical literature on this issue. The empirical methodology is presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the estimation results and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",

Frey,Andre Briviba,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A specific area within economics studies the determinants, behaviour, and outcomes of cultural institutions such as theatres, opera houses, festivals, museums, and the cultural industry. More recently, a separate field in modern economics has emerged that analyses the effects of cultural factors as a set of attitudes and goals on economic outcomes. Such cultural factors are beliefs, norms, or preferences that some or all of the population share. Up to now, these two fields within economics have been investigated independently of each other, although the two types have been introduced sharing the same name, Cultural Economics, creating confusion for the reader. This paper discusses in what respect the two types of Cultural Economics differ and how they are related. The goal is definitely not to provide a survey of the procedures and results of the two types; rather, we refer to the relevant literature. The aim is to characterise the two distinctly different approaches to ‘culture’ as clearly as possible. Table 1 provides a brief overview distinguishing the two types of Cultural Economics. We also discuss in which ways the two types of Cultural Economics can benefit from each other. The paper seeks to encourage scholars to establish links between the two types. This is so far an essentially uncharted but potentially fruitful scientific activity. It presents a difficult challenge because the factors to be considered evade easy identification and measurement, and there are reciprocal causal relationships to be taken into account. The following section looks at cultural institutions (First Type). The development of the more recent study of cultural effects (Second Type) is sketched in Sect. 3. Section 4 considers possible relationships between the two types and illustrates future research potential and expected synergies. Section 5 highlights further challenges and concludes.",

Since the mid-twentieth century, many researchers have focused on studying the factors that contribute to economic growth. One result is that investment in physical capital is not sufficient to guarantee long-term economic growth. The development of wealth in recent decades seems to be mainly due to the use of cognitive human capital (i.e., cognitive ability or intelligence and knowledge) to develop new technologies and more efficient production methods. Cognitive human capital is necessary for innovation as technological progress or more effective organizations and for adapting technology from other countries (e.g., Hanushek and Woessmann 2015; Jones 2016; Lucas 1988; Mincer 1958; Rindermann 2018; Romer 1990). Since the Industrial Revolution, societies have evolved rapidly, and Schumpeterian creative destruction has steadily dismantled traditional practices focused on mere expansion. This process was rapid and intense, quite different from what the human species originally evolved for: a rather incomplex life as hunter-gatherers on the Savanna for more than 100,000 years, accounting for more than 90 percent of human life history (Lee and Daly 1999). The Savanna Principle states that modern societies face unique challenges because humans evolved to adapt to an original Savanna environment—an ecosystem fundamentally different from that of urban and industrial civilizations in modern times (Kanazawa 2004; Kanazawa and Li 2018; Li and Kanazawa 2016). In small hunter-gatherer and tribal communities, survival was based on muscular legs, handling tools such as spears, and rather simple thought processes. The brains of early humans were designed to feed in the wild and raise offspring under harsh and dangerous conditions. For example, at a concrete-objective level, cognitive skills were used to develop stone-tipped spears into effective weapons and tools for hunting and fishing (e.g., Milks et al. 2019). In contrast, life in today’s world depends more on rapid technological progress, on abstract monetary units and interaction processes with distant partners enabled by high cognitive abilities. Highly intelligent people are associated with the creation of modern, complex and evolutionarily novel environments that are later adopted by people of more average intelligence (Gottfredson 2007; Kanazawa 2004). Modern societies are not only becoming more complex, but also more heterogeneous, as differences in wealth and income and between societies become increasingly visible through television and the internet. In within society comparisons, higher income goes along with more happiness (Easterlin 1974). In addition, happiness or satisfaction motivates workers to be more engaged at work. Resources appear to be used more efficiently and competences more enhanced, all resulting in higher productivity (Frey 2018; Piekałkiewicz 2017). However, do happier nations achieve higher economic growth? Do happiness and cognitive skills together contribute to wealth, i.e., do cognitive skills lead to more wealth and thus to more happiness, which in turn leads to more economic growth? However, growing inequalities, and especially the possibility of observing such inequalities within and between modern societies, can have a negative impact on happiness: There are always some people or nations who, on average, are richer, or more beautiful, or in some other way better off than you are (Buss 2000). The rich person as a visible neighbor makes you feel poor yourself. Moreover, the greater complexity and abstractness of daily life in modern societies may have a detrimental effect on happiness. Finally, the effect of cognitive ability on economic growth may depend on the level of happiness: Happier societies lead to greater well-being, which can improve the exercise of their existing skills in general, and cognitive ability in particular, further increasing national productivity. At the same time, however, it could also be that the lower the level of happiness, the more “urgent” it can be to improve one’s living conditions, and an important means of doing this would be the use of cognitive ability. In light of these theoretical considerations, the present study analyzed the role of happiness in regulating the impact of human capital, particularly cognitive ability (CA), on economic growth at the cross-country level. This study addressed happiness as an intrinsic motivator and positive psychological state of workers on a national scale.",

As such, it has become the most influential alternative approach to development.Footnote 2 The CA privileges people and their quality of life at a normative level. To do so, however, it proposes a descriptive account of human beings and their agency. Thus, Sen (1999, p. 19) regards agency “[…] in its older—and ‘grander’—sense”, encompassing both the change that can be brought about and the ability for critical introspection. The two elements composing human agency gain prominence in this definition, namely: acting or choice, and judgement or reasoning. The literature tackling capabilitarian agency, particularly in empirical terms, seems to have focussed on acting and choice (see Alkire 2009), leaving judgement relatively unattended. Reasoning within the approach, however, is of the utmost importance. An exploration of Sen’s wider work shows a challenge to the formulaic unrealistic content proposed by the dominant approach, i.e. rational choice theory, and a redefinition of rationality as reasoning (see Garcés-Velástegui 2020a, b). Indeed, Sen (2002, p. 4) defines rationality as “subjecting one’s choices—of actions as well as of objectives, values and priorities—to reasoned scrutiny”. Although this proposal seems indeed closer to human experience, it also seems to be wanting in two aspects. First, it seems to restrict rationality to self-scrutiny and leaves out impulsive or non-reflective action. Second, the fact that people assess their choices and preferences does not mean that they obtain optimal results, according to the choosers themselves, or even as intended. This is because humans fail. They do not consistently act according to their preferences and/or their well-being (Kahneman 2011; Thaler 2015). From a capability perspective, this could be extended to other-regarding goals as well. This failure has not been directly addressed within the capability literature despite it being a rather significant aspect for an account of human beings and their agency. That is the void that this paper seeks to fill by dint of behavioural insights and economics (BE). Challenging the dominant normative and axiomatic approach to rationality, BE describes how humans actually behave and performs economic analysis on that basis (Sunstein 2020). Most often, it studies the systematic deviations performed by humans from standard rational model (Corr and Plagnol 2019). In this sense, it offers an explanation of these failures in human conduct, accounting for reflective and non-reflective action, and can fruitfully complement the CA and its account of human beings and their welfare. To make that argument, this paper is structured as follows: First, the conventional rational choice model, as illustrated by the rational agent, is presented. Second, against that backdrop, the capabilitarian or reasoning agent is elaborated. Third, the misbehaving agent, as depicted by behavioural economics insights, is developed. Fourth, the case for a convergence of the capability approach and behavioural economics is fleshed out as an initial step on the pathway towards a behavioural capability approach. Concluding remarks are offered in the final section.",1

Consumer price inflation in the euro area, for example, reached 10.6 percent on an annual basis in October 2022—the highest level since the creation of the euro. After decades of inflation convergence, there is still significant variation among eurozone countries. While it was running at 7.1 percent in France, it moved into double-digits in Lithuania with an annualized rate of 22.1 percent. These inflationary pressures have emerged from a plethora of global and domestic developments, the extent and nature of which vary across countries. While the spike in international energy prices or supply chain disruptions may be transitory phenomena, tight labor market conditions with significant wage increases may reflect structural factors that could have a long-lasting effect on inflation dynamics. The continuing bout of inflation threatens hard-won macroeconomic stability in transition economies like Lithuania, where inflation declined from the peak of 1,163 percent in 1992 to an average of 1.7 percent after the country joined the euro area in 2015 (Fig. 1). Achieving disinflation and price stability in the post-Soviet period was an arduous progression with ups and downs along the way (Grennes 1996; Ghosh 1997; Christoffersen and Doyle 1998; Cihak and Holub 2001; Flanagan and Hammermann 2007). Cross-country studies are useful in modeling inflation dynamics, but may not be sufficient to capture the spatial convergence of inflation rates within countries. Furthermore, although the law of one price implies that price differences between tradable goods sold in different locations should be small, prices may still vary within a country due to regional wage differentiation, transportation costs, local taxes and differences in regional productivity or consumer preferences (Rogoff et al. 2001).  Source: Haver Analytics; author’s calculations Consumer Price Inflation in Lithuania. There is an extensive body of the literature on the convergence of aggregate inflation rates across countries and over time. Examining the nature of the deviations from the law of one price across cities in Canada and the U.S., for example, Engel and Rogers (1996) find that the distance between cities explains a significant amount of the variation in the prices of similar goods in different cities, but the variation of the price is much higher for two cities located in different countries than for two equidistant cities in the same country. Using a panel of 19 cities in the U.S. during the period 1918–1995, Cecchetti et al. (2002) conclude that convergence is slow due to transportation costs and differential rates of adjustment to small and large shocks. Similarly, Chen and Devereux (2003) study the dispersion of absolute price levels for U.S. cities since 1918 and find strong evidence that consumer prices converge over time. Comparing the sources of heterogeneity in regional prices in Europe and in the U.S., Beck et al. (2006) show that factor market distortions and structural characteristics, rather than market-driven forces, are the most important factors. Furthermore, Hegwood and Nath (2013) find that the speed of price convergence in the U.S. is faster with structural break than that reported by previous panel studies with no structural break that use similar long time-series data. On the other hand, focusing on Japan, Nagayasu (2011) shows that not only does the average inflation differ significantly across regions, but regional inflation responds differently to common economic and monetary factors, with no evidence of price convergence among regions. There are also studies focusing on subnational inflation differentials and relative price synchronization within developing countries. Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for 34 cities in Mexico over the period 1982–2000, Sonora (2005) tests the purchasing power parity hypothesis and finds that relative prices are found to be stationary and estimated convergence rates are relatively fast compared to other investigations of intercity price behavior in low inflation countries. On the other hand, investigating the relationship between monetary regimes and price convergence across 13 cities in Turkey, Yazgan and Yilmazkuday (2016) find slower convergence during the period of low inflation under the inflation-targeting regime. Focusing on the cities of Brazil, Arruda et al. (2018) reach a similar conclusion that price convergence is slow because of trade and bureaucratic barriers, market failures, and changes in the composition of price indexes. Examining the impact of region-specific and commodity-specific factors in consumer prices in Russia, Deryugina et al. (2019) find little evidence of association between subnational factors and inflation developments. Last but not the least, analyzing 82 cities in Indonesia during 2013–2018, Purwono et al. (2020) show the speed of inflation convergence varies with transportation linkages and localized initiatives to control inflation. This paper contributes to the literature with a systematic analysis of inflation synchronization at the city level in Lithuania, using disaggregate monthly CPI data during the period 2000–2021 and the instantaneous quasi-correlation approach that provides a dynamic measure of inflation co-movements with high-frequency data at any point in time. The empirical analysis shows that (i) the co-movement of city-level inflation rates estimated using the instantaneous quasi-correlation approach is significantly weaker than the extent of synchronization suggested by the simple correlation analysis; (ii) there is substantial heterogeneity in the instantaneous quasi-correlation of inflation subcomponents between city pairs; and (iii) there are significant changes in the degree of synchronization across cities over time, reflecting important economic developments in history such as the global financial crisis, the adoption of euro, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The granular evidence presented in this paper indicates that city-level inflation cycles and pricing behavior in Lithuania still lack full synchronization. This may reflect a range of factors including transportation costs, market concentration, structural and demographic differences, and labor market conditions. The disaggregate analysis at the city level helps better understand the evolution of aggregate inflation and identify country-level and local sources of heterogeneity in inflation rates. For policymakers, granular information provides valuable insights not only on the factors driving inflation dynamics and relative price convergence within the country, but also on the city-level differences in real wages and real interest rates that influence the directions of labor and capital flows and thus regional growth within the country.  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of the data used in the empirical analysis. Section III describes the econometric methodology. Section IV discusses the findings. Finally, Section IV summarizes and provides concluding remarks.",

As such, interpersonal relationships constitute the core of social sciences and can be observed from a plurality of perspectives and disciplines. However, quite surprisingly, their relevance has often been neglected by dominant economic theory, following the view that studying the communicative and affective aspects of social interactions is the aim of other social sciences. Most notably, since Vilfredo Pareto’s reformulation of choice theory at the beginning of the twentieth century, economic theory has set out on a path that treats “economics as a separate science of rational choice, independent of psychology” (Bruni and Sugden 2007, p. 146). In recent decades, however, interpersonal relationships have regained a noticeable significance in economic debate, especially in the field of behavioural and happiness economics (e.g. Becchetti et al. 2008; Bruni and Porta 2005; Gui and Stanca 2010; Gui and Sugden 2005; Sacco et al. 2006; Zamagni 2005). The attempt to provide more refined and realistic explanations of economic behaviours has led to overcoming the reductionist notion of rationality typical of the homo oeconomicus and to considering in economics issues such as reciprocity, nonselfish motivations, collective agency, and normative expectations (Gui and Sugden 2005). In this view, interpersonal relationships come back to the economic debate as “highly personalized human interactions”, in which the identity of the participants as particular human beings has affective or cognitive significance (Gui and Sugden 2005, p. 2). Different from general social interactions, which can also be anonymous and impersonal and may not require sociability, interpersonal relationships may exert a peculiar role in people’s well-being and socioeconomic behaviours (e.g. Zamagni 2005). This perspective has laid the foundations for the integration of economics with other social sciences, in particular, with psychology, in an attempt to explain economic phenomena (Bruni and Sugden 2007). Assuming this interdisciplinary point of view, this paper adopts a social constructionist perspective—drawn mainly from developmental and social psychology—with the aim of describing the peculiar, irreplaceable role of interpersonal relationships in human development and economic change. The core assumption of social constructionism is the interdependence between the individual and his or her social context. People construct and negotiate identities and knowledge of the world for themselves and others through their everyday social interactions and discourses, by transmitting specific meanings, values, knowledge, and skills to individuals. This means that objects and events characterizing the world cannot be recognized and understood without considering the life context to which individuals belong, including the culture, language, customs, power relations, norms, and economic conditions (Burr 2015). In this view, the quality of interpersonal relationships entertained within and across different organisations, along with institutional and economic factors, is important not only because it contributes per se to people’s well-being but also because it may impact people’s potential, objectives and actions undertaken at the social, political, and economic level. Positive interpersonal relationships acknowledge and value individual peculiarities, encourage individuals to express their goals, skills and knowledge, nurture and transmit prosocial values and motives that contribute to people’s human development and to virtuous social, political and economic changes. In contrast, negative interpersonal relationships may shun distinctive personality traits and leave unexpressed the individual’s peculiar potential, encouraging people to adopt uncooperative stances that may lead to conflict and tension at various levels of the system. This view enriches the perspective on human development advanced by the literature on the capability approach—normally focused on the institutional and economic aspects of human development—by considering the role that daily interpersonal relationships play in the well-being and agency aspects of human development. This more comprehensive account of human development is adopted in this paper as a profitable lens for interpreting the process of structural change, namely, a process of qualitative and quantitative transformation of sectors or other components of the economy, induced by individual and collective choices of the agents of the system concerning resource allocation (e.g. Bianchi and Labory 2019; Cardinale and Scazzieri 2018a). In this context, while theories of structural change may generally recognise the social sphere as interacting with institutional and economic dynamics,Footnote 1 they normally fall short of explicitly considering the role that interpersonal relationships, as “highly personalized human interactions”, play in human development and, therefore, in orienting the definition of actors’ objectives and actions of structural change. In this respect, this paper supplements the institutional and economic perspectives on structural change by making explicit the relevance of interpersonal relationships in shaping the trajectory of economic change. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly recalls the perspective on human development advanced by the literature on the capability approach. Section 3 introduces the social constructionist perspective on human development and enriches the debate advanced by the capability approach by devoting specific attention to the role of daily interpersonal relationships in influencing the well-being and agency aspects of human development. Section 4 builds on the social constructionist perspective on human development to describe the role of interpersonal relationships in the realisation of the institutional and economic structures of society and in shaping the trajectory of economic change. Section 5 concludes the article.",1
70,2,International Review of Economics,10 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12232-023-00415-w,The Keynesian nexus between the market for goods and the labour market,June 2023,Marco Guerrazzi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Starting from the introductory textbook on economics by Samuelson (1948, Chapter 12), the macroeconomic representation of the market for goods and services in the short run relies on a two-dimensional diagram which is known in the literature as the Keynesian cross (cf. Mankiw 1988). In sharp contrast with the Marshallian cross that relates prices and quantities in the conventional picture of the market for a given commodity, the Keynesian cross completely abstracts from prices and explains the determination of national income through the interaction of two quantity schedules. Specifically, considering a closed economy without any government expenditure, the former conveys the aggregate expenditures of households and firms—namely, consumption and investment—for any level of income. Such a schedule sometimes has been called aggregate expenditure—or aggregate demand—function (cf. Blanchard 2020). Given that some expenditures are assumed to be unrelated to income—for instance, for reasons of subsistence and/or for the urge of action of entrepreneurs—and taking into account that economic agents usually reply to increases in their income by saving a share of their additional resources, the vertical intercept of the aggregate expenditure function is positive, but its slope is lower than one. The latter schedule of the Keynesian cross simply represents all the pairs in which the national product is exactly equal to the aggregate expenditure and therefore its slope is identically equal to one. Such a 45°-line is often dubbed as the aggregate supply function even if it does not collect any reference to output technology and production costs (cf. Casarosa 1998). The intersection between the aggregate expenditure and the aggregate supply function pins down the real value of national income in the short run; indeed, in that equilibrium point, firms are producing exactly the amount of goods that consumers and investors as a whole intend to purchase. Consequently, none of these actors have any incentive to change its behaviour even if the achieved allocation is different from full employment and some workers remain involuntarily unemployed. Furthermore, the Keynesian cross is also used to provide a graphical rationale for the Keynesian multiplier, i.e., the dynamic process according to which an increase in the autonomous components of aggregate expenditure may be able to generate—after some periods of time—an increase of equilibrium output which is strictly higher than the initial stimulus (cf. Perotti 2005). Despite its clarity and its didactic worth, the theory underlying the functioning of the market for goods encapsulated into the textbook Keynesian cross is quite distant from the formulation of the central ideas crystallized by Keynes (1936) in his General Theory. Specifically, when he introduced the principle of effective demand (Chapter 3) and when he fixed the units of measure of his theoretical analysis (Chapter 4), Keynes (1936) implicitly traced out a strong link between the market for goods and the labour market without neglecting the possibility that the achievement of a short-run equilibrium—qualitatively similar to the one described above—may involve some adjustments in wages and prices (cf. Hartwig 2006). Consequently, the conventional picture of the Keynesian cross has to be somehow enlarged in order to accommodate the possibility of simultaneous price and quantity adjustments. In this paper, drawing on an array of works by Casarosa (1981, 1984), I build on the analysis of the market for goods developed by Keynes (1936) in the General Theory to draw some of implications on the dynamic behaviour of some typical labour market indicators by extending the traditional analysis underlying the Keynesian cross. Specifically, focusing on real magnitudes and distinguishing between the aggregate expected demand function and the aggregate expenditure function, I discuss the implied “daily”—or market period—adjustments of real wages that may lead to the simultaneous balance between the aggregate expenditure, the aggregate expected demand and the aggregate supply functions that qualify a short-run equilibrium. In addition, drawing on some recent papers and a book by Farmer (2008, 2010, 2013), I offer a rationale for short-run equilibrium unemployment due to deficient demand grounded on the searching-and-matching theory (cf. Pissarides 2000). From a theoretical perspective, the analysis developed in this paper aims at achieving two different goals. On the one hand, making some assumptions about the “daily” revision of entrepreneurs’ wage expectations, I explore the stability of the Keynesian short-run equilibrium, an issue that has never been explicitly explored before (cf. Dutt 1987, 1991–1992; Rivot 2020). On the other hand, avoiding to refer to the traditional representation of the labour market grounded on labour demand and supply schedules, I give some insights about the institutional setting underlying labour transactions in a model economy in which equilibrium output and employment are driven by aggregate demand and some workers may remain without an occupation despite their willingness to work at the prevailing level of the real wage (cf. Guerrazzi 2011, 2012; Guerrazzi and Gelain 2015). The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 explores the microfoundation of firms’ behaviour offered by Keynes (1936) in the General Theory. Section 3 derives the “daily” and the short-run equilibrium of the economic system as a whole. Section 4 addresses the stability of the short-run equilibrium by addressing the implied adjustments of real wages and employment. Section 5 reinterprets the short-run equilibrium of the economic system as the resting point of a searching-and-matching process with persistent unemployment. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

The new constituency, which represented roughly half of the voting population, forced politicians to shift their electoral supply to meet the demand of the female electorate, focusing their platforms and public policies in issues that either ranked lower or were absent in their original agenda. The initial conjecture about the existence of a gender gap in electoral decisions was supported by several studies that found noticeable differences in women and men voting behavior and in their political party predilections (Kaufmann 2006) as well as in the temporal conduct with women tending to change their voting preferences more often than men´s (Lott and Kenny 1999).Footnote 1 The explanation of the gender gap started a debate, with some authors suggesting that men cast their vote following a self-interest set of preferences, or what it is known as egocentric behavior, while social issues play a more important role in women´s electoral choices, known as sociotropic behavior (Welch and Hibbing 1992; Clarke et al. 2005). Other scholars, remarkably Eisenberg and Ketcham (2004), sustain the opposite, while Kam (2009) asserts that both genders vote similarly regarding the performance of the economy. The arguments to rationalize that women use egocentric economic judgments less frequently than men were mainly based on the view that there exists differences in values, as well as disparities in self-perceptions of men and women, with men more likely to perceive themselves and other males as autonomous and independent and women considering themselves as more interrelated with people and things (Deaux 1985). The common factor of this controversy is that the empirical evidence rests exclusively on survey’s data gathered before or after the election that are subject to various criticism about data quality that are not easy to circumvent. On one hand, respondents may give socially desirable answers or the answer that they believe are likely to please the poll’s sponsor rather than showing their true preference (Givens 2004; Karp and Brockington 2005). On the other hand, sample sizes are not usually large enough to reliably estimate the incidence of bogus respondents that do not belong to the district that the survey is inquiring or simply do not vote. The researcher’s dependence on surveys is attributable to the lack of actual voting records because countries rarely assign different polling stations to each gender like has historically occurred in Argentina until 2007. This paper analyzes the determinants of the electoral gender gap using a unique and unusual data set of gender-segregated voting booths, which help in getting better insights on electoral decisions. We conjecture that the gender gap is not driven by differences in values or self-perceptions of men and women, as has been conventional in the literature, but by labor market incentives. In the same line of research of Montgomery and Stuart (1999), Eisenberg and Ketcham (2004) and Strom (2014) that point at earnings derived from employment as one of the key factors influencing political preferences in the ballot box, we propose that the head of household status, associated with independent thinking and thus with autonomous electoral behavior, is an important determinant of the electoral gender gap. To preview our results that come out from a panel data of five presidential elections at district level, our estimations suggest that the voting gender gap reduces as women move from member of the household to head of household status. That is, as females face similar conditions and stimulus, their evaluation of the incumbent’s performance tends to be the same as men. This finding supports the developmental theory of gender gap claiming that major changes in sex roles influence women’s and men’s political behavior (Inglehart and Norris 2000). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature on gender gap relevant to the paper. Section 3 describes the gender gap in Argentine presidential elections. Section 4 presents the data and outlines the empirical specification. Section 5 discusses the empirical results, and finally, Section 6 summarizes our main contributions to the literature.",

The arguments are based on the recognition of the nature of cultural products, such as performing arts, museums and cultural heritage, as providers of positive externalities from which everyone can benefit regardless of the level of cultural consumption. In this paper, we aim to value the impact on individuals engaging in cultural institutions, in particular theatres and museums. This framework appeared most relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where cultural organisations have been severely hit by the lockdown-type measures enforced. In Denmark (the geographical scope of this paper), on 16 March 2020, the government imposed the closure of non-essential activities, a category that included museums, theatres, concert venues, and in general all cultural activities requiring the physical presence of an audience. These closure measures have had a marked effect on cultural consumption patterns, with a rise in demand for cultural services that require digital access, as well as an increase in cultural leisure activities (such as reading, listening to music, etc.) that help individuals to cope with the COVID-19 crisis (Tubadji 2020; Radermecker 2021), mitigating many of the negative impacts that lockdown had on the individuals’ well-being (Ascolani et al. 2020). However, the cultural activities that could not be attended during the period (such as live events) are the ones exhibiting a crucial contributory feature to individual well-being, i.e. social interaction (Ateca-Amestoy 2011). Not all types of cultural activity are equally relevant for individual well-being; among the different forms of cultural participation, Ateca-Amestoy et al. (2016) finds that attendance-based cultural participation contributes more to individual happiness than home-based activities (reading books, watching TV and videos, listening to music). As Bryson and MacKerron (2017) show among the 39 leisure activities considered in their study, “theatre, dance, concert” and “exhibition, museum, library” are respectively ranked second and third in their relevance to the reported happiness, behind “intimacy and lovemaking” and ahead of other cultural activities such as “singing and performing” (6th), “listening to music” (17th) and “reading” (26th). Given the acknowledged impact of engagement with arts and culture on individual well-being (see among others Michalos and Kahlke 2010; Brajsa-Zganec et al. 2011; Grossi et al. 2012; Hand 2018; Wheatley and Bickerton 2019), the purpose of this paper is to implement the life satisfaction approach (LSA) in order firstly to provide a monetary value for the welfare gain that cultural consumers (specifically, theatregoers and museum visitors) get from their cultural experiences; secondary to explore whether these cultural consumers have experienced a greater decline in well-being compared to non-cultural consumers, keeping fixed the other negative effects of the pandemic on personal life. Additionally, we estimate a monetary value for such welfare decline, i.e. lost use value. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 defines values of culture and presents the life satisfaction approach (LSA), comparing this technique with the preference-based ones. Section 3 presents the survey design, data collection and the variables used. Section 4 describes empirically the LS models including how we overcome the endogeneity issue, which is a common issue in the estimation of the life satisfaction equation, and shows the estimated results; similarly, Sects. 5 and 6 extend the models considering the COVID-19 lockdown period as a unique setting to analyse the loss of well-being experienced by cultural consumers. Finally, Sect. 7 provides some conclusions.",

These activities can involve at different levels in the three mentioned steps national governments or local administrations, not-for-profit companies and civic society organisations. Historically, the preferred standard approach in the field, alternative to a fully centralised institutional management, has been that of a public administration developing the first two (planning and design) phases and choosing with tender the best candidate organisation to manage the welfare service. This approach is, however, criticised and considered suboptimal when acknowledging that local administrations and civic organisations have complementary non-overlapping experiences, information and competences. More specifically, if it is reasonable to assume that competences on a specific service grow with management experience, civic organisations with an established past record in the field are likely to possess original and, not unfrequently, superior information and competences vis-à-vis the public administrations. The standard procurement process involving only the public administration in the first two (planning and design) steps is therefore likely to lead to a poorly planned and designed welfare service. The welfare improving potential of an alternative approach based on co-planning and co-programming can be understood from the recent judgement of the Italian Constitutional Court in response to an application from the President of the Council of Ministers questioning the constitutionality of Umbria Regional Law (No. 2 of 11 April 2019, Article 5(1)(b)) which, in connection with community cooperatives, sought to regulate the methods of implementation of the co-planning, co-design and accreditation provided for by Article 55 of the third-sector code. The government in its question alleged that the regional law encroached upon the exclusive legislative powers of the state under Article 117(2)(l) of the constitution insofar as it broadened the range of third-sector bodies, exhaustively defined by the national law, entitled to actively participate in the national planning of measures of social utility. In the motivation of its judgement against the Umbria regional government and in support of third-sector bodies participation to co-planning and co-design, the court said that the latter “are representative of the 'solidarity society', they moreover often constitute a widespread local network of proximity and solidarity, sensitive in real time to the needs that stem from the social fabric. Thus, they are able to provide the public body with both valuable information (otherwise achievable in a longer time frame and with organisational costs at its own expense) and an important organisational and intervention capacity. That often produces positive effects, both in terms of saving resources and increasing the quality of services provided in favour of the “society of need”. Having in mind the above-mentioned issues and events, our paper aims to provide an original contribution from an economic perspective to the literature of co-design and co-planning, developed mainly in the public management research. The field closer to ours with an established tradition in this literature investigates the role of co-production of welfare services intended as an innovative approach that overcomes the dichotomy between a public entity designing and delivering the service, on the supply side, and private end users of the service, on the demand side (Brudney 1983; Brudney and England 1983; Parks et al. 1981; Sharp 1980; Pestoff 2009). The main idea is that participation of end users to the production of the service can contribute to improve it incorporating in the design itself an improved knowledge of end users preferences and needs. This literature identified direct and indirect benefits of co-production. The intuitive direct benefit is the improvement in the quality of public services that better capture knowledge and preference of users (Bovaird 2007a, b; Ostrom 1999). The indirect benefit is the positive externality of improved citizenship (Levine 1984; Wilson 1981) and increased social capital (Sicilia 2016; Cahn and Gray 2012). Starting from this point, however, other authors (Alford 2014; Bovaird 2007a, b) progressively develop the idea that co-production should not just consist in forms of consultation and/or involvement of individual customers/beneficiaries of the welfare service, but should be extended also to a broader range of actors including non-governmental partners. The idea of co-planning and co-design departs from this approach and extends it to a multilevel governance setting where civic society organisations having past experience in managing the welfare service cooperate with government actors in planning and designing the service. This evolved co-production approach tend to develop where welfare services are less centralised and standardised and in a favourable political scenario such as in the analysed examples of child care welfare services in Sweden (Pestoff 2009) or in housing policy Canada (Vaillancourt 2009). Within this field, an approach closer to ours is that of Sicilia et al. (2016) who start from the limits of an approach planned and designed by the public sector only and focus on a more complex pattern of interactions between the public sector, non-governmental entities and citizens (end users) discussing a case study in Lombardy related to the management of services for autistic children. The Lombardy model included a first stage where the regional authority involved in a consultative way end user families with a survey to understand better their perspective and needs. In the second stage, the same regional authority promoted a tender identifying a series of projects where local health authorities were asked to collaborate with local non-governmental entities to design and manage the service. Sicilia et al. (2016) highlight that involvement of families in all phases of the process reinforced their trust in the institution and in the process itself. They also emphasise how this move to a “citizen-capability” approach (Sen 1993) from a “service-dominant” approach (Osborne et al. 2013) requires good coordination capacity of the public manager. Our paper aims to provide an original contribution to this literature by providing for the first time to our knowledge a simple and general theoretical framework comparing four different models dealing with the interplay between local administration and civic society organisations in co-planning, co-design and management of social services. In our theoretical analysis, we outline pros and cons of the four models in terms of activation of intrinsic motivations, monetary incentives, enactment of effort and competences of complementary actors and respect of competition and anti-collusion and corruption rules. We as well provide a simulation of the comparative performance of the four different models according to parametric assumptions on coordination costs and marginal contribution of each involved actor. We finally discuss how the empirical evidence from four pioneeristic case studies complies with our benchmark model and outline some policy suggestions.",

On the one hand, one part of the world does not have adequate access to food to live a healthy life: one in five people suffers undernourishment in developing countries. On the other hand, in Western countries, food overconsumption is leading people to numerous metabolic disorders: about a billion and a half adults are overweight. These two opposite extremes give origins to the famous “paradox of malnutrition”, also known as “double burden”, deriving from the paradoxical coexistence of the undernourished and the overweight not only across the global space but also within the same country (Passerini 2012). Undernourishment and the overweight should be highlighted, otherwise their socioeconomic impact will be disastrous, especially on socioeconomic inequalities. These respective phenomena are connected to food insecurity and food waste and represent the two biggest contemporary food system problems. Food insecurity and food waste are two distinct but interrelated concepts. Food insecurity “is a major determinant of undernutrition” (Charlton and Rose 2002, p. 383). This phenomenon might be quantified through the food poverty rate that estimates “the cost of a nutritionally adequate subsistence diet for a household” (Charlton and Rose 2002, p. 385). In this respect, food insecurity is often associated with a general condition of chronic poverty that covers the whole aspects of life (Barrett 2010), not only food access. Food insecurity is also a “major barrier to human development” (Clark 2015, p. 138) and might be defined as “the inability to consume an adequate quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so”. (Dowler et al. 2001, p. 12). Food insecurity is widespread in agriculture and is principally related to disasters (for instance, drought, earthquakes, floods, and war), which make food insecurity mostly seasonal or regular (Barrett 2010). Instead, food waste might be generally defined as “any food, and inedible parts of food, removed from the food supply chain to be recovered or disposed” (Aschemann-Witzel et al. 2015, p. 6458). In developing countries, food losses mostly occur at the early stage of the supply chain. Instead, in developed countries, food surplus and wastage principally happen at the later stages of the supply chain (Parfitt et al. 2010). In both cases, food production might be optimized, reducing inefficiencies, and matching more closely real food needs (Smil 2004). Food waste might also be seen at the consumer level through an irresponsible food overconsumption (Balan et al. 2022). So, food insecurity and food waste are the result of socioeconomic inequalities also in food access; while many people die from famine and hunger, other people can waste food or even die from diseases related to food overconsumption. Pope Francis (2013) has recently emphasized the existence of the paradox of malnutrition, inviting producers and consumers to change their behaviour through the adoption of ethical and sustainable decisions about food consumption. Not only are these decisions useful for foregrounding this paradox but also for safeguarding the global environment and individual well-being (Masotti 2021). To achieve these ambitious goals, however, a general reorganization of the food system is required. In this regard, Pope Francis argued that contemporary food systems should overcome the simple market logic based on economic advantage where food is understood as a commodity among many others. In his catechesis of the ""Our Father"", Pope Francis (2019b) lamented inequalities in food access that lead to world hunger, but “love cannot bear this, and neither can God’s love bear this selfishness. Let’s get this into our heads: food is not private property. Pay attention to this: it is not my bread. It is ‘our’ bread”. In this sense, private property is a secondary right compared to a universal distribution of food because what we really need is “our daily bread”, as praised in ""Our Father"".Footnote 1This is the time to make food a common good (Pope Francis 2019a) where ""common"" means “ours” (Ostrom 1990), i.e. accessible to all, because socioeconomic inequalities might be reduced through redistribution. To reduce these inequalities, several measures might be considered, for example, different individual consumption choices. In this respect, it is not the first time that the Roman-Catholic church suggested modifying individual relationship with food: for instance, analysing hagiographic sources, we might discover that early Franciscanism, especially among the minor friars, was the first religious movement interested in redefining the individual’s relationship with food. It is not the case that Pope Francis’s pontifex is deeply rooted in this religious tradition. Early Franciscanism adopted a different language to that adopted in interdisciplinary contemporary debates about food issues because they were friars and lived in a different historical moment, but it is intriguing to find this effort to redefine the individual’s relationship with food already in the XIII century. In early Franciscanism, we cannot find a complex analysis close to the contemporary debates on the paradox of malnutrition, but we may highlight an interesting argument against what we would define as food waste. This criticism was formulated through the concept of usus pauper [poor or restricted use] that is implied in the well-known Franciscan idea of “highest poverty”.Footnote 2 This paper will show that early Franciscan economic thought might offer a relevant contribution to the debate about food waste. In particular, some elements related to the concept of usus pauper—like the ideal food quantity and food type or the criticism against food storage—might be useful for establishing a more balanced individual relationship with food. I think this analysis is helpful for dispelling the idea that early Franciscan values necessarily lead to food insecurity because of their notion of highest poverty. On the contrary, I argue that from the XIII century early Franciscan economic thought offered an ante-litteram example of food education for promoting sustainable food consumption against food waste. These elements make the insights offered by early Franciscan economic thought valuable and important principally, but not exclusively, for those scholars who also adopt a civil and ethical perspective on multidimensional economic problems, like food waste and sustainable food consumption. The potential audience for this paper might be ecological economists, development economists, and social economists, as well as historians of economic thought and medieval philosophy, and also even people committed to nonprofit organizations. The paper is composed as follows: in Sect. 2, I will explore how the highest poverty implies usus pauper in early Franciscan economic thought; then, in Sect. 3, I will point out how food poverty leads to a more balanced relationship with food through the analysis of the main elements of the “Franciscan food education”; in Sect. 4, I will show how early and contemporary Franciscan economic thought might offer a contribution to the debate on food waste. Finally, some concluding remarks.",

Marak,Vaishali Pagaria,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economic downturns can severely affect people's employment, earning capacity, and savings. In recent times, the world economy has witnessed two major events, namely the global financial crisis of 2008 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Both these events severely affected the global economy, hampered economic growth, and negatively affected the earning capacity of individuals and household savings (Guichard and Rusticelli 2010; Choudhry et al. 2012; Barrafrem et al. 2020; Singh and Malik 2022). Young adults between 20 and 30 years of age are highly vulnerable to such financial threats. As the economy gradually recovers from such a downturn, young adults, in particular, tend to struggle the most (Brüggen et al. 2017). Therefore, such economic downturns highlight the need and significance of financial literacy and knowledge, which contribute to the development of a financial attitude and are key to achieving financial well-being (FWB; Philippas and Avdoulas 2020). Research on long-term financial behavior reveals that people of working age often do not prioritize saving for retirement. Nevertheless, the majority of people worry about not having sufficient money to meet day-to-day expenses in later life (Brüggen et al. 2017). India is characterized by a large population, a large percentage of working youth, a fast-growing economy, and a resilient and vibrant democracy (Kalyanakrishnan et al. 2018). India is experiencing a demographic revolution, whereby the composition of the workforce is steadily increasing relative to the population of dependents. India's share of the working-age population was 58% in 2000 and is expected to be approximately 65% in 2035 (Jain and Goli 2022). This growing working-age population is expected to influence household/private savings in India. Evidence suggests that the working-age population enhances the economic growth by improving savings (Lee et al. 2000; Loayza et al. 2000; Mason and Kinugasa 2008; Mason et al. 2016; Kalyanakrishnan et al. 2018; Jain and Goli 2022). For the working-age population, acquiring financial knowledge, as well as maintaining and enhancing FWB, is vital because this group is expected to play a crucial role in the progress and growth of the Indian economy in the coming years. Gaining insights into the FWB of working professionals is critical for numerous stakeholders. This includes improvements in the quality of life/success and happiness, mental health, interpersonal relationships, and overall well-being of both individuals and households. Moreover, organizations can enhance their reputation/brand image and trust (Brüggen et al. 2017). Further, FWB is beneficial for organizations in making decisions about new product development or introduction, market segmentation, and so on. FWB is also useful for governments and policymakers in measuring economic growth and prosperity (Mahendru et al. 2020). Over the last two decades, FWB has attracted the attention of researchers from various disciplines, including economics, psychology, marketing, consumer behavior, and sociology, among others. However, despite greater research output in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, many related areas and dimensions require further exploration. Research on FWB is still considered to be in the nascent stage (Mahendru et al. 2020; Kaur et al. 2021; Mahendru 2021), with several gaps in the existing literature. First, there is a need to explore the influence of various factors on individual FWB. Second, a limited number of studies consider the psychological factors affecting FWB. Third, there is a scarcity of research on contextual factors that may affect FWB, such as unemployment, inflation, and financial inclusion. Fourth, limited or no studies consider the life events affecting FWB. Finally, limited or no studies examine the consequences of FWB. To address these research gaps, this study aims to examine the determinants, as well as the consequences or outcomes of FWB. It contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, it considers the determinants of FWB, including psychological and contextual factors, as well as life events. Second, it examines the consequences of FWB, which was lacking in the literature. The remaining sections are arranged as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature and the hypotheses development. Section 3 presents the methodology used in the study. Section 4 shows the results and findings. Finally, Sects. 5 and 6 provide the discussions and conclusions of the study, including the theoretical contributions, managerial implications and limitations, and future directions.",

The literature considers ML a growing global issue (e.g., Loayza et al. 2019). Regarding its scope, the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2018) estimates that the amount of money laundered annually ranges between 2 and 5 percent of global GDP (i.e., approximately 1.6 to 4 trillion US dollars). According to the United Nations Organization Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC 2011), ML equaled approximately 2.7% of world GDP in 2009. According to Global Financial Integrity (2019), during the period from 2005 to 2016, potential illicit flows in and out of the developing world represented between 20 and 30 percent of the total trade in developing countries. These figures, despite being a rough approximation of the size of ML, highlight that the knowledge of the size of ML and its multifaceted effects on market competition and development is not only an econometric task but also an important topic for numerous economic issues. A vast body of literature reviews the economic and noneconomic consequences of ML (e.g., Unger 2007; Unger et al. 2006; Ferwerda 2013; Savona and Riccardi 2017; Romero 2020; Barone et al. 2022; Slama and Gueddari 2022). According to this literature, there are two antagonistic effects of ML on socioeconomic development. On the one hand, ML hinders the economic performance of a country for at least three main complementary reasons. First, because those who invest illicit proceeds mainly aim to launder dirty money rather than to maximize returns, ML generates unfair market competition between laundering-maximizing criminal actors and profit-maximizing legal actors if they compete in the same market. As a consequence, ML activities reduce the market capacity available to realize efficient resource allocation. Second, ML diverts resources from sectors with low capacity to launder dirty money toward sectors with higher turnover or with a larger use of untraceable transactions (e.g., cash). This second source of misallocation reduces marginal profits in cash-intensive sectors because of excess investment. As a consequence, in these sectors, the equilibrium price may be fixed at a level that yields negative marginal profits; “this makes it difficult, if not impossible, for legitimate business to compete against front companies with subsidized funding, a situation that can result in the crowding out of private sector business by criminal organizations” (McDowell and Novis (2001: 7). According to Unger et al. (2006), these detrimental allocative effects for the economy mainly affect international trade and capital investments, particularly in the real estate sector. Walker (1995) estimated for Australia that one million dollars of laundered money decreases output by 1.2 million dollars because criminals spend and invest the money less productively than the victims would. In general, criminal organizations overinvest illegal earnings in sectors that wash dirty money easily (e.g., because they typically use more cash and/or are difficult to detect by AML authorities because they produce intangible goods or services). For that reason, the excess investments in ML-friendly sectors and the presence of business actors that have a primary aim of laundering money instead of maximizing their profit lead to unfair market competition and the crowding of “normal” profit-maximizing firms. Moreover, ML may hinder economic development in several other ways, e.g., it weakens the financial sector due to the entry of illegal money (Kumar 2012), it increases the risk of bankruptcy and financial crises by threatening the financial market (Bartlett 2002), ML is positively correlated with corruption (Ospina-Velasco 2003; Markovska and Adams 2015). On the other hand, ML may positively affect economic growth, especially in developing economies, because of the reinvestment of laundered illegal funds in the formal economy (e.g., Masciandaro 1999, 2007). This result has been empirically validated by Stancu and Rece (2009) and Slim (2011). Uger et al. (2006: 9) analyze the multiplier effect of ML in the Dutch economy and conclude that “one billion of additional money laundering leads to about 0.1% more growth”. However, they distinguish between short-term effects, where ML seems to be a smart strategy for rich countries to attract additional capital inflows, increased government revenues, employment and growth, and long-run effects. In the long term, “Criminal money is a ticking bomb” (Uger et al. 2006: 7), as it attracts crime. According to their estimates for the Netherlands, one million laundered illegal proceeds are partly reinvested into further illegal activities, this will increase ML of the related crime by 10% to 20% resulting in Є 1.1 to 1.2 million of money laundering. More recently, Romero (2020) analyzes this effect in Mexican local economies. He observes that ML, by increasing investment of dirty money in legal local businesses, leads to short-term improvements in these economies. However, this windfall attracts additional criminal organizations that endogenously increase violence. As a consequence, Romero (2020: 21) concludes that these “gains are more than overshadowed by the subsequent rise in criminal violence”. Launderers' reinvestments in hotels, villas, apartment buildings, shopping malls, luxury stores, and restaurants, despite raising local revenues and expenses and increasing employment, provide benefits for local governments in the short run while, in the long run, ML increases violence. Henry and Moses (2020) investigate the relationship between ML and economic growth in a developing country (i.e., Trinidad and Tobago) by using the volume of fraud and narcotics offenses as proxies for ML. Different from the previous literature, their results are mixed and highlight the relevance of measurement errors in the economic analysis of ML. Specifically, they find that ML influences economic growth in both the short run and long run and that these effects can be both positive and negative depending on the proxy and time span.Footnote 1 Loayza et al. (2019) present an overlapping-generations growth model with both licit and illicit activities. They analyze the effects of ML by calibrating the theoretical model to the Colombian economy and simulating the estimates of the volume of laundered assets. Similar to Henry and Moses (2020), Loayza et al. (2019) find that the effects of asset laundering on savings and social welfare are ambiguous. In particular, if asset laundering comes mainly from drug trafficking, then it has a positive effect on aggregate savings and social welfare in the economy. In contrast, if asset laundering comes from common crimes, the effect is negative. In conclusion, the basic intuition for this hypothesis is that, in the short run, ML acts as a multiplier for employment and production by reinvesting criminal proceeds. Obviously, these studies do not argue that the overall net effect of ML is advantageous for the economy but that, at least in the short run, ML contributes to reducing the negative externalities generated by criminal activities on growth. To prevent misunderstanding, this hypothesis argues that ML acts as a multiplier not only for GDP but also for crime, corruption and terrorism (e.g., Gnutzmann et al. 2010). The increase in these phenomena undermines democratic institutions, and this comes at a significant cost to society in the long run. The main reason for this incongruity between the short- and long-term effects of ML concerns the role of institutions in economic development. According to Acemoglu and Robinson (2010: 1), “the main determinant of differences in prosperity across countries are differences in economic institutions”, but changing “the rules of the game in a society”Footnote 2 is a complex and slow process that requires several years. In contrast, a decline in ML activities has an immediate negative effect on economic growth via the ML multiplier. For instance, Sabir et al. (2019) argue that corruption and inefficient institutions can be considered the most important determinants of ML in developing countries. Specifically, they note that a weak institutional setting is positively correlated with corruption and that the latter is often essential for the success of an ML process. In this scenario, anti-money laundering (AML) policies, by disincentivizing corruption and illicit activities, enhance political and economic institutions and, in the long run, foster socioeconomic development. However, in the meantime, AML policies reduce the reinvestment of criminal proceeds in the formal economy or push these illicit proceeds abroad by decreasing economic growth rates. The aim of this article is to analyze the relationships among ML, corruption, and socioeconomic performance in a developing country where the first two phenomena are estimated to be particularly widespread. In particular, according to Transparency International Organization (2022), Iran is in the lowest quartile of countries in terms of institutional quality (147th on 180 countries). It is also considered among the highest-risk countries for ML in the world. Indeed, according to the Basel AML Index (2017),Footnote 3 Iran occupies an unenviable first place in this world ranking. For Salehi and Imeny (2019), the geographical position of Iran explains the high presence of laundering activities. Indeed, Iran’s neighbors—the first (Afghanistan) and sixth (Pakistan) largest world opium producers—often use Iran to launder their dirty money yield by smuggling drugs abroad (e.g., to Europe). For these reasons, we consider Iranian ML a meaningful case study for developing countries. To sum up, this paper contributes to the literature in different ways. From a methodological perspective, this is the first application of PLS-SEM to investigate relationships among ML, corruption and socioeconomic development. From a positive, we find that the direct effect of ML on socioeconomic development is not statistically significant while the indirect and overall effects are positive in our time frame (1997–2017). Accordingly, the normative implication of this research is that, in the short run, AML policies should be accompanied by an increase in public expenditure to offset the detrimental indirect effects that come through the multiplicative effect of a lower reinvestment of illicit earnings in the economy.",
