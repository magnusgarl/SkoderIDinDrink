17.0,2.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,09 February 2007,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-006-0045-1,"Uncertainty avoidance and the rate of business ownership across 21 OECD countries, 1976–2004",April 2007,Sander Wennekers,Roy Thurik,Niels Noorderhaven,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The prevalence of business ownership, expressed as the percentage of owner/managers of incorporated and unincorporated businesses within the labor force, differs strongly between countries. Even within the relatively homogeneous subset of the world’s economically most developed nations (the OECD member countries), the diversity is considerable. In Greece, approximately one in five in the labor force is a (non-agricultural) business owner, whereas in Finland approximately one in 14 operates a business of his own (average rates 1972–2004; see e.g. van Stel 2005; Thurik and Wennekers 2004). A well-known approach explains this disparity by differences in prosperity (Kuznets 1971). The richer the country, the fewer business owners there are. However, the first cracks in this negative relationship appeared in the late 70s (Blau 1987; Acs et al. 1999). In fact, the negative relationship between prosperity and business ownership now seems to be breaking down in several (but not all) of the most prosperous countries, as they have shown a resurgence of business ownership rates in the past decades (see Carree et al. 2002; van Stel and Carree 2004, for an analysis of the relationship between economic development and business ownership, and Carree and Thurik 2003, for a literature survey). Moreover, the dominance of economic variables explaining business ownership rates has been questioned, and other explanatory factors, such as culture, have been brought forward (Hofstede et al. 2004). Slowly, data material has become available showing that business ownership rates follow some U-shaped path when related to the level of economic development (Thurik and Wennekers 2004). The switch between the downward phase of this U-shape and the upward one has to do with the changing role of entrepreneurial activities. The role of entrepreneurship has changed dramatically, fundamentally shifting between what Audretsch and Thurik 2001) introduced as the model of the managed economy and that of the entrepreneurial economy. In particular, Audretsch and Thurik (2001) argue that the model of the managed economy is the political, social and economic response to an economy dictated by the forces of large-scale production, reflecting the predominance of the production factors of capital and (unskilled) labor as the sources of competitive advantage (see also Audretsch and Thurik 2004). By contrast, the model of the entrepreneurial economy is the political, social and economic response to an economy dictated not just by the dominance of the production factor of knowledge—which can be identified as replacing the more traditional factors as the source of competitive advantage—but also by a very different, but complementary, factor: entrepreneurship capital, or the capacity to engage in and generate entrepreneurial activity. By and large, countries first move from a predominantly rural economy with a high level of business ownership to an industrial one where scale economies dominate, and then again to a service economy where small scale entrepreneurial activities are essential in many industries (see Wennekers et al. 2005, for an example of the U-shape using data material of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor). Differences in the business ownership rate between countries seem to be persistent despite the U-shaped path that appears driven by the level of economic development. There is a general intuition that cultural rather than economic variables play a role in explaining these differences, since cultural aspects are relatively time invariant (Noorderhaven et al. 2004). The present paper investigates the role of uncertainty avoidance. Elsewhere the role of variables such as post-materialism and dissatisfaction is studied (Uhlaner and Thurik 2007; Noorderhaven et al. 2004). At the individual level, the decision to become a business owner can be viewed as the outcome of a process of occupational choice. This approach views agents as utility maximizers making an occupational choice decision—to become employee or business owner—on the grounds of the utility associated with the expected returns from the two activity types.Footnote 1 Personal characteristicsFootnote 2 as well as cultural, institutional and economic conditions will influence these individual choices. An aggregation of these occupational choices at the level of countries shows the cumulative and interactive influence of the different determinants (Verheul et al. 2002). In the present paper, we will focus on a specific cultural determinant of business ownership, viz., uncertainty avoidance, which to date has received only scant attention. Our first research question considers the concepts of uncertainty and risk and the relevance of cultural attitudes towards uncertainty for the occupational choice with respect to business ownership. What effects of uncertainty avoidance on the choice for business ownership can be assumed to exist at the individual level, and how does this influence work at the country level? Our second question pertains to the direct influence of uncertainty avoidance on the prevalence of business ownership at the country level. Are differences in business ownership rates at the country level related to differences in uncertainty avoidance? Our third question deals with an indirect role of uncertainty avoidance through an influence on the relationship between GDP per capita and business ownership. Do differences in uncertainty avoidance alter the trade-offs between the opportunity costs and benefits of entrepreneurship in relationship to the level of economic development, and hence indirectly affect business ownership rates?",158

M. van den Bergh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Under the umbrella of economics as a broad discipline, the subdisciplines ‘evolutionary economics’ and ‘environmental economics’ (including ‘resource economics’) have developed quite independently. These two fields share many characteristics and can be combined in a fruitful way. They both make use of certain insights from biology, in particular ecology. In the case of environmental economics, this is illustrated best by the study of renewable resource use and ecosystem management. In the case of evolutionary economics, the biological inspiration expresses itself most clearly in the use of notions and mechanisms originating from population theory. This paper intends to show that environmental economics can greatly benefit from approaches and insights of evolutionary economics in addressing a number of core issues, both in fundamental and policy research domains. In addition, it will be argued that the study of certain themes within evolutionary economics could benefit from giving more explicit attention to the role of environmental and resource factors. Although one might think that environmental (and resource) economics is occupied predominantly by applied policy issues, it in fact addresses a number of rather fundamental research questions. These relate to the persistence of many environmental externalities, the place of humans in the biosphere, the role of ethics and (monetary) values, and the limits to regulating the behavior of humans and economic organizations. In all these domains, evolutionary notions play a role, be it at a biological or economic (including institutional and technological) level. Not surprisingly, because of the fundamental issues involved, heterodox schools are well represented in the environmental debate, including within environmental economics. In fact, environmental economics has proven to be an important source of fundamental critique on mainstream economics (e.g., Daly and Cobb 1989). Ecological economics, next to being a platform for multidisciplinary research, has tried to accommodate the various critiques and offer viable alternatives (van den Bergh 2001). This new ‘field’ is indeed very close in spirit to evolutionary economics, in a number of ways. Dissatisfaction with neoclassical mainstream theory was an important reason for the emergence of either field. Both evolutionary and ecological economics cover a range of disciplinary angles, in addition to the dominant economics angle, such as development studies, geography, ecology and hydrology in the case of ecological economics, and technology studies, management theory, behavioral economics, evolutionary modelling and economic history in the case of evolutionary economics. Most importantly, generalized non-genetic evolutionary theory has been proposed by many influential ‘ecological economists’ as the main framework to realize a full understanding of the complex dynamics of interactions between human and natural systems (Boulding 1978; Norgaard 1984; Faber and Proops 1990; Costanza et al. 1993; Ayres 1994; Gowdy 1994). Environmental economics, and more so ecological economics, are not only subdisciplines of economics, but at the same time part of the broad field of environmental sciences. It is surprising and a missed opportunity that evolutionary thought—both genetic and non-genetic—has been so rarely invoked to allow us to understand better the causes of environmental problems as well as the characteristics of and limits to solutions. With some notable exceptions (see especially Section 3), natural scientists within the environmental sciences seem to have focused attention on practical issues (e.g., pollution effects in food webs), thus neglecting fundamental evolutionary aspects. Many social scientists working within the environmental sciences often are not well informed about evolutionary thought, and some even adopt the old-fashioned idea that evolution is a ‘dangerous and explosive’ notion within the realm of the social sciences. This misplaced political correctness does more harm than good, as it goes along with a focus on proximate causes of environmental degradation, misinterpreting or even overlooking the ultimate causes. As a result, one may easily arrive at ineffective or counter-productive policy suggestions. It is perhaps good to emphasize that evolutionary thought is a-political, and can be as easily (mis)used to support left-wing ideals (e.g., inequality is a tendency of evolutionary economic systems—its correction requires robust public institutions) as right-wing ideals (inequality is an inevitable outcome of evolution—learn to live with it). In a very informative overview of the meaning of evolution for the environmental sciences, Penn (2003) surveys the evolutionary explanations of “why humans are ecologically destructive, overpopulate, overconsume, exhaust common pool resources, discount the future, and respond maladaptively to modern environmental hazards.” (Penn 2003, p1). He notes that evolutionary biology provides fundamental insights into various environmentally relevant aspects of human behavior, such as cooperation, morality and reproduction. Regarding the latter, it is evident that population pressure is an important factor of human overexploitation of the natural environment, not only in particular regions characterized by extreme food and water shortages, but increasingly so at the global scale. A very general perspective arising from evolutionary thinking is that human-induced environmental degradation can be interpreted as the human species being maladapted to its current natural environment. Maladaptation may even get worse since the environment is not exogenous but is being transformed by humans at an unprecedented rate. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 mentions the most important contributions in environmental economics that have adopted an evolutionary approach. In addition, it briefly evaluates mainstream environmental economics on the basis of ‘evolutionary criteria’, and summarizes the main similarities and distinctions among environmental economics, ‘ecological economics’ and evolutionary economics. Section 3 examines the implications of evolutionary analysis at the level of ecosystems and natural resources, and suggests that the notion of ‘resilience’ can be useful to evolutionary economics. Section 4 considers economic growth with environment and resources from an evolutionary angle, and argues that major transitions in human-economic history can only be fully understood if the coevolutionary role of environmental resources is sufficiently recognized. Section 5 discusses the notion of economic progress in an evolutionary context. It presents a number of interpretations of evolutionary progress and indicates various reasons for not expecting such progress always to occur. Next, Section 6 presents an evolutionary perspective on environmental regulation. Section 7 concludes.",84

Geels,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is surprising that little systematic attention has been given to the topic of niches in evolutionary theories of technological change. Recently, a number of scholars have sought to conceptualize the role of niches, but this has not often been treated as a central issue for further theory development. Following scholars such as Tisdell and Seidl (2004); Kauffman (1995, 283), and others, we argue that the challenge for future work is to build a theory as to the way in which technical change drives its own transformation by the persistent creation of new niches. Our aim is to provide building blocks for such a theory. The development of a niche theory is particularly important because it will shed light on the far from fully understood issue of the creation and survival of novelty leading to discontinuity and hence the establishment of new technological species. This article starts with a historiographical overview. We will explore systematically how niches have been conceptualized in various evolutionary theories of technical change coming from different traditions: evolutionary economics (e.g. Levinthal 1998; Nelson and Winter 1982; Saviotti 1996; Ziman 2000; Malerba et al 2003), history of technology (e.g. Basalla 1988; Constant 1980; Mokyr 1990a), science and technology studies (e.g. Rip and Kemp 1998; Schot 1998) and technology management (e.g. Rosenkopf and Tushman 1994; Van de Ven and Garud 1994).Footnote 1 It is important to note that, although we discuss and use the existing literature, we do not always follow particular understandings put forward by introduced authors. Our main aim is to use their interpretations of evolutionary change to elaborate more systematically on the role of niches. This elaboration often builds on the important insight that niches must not be seen as resource spaces that pre-exist waiting to be filled in. Instead, we emphasize that they develop as a product of agency. Innovators do not succeed, in other words, because their innovations fortuitously fit into predefined sets of niche constraints; rather, they construct their own niches. We are not able to do full justice to the work of the ‘shoulders we stand on’ but rather select, discuss and sometimes reformulate those elements, which help to create a better understanding of the role of niches in technical change. A discussion that includes evolutionary accounts from a range of disciplines and literatures is rare. Yet it is precisely the combination of insights from the various traditions that sheds new light on the development of new technological species and hence on the origins of discontinuity.  In the second part of this article, we will show the complementarity of the various conceptualizations of the role of niches, and by doing so bring forward the varied kinds of niches that play a role in technical change. We will critically discuss and develop a taxonomy of four different basic evolutionary mechanism (and patterns of change that follow from them) responsible for discontinuity in technical change: natural selection, punctuated equilibrium, market niche selection and technological niche selection. For each pattern, we will highlight the specific role of niches.",200

They observed that the patterns of evolution between plants and butterflies were closely interrelated. As plants developed toxic chemicals to prevent attacks from butterflies, the insects adapted by creating resistance to these chemicals. Examples of these patterns of coevolution abound in the biological world. Three main types of interactions are generally observed (Roughgarden 1979):
 Parasitic relationships. In this case, one species benefits at the expense of the other. The butterflies-plants relationship described by Ehrlich and Raven (1964) is an example of a parasitic relationship. Commensal relationships. One species benefits from another at negligible harm to the other species. An example is the presence of harmless bacteria living in human organisms (Hooper and Gordon 2001). Mutualistic relationships. Both species benefit from one another. Fig trees, for instance, provide food for wasps, while the latter act as pollinators for the figs. As a result, the reproductive characteristics of the two species are intrinsically linked to one another (Herre 1989). Models of coevolution in biology fuse population dynamics models with equations describing changes in gene frequencies. These models usually include a set of two differential equations for each interacting species. One equation represents population dynamics while the other reflects gene frequency changes (Levin and Udovic 1977; Roughgarden 1979; May and Anderson 1983). The idea behind this modeling approach is that numerical abundance of one species selects for the genetic characteristics of the other species, and conversely. Coevolutionary models are nowadays very sophisticated and include stochastic elements to describe sequences of mutations (Dieckmann et al. 1995; Dieckmann and Law 1996). Questions addressed by models of coevolution in biology relate to the final equilibrium configuration of ecological communities and the dynamics of coevolution, e.g. the presence of time lags in the adaptive response from one species to another. In recent years, the concept of coevolution has been transferred from the biological sphere to a large range of applications in socioeconomic contexts. For instance, the coevolution analogy has been used to describe the complex interactions between genes and culture (Lumsden and Wilson 1981), behavior and institutions (van den Bergh and Stagl 2003) and technology and industry (David and Rothwell 1996). In environmental economics, Norgaard (1984, 1994) was the first to suggest the use of coevolution to describe environment-economy interactions, although in a somewhat loose interpretation. In his view, development is shaped by a process of coevolution between several subsystems, namely, knowledge, values, organizations, technology, and the environment, so that each of these subsystems creates selective pressure on the others. As an illustration, Norgaard (1994) explains the current lock-in of fossil fuel technologies as the result of a coevolution of urbanization, technical progress and the development of the car industry. Another example of environment–economy interaction is the coevolving pattern of human activity and climate change (Schneider and Londer 1984). By altering the composition of the atmosphere, human activity induces climate change, which forces society to adapt by way of the improved management of natural resources. Climate change in combination with intensive grazing, for instance, can cause desertification in certain areas, which, in turn, can force humans to migrate or to adopt cultures adapted to arid climates. Using a strict definition, environment–economy coevolution refers to the fact that economic activities select for genetic traits of biological species. A well-studied example of such coevolution is the impact of fishing activities on the genetic evolution of fish (Stokes et al. 1993; Heino 1997). The choice of fishing gear and fishing mesh sizes selects for size and swimming abilities among the various species of fishes (Policansky 1993). In turn, these genetic changes force fishermen to adapt and modify their fishing strategies. The objective of the present paper is to present a model of environment–economy coevolution, which reflects the impact of economic activities on the biological evolution of species, and vice versa. Using a coevolutionary framework may prove particularly useful in situations in which regulation is difficult, due for instance to the presence of bounded rationality. In these situations, environmental change cannot be perfectly anticipated, and economic activities are adaptive rather than optimal responses to this change. Although the concept of coevolution has been repeatedly mentioned in the literature, so far there has been little attempt explicitly to formalize it in a coevolutionary model. The present model of coevolution is applied to the problem of pesticide resistance management. Pesticide resistance has become a subject of major concern. The National Research Council (1986) records that, between 1950 and 1980, nearly 500 pest species of agricultural importance have developed resistance to the principal classes of pesticides. This evolution, described in Fig. 1, is a direct consequence of the widespread use of intensive pesticide treatment in agriculture. Today, the spread of pesticide resistance poses major threats to agricultural yields. As an example, Tyler Miller (1992) states that, between 1940 and 1984, crop losses due to pests increased from 7 to 13%, although there was a 12-fold increase in pesticide use within the same period. 
 Increase in number of cases of resistant species (reproduced from American National Research Council (1986)) Economic models have treated the issue of pesticide resistance management in optimization models within the neoclassical economic tradition. Regev et al. (1983) derive the optimal dosage of pesticide under a constraint of decreasing pesticide susceptibility among pests, modeled as a non-renewable resource. This modeling choice eludes the issue of reversible resistance and is not based on a formal ecological theory. A similar approach of modeling resistance was used by Laxminarayan (2001) and Brown and Layton (1996) in dealing with antibiotic resistance. Munro (1997) offers a more satisfactory way to model pest resistance using sound ecological-genetic modeling. The main intuition in his model is that economic activities reduce the fitness of genes, which confers susceptibility to pests, so that genes carrying resistant traits tend to be selected. Resistance allows the pest population to be less affected by pesticide use, so that the population of pests eventually recovers as more pests become resistant. Munro compares the optimal pesticide dosage of a myopic agent, who only understands pest population dynamics, but not genetic evolution, with that of a farsighted agent, who takes both pest population dynamics and genetic evolution into account when solving the optimization problem. He finds that the equilibrium obtained in the latter case exhibits a lower level of resistance and a lower pest population for the same level of pesticide use. Nevertheless, this model assumes perfect rationality of economic agents and is thus not a model of coevolution, since economic activities are not truly “evolving”. The model presented in this paper takes Munro’s (1997) analysis as a starting point for the ecological side of the coevolutionary framework. Just as in Munro, we consider a situation in which a large area of land is used for the production of a crop. This crop is subject to a pest, whose presence reduces the yield of the crop. A population of individual farmers obtains revenues from harvesting the crop. The farmers use pesticides to limit pest nuisance and thus to increase crop yields and revenues. Nevertheless, intensive use of pesticides favors the development of resistant strains in the genetic structure of the pest. As resistance spreads, pesticides become less effective, and the pest population may eventually recover. In short, three main types of interactions must be considered: (1) a large pest population reduces economic revenues; (2) economic activities select for resistant genes; and (3) the spread of resistant genes affects the size of the pest population. The model differs from Munro, however, in that it includes evolutionary modeling of economic strategies. Economic agents are assumed to be boundedly rational, i.e. they are not capable of anticipating any aspect of biological and ecological evolution and thus cannot compute the optimal level of pesticide use that minimizes resistance. Economic evolution represents the change in the distribution of pesticide strategies in the population of economic agents. In this model, economic and ecological evolution are combined in a system of differential equations. This makes the model truly “coevolutionary”. The analysis is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model by presenting its three main building blocks: namely, genetic evolution of resistance; pest population dynamics; and economic evolution of agricultural pesticide strategies. Section 3 studies the steady states and discusses some general aspects of the dynamics of the coevolutionary system. Section 4 presents further results on possible forms of dynamic behavior using a numerical illustration. Section 5 draws policy implications from the analysis. Section 6 summarizes the main results and concludes.",23

An early inquiry by Foster (1987) develops an evolutionary perspective on macroeconomic issues in comparison to Keynesian and post-Keynesian positions. This work was later extended to an econometric approach focusing on the impact of logistic diffusion processes on macroeconomic time series (Foster 1992, Foster and Wild 1999). Another strand of thought is informed by the seminal work of Nelson and Winter (1982, Chap. 4) on innovation driven structural change in industries. The macroeconomic implications of their approach are discussed in terms of disequilibrium growth processes accompanied by productivity changes at the aggregate level, GNP growth rate variations, and a catching up and falling behind in international competitiveness (Silverberg and Verspagen 1995, Fagerberg et al. 1997, Fagerberg and Verspagen 2002, Los and Verspagen 2006, Metcalfe et al. 2006). The agenda of the latter contributions partly overlaps with that of macroeconomic “out-of-equilibrium” models that draw much of their inspiration from the neo-Austrian theory of production and growth (Amendola and Gaffard 1998, 2003, Amendola et al. 2005). However, the former literature focuses on how the evolutionary process of structural change results in disequilibria, breaks, and fluctuations reflected in growth accounting at the regional, national, and international levels. The latter writings, in contrast, emphasize how the results of the restructuring of the productive capacity hinge on whether or not inter-temporal complementarities can be upheld in the process of innovation-driven growth. This is the problem of coordination in the economy. It relates to the influence of expectations held by the agents, to the intra-temporal and inter-temporal working of the price mechanism, to the time structure of the flows of goods and services arising from capital accumulation, and to the impact of monetary and fiscal policies. In the “out-of-equilibrium” approach to evolutionary macroeconomics, a vision of the coordination of aggregate economic activity lives on as it can be found already in Hayek (1941) before the advent of Keynesian macroeconomics, and in Hicks (1973) afterwards. In this vision, the incessant structural change in the economy is seen as an expectation-driven venturing into future production and trade opportunities offered by new technologies. It induces restructurings and disruptions and, hence, a disequilibrium state of the economy. However, as the disequilibrium state is seen as one that elicits coordinating forces, false expectations, prices, and production engagements should sooner or later be corrected. If there were no further profitable restructuring opportunities emerging, aggregate economic activity should therefore be expected to return to an equilibrium state—albeit one that may vary with the technological conditions and the policy regimes chosen. The association of technological change, capital accumulation, and the restructuring of production with a disequilibrium state of affairs indeed seems uncontroversial in all approaches to evolutionary macroeconomics. Not so, however, the question of what concept of equilibrium, if any, is relevant as a standard of reference. This is an old question that not only concerns definitions, but also, and more fundamentally, the way in which the evolutionary transformation process in the economy can be approached from a macroeconomic point of view. In macroeconomic theorizing, the frame of reference for defining disequilibria is usually the notion of a market equilibrium, i.e. of equality of supply and demand. As will be argued in this paper, on closer inspection of the time structure of aggregate economic activity, a different equilibrium notion shows up. This notion draws attention to dynamic macroeconomic features that, despite the ongoing structural change in the economy, are remarkably robust over time and may therefore play the role of invariance in evolutionary macroeconomics. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the alternative notions of equilibria relevant for the macroeconomic level. Drawing on a metaphor introduced by Hayek (1981), the notion of an equilibrium in the flow of goods and services over time is contrasted with that of an equilibrium in the aggregate markets for goods and services at a certain point in time, and it is argued that the former fits an evolutionary perspective better. In Section 3 the corresponding macro flow dynamics are explored and are shown to transcend the usual focus on market equilibria. The critical role of a velocity variable for the flow equilibrium is pointed out—a variable that is usually not even considered in macroeconomic models. Section 4 looks into the empirical evidence for flow equilibria at the macroeconomic level. Time series data for West Germany are used to estimate the velocity variable whose behavior over time allows to infer whether or not the conditions for a flow equilibrium are met for the time period under consideration. Section 5 offers conclusions.",5

A focal point of such entrepreneurship policies is to increase the share of the labor force that would be potentially interested in entering into entrepreneurship. This preference for entrepreneurship is said to be hampered, especially in Europe, by the stigma on failure (European Commission 2002). Many people may be uncertain about their entrepreneurial skills, and this uncertainty becomes more constraining when a failed start-up is highly stigmatized. Many scholars have focused on the uncertainty involved in entrepreneurial activity that deters entrepreneurship. In the logic of the Jovanovic (1982) and Lippman and Rumelt (1982) models of firm dynamics, individuals are uncertain about their actual entrepreneurial abilities. They can only learn about their actual entrepreneurial abilities through the process of starting a new firm. Only by starting a new firm and observing the subsequent performance a nascent entrepreneur is able to learn about her endowment of entrepreneurial talent. The firms of entrepreneurs with inferior skills ultimately exit. Thus, an important implication of these models of entrepreneurship is that a positive entrepreneurial performance subsequent to startup will lead the entrepreneur to infer that she has a strong endowment of entrepreneurial skills, which will lead her to persist as an entrepreneur. By contrast, those startups with a poor performance will lead entrepreneurs to infer that they have only a poor endowment of entrepreneurial skills and they will tend to exit out of entrepreneurship. Thus, the nascent entrepreneur can only learn about her true but unobservable underlying endowment of entrepreneurial skills by inferences gleamed from the actual entrepreneurial performance. Those entrepreneurs learning from actual entrepreneurial experience that they have only poor endowments of entrepreneurial skills select themselves out of entrepreneurship, while those learning that they have rich endowments of entrepreneurial skills remain in entrepreneurship. A second important implication of these models of firm dynamics is that once an individual has learned that she has a paucity of entrepreneurial skills, there is no reason to subsequently (again) become a nascent entrepreneur. According to these models, the (lack of) underlying entrepreneurial skills would already have been revealed through the entrepreneurial experience. Thus, there would be little incentive to (re-)enter into entrepreneurship, or what we term here as renascent entrepreneurship. However, a number of empirical studies have consistently found a positive effect of entrepreneurial experience on the preference to start again as a business owner. If such ex-entrepreneurs had already learned that they did not possess a strong endowment of entrepreneurial skills, why would they re-enter into entrepreneurship? The purpose of this paper is to resolve this empirical paradox and to challenge both the passive view of entrepreneurial learning along with the high propensity for renascent entrepreneurship. In the second section of this paper we present a model of entrepreneurship. The third section presents a review of empirical studies on nascent entrepreneurship. Next, the research method and data are described. In the fifth section logistic regression models are used to explain why some ex-entrepreneurs become renascent entrepreneurs, while others abstain from renascent entrepreneurship. In the final section the findings are discussed and conclusions are presented. In particular, we find that the propensity for ex-entrepreneurs to become renascent entrepreneurs is not homogenous, but rather systematically related to the capacity to absorb knowledge and learn from previous entrepreneurial experience.",79

This provides a clear context for the other papers in the special issue can be placed, and brings them into focus. The Gallouj and Savona paper starts with an overview of a core debate regarding the innovative potential of services, compared to manufacturing, and the implications of this for economic growth and employment. A common concern is that this concern dates back to Adam Smith (1776) and his concern that personal services offered little or no scope for a division of labour and, hence, productivity growth. This concern resurfaced during the 1960s in Baumol’s discussion of the ‘cost disease’. Baumol (1967) argues that this is due to the lack of innovation (in his words ‘technological stagnancy’) in services vis-à-vis manufacturing. Baumol’s argument has been questioned in three ways. First, the assumptions have been questioned, theoretically and empirically. Second, a more general issue is raised regarding problems in empirically measuring the outputs of services and in measuring innovation within services—where ‘traditional’ innovation indicators of patents and R&D labs expenditures outputs perform poorly. Third, a new exploration of the types of innovation found in services is underway. This debate concerns the issue of whether or not the innovation process in services differs to that in manufacturing, and if, so in what way. The latter debate has focused around the so-called assimilation/ demarcation/synthesis discussion (Gallouj 1994; Coombs and Miles 2000). The ‘assimilation’ viewpoint can be traced back to Pavitt’s sectoral taxonomy of innovation (Pavitt 1984). This proposes that service activities are generically the same as manufacturing activities. Theories and empirical indicators, originally developed with manufacturing in mind, are therefore equally applicable to services. Consequently, the study of services can be assimilated within a generic set of theories, originally developed through the study of manufacturing innovation. This is the underpinning methodological basis of the assimilation approach. Like Baumol, Pavitt argued that services are innovation laggards. Moreover, he argued that, where change occurs, this is typically a consequence of the diffusion of innovations that are developed and first applied in manufacturing sectors. These are acquired through new capital investment or through suppliers (predominantly through pressure exerted by manufacturers up/down the supply chain). Though he later acknowledged computer services, telecoms, and science based services as innovators (Pavitt et al. 1989), he maintained that these were notable because they are exceptions to the rule. The ‘demarcation’ viewpoint is the antithesis of the assimilation view. Demarcation writers have forcefully put on the table the proposition that service-specific forms of innovation exist. They have also highlighted the importance of organisational innovation, which appears to go hand-in-hand with product and process innovations in services, and the roles played by knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) providers and ICTs within the wider innovation process. These areas have become key areas of research. Demarcation writers argue that completely new, services-specific theories of innovation are required to understand the nature and the dynamics of innovation in services because some forms of innovation are services-specific (see, for example, Gadrey et al. 1995; Sundbo 1998; den Hertog 2000; Preißl 2000). Two types of innovation have attracted much attention. The first is the co-production thesis. This suggests that a distinguishing feature of services is the high degree of interaction that occurs between the user and the service provider. Particular attention is focused on the business-to-business services provided by knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) providers. Together with their clients, KIBS detect new needs, define product specifications, and act as an interface between client firms and other actors within innovation networks (e.g. suppliers and business service providers). This highlights the importance of organisational innovation and it relationship to product and process innovation, input and market innovations, innovation networks, and the problems that service firms face in protecting their innovations. A second alleged distinguishing feature is ‘ad hoc innovation’. This is a non-reproducible solution to a client-specific problem. The proposition has generated much heated discussion. Drejer (2004), for example, criticises the proposition, observing that it does not conform to the conventional definition of the innovation process where a novelty is introduced that subsequently diffuses across a population. Diffusion requires replication in different settings. This is precluded by the supposed specificity of ‘ad hoc innovation’. Drejer argues that what is actually being described here is cumulative learning; a process of continuous adaptation to small changes—including coming up with specific solutions to specific problems—and is part of the day-to-day functioning of a business. By contrast, Gallouj and Weinstein (1997) and Gallouj (2002) argue that it is much more than learning. It is innovation characterised by degree of indirect reproducibility. The ‘synthesis’ viewpoint, as outlined by Gallouj and Weinstein (1997), Metcalfe (1998), Drejer (2004), and Windrum (2007), seeks to take the recent insights of demarcation writers and to integrate these within insights gained in manufacturing studies within a unifying neo-Schumpeterian framework. This broad framework encompasses the five dimensions of innovation discussed by Schumpeter: organisational, product, market, process and input innovation. According to this view, conventional (manufacturing-based) innovation studies privileged product and process innovation at the expense of organisational, market and input innovation, while services-based innovation studies have (re)invigorated research in these other dimensions. The aim of the neo-Schumpeterian synthesis approach is not merely add one to another, but to develop an integrated account that is applicable to both services and manufacturing, and which covers all aspects of innovative activity. One aspect of this agenda is the re-testing and extension of existing theories and models, originally developed in studies of manufacturing. Another aspect is the development of new theories and models that can accommodate both the services and manufacturing innovations. The papers in this special issue contribute to this theoretical and empirical debate about the nature of services innovation. The Faïz Gallouj and Maria Savona paper further develops Gallouj’s work on extending the Saviotti and Metcalfe (1984) characteristics approach to services innovation. Their aim is to develop a generalisable theory that captures the innovation dynamics of both services and manufacturing sectors, and which is amenable to empirical measurement. The paper by Nicoletta Corrocher, Lucia Cusmano, and Andrea Morrison examines the types of innovation performed by a sample of KIBS firms in Lombardy. The paper empirically tests a set of propositions that have been put forward in previous literature (discussed above). Using cluster analysis, it tests the importance of different types of innovation amongst KIBS. The authors also test whether a distinction exists between the innovation patterns of two groups of KIBS: professional KIBS (p-kibs), such as business and management services, legal and accounting activities, and market research firms, and technical KIBS (t-kibs) such as IT related services, engineering, and R&D consulting firms. Two findings are of particular interest. First, not all KIBS innovate. Many rely on their reputation and brand for business. The play that has been made on the importance of KIBS within the services economy may need to be tempered somewhat. Having said this, one should remember that the majority of manufacturing firms do not innovate either. Indeed, one of the most important lessons that innovation studies has taught us is that innovation rates are highly skewed—all the action happens on the tails of the population distribution. A few, highly successful and large firms perform the bulk of innovation.Footnote 1 The second finding is that the proposed distinction between p-kibs and t-kibs is not supported by their dataset. With regards to the types of innovation, cluster analysis indicates four key modes of innovation in the sample: product innovation, interactive innovation (i.e. the co-production thesis), technological adoption (Pavitt’s argument), and a link between technological and organisational innovation. The findings are intriguing, given the arguments put forward in the assimilation/demarcation/synthesis debate. It is hoped that future empirical studies will seek to replicate the analysis in other regions. The next two papers examine the long term implications of outsourcing. Outsourcing is, of course, a key issue for services and services innovation. Not only are specialist KIBS the providers of outsourcing services, but the majority of client firms are themselves service firms. The paper by Paul Windrum, Andreas Reinstaller, and Chris Bull reviews the existing empirical literature on short and long terms costs–benefits for the outsourcing firm. These indicate that, while there are short term gains to be had, primarily in terms of reducing the wage bill, firms that heavily engage in outsourcing appears to suffer lower productivity growth than firms that do not engage in outsourcing. Windrum et al. draw a distinction between ‘total outsourcing’ and ‘integrated outsourcing’. The co-production thesis, highlighted by demarcation writers, assumes the client and outsourcing provider have an integrated outsourcing relationship. In fact, this form of open, interactive relationship lies at one end of a spectrum of client–provider relationships. At the opposite end of the spectrum lies the ‘total outsourcing’ relationship. The vast majority of outsourcing contracts are total outsourcing relationships. In this relationship, the outsourcing firm has little or no control over the outsourced activity for long contractual periods. This severely limits the scope for the outsourcing firm to engage in organisational innovation because these activities cannot be reshaped and recombined with the activities that are held in house. The limits that this places on the scope for organisational innovation has a direct impact on long run productivity growth. The authors test their argument by means of a simulation model. They establish a set of results that correspond to the available empirical data. The second of the outsourcing paper, by Lars Bengtsson and Mandar Dahbilkar, provides an excellent example of the type of empirical research that is being undertaken. Bengtsson and Dahbilkar examine a survey sample of 267 medium and large size manufacturing firms in Sweden. They distinguish between firms that outsource manufacturing activities, and firms that outsource design as well as manufacturing operations. They compare these two groups of outsourcing firms with firms that do not engage in outsourcing. Taking all outsourcing firms together, cost reduction and increased focus on core activities are cited as key drivers. Despite the emphasis placed on innovation in the KIBS literature, innovation-related drivers such as reducing time to market, accessing external competences, and learning are not statistically significant. Unfortunately, perceived short term costs are overturned y rising logistics costs and monitoring costs. These are in line with the findings of other surveys. Also in line with other surveys is the finding that outsourcing firms are neither achieving improvements in plant efficiency nor in plant innovation. A particularly intriguing finding of the paper concerns the sub-sample of firms that outsource design activities as well as manufacturing activities. Some caution needs to be taken here since this sub-sample is small in number (n = 25), but there is a suggestion that these firms do experience some positive innovation benefits. This leads Bengtsson and Dahbilkar question to those who have urged firms to keep control of design, R&D, and other core competences in-house. It could be, the authors argue, that the outsourcing of related activities enables improvements to be made (the identification of the externalities discussed by Windrum et al.) that would be unavailable if piecemeal outsourcing is undertaken. Alternative, it could be that these are poorly performing firms, and so outsourcing activities to another firm improves their competitive performance. Testing this requires discriminatory analysis and a larger sample. Regardless, it opens up an interesting and important issue that demands further empirical research. The paper by Karl Wennberg is an example of research originally developed with respect to manufacturing firms, being applied to services firms. In this particular instance, Wennberg extends and develops the work of Klepper on firm spin-outs. Klepper’s thesis of entrepreneurial success—that founders that leave successful, innovative firms to start up their own businesses in the same industry have a higher probability of success than entrepreneurs without this background—is here combined with theories of human capital, and applies to a discussion of the role played by knowledge in new financial services ventures. Wennberg’s dataset comprises matched employee–employer information on 1,077 financial services ventures in Sweden for the period 1990 to 2002. The findings suggest that larger founding teams, with more extensive knowledge gained from past employment in the financial services is a factor affecting success. But so is knowledge gained from past employment in high-tech industries. Indeed, it is this combination of knowledge which appears to be very powerful, markedly increasing the probability of survival. This idea that particular combinations of knowledge and past industry experience are important certainly extends the current discussion on spin-out entrepreneurship, and of entrepreneurship in services. The final two papers extend the focus outwards: to services innovations in networks. Each, in its own way, takes the discussion beyond KIBS. The paper by Rebeca Mendez-Duron and Clara García addresses the importance of social capital within the open source community, and its impact on the success of open source software projects. The authors argue social capital establishes a set of ties among programmers who make up an innovation network. There are central actors, and more peripheral actors, strong ties and weak ties. Together these establish a directionality of knowledge flows, inwards and outwards, within open source projects. Data on games’ software development is collected from SourceForge.net over a twelve month period. This provides dataset of 2,962 observations. By treating an individual project as one event, in a flow of such events across a network, the authors project a two-mode network into a one-mode event-by-event network. The findings indicate asymmetric knowledge flows across projects, reflecting the different roles played by core project members and by contributors. Contributors who add programming expertise (a key source of new knowledge) raise the likelihood of project success. By contrast, if core members simultaneously sign up to other projects, this tends to hinder project success. The exception is where programming activities in other projects develops new knowledge that can be transferred back. The final paper, by Davide Consoli and Andrea Mina, provides a very exciting and promising area of services research: health. It is novel in two senses. First, it explicitly considers interactions between public and private sector organizations. With the exception of university science, innovation in the public sector is woefully under-researched, while a consideration of interactions between public and private sectors innovation networks is non-existent (Windrum 2008). This paper addresses precisely this topic. Health sector innovation comprises complex bundles of new medical technologies and clinical services that are created by a highly distributed public-private competence base. Second, the paper is novel in the algorithms that are used to analyse networks. Going beyond traditional centrality measures, the methods enable one to identify chains of citations through time, presenting us with a picture of the history-dependent trajectories that develop in a medical field. The paper therefore offers up a new topic for study within services, and new, promising techniques with which to study the topic.",72

The term ‘outsourcing’ can cover many areas and activities, in manufacturing as well as services. While much of the media attention has tended to focus on foreign outsourcing by manufacturers and on call centres (so-called ‘offshoring’), the vast majority of outsourcing is done ‘locally’ within the US and within Europe, and the vast majority of outsourcing is by services firms, not manufacturers (Willcocks and Plant 2003). Recent empirical studies have highlighted the existence of an outsourcing productivity paradox (Görzig and Stephan 2002; Bengtsson and von Hartman 2005; Lacity and Willcocks 1998; Gianelle and Tattara 2007). In the short-run, outsourcing firms are able to reduce costs. In the long-run, firms that engage in outsourcing suffer lower productivity growth than firms that do not engage in outsourcing. How is this paradox to be explained? In this paper we explore the impact of outsourcing on organisational innovation. Organisational innovation is a key source of long term productivity growth. The argument that organisational innovation drives economic growth is a central theme in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (Smith 1776) and, more recently, has been re-emphasised by Chandler (1980) and Harberger (1998). The central message of this paper is that it is not the ownership of activities that matters, per se, but how activities are controlled and integrated. Empirically, we know that the vast majority of outsourcing takes the form of ‘total outsourcing’ relationships. In this relationship the outsourcing firm has little or no control over the outsourced activity for long contractual periods. This severely limits the scope for ongoing organisational innovation and, hence, has a direct impact on long run productivity growth. We explore the relationship between total outsourcing, organisational innovation, and long run productivity using a model of organisation innovation. In the model, organisational innovation is the search for new organisational architectures that more effectively bring together the externalities that exist between value-adding activities. Externalities exist between a set of related R&D, design, production, and marketing activities within a firm (Langlois 2002), and between the activities of firms along the supply chain (Jacobides and Winter 2005). Organisational innovation involves experimentation with (a) different combinations of value-adding activities, and (b) the insourcing/outsourcing of activities. Over time, firms experiment with different organisational designs that recombine activities in new and novel ways, thereby raising the total factor productivity of its managerial, labour, and capital inputs. They also experiment with the sourcing of activities. A firm must identify and control core R&D, design, production, and marketing activities for which there are strong externalities. Seen in this light, the make/buy decision is not a question of ownership but of control. What matters is the outsourcing relationship, and how this positively or negatively affects the firm’s capacity to engage in future organisational change that reorganises activities (held in house or externally). Information technology is a key factor that affects the feasibility and the relative costs and benefits of outsourcing. The model therefore considers the effect on outsourcing strategies of new, internet-based IT systems that significantly lower the costs of external transaction costs. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on the potential benefits and potential problems of outsourcing. This draws on research conducted in a number different discipline areas; transactions cost economics, strategic management, information systems, services innovation, and industrial organisation. These highlight a set of potential benefits that arise from cost reduction, specialisation, and substitution. In terms of potential costs, managers face problems in effectively monitoring contracts, with unforeseen transaction costs, in identifying core and non-core competences, and with estimating the externalities that exist between activities. Section 2 also reviews the empirical studies by Görzig and Stephan (2002), Bengtsson and von Hartman (2005), Lacity and Willcocks (1998), and Gianelle and Tattara (2007) on the relationship between outsourcing and long term productivity. Section 3 examines the connection between total outsourcing, organisational innovation, and productivity growth. We introduce the key concepts of organisational architecture and organisational innovation, based on a modular theory of the firm. This theory is founded on the twin principles of increasing specialisation and the modularisation of complex organisational structures. Increasing the modularity of an organisational structure leads to improvements in efficiency through specialisation. As we will see, it also enables a firm to realise system economies. By restricting the client’s ability to engage in organisational innovation, total outsourcing reduces its effective search. Increasing the extent of total outsourcing increases the possibility of lock-in to an inefficient organisational architecture, negatively impacting long run productivity. Section 4 describes the model that is used to investigate the complex relationship between organisational innovation, total outsourcing, and productivity growth. It specifies the alternative strategies for organisational innovation available to the firm, the way in which learning is modelled, the decision rules for IT adoption, and the outsourcing of activities. Section 5 discusses the results of simulations performed on the model. Section 6 concludes and points to new directions for further research.",40

Before the stock markets crashed in 2000–2001, there was widespread enthusiasm about the “new economy,” often including the belief that fundamental economic principles were no longer valid in the Internet age. After the collapse, the enthusiasm rapidly gave way to a new conventional wisdom holding that the “new economy” had been based on an unfortunate coincidence of greed, hubris and naïveté, producing little that was of lasting substance. From the investor’s perspective, the latter assessment is indeed straightforward, given the large amounts of money lost, as well as the fact that many of the dot-com firms have folded altogether. This article explores the possibility that dot-com firms had substantial, lasting effects that were not reflected in the investor’s portfolio. We take our motivation for this study from two strands of literature. First, in the literature on serial entrepreneurship, it has been suggested that analyzing individual ventures in isolation may be insufficient to evaluate the importance of entrepreneurship, as it neglects potentially beneficial effects of entrepreneurial experience on the performance of later ventures started by the same entrepreneur (Westhead and Wright 1998; Sarasvathy and Menon 2004). Second, recent empirical studies indicate that individual firms can trigger cluster formation by providing a seedbed for subsequent spin-off entry, which tends to be concentrated locally. Examples include Fairchild Semiconductors in Silicon Valley (Moore and Davis 2004; Klepper 2008), SP Radio in the Danish telecommunications cluster (Dahl et al. 2003), and B.F. Goodrich’s role in the emergence of Akron, Ohio, as the center of the U.S. tire industry (Buenstorf and Klepper 2008). Can we observe similar dynamics in regions that were home to (temporarily) successful dot-com firms? To answer this question, we focus on learning processes within firms. Previous research on spin-offs has highlighted the role of incumbent firms as (involuntary) training grounds for employees (Garvin 1983; Agarwal et al. 2004; Klepper and Sleeper 2005). However, little is known about what exactly spin-off founders have learned in their previous employments and what kinds of knowledge transfer underlie the often exceptional performance of spin-offs. Also, the interrelations between the regional spin-off process and other processes affecting cluster dynamics, such as regional network dynamics, the provision of entrepreneurial role models (Fornahl 2003), and non-spin-off entry (see, e.g., Bresnahan et al. 2001; Feldman 2001), have been largely unexplored. In this article, we begin to pursue these issues in an explorative case study. We trace the regional legacy of one of Germany’s most prominent protagonists of the dot-com boom, Intershop Communications, the Jena-based maker of e-commerce software for providers of online shops. Intershop was a global pioneer of e-commerce software development that grew rapidly during the boom. It subsequently encountered severe difficulties, losing money throughout almost all its corporate lifespan. As with other fallen dot-com stars, today’s conventional wisdom has it that Intershop was an unequivocal failure. The firm has been singled out as the biggest annihilator of investor money by the German association of private investors (Deutsche Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz 2006). According to their estimates, Intershop stock valued Euro 10,000 at the end of 2000 had a value of Euro 27 at the end of 2005. Intershop has survived to date, but was forced to downsize drastically its operations. Only most recently, its financial situation and employment numbers seem to have stabilized. We suggest below that Intershop’s temporary success allowed the firm to make a lasting contribution to its home region. Intershop’s growth opened a new trajectory for local development based on software and web-based services rather than the traditional local industries, most notably optics and instrument-making. Its subsequent decline was accompanied by new entrepreneurial activities initiated both by Intershop’s founding team and by employees leaving the firm. Through creating new employment opportunities and keeping human capital in the region, the spin-offs helped to sustain the favorable regional dynamics initiated by the parent firm. Based on extensive interviews, our empirical analysis allows us to identify the main channels through which Intershop enabled these subsequent activities. Our results provide new insights into employee learning as a basis of spin-off activities, and also into the links between the spin-off process and other aspects of regional industrial dynamics, including labor pooling and regional cooperation. In addition to presenting specific findings for the Intershop case, the study thus suggests new directions for future quantitative work. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical background of the analysis by summarizing prior work on spin-off formation as well as the role of spin-offs in the evolution of industry agglomerations. Section 3 outlines the empirical approach of the study. Section 4 presents our narrative on the growth and subsequent decline of Intershop. Section 5 turns to the entrepreneurial activities by Intershop’s founding team that accompanied the firm’s downsizing. Section 6 discusses the spin-off activities of other Intershop employees. It also relates the manner in which a local support structure for nascent software entrepreneurs developed with Intershop’s support. Section 7 studies additional regional effects of Intershop’s development. Section 8 discusses the implications of the case study for the emerging literature on spin-offs and spin-off-based clustering. Section 9 concludes.",38

They have shown that, if agents play a bilateral prisoner’s dilemma with their interaction neighbors in a circle network and learn about actions via imitation, cooperation can survive in what is called a stochastically stable state. In this paper, we explicitly distinguish between the set of agents one interacts with (interaction neighborhood) and the set of agents one possibly imitates (information neighborhood). We do this because we want to allow for the fact that agents can be informed also about some agents beyond their interaction neighborhood (e.g. their friend’s friends) and will use this information when imitating an action.Footnote 1 We find that whenever agents are allowed to hold some information beyond their interaction neighbors, the unique stochastically stable state is one where everyone chooses defection. We then introduce a conformist bias into the imitation process relying on the model by Ellison and Fudenberg (1993). We find that, if this conformist bias is strong enough, full cooperation always emerges irrespective of whether agents hold information beyond their interaction neighbors. Conformism is thus identified as an important and new mechanism that can stabilize cooperation in a local interaction environment. We also show that the result from Eshel et al. (1998) does not extend to general networks irrespective of whether agents hold information about others beyond their interaction neighbors. In particular, we give examples of asymmetric networks (where not all agents have the same number of neighbors) for which the unique stochastically stable state under payoff-biased imitation involves full defection. Conformism—on the other hand—stabilizes cooperation in these networks. Previous literature has explained cooperation in networks also through other mechanisms. Marsili et al. (2005) highlight the importance of the clustering degree for sustaining cooperation. Zimmermann et al. (2004), Fosco and Mengel (2008) or Hanaki et al. (2007) among many others explain cooperation through exclusion of non-cooperators in a dynamic network setting. The role of a conformist bias in imitation has been examined by Ellison and Fudenberg (1993) to study the spread of an efficient technology in a one person decision problem. Levine and Pesendorfer (2007) explain cooperation through an imitation process in a set up where agents get some information about the opponent’s strategy prior to interaction. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the model is presented, and in Section 3, the model is analyzed. Section 4 concludes. The proofs are relegated to an Appendix.",22

19.0,4.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,01 May 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-009-0139-7,Introduction to the Journal of Evolutionary Economics special issue: the product characteristics approach to innovation studies,August 2009,Roberto Fontana,Alessandro Nuvolari,Pier Paolo Saviotti,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Most goods or services people consume today in post-industrial countries are complex, heterogeneous and multi-characteristic. This has not always been the case, as the emergence of heterogeneous goods has been quite recent in historical terms. This emergence can be roughly dated to the end of the XIXth century, mainly in the USA. The presence and increasing frequency of heterogeneous goods has at least two important and related consequences: on the one hand, it affects some fundamental mechanisms of economic development and, on the other hand, it requires a number of changes in economic theory. The emergence of new types of goods and services and their growing differentiation are not marginal epiphenomena but rather are the result of fundamental mechanisms of economic development. Two trajectories, leading respectively to (i) the growing efficiency of existing production processes and to (ii) the growing output diversity of the economic system have, for a long time, been present in economic development, although the latter acquired a considerable weight only recently. These trajectories are not independent: production efficiency had to reach a threshold supplying people with their minimum requirements of basic needs (food, housing clothing) before ‘higher’ goods or services could be purchased on a large scale. During the XIXth century, the above basic needs represented about 90% of working class households in the UK and the income share allocated to them only started falling at the beginning of the XXth century (Hobsbawm 1968). In fact, not only was the growing efficiency in the production of basic needs a necessary requirement for the emergence of new and more highly differentiated goods and services, but without such growing diversity the capitalist economic system was likely to run into a serious and potentially fatal bottleneck. Growing production efficiency combined with saturating demand could have led to the possibility of producing all demanded output with a declining proportion of the labor force and of other required resources (Pasinetti 1981, 1993). However, this trend could have been compensated by the emergence of new goods and services and by their growing differentiation (Pasinetti 1981, 1993; Witt 2001). Thus growing efficiency and growing diversity are complementary trends in economic development (Saviotti 1996). As soon as new and highly differentiated goods and services appeared, economists started realizing that this emergence had important implications for economic theory. Probably the first field to receive attention was competition. The presence of highly differentiated goods and services made perfect competition implausible and gave rise to the concepts of imperfect (Robinson 1933) and of monopolistic (Chamberlin 1933) competition. Each producer could try to produce goods or services located in regions of characteristics space where no one else was present, thus acquiring a ‘local’ monopoly. Demand theory had to become more subtle. How could one predict the demand for a completely new or for a highly differentiated good or service? A number of economists struggled with problems such as the distinction between the quantity and quality of goods (Duesenberry 1949; Theil 1951–1952; Houthakker 1951–1952; Hirshleifer 1955). In the end, the economist who is credited with having made the most decisive step forward in this field is Lancaster (1966, 1971), although the almost simultaneous work of Ironmonger (1972) provided a very similar approach. A more detailed analysis of the evolution of these concepts can be found in Wadman (2000). The solution Lancaster proposed is that consumers do not purchase goods for their intrinsic nature, but for the services they supply, which can be represented by their characteristics. In other words, demand was not demand for goods but for the services they supplied, represented by their characteristics. The price of heterogeneous goods was not only determined by production costs but also by their characteristics. The relationship between product characteristics and their prices had been investigated since the 1930s (Court 1939) and in the 1960s it began to be used to separate product quality from inflation (Adelman and Griliches 1961; Griliches 1971). Recently, it has been realized that even the productivity of heterogeneous goods cannot be adequately computed without taking into account the characteristics of these products (Foster et al. 2005). The previous paragraphs show that the potential impact of the emergence of new and highly differentiated goods and services on economic theory can be very widespread, affecting many areas of economics. While the awareness of the need for change has been high for almost a century, the actual incorporation of heterogeneous goods and services into economics has been both piecemeal and controversial. This limited incorporation of what has been a major trend in economic development reflects the tension between the need to preserve the perceived foundations of economics and the need to adjust, and possibly to replace, these foundations in order to encompass and to treat the new phenomena. A similar difficulty has been encountered in the incorporation of innovation into the main body of economics. By definition, and in particular when it is very radical, innovation gives rise to qualitative change (Saviotti 2007) and creates radical (i.e. Knightian) uncertainty, which is conceptually difficult to incorporate into a general equilibrium framework. In fact, innovation has been responsible for the introduction of new types of goods and services and for their growing differentiation. During the industrial revolution and until the Second World War, most innovations consisted of improvements in the production of physical goods. These physical goods were created because, in the end, they would produce services useful to either producers or consumers. They all involved human knowledge about nature and supplied services to human beings. The activities of inventors and innovators consisted of identifying subsets of the external environment which, when adequately transformed, produced services useful to human beings. Product innovation lies at the interface between innovation and demand. Thus, we can in principle distinguish in any heterogeneous material good an internal structure, depending on the materials of which it is constituted and the ways in which they are combined, and the services which it supplies to its users. Correspondingly, if we are interested in both demand and supply, we can identify within each physical good two sets of characteristics, one representing the internal structure and called technical characteristics, the other representing services and called service characteristics (Saviotti and Metcalfe 1984). Henceforth, this representation will be called the ‘twin characteristics approach’. The previous distinction corresponds to that introduced by Simon (1962) between the internal structure of a system and the interface with its environment. Furthermore, technical and service characteristics can be considered an analogue of the genotype and phenotype of biological organisms (Frenken 2006). This apparently technical distinction is rooted in the relationship of human beings with their external environment. Progress in human knowledge has allowed human beings to improve their adaptation to their external environment, thus improving human welfare. This subsequently led to investing greater amounts of resources in the generation of further knowledge, which in turn increased even more human welfare. As previously pointed out, this self-sustaining process could have encountered a bottleneck if the growth of human knowledge had been focused exclusively on the improvement of productive efficiency within a constant set of goods and services and not also on the growing differentiation of the economic system entailed by the creation of new goods and services. Using the ‘twin characteristics approach’, we can represent the evolution of demand by following the development of service characteristics, which can affect directly consumer preferences, and of innovation by looking at the development of technical characteristics. In particular, we can obtain a more rigorous and operational distinction between radical and incremental innovation, with the former involving the emergence of new types of technical characteristics and the latter only involving changes in the level of characteristics. The use of the twin characteristics approach can also be very useful in providing an operational definition of dominant designs, technological paradigms and trajectories, among others. In all these cases, the use of the ‘twin characteristics’ approach can give us an unparalleled level of analysis and understanding of the dynamics of innovation and of technological change. This special issue collects a selection of papers that were originally presented at the workshop on ‘Demand, Product Characteristics and Innovation’ organized at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena in October 2007. The workshop was funded by the DIME (Dynamics of Innovation and Markets) Network of Excellence of the European Commission. All these papers are empirical investigations of the dynamics of innovation in particular industries, based on the ‘twin characteristics’ approach pioneered by Saviotti and Metcalfe (1984) exactly 25 years ago. Corrocher and Guerzoni consider the process of price formation in the contemporary ski manufacturing industry (1992–2007). Their analysis shows the impact on price formation of different indicators of ski quality and variety in technical and service characteristics. One of the conclusions of the paper is that the relationship between technical and service characteristics and price formation must be interpreted as an outcome of different firms’ strategies aimed at exploiting in different ways economies of scale and scope. In this way, the paper provides an illustration of the potential of the ‘twin characteristics’ approach for our understanding of patterns of competition. Grupp and Heller examine the relationship between product quality and competition in the German market for photovoltaic cells.Footnote 1 The paper combines metric rescaling technique for measuring changes in performance in multi-characteristic products with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It shows that, in the case of science-based markets, quality improvement explains long term growth of the industry. However, somewhat paradoxically, in order to meet some demand segments, a reduction in performance characteristics may also be required. DEA is also employed by Los and Verspagen to study environmental innovation (i.e. reduction of CO2 emissions) in passenger cars. Their results indicate that the rate of improvement in the reduction of CO2 emissions substantially differs across segments of the car market. As a consequence, it is suggested that policy makers wishing to reduce the impact of CO2 emissions should explicitly take this into account. The case of environmental policies for improving sustainability of the car as transport system is also examined by Schwoon, Alkemade, Frenken and Hekkert. This paper shows the way in which technical characteristics can be used to provide a detailed map of the space of technological opportunities, which is akin to the idea of the fitness landscape in biology. This reconstructed technological landscape is then used to assess the merits and limitations of alternative transition paths towards environmental-friendly technological solutions. As with the previous paper, this contribution also highlights one of the advantages of a quantitative approach based on characteristics, and is able to provide specific policy implications, whereas most of the literature tends to remain rather generic or vague. Castaldi, Fontana and Nuvolari apply the ‘twin characteristic approach’ to study the evolution of tank technology over the period 1915–1945. Using principal component analysis, they provide a detailed assessment of the mains trends of development of tanks understood as technological systems. One of their findings is that the technological superiority of German and Russian tanks during World War II was more in the ‘eye of the beholder’ rather than an actual technological gap, a result that sheds a different light on the military doctrine concerning the use of tanks prevailing in Germany and Soviet Russia in comparison to those of the Allies. Indeed, one of the aims of the paper is to show the potential of the approach for the field of history of technology. Historians of technology tend mainly to focus on documental evidence and, usually, and to eschew the use of quantitative techniques of analysis. This paper suggests instead that detailed analysis of the trend of evolution of the characteristics of a product population can generate useful insights and provide a different perspective in the analysis of the documental evidence. Another empirical application of the ‘twin characteristics’ approach, based on the use of principal component analysis, is contained in the paper by Windrum, Diaz and Filiou. They examine the dynamics of innovation in mobile phone handsets. Their findings point to the existence of a complex and non-linear pattern of imaging between product and service characteristics, as originally posited by Saviotti and Metcalfe (1984). Moreover, there seems to be a restricted number of core technical characteristics, which seems to be responsible for the performance levels achieved in the most relevant service characteristics. It is on these core technical characteristics that the competition between manufacturers seems to focus. Finally, the paper by Coad focuses on the relationship between the distribution in the technical characteristics of products and the distribution of their prices. Relying on hedonic price analysis, one of the earliest approaches combining information on product prices and characteristics, it shows that price distributions in different markets seem to reveal the existence of complicated patterns of interactions among the characteristics affecting the overall quality of a product. Altogether, the papers contained in this special issue provide a good illustration of the variety of approaches that can be employed in detailed studies of product characteristics. They also provide a good overview of the riches of insights that can be gained using this approach. As the availability of datasets and information on product prices and technical characteristics is likely to increase in the near future, empirical studies based on product characteristics seem to represent a research trajectory that is worthwhile pursuing, especially by younger generations of researchers.Footnote 2

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important of these gases, and emissions by cars contribute heavily to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Hence, it does not come as a surprise that the European Commission stimulates the development of cleaner automotive technologies. In 1995, for example, it set a target to reduce average emissions of CO2 to 120 g/km driven by passenger cars in Europe. The population of passenger vehicles in Europe is heterogeneous, however, in terms of both size and the basic motor and fuel technologies used. From an engineering point of view, for example, diesel and gasoline engine technologies have different static and dynamic potentials for reducing CO2 emissions.Footnote 1 Differences also exist with regard to other characteristics of cars, such as transmission systems and engine capacities. Moreover, some types of cars are natural candidates to apply radically new technologies, such as hybrid cars. Consequently, the 120 g/km target may be attained in various ways, for example, by switching between existing technologies or by exploiting technology-specific differences in development potential. Our aim in this paper is first to provide descriptive and analytical evidence of the performance of the various technologies available in the market. It is currently believed that the actual pace of emission reductions towards the CO2 target is too slow and that average emissions currently stand at about 160 g/km.Footnote 2 Therefore, the European Commission has announced a more stringent set of measures that should bring average emissions down to 130 g/km in 2012. We will draw conclusions regarding the most promising ways to achieve such further reduction in emissions. To this end, we ask what reductions in CO2 emissions were actually realized in the recent past and to what extent these have differed between fuel types for various segments of the car market. Taking these results as a point of departure, we ask a second question: How important is the heterogeneity of the available technologies for achieving further progress in CO2 emissions? Should we expect that this target will be met by a shift towards a single car type, e.g., hybrid cars? Or should we expect that technological change has been so fast and universal that the target will be attainable without losses in heterogeneity? Although we cannot provide exact numerical answers to these questions (due to the nature of our data), we can provide general insights on them. We will use a database of all car models available in the United Kingdom over the period July 2000–May 2007. Although we have data at yearly intervals, we will focus here (for reasons of space and clarity), on the earliest and most recent observations. For 2000, the dataset consists of 1,738 car models, while data for 2,971 car models have been available for 2007. The data were collected by the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) in the UK, and are documented on its website.Footnote 3 The primary purpose of this website is to inform consumers who wish to buy a car, but it also represents the official information used for levying environmental taxes on the purchase of cars. The VCA does not carry out its own testing, but leaves this to either independent organizations or the car manufacturers and importers. The VCA does inspect the tests and the data in the database, etc. The figures on CO2 emissions are based on a standard test-drive, which combines an urban and extra-urban stretch. Since the technical specifications of the cars do not differ from those in other European countries, the CO2 emission levels can be considered as representative for Europe as a whole. The main drawback of the database is that it does not include any data on car sales. Hence, we have no way of calculating average CO2 emissions for a representative market.Footnote 4 Furthermore, we do not have much information on the actual performance characteristics of the cars (in terms of characteristics from which buyers derive utility, such as speed or comfort), which is something on which we will comment in more detail later. The database includes information on other environmental aspects of cars, such as emissions of particulates in the case of diesel cars, emission of NO
x
, CO and hydrocarbons.Footnote 5 We only use the data on CO2, however, since these are the main policy focus. Incompleteness of data concerning other pollutants is another reason not to consider other environmental aspects. In the remainder of this paper, we first look, in Section 2, at some descriptive data on the various fuel technologies available in the market. In Section 3, we explain our methodology. The empirical results are presented in Sections 4 and 5. The first of these looks at technological change, and outlines how rates of technological change have differed between segments of the car market. The latter section focuses on technological diffusion, in particular at the brand level. Section 6 summarizes and draws conclusions.",12

Consumers seek to distinguish themselves through their consumption activities. Firms respond to this heterogeneity by creating niches, and the associated processes of variety generation and attempts at product differentiation are important drivers of industrial innovation. This research aims to improve our understanding of the structure and composition of consumer demand through an analysis of the heterogeneity of consumer products. More specifically, we focus on the price distribution, which presumably also sheds light on the underlying distribution of product quality. We collect data on prices of bottles of wine, prices of used automobiles, prices of houses in the London area and prices of week-long holiday packages in Majorca. These goods have similar ‘functions’, in the sense that cars transport people from A to B, wine is a beverage made from grapes with a loosely-specified alcoholic content, houses provide shelter, and the holidays we analyze offer one week of leisure time in a similar geographical environment. However, the prices of these goods vary dramatically, due to differences in quality, design, or even due to brand names and Veblenian ‘snob effects’. Our analysis applies both non-parametric and parametric techniques. A non-parametric kernel density analysis allows a visual appreciation of the underlying distribution. This analysis offers little support to the view that consumer groups can be neatly separated into a small number of discrete strata. Instead, we observe a smooth distribution of prices, the smooth form indicating that there is a continuum of consumer groups and corresponding market niches, ranging from the very cheapest goods to the most extravagantly-priced luxury items. A parametric analysis provides more structure to our results, by comparing the empirical distributions to the log-normal and Pareto distributions. We observe that the price distribution is right-skewed, having fat tails that fall between the lower bound case of a lognormal and an upper bound case of a Pareto distribution. In a theoretical model we build upon a standard hedonic model of product attributes to generate a right-skewed product quality distribution, which exhibits a fat tail that lies between the lognormal and Pareto benchmarks. The layout of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the theoretical background in which this analysis of consumption behaviour is framed. In Section 3 we present the databases along with some summary statistics. Section 4 contains our analysis of the price distributions, and in Section 5 we propose a statistical explanation of the observed distributions. We conclude in Section  6.",14

It is not about innovation and technical development per se, or the role of knowledge workers. Rather, Leydesdorff makes a more general theoretical point. He looks at the economy as a complex system that may endogenously evolve coordination systems in addition to the market mechanism whereby action, expectations, and meanings are aligned with each other. Rather akin to the polyphonic kind of singing, most notably from the Italian island of Sardinia, whereby a group of singers cooperate such that a new voice seems to appear, Leydesdorff argues that when three or more subsystems interact, an ‘overlay’ can emerge that automously but not purposefully coordinates the subsystems, much like an invisible hand. While at the level of systems one may not speak of actors purposefully pursuing a goal, anticipation of future states of affairs emerging in the systems do help constitute stable meanings, communication and outcomes, retaining some elements and not others. In this respect, too, the selection mechanism is endogenized. This meets a fundamental critique leveled at evolutionary economics also by Andersen (1994), not addressed till now: variation and selection are not completely separate, and the selection environment is not undifferentiated. This is not to deny the physical or biological nature of agents (individuals) in a system, but does suggest that they are not limited by these dimensions of their existence. Social systems and biological systems are different because, in the former, meanings are created as effects of and preconditions for communicative behavior (p. 180). This line of argument does raise some serious questions about issues that are rather central to evolutionary theory. For instance, the idea that (anticipations of) future states of the world can affect the present seems to be incompatible with the ‘arrow of time’ and so touches on the conception of causality–not an uncommon position in the current state of affairs in physics (van Fraassen 1985). The existence and workings of such a knowledge-based economy needs to be explained and cannot be alluded to, as especially many policy makers are wont to do, to figure as explanans. For reasons of theoretical and empirical tractability, Leydesdorff discusses how three subdynamics interact and mutually shape one another. Especially where subdynamics interface, disturbances (innovations) may be expected–a theoretical generalization of the critique of the linear model of innovation that does not and has never worked (Dolfsma 2008). The potentially different selection mechanisms in the different systems (profit seeking in the economy, technological excellence in technology, political clout in the political or geographical spheres) may interact to produce a non-linear dynamics. In simulation, the circumstances under which such a dynamics may stabilize locally or even globally are investigated. Thus, for instance, the question whether or not a country or a region is a stable innovation system may be investigated.",

One way in which academic activity is increasingly institutionalized is obviously in journals (Price 1965). Academic journals connect “consumers” and “producers” of scientific knowledge. Just exactly which knowledge is used by authors of articles in a particular journal, and where such knowledge is subsequently found relevant and is cited can sometimes be obvious to scholars but may also be surprising. This is true for the field of evolutionary economics and one of its main journal, the Journal of Evolutionary Economics (JEE) as well. In this contribution we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of knowledge used as input in the JEE as well as of the use that this knowledge is put to elsewhere. Using methods developed in Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Scientometrics, it is thus possible to determine (1) which relations were shaped among journals in the field of evolutionary economics, and (2) what knowledge is used more specifically in the JEE. The analysis provided may be particularly interesting if it presents a situation that is in some ways different from what could have been expected. We use aggregated citations among journals in this field in a number of different ways, instead of simply counting the number of cites or the Impact Factor (IF) of the Journal of Evolutionary Economics. We are interested in determining empirically which journals in the field of evolutionary economics occupy positions that turn them into indispensible links among academic fields and journals. Such an indispensable link established by a journal might but need not be reflected in its IF. In addition, we are interested in the extent to which the JEE can be considered as the interdisciplinary journal that it wanted to be when it was first published. Some links between journals can thus be expected, while others may not be obvious; some links are stronger than expected, while again other links between journals may be surprisingly absent. Links of a field with adjacent fields may, from a point of view of substantial discussion, be expected, but this does not mean that such links will materialize or have materialized in aggregates of references among journals. Evolutionary Economics is briefly surveyed in the next section (Section 2). The goal is to characterize, rather than extensively or even exhaustively review (see Andersen 2009; Dopfer 2005; Herrmann-Pillath 2009; Witt 2008), the academic field within economics that has taken explicit cues from  biology and thermodynamics to develop ideas and conceptual frameworks that would  explain economic phenomena. We aim to indicate how evolutionary economics, and particularly one of its main journal, relates to an outside discussion rather than primarily focus on how it has developed internally (Silva and Teixeira 2009). Section 3 describes data used, and provides some descriptives with regard to the JEE as well. Some of the measures may not be familiar to economists as they are developed at the interface between SNA and science and technology studies. Discussing the proposed measure for interdisciplinarity, in particular, will feature in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the findings before Section 6 concludes the paper.",10

Industrial economists have referred to these short-lived firms using the “revolving doors” metaphor (Audretsch 1995). This to emphasize the high turbulence of new ventures that are rapidly selected out at the fringe of the firm population, in contrast to high potential new firms that are able to survive and displace established firms (according to the metaphor of the forest), and which provide a long-term contribution to job creation and economic wealth. What the metaphor did not seem to capture is that well-planned exit strategies can be the root of entrepreneurial success. Studies in the entrepreneurship literature have started to consider exit as an integral part of the entrepreneurial processes, a stage in the life cycle of new ventures and a step in the career path of the founders, which need to be carefully prepared for (DeTienne 2010). Short-lived new ventures can also assume a role in the context of the growth strategies of established firms. Large firms can ‘eat up’ novelty by acquiring innovative new firms that lack the resources necessary to exploit what they know. Entrepreneurial exit thus becomes a mechanism to transfer novelty to established firms. Although selection may rapidly force new ventures out of the market, “revolving doors” firms can represent a vital place of experimentation in the innovation ecosystem. In this respect, survival may not be the necessary purpose of an organization, or the optimal outcome of market competitive forces. As the management literature suggests, exit can be a sign of success and a critical element of the overall strategy of a firm (Decker and Mellewigt 2007). The very recent scientific research has come to address firm exit from different perspectives, drawing attention to the many different factors that influence exit, and the topic has become to be very discussed in the field. These considerations encouraged us to organize a workshop with the title “Revolving doors: Entrepreneurial survival and exit”, which was held at the Rotterdam School of Management, in November 2008. The aim of the workshop and of this Special Issue was to highlight the multiple aspects of exit as part of the entrepreneurial process. Three main themes emerged from the presentations and the discussion during the workshop and the Special Issue has been organized around them. Section 2 elaborates the theme on exit and firm’s performance. Section 3 presents the papers that investigate the value or the benefits of the exit and Section 4 those regarding the influence of the external environment on firm exit. The last Section concludes with general implications derived from the overall collection of papers.",8

Exit decisions of entrepreneurial firms in high-tech and low-tech industries,August 2011,Elena Cefis,Orietta Marsili,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"It is a fact that a large proportion of new firms exit within few years of start up. Less than half of start-ups survive more than 5 years after entry, and less than a third survive 10 years after entry. This pattern is fairly consistent among cohorts of firms founded in different years, or located in different countries. The evidence of high exit rates among new firms is supported by a long tradition of studies in Industrial Economics, which have resulted in the ‘stylized fact’ that the probability of survival increases with firm age (Caves 1998; Geroski 1995). Consistent with this evidence, studies in Organizational Ecology suggest that organizations are subject to the ‘liability of newness’, and that their hazard of mortality decreases with age. At the same time, case studies and press anecdotes tell of acquisitions of high potential new ventures by established market leaders, indicating that the exit of entrepreneurial firms can be highly successful. Entrepreneurs at various stages of their entrepreneurial careers may decide to sell their companies in order to reap the rewards from their business activity, or in order to move on to another new venture. For example, the participation of venture capitalists in the funding of a new enterprise often imposes constraints on the timing and mode of exit of the company. Indeed, venture backed firms are often created with the expectation of their being sold on to larger firms. Also, entrepreneurs may decide to merge their successful new ventures with established firms, as a way to continue growth that would otherwise be limited by lack of managerial or financial resources. Entrepreneurial firms can follow different paths to exit, which may not necessarily signal failure, but rather may be based on an explicit strategy (Freeman et al. 1983; Headd 2003). The survival of new firms is related to a number of factors, such as firm-specific resources and capabilities e.g. human capital and knowledge capital, the intensity of market competition, the technology environment, and the macroeconomic conditions (Geroski et al. 2010). It is acknowledged that most empirical studies on survival treat exit as a homogeneous event (often because of data limitations), and fail to capture the differences between the factors that influence the decision to close down the company and those related to the decision to sell it on (Gimeno et al. 1997; Wennberg et al. 2010). These differences are not sufficiently investigated in the literature. Cefis and Marsili (2007) show that innovation plays a role in the general decision of a firm to exit, and the choice of the mode of exit. This study contributes to the analysis of the determinants of the exit decisions of entrepreneurial firms, by differentiating between exit by closure and exit by M&A. The novelty of the paper lies in highlighting the importance of the ‘fit ‘between the innovative behavior of firms and the technological environment, in which they operate, as a determinant of entrepreneurial exit. Starting from the consideration that young firms suffer the liability of newness, we examine whether this liability differs between forms of exit, and how it is shaped by firm-specific innovative capabilities and the industry-specific rate of technological change. Using a large panel of Dutch manufacturing firms from 1996 to 2003, we estimate a competing risks model, which allows us to compare (within the same framework) the probabilities of exiting by closure and by M&A, between categories of firms that differ in age (young and old), innovative capabilities (innovators and non-innovators, in products and/or processes), and technological environment (high-tech and low-tech industries). We find there are two mechanisms at play, which are contingent on the technology environment. First, our results confirm that there is an innovation premium for survival (Cefis and Marsili 2006), which mitigates the liability of newness of entrepreneurial firms, with respect to actual failure or termination of activities by the firm. Second, innovation influences the choice of a possible strategic exit, when entrepreneurs contemplate the alternative between selling the new venture and competing in the market. We observe that by innovating, young firms, in low-tech industries, but not high-tech industries, can improve their chances of success, lowering the risk of closure or increasing the possibility to sell the company. This suggests that in a rapidly changing environment, innovation is necessary, but not sufficient to guarantee the survival of new firms or to create a successful path to exit: the process of competition assumes the characteristics of “Red-Queen” competition (Barnett and Hansen 1996), in which innovation is the entry ticket to the race. Conversely, in a slow changing environment, innovation improves the chances for survival for new firms as well as the option of a successful exit route: when innovation displays exceptionality in the process of competition, innovation becomes the winning ticket.",67

EAs have their origins in the field of computer science, where they are mainly applied for optimization purposes. Nowadays, EAs are also regularly employed in the field of economics. In economic research, EAs frequently serve as a tool for modeling boundedly rational behavior. When EAs are applied as a modeling tool in economic research, a binary encoding of strategies is typically used. This means that strategies are represented by bit strings (i.e., strings of zeros and ones, often referred to as chromosomes) and that evolutionarily inspired operations such as crossover and mutation take place at the level of individual bits. EAs that use a binary encoding of strategies are commonly referred to as genetic algorithms. For early research in which genetic algorithms are employed, we refer to Miller (1986, 1996), Axelrod (1987), Marks (1992), Arifovic (1994, 1996), Andreoni and Miller (1995), and Dawid (1996). Examples of more recent research can be found in the work of, among others, Lux and Schornstein (2005), Alkemade et al. (2006, 2007, 2009), Arifovic and Maschek (2006), Wheeler et al. (2006), Xu (2006), Casari (2008), and Maschek (2010). Researchers who apply genetic algorithms as a tool for modeling boundedly rational behavior typically do not justify why they use a binary encoding of strategies. If the agents whose behavior is being modeled have to make decisions that are intrinsically binary, such as decisions between cooperation and defection in a prisoner’s dilemma (e.g., Axelrod 1987), the use of a binary encoding of strategies is a very natural choice. However, in the case of non-binary decisions, such as decisions by firms on their production level (e.g., Arifovic 1994; Price 1997; Dawid and Kopel 1998; Franke 1998; Vriend 2000; Alkemade et al. 2006, 2007, 2009; Arifovic and Maschek 2006; Wheeler et al. 2006; Casari 2008; Maschek 2010), there is no clear reason for the use of a binary encoding of strategies. In this paper, we examine to what extent the use of a binary encoding of strategies may influence the results of studies in which EAs are employed. It turns out that the use of a binary encoding can have quite significant effects. In general, these effects do not have a meaningful economic interpretation and should be regarded as artifacts. In order to avoid these artifacts, we argue that in most cases researchers should not use a binary encoding of strategies. Our research is inspired by results reported by Alkemade et al. (2006, 2007, 2009; see also Waltman and Van Eck 2009b). Alkemade et al. show that under certain conditions an EA that is employed for modeling purposes may exhibit premature convergence. By premature convergence Alkemade et al. mean that different runs of the EA can lead to very different results. Alkemade et al. argue that premature convergence is caused by a too small population size. In this paper, we report results that point in a different direction. We show that the observation of premature convergence by Alkemade et al. depends crucially on their use of a binary encoding of strategies. Using the same economic environment as Alkemade et al. (i.e., a Cournot oligopoly market), we demonstrate that premature convergence does occur in the case of EAs with a binary encoding while it does not occur in the case of EAs without a binary encoding. We note that the consequences of the use of a binary encoding of strategies are also studied extensively by Dawid (1996; see also Dawid and Kopel 1998). However, the approach taken by Dawid is quite different from the approach that we take in the present paper. Dawid focuses on EAs with a large population size, and he is concerned with aggregate results, that is, results averaged over many EA runs. We do not assume the population size to be large, and we are specifically interested in comparing results of individual EA runs. Another difference is that the crossover operator plays a crucial role in Dawid’s approach while in our approach the crossover operator is not important at all. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the Cournot market that we consider in this paper. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the various EAs that we study and we discuss the economic interpretation of EAs. We report the results of the computer simulations that we have performed in Section 5. Based on these results, we provide an elaborate analysis of the effect of a binary encoding of strategies in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the conclusions of our research.",19

It is consumers who decide when to buy and what to buy, and how to respond to price or quality changes in products supplied to them. Thus, we believe that the analysis of any economic phenomenon should start with the analysis of consumer decisions. The process of consumer decision-making is complex. It is affected by numerous forces, some more important than others. Our everyday decisions about which products to purchase are largely influenced by our own consumption history, by the information coming from our social network, as well as by the information received from the media. At the same time, in today’s world of advanced technologies, many products need specific consumption skills in order to be utilized to their maximum capacity. We argue that the level of these skills plays an important role in consumer decisions about the composition of a significant share of their consumption baskets. Thus, effects of producer decisions are heavily influenced by the process of skill accumulation by consumers. This paper looks at the influence of the skill acquisition process on consumers’ decisions. We consider the problem of choosing a product among multiple alternatives. We discuss two sources of consumer skill acquisition: learning by consuming and the consumer socialization process. Learning by consuming means that consumers acquire skills along the consumption process, while consumer socialization implies that consumers obtain skill spillovers from their social network. In this framework, as a new product enters the market, it is met with some initial skill distribution over the population of consumers. Consumers who purchase new products will acquire more skills through the consumption process, and these skills will be further diffused through a socialization process. Thus, consumer purchasing decisions have temporal effects on average skill levels over the population. High rates of initial market penetration will ensure fast acquisition and the diffusion of skills for new products. This implies that a new product will be able to grab higher market shares during the transition to equilibrium. This framework is suitable for analyzing the effects of producer policies that can influence consumer skill levels. We discuss the effects of such policies using the example of product promotion (advertising). Advertising is recognized as one of the essential activities of a modern firm. Economists, as well as business and marketing academicians, have shown interest in its effects. The main concern has been whether advertising can be used to create barriers to entry and thus to generate a long-run comparative advantage. Views on this issue are not unified: some researchers find that advertising can be effectively used for creating barriers to entry (e.g. Comanor and Wilson 1967, 1979), while others find the opposite (e.g. Erickson and Jacobson 1992). In this paper, we tackle a similar problem. We use an innovative framework in which effects of producer actions are rooted in the micro behavior of consumers. We investigate the manner in which returns to advertising (measured as the gain in market share) depend on quality and user-friendliness of the product when consumers make their product purchases, taking into account their product-specific skills. Products that we have in mind are those that are relatively durable. They are repeatedly purchased by households and are technologically sophisticated to some extent. This description fits well the group of products called “consumer electronics.” This class of products has one more characteristic that makes it particularly interesting for us: the products in this category are widely advertised. According to AdvertisingAge, in year the 2007 producers of consumer electronics in the USA spent 50% of their profits on advertising.Footnote 1 This indicates that producers of consumer electronics rely heavily on advertising as a way of promoting their products. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the existing related literature about learning and socialization among heterogeneous consumers. Section 3 formulates the model of consumer behavior, while Section 4 presents the analysis and results of the model. Section 5 summarizes the paper and provides some concluding remarks.",6

He has made a significant contribution. One of the positive and useful features of Pelikan’s article is his argument that ‘development is an inseparable but distinct companion of evolution’ (p. 3). We agree entirely. In our work we have likewise raised the famous ‘evo-devo’ dispute and affirmed that ‘development and selection are ... essential features of evolution’ (Hodgson and Knudsen 2010b, p. 114). There seems to be no disagreement here. Another common feature is our shared emphasis on the crucial role of information and instructions. Pelikan (2011, p. 343) writes: ‘Evolution produces instructions for guiding development’ and ‘all uses of instructions require pre-existing instructions.’ One of us used the ‘instruction’ language in a much earlier book, writing of ‘information [that] consists of coded instructions programming or directing behaviour or growth’ (Hodgson 1993, ch. 11). In Hodgson and Knudsen (2010b, pp. 65–66, 70–4, 77–8, 80, 84, 113, 117, 121–123, 132, 159–60, 226, 238, 241) we write of instructions in a similar sense. But we also use the replicator terminology, to which Pelikan objects (see below). Nevertheless, continuing on the theme of common ground, our emphasis on informational instructions leads us to argue at length that evolution is an informational process at its core. Like us, Pelikan (2011, p. 357) argues that evolution is a multi-level process involving ‘cultural’, ‘organizational,’ and ‘national’ levels. Our analysis is very similar, but we add some more levels to the picture (Hodgson and Knudsen 2010b, ch. 8). So we have a large measure of agreement.",16

The modular nature of complex systems refers to the nearly decomposable architecture of the interaction between elements. In modular systems, the great majority of interactions occur within modules and only a few interactions occur between modules. Modular architectures offer evolutionary advantages because, in most instances, the effect of a change in a given module is confined to that module. Due to this localization of the effects of changes, the probability of a successful change is greatly enhanced. Each module can be improved more or less independently of other modules. For example, modular technologies allow for innovation in each module without the risk of creating malfunctions in other modules. Similarly, modular organizational designs allow different departments to change their operating routines without creating problematic side effects in other departments. More generally, the typical feature of modular systems holds that they can more easily be improved by random mutation and natural selection than other complex systems. The NK-model, originally developed by Kauffman (1993) and generalized by Altenberg (1994), is a common tool to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of complex systems, including organizations and technologies (Levinthal 1997). In the economics and management literatures, several simulation studies have been carried out to analyze the conditions under which modular systems favor adaptation compared to other complex systems (Frenken et al. 1999, Marengo et al. 2000; Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004; Dosi and Marengo 2005; Brusoni et al. 2007; Rivkin and Siggelkow 2007; Ciarli et al. 2008; Geisendorf 2010; McNerney et al. 2011; cf Bradshaw 1992; Baldwin and Clark 2000). These studies tend to confirm the central idea that modular systems are improved by random mutation and natural selection at a faster rate than other complex systems. Yet, the exact results of the simulation exercises differ across these studies, as they utilize different assumptions regarding search behaviour and memory constraints, as well as differing definitions of modularity. In the following, we propose a formal definition of modularity that distinguishes it from decomposability. Though many use the terms decomposability and modularity interchangeably, we argue that modular systems differ from decomposable systems; while decomposability requires a full decomposition of a complex system into subsystems, modularity requires a system architecture in which subsystems are still connected via interface standards. Conceptually, the problem of the decomposability concept is that a decomposable system is no longer one system, but simply a collection of several smaller systems. As a representation of a technology, or an organization, it falls short in conceptualizing the fact that elements in a technology or organization always act together and are collectively subject to selection. The idea of a decomposable system is thus better understood as an analytical construct or as an approximation of reality rather than a precise representation of a real-world system. The concept of modularity overcomes these conceptual issues. A modular system cannot be partitioned into completely independent subsystems, but rather contains nearly independent subsystems (modules) which are connected via interfaces. These interfaces are elements of a system that connect subsystems such that the only interdependencies between the subsystems are via the interface standards. This definition corresponds quite closely to the concept of near decomposability introduced by Simon (1962, 1969, 2002), as well the more recent notion of modularity in complex networks (Newman 2006). The applied literature on modularity has drawn similar distinctions between modularity and decomposability. For example, Baldwin (2008) compares perfect modularity (similar to our definition of decomposability) with near decomposability (similar to our definition of modularity). Langlois and Garzarelli (2008, p.128) differentiate between decomposable systems and modular systems which are “nearly decomposable system that preserves the possibility of cooperation by adopting a common interface”. This paper, then, is best seen not as creating a novel distinction, but as adopting an existing distinction and expressing it formally. We will argue below, using a generalized NK framework developed by Altenberg (1994), that modular systems, defined in this way, can be optimized globally given the right sequence of problem-solving. Though a decomposition strategy is not feasible, modules can be optimized independently as long as interface standards between modules are left unchanged. This means that, contrary to decomposable systems, optimization of modular systems requires hierarchical problem-solving, where interface standards are defined first, followed by module design within the constraints of the standards. Following this definition, we will proceed to derive the optimal level of modularity for systems of a given size, where the optimum is defined by the search time required for global optimization. This result is shown to be extendable to multi-layered hierarchical complex systems, where modules are defined recursively. We find this extension important since hierarchical complex systems are ubiquitous in technological artefacts and organizational design, yet have not been analyzed thus far in the NK-modelling framework. The reader will note that the model we propose is quite simple. For example, it adopts a global search strategy. This is done purposively for the purpose of creating a framework and a baseline. The framework offers the possibility of comparability of results derived from different assumptions. The baseline of a simple model provides an anchor for comparison with more complex models. This approach of using a simplified model as a baseline is common in NK modelling. It should be noted, then, that the purpose of this model is not to make the empirical claim that it reflects actual behaviour. It rather should be interpreted as a tool to be useful in integrating and reconciling various models on modularity. The importance of creating common frameworks is discussed in terms of the ongoing debate as to whether over-modularity has evolutionary advantages.",23

Many such initiatives have touched upon intellectual property right (IPR) legislation and its relationship to university policy, with the introduction of incentive schemes to induce academic scientists to commercialize more actively their research results, most often through patenting and licensing. All of these reforms share the assumption that European universities and scientists do not undertake enough IPR-mediated technology transfer, especially when compared to their US counterparts (Mowery and Sampat 2005). Recent studies, however, have shown that such assumption may derive from lack of attention to the legal and institutional differences between the university systems of the two continents. In particular, too much faith has been placed in available statistics on the number of patents owned by universities (university-owned patents) as opposed to patents covering inventions by academic scientists, but assigned to the individual scientists, public research organizations and, above all, business companies (university-invented patents; surveys by Geuna and Nesta 2006; and Verspagen 2006). Lissoni et al. (2008) suggest that university-owned patents in France, Italy and Sweden are no more than 11% of all academic patents (whether university-owned or merely university-invented), as opposed to 60–80% academic patents owned by business companies. This implies that European universities may contribute to technology transfer activity by producing inventions, whose IPRs they choose (for institutional, strategic or managerial reasons) to leave entirely in their public or private partners’ hands. When it comes to measuring the effect of patent-inducing policies, therefore, we may be interested not only to measuring whether they have indeed produced an increase in patenting by universities, but also whether such increase may derive from a patent property shift (from public partners and business companies to universities) and not only from an increase in the number of patented inventions. More generally, the number of European academic patents in the hands of business companies is so high that they have necessarily to be taken into account in any evaluation effort. In this paper we build upon Lissoni et al. (2008) in order to assess the impact on patent ownership patterns of IPR-related reforms. In particular, we explore the consequences of the French government’s introduction, in 1999, of the Innovation Act, which promoted, among other things, a more aggressive patenting activity by universities. In particular, we test whether the Act (also known as “Loi Allegre”) has significantly increased the likelihood of a French academic patent being assigned to a university rather than to a business company or a public research organization. We also assess, in the same respect, the effect of the creation of a technology transfer office within the academic inventor’s university. The study is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief review of the IPR-related aspects of science policy reforms introduced in France over the past 10 years, with special emphasis on the Innovation Act. We also provide some comparative information on similar policies introduced in the US and in Europe. In Sections 3 and 4, respectively, we present the data and the econometric model used to examine the effect of the new law. Section 5 illustrates and discusses our results, and Section 6 concludes and outlines the directions of our future research.",33

The best known and most popular model is the epidemic model (pioneered by Bass 1969), where diffusion is governed by epidemic learning. A second type of model is the rational choice or threshold model (David 1969; Kemp 1998). In this type of model, individual decisions are modeled. Both models are widely and successfully applied to simple as well as to complex technologies, varying from lead free petrol to wastewater treatment technologies. There has emerged a third type of diffusion model that incorporates endogenous technological change, called the evolutionary or ‘non-equilibrium’ model (in the tradition of Nelson and Winter 1982). This type of model includes (random) events and learning, which result in changes in the techno-economic characteristics of the technologies. Recently, some models of this type incorporated evolution of consumers, referred to as co-evolutionary modeling (Windrum and Birchenhall 2005; Windrum et al. 2009a, bb). Although existing diffusion models have shown their value in simulating innovation at the firm level (technological innovation, learning), the market and sector level (competition and diffusion, structural change), and the macro level (growth, long waves and international trade), the models are as yet less applied to consumer products in a changing social context. Popularity or social connotation of products, especially new emerging environmental products, may change alongside technological innovation. A chief example is the hybrid-electric vehicle, which entered the car market around 2000. Owners see their vehicle as ‘socially responsible’, as ‘the right vehicle for society’ (Heffner et al. 2006). Progression of such connotation will influence the further innovation and diffusion process of the technology, affecting both the consumer and the producer side. There are currently no models available that incorporate this interaction of such social and technological aspects. In this paper, we aim to extend the co-evolutionary approach to innovation diffusion in a changing social context. To this end, we incorporate elements of the literature of social construction of technology (SCOT; Bijker 1995) into an evolutionary model. This results in an agent-based model to analyze the interaction between consumer demand and industry supply as a co-evolutionary process. Agents’ behavior is subject to feedback mechanisms from micro-to-micro, as well as macro-to-micro. One such mechanism is the creation of meaning by consumers of a product based on product characteristics. By attaching weights to various product attributes, different groups of consumers interpret the same product differently: they attach different meaning and value to it. The set of weights that an actor group applies in evaluating adoption and investment is called a frame. A potential adopter’s frame includes attributes of functionality, but also of social connotation. The attribution of meaning (especially by early adopters) influences other consumers’ decisions, something that is well-established in marketing but has been neglected in innovation diffusion analysis. The interplay of demand and supply through various feedback loops give rise to trajectories. These paths of innovation may be modeled on the basis of the feedback loops. This will be done here for the example of car engines. The paper offers a bridge between two literatures: innovation diffusion and social construction of technology (SCOT; Bijker 1995), dealing with shortcomings of both literatures, such as the assumption of an objective innovation in the innovation literature and the neglect of techno-economic characteristics of the innovation and co-evolution processes in the SCOT literature. This paper has five sections. In Section 2, we review the diffusion modeling literature, covering the early epidemic modeling approach of Bass, up to the recent co-evolutionary approach. In Section 3, we describe our model concept, offering a richer conceptualization than current diffusion models, in particular by drawing from the literature on the social construction of technology (SCOT; Bijker 1995). In Section 4, we describe a simulation model that formalizes the modeling concept for the case of car engine innovation. In Section 5, the model is applied and two model runs are discussed with a focus on the role of social connotation. Section 6 presents scenarios for the future diffusion of cleaner car engines, supported by the model runs. Section 7 draws conclusions and discusses the novelties of our analysis and challenges for future research.",17

Hommes,Raoul H. S. Philipse,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Expectations play a major role in both financial and commodity markets affecting individual decisions and having a large impact on aggregate variables, such as prices. Sometimes the influence of expectations seems larger than that of other, more tangible fundamental factors. Recent literature on Heterogeneous Agent Models shows that when non-fundamental expectations are widespread among market participants they can result in price bubbles, see, e.g., the review in Hommes (2006). Dynamics of heterogeneous, non-fundamental expectations might explain different “stylized facts” of financial markets, above all excess volatility of asset prices (Shiller 1981). For this reason it is important to investigate how individuals form expectations about market variables and what is their aggregate effect. The expectations of the participants in real markets are not easily observable and are also affected by different uncontrolled factors. This makes experiments in a controlled environment particularly attractive for studying expectations (Duffy 2006). The number of experiments on expectations is growing, see, e.g., Hey (1994), Hommes et al. (2005, 2007, 2008), Adam (2007) and Fehr and Tyran (2008), see Hommes (2011) for a recent survey. By and large these experiments reject the dominating in economic theory Rational Expectations hypothesis. The development of an alternative theory of expectation formation thus becomes an important task. In this paper we contribute to this task by fitting the Heuristics Switching Model (HSM), introduced in Anufriev and Hommes (2009, 2012), to a recent experiment on expectation formation presented in Heemeijer et al. (2009) (HHST, henceforth). This experiment is one of several “learning to forecast” experiments that have been performed in the CREED laboratory of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). Participants of these experiments have a single task to predict next period’s realization of an aggregate variable (price), which depends on the average of all individual predictions. The details of the pricing equation may change in these experiments, see the examples in Hommes et al. (2005, 2007, 2008) and Sonnemans and Tuinstra (2010). These early experiments have already pointed out that the type of feedback between expectations and realization is important. In the “hog cycle” model of a market for an agricultural good with a production lag, when the expectations about next period’s price are high, producers produce a large amount of the good and the realized price is low. This is an example of a negative feedback system. The opposite situation holds in positive feedback systems. For example, if expectations about the future price of a speculative asset are high, the demand for the asset will increase and the realized price will be also high. Experiments in Heemeijer et al. (2009) focus on the role of the feedback type. In a perfectly symmetric setting, where the only difference between two treatments is the sign of the average forecast in the pricing equation, two different qualitative patterns have been observed. In the negative feedback treatments, where higher expectations lead to lower price, the realized market price converges to the fundamental level very quickly and remains there for the rest of the experiment. In contrast, in a positive feedback market, where higher expectations lead to higher price realizations, the price exhibits fluctuations and long lasting deviations from the fundamental level. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a single model of individual expectations can explain these different aggregate outcomes. Estimation of individual forecasts in HHST reveals that participants of the experiment tended to use simple behavioral rules in their forecasting activity. These rules strongly depended on the feedback type. This paper takes these results as a starting point to fit the data with a heuristic switching model (HSM) which also explains why different rules are chosen under different feedback. This HSM proposed in Anufriev and Hommes (2012) extends the adaptive belief framework of Brock and Hommes (1997). In the HSM agents’ expectations are governed by several behavioral heuristics, e.g., adaptive or trend-following rules. Agents switch between heuristics learning to use those heuristics which performed better in the past. The impact of different heuristics on the aggregate price is, therefore, changing over time, explaining different aggregate outcome observed in the experiment. For the negative feedback experiment we find that in the initial periods the adaptive heuristic performs much better than the others. As this heuristic attracts enough participants, the price dynamics exhibit convergence to the fundamental level with small oscillations around it due to small noise. Along this converging time path the adaptive heuristic performs slightly better than the others, supporting this outcome in the long run. In the positive feedback environment the performance of the trend-following heuristic is better. When this heuristic is used by a majority of participants, the price deviates from the fundamental value leading to persistent price trends, and confirming the dominating trend-following heuristic. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we set out the background on which this work rests, discuss bounded rationality and recall the HHST experiment. Section 3 presents models with a single heuristic and HSM with several heuristics replicating the experimental data. In Section 4 we compare the performances of different models, optimize the best performing model and discuss the robustness of the model simulations. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions drawn from our research.",36

The role of entrepreneurship and knowledge spillovers,September 2013,Joern H. Block,Roy Thurik,Haibo Zhou,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Endogenous growth theory assumes that an economy automatically benefits from its investments in new knowledge (Lucas 1988; Romer 1990) because knowledge is a public good that can be used by an entire economy, leading to innovation and economic growth (Cantner et al. 2008). In the empirical world of the R&D capital approach (Mansfield 1965; Griliches 1998, 2000), the development of total factor productivity (TFP) is explained using an R&D stock variable.Footnote 1 Although a great deal of evidence shows that knowledge (R&D stock) leads to growth (TFP growth), some countries seem to benefit more from investments in new knowledge than others. The US, for example, is thought to commercialize new knowledge better than Europe, giving rise to what is referred to as the Swedish paradox (Ejermo and Kander 2006) or the European paradox (Audretsch 2007). Investment in new knowledge is only one necessary condition; new knowledge must be exploited and put to commercial use so that it can translate into stronger competitiveness and subsequent economic growth (Braunerhjelm and Svensson 2010; Carlsson et al. 2009) This barrier between knowledge and its commercialization is referred to as the knowledge filter (Acs et al. 2009; Braunerhjelm et al. 2010).Footnote 2
 The contribution of Acs et al. (2009) extends the microeconomic foundations of endogenous growth models (Lucas 1988; Romer 1990) through the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship, which holds that knowledge creation can lead to knowledge spillovers, creating technological opportunities. Entrepreneurs then exploit these opportunities, leading to economic growth and development. New product innovations may come from both incumbent firms and start-ups. Incumbent firms mainly produce incremental innovations from the flow of knowledge, whereas start-ups tend to exploit knowledge spillovers to produce radical innovations. Braunerhjelm et al. (2010) use the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship to explain the European or Swedish paradox (Ejermo and Kander 2006; Audretsch 2007). They develop a theoretical model in which the transformation of knowledge into economic growth depends on how knowledge diffuses through both incumbent and entrepreneurial activity. The entrepreneur is the “missing link in converting knowledge into economically relevant knowledge” (Braunerhjelm et al. 2010, p. 105). Based on OECD data from 1981 to 2002, they show that entrepreneurship Granger-causes economic growth and that this effect increased in the 1990s, as the knowledge economy began to grow. Our paper links the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (Acs et al. 2009) to empirical innovation research using different types of innovation as outcome variables. Whereas the empirical model of Braunerhjelm et al. (2010) tests the effects of entrepreneurship on economic growth when the link to innovation is indirect, we seek to explain the effect of entrepreneurship on the transformation of knowledge into innovation. A research gap exists in the link between the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and empirical research about innovation and the commercialization of knowledge (Carlsson et al. 2009; Braunerhjelm and Svensson 2010). In our paper, we will discriminate between innovations that are new to the market and those that are new to the firm. Based upon the knowledge spillover theory, we hypothesize that a high rate of entrepreneurship facilitates the process of turning knowledge into new-to-the-market innovation but has no important effect on the relationship between knowledge and new-to-the-firm innovation. Our focus, and, therefore, our unit of observation, is at the country level rather than at the individual-firm level. We use a panel dataset that covers the innovation activity of 21 European countries in four waves, corresponding to the period from 1996 to 2006. The results clearly show that entrepreneurship, measured as the business ownership rate, is an important driver for turning knowledge into new-to-the-market innovation but has no impact on new-to-the-firm innovation. This finding is precisely what the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and prior entrepreneurship research predicts. Entrepreneurs as individuals are considered risk takers (Kihlstrom and Laffont 1979) who are tolerant of ambiguity (Schere 1982). Thus, they play an important role when risk and uncertainty are involved, such as new-to-the-market innovations, but less so for new-to-the-firm innovations, for which product uncertainty and risk are much lower. Our paper contributes to our understanding of the knowledge spillover theory, particularly why and under what conditions entrepreneurship leads to innovation and economic growth. This paper also enhances understanding of the types of innovation that are most closely related to entrepreneurship. Following this introduction, Section 2 introduces the literature on economic growth, knowledge spillovers and types of innovation. Section 3 develops our hypotheses using the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and links this theory to different innovation outcomes. Section 4 summarizes our data and the empirical model. Section 5 reports our regression results, which are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.",87

To understand better the dynamics of economic growth and enact facilitative policies, we must design improved measures of innovation. At the same time, firms would benefit as to implement best practices in innovation management and services. For the sake of the subsequent discussion, we rely on the following definition of innovation:Footnote 1 The design, invention, development and/or implementation of new or altered products, services, process, systems, organizational structures, or business models for the purpose of creating new value for customers and financial returns for the firm. It is rather obvious from this perspective that while innovation is a change in the performance of the supply side of the economy, the value induced is well measured from the demand side. As a better, faster and cheaper alternative enhances the value of innovation, it is essential that we consider innovations by price deflation and performance improvement, perhaps independently. In general, the former is called process innovation while the latter is called product innovation. To do so, we must evaluate the qualitative changes in commodities with relevance to the overall innovation gain, while controlling and identifying how much performance bettered and how much price halved, in effect. The problem is, thus, to figure out how to measure the value of qualitative as well as quantitative changes in a differentiated market in different periods. One way would be to apply a hedonic approach, whereby regressing characteristics of a commodity on its price. By means of time dummy variables we can estimate the marginal prices of the attributes, and at the same time retrieve the changes in CPI (consumer price index) which is equivalent to the quality-adjusted price change.Footnote 2 Although CPI is one demand side assessment of innovation, hedonic approach itself is based on both consumers’ and producers’ optimizing behavior. If hedonic regression is not weighted by sales volume for each commodity, which often is the case, the index would be more or less a supply side measurement. Hedonic function and related price indices can make relative comparison between the levels of innovation but are not compatible with the absolute terms for welfare change. On that regard, discrete choice methods, which are based on the consumer’s intrinsic behavior, are eligible for estimating the change in the consumer surplus, through structural econometric investigations. Discrete choice models are widely applied in a variety of situations, including welfare measures estimation for cereals using time dummy variables by Nevo (2003). Mason and Quigley (1990) and Cropper et al. (1993) found that discrete choice models yield better estimates of non-marginal changes compared to those obtained using hedonic methods through their simulation experiments. Recent advancement includes various techniques concerning the IIA property of the logistic regression, omitted variables, endogeneity, etc. (Berry 1994; Berry et al. 1995; Petrin and Train 2010). Under the discrete choice framework, an utility-controlled price index can be sought, for which they are called the COL (cost of living) index. Incidentally, CPI is taken as an approximation to the COL index (see Fisher and Shell 1998, p. 3). A true COL index is based on the theory of consumer demand which indicates how much money a consumer would need in later period, relative to the amount of money he needed in the base period to attain the same level of utility as in the base period (Jonker 2001). The COL index, however, is by far less illuminating than the welfare measurements that we combine to obtain that index. On the other hand, the utility-constant valuation of attributes by way of discrete choice methods, allows us to project all qualitative characteristics along with prices of goods onto the iso-consumer surplus plane, so that not only the welfare gain from innovation can we assess in terms of compensated variation, but also can we separate it into the innovative components that we consider.Footnote 3 In this paper we thereby disaggregate the welfare gain into the qualitative and the budgetary terms. As for our analyses, we collected weekly market data through an internet shopping mall called Kakaku.com in Japan for LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs that amount to the retail price and counts of page views which we use as a proxy for transaction counts for each model that prevailed within the market during the period October 2005–October 2007. LCD TV has received considerable attention in recent years, partly by the digitization of the terrestrial broadcasts in Japan, let alone the recent prominent innovations in LCD High Definition TV’s. Another feature is that TVs were the largest expended items (larger than PCs) in the educational and entertainment durable goods category for households expenditure, according to the Family Income and Expenditure Survey 2006–2008 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Japan.Footnote 4
 The attributes for the entire set of models were obtained from the website where the basic information for each model is available. These data were used to estimate a discrete choice model based on a nested logistic regression, and the quality measures by using the estimated parameters on the attributes. The performance attributes, in this regard, were selected in a same manner as the case for the hedonic attributes. We first estimate a hedonic function and were able to compare the estimates with those obtained by the discrete choice model. Transition of price and quality relationship is then assessed by the utility constant indifference line and its shift in time, while we eliminate the supply side of the market by assuming inelastic supply curve; in discrete choice framework, utilities will be measured relatively in terms of differences in consumers surplus, as is dealt in Trajtenberg (1989). Accordingly, and assuming that the indifference lines are all parallel, we are able to assess the price changes that are fair to the qualitative improvements in the commodities. The overall innovation gain, therefore, will coincide with the budget gain that eliminates the value of qualitative improvements, plus that quality gain which we designate fair assessment of the qualitative improvements, in monetary terms. Although we will not be discovering index figures , innovation gain, if any, will be measured as the quality normalized price deflation, or, what is known by the term process innovation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly summarize the LCD TV market in Japan during the sample time span. Section 3 outlines the theoretical foundations of discrete choice models and elaborates on the measurement that is consistent with the consumers welfare change. The data and performance attributes selection along with hedonic regressions are discussed in Section 4. Value estimates of the performance attributes for the discrete choice model via nested logit regression, and the main result of price-quality relationship is presented in this section as well. Section 5 concludes.",3

Network models are operationalized in the attempt to provide a novel understanding of two central issues of labor intermediation: (1) how and to what extent the arrival of labor intermediaries following enactment of a reform affects market integration and accessibility of different employers by people who reallocate within the market, and (2) whether and how the power of intermediaries in controlling and directing worker flows grows over time, and the fundamental dynamics of this process. These questions are derived directly from the fundamental trade-off characterizing brokerage activity, according to which, on the one side, intermediation increases matching opportunities by reducing both parties’ information costs, and on the other side, it produces monopolistic rents for the intermediary, due to the information asymmetries inherent in information brokerage which also favor concentration of the market in the hands of a few intermediaries. To explore these issues, we apply for the first time a complex network approach to employer-employee matched data covering the universe of private employment in Veneto, a highly industrialized region in the North–East of Italy. A network representation is used to organize individual mobility events over a ten-year period, and network models are used to capture the effects of labor intermediaries on the structure of inter-firm reallocations. We focus on a special category of intermediaries, temporary employment agencies (TEAs), that was introduced in Italy by the 1997 “Treu” reform of the labor market as a response to the persistently high level of unemployment especially in the southern regions of the country and among young people. Prior to the Treu reform, employment services were a public monopoly operated through a network of provincial agencies, which generally were inefficient and of little help to unemployed people (Barbieri et al. 2001). TEAs are, thus, the very first example of a private employment intermediary in contemporary Italy (detailed information about the novelties introduced by the Treu reform are provided in Appendix I). The main object of the analysis is a directed graph where the vertices indicate employers, private firms or TEAs, and the links denote transfers of workers between employers. The data track all worker reallocations involving TEAs as either origin or destination, which captures all labor mobility involving intermediaries. The first analytical focus is on the degree to which the network of labor mobility works as an integrated and easily practicable system for workers reallocating from one job to another, measured by the small-world characteristics of the network. The impact of TEAs on the network architecture is assessed by interpreting the tendency of the “world” of worker mobility to become smaller as a sign that the labor market is more accessible and more pervious to reallocation flows, and vice versa. The second main focus is on the position of TEAs in the reallocation market or, more specifically, on their power in controlling hiring channels, as revealed by the number of incoming links pointing to intermediaries in the labor mobility network. To this purpose, the evolution of the statistical distribution of connections over vertices is tracked, highlighting the way in which global labor flows adjust to the presence of labor market intermediaries (LMIs). This is followed by a discussion of the predictions of several models of network formation describing evolution of the link distribution in the presence of information costs. Exploratory in its nature, the approach developed in this work allows for quantitative analysis of the effects of employment intermediation on the labor market system as a whole, while also identifying the possible mechanisms governing the evolution of intermediaries’ market power. Ultimately, the paper provides a novel set of tools for monitoring labor market functioning and supporting policy actions aimed, for instance, at improving the efficiency of job matching through intermediation or formulating better regulations for intermediated markets. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical foundations of economic intermediation, with a special focus on the labor market; Section 3 introduces the network framework and the empirical strategy; Section 4 describes the data. Sections 5 and 6 present the results; Section 7 discusses the empirical evidence on the evolution of TEAs market power in the light of network formation models; Section 8 concludes.",2

McCann identifies the influence Schumpeter had on the work and ideas of Perlman who later set out to analyze Schumpeter’s influence on the work and ideas of other contemporaries. The self-referential twist of this enquiry provides unusual insights into the work of both Perlman as the progenitor of the present project and Schumpeter as its designated subject matter. Generally, the early Schumpeter is seen “to have been in the Cartesian mould”, with economics representing a “scientific discipline, distinct in kind from political economy, a logical and mathematical discipline, ahistorical by its nature” (25); in turn, the later Schumpeter became more Baconian, his “grounding in economic history, sociology, statistics, law, political science, political economy” (25). Perlman arguably adopted the posture of the later Schumpeter, but unlike Schumpeter, Perlman recognized the necessity of acknowledging expressly the “significance of Institutionalism as a school of thought and as a subject of inquiry” (25). In the concluding section of his contribution, McCann quotes Perlman: “As with Einstein, Schumpeter failed to find his unified theory, but like Einstein he believed that there must be one somewhere” (Perlman 1994, xxxvi). Indeed, one may opine that despite Schumpeter’s broad vision of a unified economic theory, his project was bound to remain unfinished given his ultimate reluctance to import the required knowledge (from sociology, psychology, etc.) not native to the traditional canon of the economic discipline. Paul A. Samuelson, in his paper The Harvard Circle (title inserted by editors), provides an “undocumented memory” report which is remarkable in two ways. First, his chronicle of personal encounters and reminiscences bears witness to the extraordinary number of now famous economists who, in the years around 1935 gathered in the “Harvard Yard”. It also reveals spectacularly how close interactions between scientists can spur great scientific advances. More important in the context of this volume is Samuelson’s paper as an assessment of Schumpeter’s work. It provides a clear indication of how his own work departed from Schumpeter’s, leading to what in hindsight may be conceived as a major bifurcation in the evolution of contemporary economics. Schumpeter aimed at completing economics by amending Walras’ equilibrium theory with a dynamic chapter focusing on entrepreneurial innovations and by relying on a mix of methods. In contrast, Samuelson set out to complete the neoclassical program by integrating the domains of micro- and macroeconomics based on comparative equilibrium statics, inspired by Newtonian physics and clothed in rigorous mathematics. In his paper, Samuelson criticizes Schumpeter for being “such a bad macroeconomist … as bad as 1931 Hayek” (33), and scolds Schumpeter for “having admiration for technicians whose mathematical nuances he did not fully understand” (34). Samuelson the Schumpeter student sets the pace for modern neoclassical economics, much in the Cartesian spirit of the young Schumpeter, and it was not before the 1980s, mostly due to the influential work by Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter, that Schumpeter’s key theoretical message of the innovative entrepreneur as the driver of modern capitalism gained broader credence in the discipline. In due recognition of Schumpeter’s lasting contribution, Samuelson concludes: “What will ever be remembered was his now century old emphasis on entrepreneurial innovation as a cardinal catalyst for economic progress” (34). In his paper Joseph Schumpeter: The Long Run, and the Short, William J. Baumol gives Schumpeter’s purported Achilles heel (lack of understanding of macroeconomics and of mathematical sophistication) a different interpretation. Baumol does not start off with static Keynesian macroeconomics developed around the critique of Say’s proposition of an automatic macro-equilibrium, but instead refers to the central contribution Say made with a view to modern economic dynamics, stating “it is only Say who recognized and, indeed, emphasized the role of the innovative entrepreneur, who perceives the promises of an invention and takes steps to ensure that it is put to effective use” (40). Thus departing from the ‘dynamic Say’, Schumpeter’s seminal contribution comes into focus. Baumol sketches Schumpeter’s “workable and useful micro-model of the growth process” demonstrating—in appreciation of Schumpeter’s ‘tacit’ technical skills—that “his model lends itself directly to formalisation” (42). Gunnar Eliasson’s paper, The Incomplete Schumpeter Stockholm School Connection, is an exercise in counterfactual history of economic thought inspired by the “sad observation … that unique constructive features of two schools—the Austrian/Schumpeterian and the Swedish Stockholm School—have been dispatched into ignorance for such a long time” (54). The counterfactual approach enlarges the context of interpretation, indicating connections between theories or schools that evade any analysis conducted on the basis of a factual account. Here, the Schumpeterian entrepreneur emerges in the context of dynamic coordination failures defined by Wicksellian cumulative processes, in the sequential analysis of Stockholm school economists, in Carl Menger’s subjectivist focus on ignorance, and in Hayek’s discussion of investment mistakes—all loosely posited in a framework that distinguishes between ex ante and ex post. In her paper, It was Ideas and Ideologies, not Interests or Institutions, which Changed in Northwestern Europe, 1600–1848, Deirdre N. McCloskey traces a historical path that has led to what Schumpeter called the “business-respecting civilization”. In her view Schumpeter’s ensuing theoretical edifice suffers from the basic shortcoming that he “did not … attempt to unify his economics of entrepreneurship with sociology ….” (57). Schumpeter’s case is seen as symptomatic for the general neglect of integrating properly the various disciplines of the social sciences. In a general attempt to shatter “bad history, bad economics, and bad sociology”, McCloskey endeavors to rewrite chapters of European history such that “better ideological conditions” and improvements in the “conditions of talk” are the driving forces. The materialistic underpinnings of traditional histories are dismantled, not sparing the venerable figures Toynbee and Mantoux, and the “memes” of the bourgeoisie are given distinct explanatory power. In its instrumental avenues, “Science didn’t make the modern world. Technology did, in newly liberated and honoured instrument makers and tinkerers.” (64) From here a bridge may be built to the Schumpeterian entrepreneur who is not interested in ideas per se but rather in ideas as the basis for carrying out economic operations. Paul Nightingale’s paper Schumpeter’s Theological Roots?: Harnack and the Origins of Creative Destruction, demonstrates that Schumpeter’s “creative destruction”—a concept associated with the very core of his work—was paralleled by Harnack’s historical analysis of religions such as Christianity. The parallels exist at the overarching plane of an assumed general historicity, as “(f)or Harnack, Strauss, Ritschl and Schleiermacher, the Bible was not an expression of timeless truth but a product conditioned by the historical context in which it was produced.” (70) The statement evokes (as analogy) neoclassical decision logic as “timeless truth” and leaves evolutionary economics as analysis of actual economic phenomena produced in a “historical context”. More specifically, the close parallels also appear at the theoretic level as manifest in Harnack’s proposal to re-structure the “history of Christianity … around a dynamic theory of historical change driven by charismatic innovators, revolutions and the creative destruction of old orders” (70). Nightingale suggests we “reread Schumpeter with fresh eyes” (74). Based on the exegesis proposed, we may also wish to address the foundational question of whether evolutionary economic theory should be considered as a special theory within a more general theory of social evolution—a question much under-researched but arguably as relevant as the enquiry into a homology between biological and economic evolution.",3

An evolutionary approach,July 2015,Michał Ramsza,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The concept of a reference group and its potential influence on an individual has been know at least since the landmark publication of Merton (1949), but its beginnings can be traced to Cooley (1902). A brief definition of a reference group is given in Park and Lessig (1977):  “(...) a reference group is defined to be an actual or imaginary individual or group conceived of having significant relevance upon an individual’s evaluations, aspirations, or behavior.” The present paper uses the concept of a reference group in a very broad sense as defined above. The general discussion regarding the concept of a reference group is beyond the scope of this paper. A brief discussion of the history of the concept of a reference group and its relevance can be found in Dawson and Chatman (2001). This short note concerns the choices between two alternatives made within a large population. Suppose that each individual in the population uses a product of one of two alternative brands. Once in a while the product breaks and needs to be replaced with a new one. At this time, an individual tries to determine which brand is used by the majority of a population. He selects at random a group of \(k \in \mathbb {N}\) individuals. This group becomes his reference group. He chooses a brand used by the majority of those in the reference group with the probability α∈(0,1), referred to as the follow-up probability. This procedure is repeated in time and leads to fluctuations of the share of each brand in the market. The market share of the first brand at any given time t is denoted by x(t) ∈[0,1]. The two parameters, the size of a reference group k and the follow-up probability α, are exogenous. The size k of the reference group governs the precision of information that an individual gets while choosing a brand.Footnote 1 The follow-up probability α is the measure of affect’s strength of an individual for the group. The strength of the influence of the group on the individual thus measures how strongly an individual wants to be associated with the majority of a population. The value α = 1/2 is referred to as the neutral position — larger values indicate the positive attitude to the information, while lower values indicate the negative attitude to the information. The main issue investigated in the present paper is the isolated effect of the reference groups on the market share of a particular brand. Specifically, there are two main points investigated. The first point concerns the existence and (local) stability of equilibrium. The second point concerns the dependence of equilibrium on the follow-up probability α and the size of a reference group k. It is shown that, depending on the follow-up probability, there are two distinct types of model behavior, i.e. the model is not structurally stable for any k. The (pitchfork) bifurcation occurs for relatively high values of the follow-up probability provided that the size of a reference group is small, which may be interpreted as the negligible effect of the reference group in certain circumstances. The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, the model is constructed and analyzed. Section 3 offers discussion and conclusions.",4

Such extensive analysis has led to the identification of a number of statistical properties for financial returns that seem to hold across markets and over time, and that can be summarized in the following set of empirical stylized facts (see, e.g., Cont 2001 and Tseng and Li 2011): i) the distribution of returns is not Gaussian but presents instead fat tails; ii) there is no serial correlation in returns; iii) there is positive correlation in absolute returns, with slow decay; iv) returns show strong volatility clustering, with large fluctuations that tend to cluster together. Though there is agreement among researchers on such empirical observations, we still lack a clear understanding of their causes. We suggest in this work that a common origin could be identified in the time-varying nature of the risk aversion coefficient for investors, and show that an otherwise standard, rational expectations asset pricing model, once enhanced with such a feature, can generate time series for returns that replicate very closely the main stylized facts identified in the empirical literature. A growing body of literature has recently tried to use adaptive learning to improve the empirical performance of asset pricing models. Examples include Branch and Evans (2010, 2011), Adam et al. (2015), Carceles-Poveda and Giannitsarou (2008), Bullard and Duffy (2001), Brock and Hommes (1998) and Timmermann (1993, 1996). The main success of these works has been in generating models able to show excess volatility similar to that observed in financial markets, but they have not focused on the same array of short-horizon stylized facts that we consider here. An important attempt at explaining such short-run stylized facts comes instead from models based on stochastic interactions among traders. These models are borrowed and adapted from the physics literature, where they have been known for being able to generate data that display scaling laws regularities similar to those found in financial markets.Footnote 1 While the spirit of these works is similar to the motivation of this paper, our study would fit perhaps better in the behavioral economics literature, as we try to remain as close as possible to a standard economics framework, while departing from it only in the way a behavioral characteristic, risk aversion, is modeled. The advantage of this approach with respect to models based on stochastic interacting particles is that the economic interpretation remains clearer. While stochastic models of interacting agents seem to be able to replicate facts such as fat tails and volatility clustering, in fact, they tend to lack microfoundations and do not explicitly provide an economic justification for the behavior of agents. The backbone model that we use for our analysis is a simple, standard, present value asset pricing model with stochastic dividends, as presented, for example, by De Long et al. (1990). Such a model, as it stands, does a poor job in matching stylized facts about financial returns, as it implies that returns are normally distributed and independent over time. Our main contribution is to show that a simple behavioral modification of this model can generate returns that match key statistical properties of historical data for financial markets. The risk aversion coefficient for investors is usually assumed, in the standard economics and finance literature, to be a primitive of the model, a feature that is hard wired into the brain of people when they are born and that does not change. We believe instead that there is scope for modelling the attitude of agents towards risk as a feature that depends on the environment in which agents make their decisions, and that evolves with it. For example, narrative evidence suggests that many people, who had been very cautious up to that point with their investment decisions and mainly kept their savings in government securities or similar activities, during the stock market bubble of the late nineties and early 2000 abandoned their safe investments and moved their money into more risky assets. Observing high rates of returns on stock markets, those people became more willing to take on risky activities in an attempt to join in and share the high profits that were realized on financial markets at the time. In a sort of herd-like behavior induced by their decreased risk aversion, previously cautious investors entered into the stock market. When prices then started to fall and returns decreased, those same investors became afraid of losses, their risk aversion increased and they fled financial markets, selling their assets and fuelling a sharper decrease in prices. Alan Greenspan, on this point, said in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (Greenspan, 2005; Italics added):  “Thus, this vast increase in the market value of asset claims is in part the indirect result of investors accepting lower compensation for risk. [...] Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher asset prices.” Greenspan suggests in his speech that changes in market values depend, partly, on changes in risk premia required by agents, which in turn depend on the attitude of investors towards risk. In this paper we make formal this argument and show that adding this feature to an otherwise standard model changes completely the statistical properties of simulated asset returns, making them similar to those observed in real markets. Time-varying risk aversion is not new in economics. In consumption-based asset pricing models, for example, Brandt and Wang (2003) propose a time-varying risk aversion coefficient that responds to news about consumption growth and inflation, while Li (2007) studies asset prices under the assumption of a countercyclical risk aversion. We propose instead a process for risk aversion that depends on unexpected excess returns: agents adapt their attitude towards risk on the basis of the unexpected excess gains that they observe from risky activities. While in standard economics risk aversion is a feature that depends solely on the curvature of the utility function being maximized by agents, the form of which is assumed constant over time, in behavioral economics Kahneman and Tversky (1979)’s prospect theory argues that expected utility maximization is a poor representation of how people make choices under risk, and suggests instead an alternative framework where people’s attitude towards risk is situation dependent. We will continue to use here the expected utility maximization framework, but modify it to allow for the curvature of the utility function, and therefore the risk attitude of agents, to evolve over time endogenously. An evolutionary justification for changes in attitudes towards risk is provided by Netzer (2009), who shows that, from an evolutionary perspective, the utility function of agents, and therefore their risk aversion, should depend on the probability distribution of alternatives about which agents need to make decisions. In our context, such alternatives are represented by returns from risky versus risk-free activities, and agents adapt their perceptions about the distribution of such alternatives using observations about unexpected excess returns on the stock market. The plan of the paper is as follows: in Section 1.1 we discuss the literature related to our work, while in Section 1.2 we discuss more in detail the statistical properties of financial returns by looking at the S&P500 index as a representative case. Section 2 introduces the basic model, Section 2.1 discusses endogenous time-varying risk aversion and Section 2.2 derives the equilibrium solution for the model. Section 3 presents results from simulations of the model with constant and with endogenous time-varying risk aversion, and compares the resulting series for returns with those from real data. Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes. Two main lines of research are relevant to our work, one based on bounded rationality and learning, and the other based on behavioral models of human decisions. In terms of the first strain of literature, Branch and Evans (2010) show that real time learning dynamics, in an otherwise standard consumption based asset pricing model, calibrated to U.S. stock data, is capable of reproducing regime-switching returns and volatilities. Branch and Evans (2011) introduce learning about risk and returns in the De Long et al. (1990) framework and show that escape dynamics emerge that look like stock market crashes, even though the escape route is not from a bubble high but from the equilibrium fundamental value. Hommes and Zhu (2014) use the concept of stochastic consistent expectations equilibrium to explain excess volatility in a standard present value asset pricing model with stochastic dividends similar to the one we consider here. Adam et al. (2015) show how adaptive learning can generate excess volatility in a consumption based asset pricing model and present an estimated version of the model to US data that can replicate some asset price puzzles such as stock price volatility, the persistence of the price-dividend ratio and the predictability of long-horizon returns. All these works mainly focus on the long-horizon properties of asset prices returns, while we will focus our attention on trying to explain and replicate statistical properties of returns in the short run. As for the second strain of literature, Lux (2009) provides an extensive surveys on behavioral asset pricing models based on interacting agents. He divides such literature into four groups, and we follow here his classification in our discussion. A first class of models is focused on interactions between fundamentalists and chartists, where the disaggregation of markets is limited to the distinction between two classes of agents that form their demand according to different rules. Early contributions are Beja and Goldman (1980), Day and Huang (1990) and Chiarella (1992). The interaction between these two classes of agents is able to generate a mix of centripetal and centrifugal forces that can lead to rich dynamics in prices. More recently, Chiarella and He (2002, 2003) propose a model where there is heterogeneity in risk aversion between fundamentalists and trend chasers, coupled with learning about future returns, and find that the dynamics of asset prices are affected by the relative risk attitudes of different types of investors. A second class of models is built on local stochastic interactions, based on the seminal work of Kirman (1993) on herding: here the departure from traditional economics models is more marked, with agents’ demand being determined by a local interaction mechanism by which agents are recruited by neighbors on a particular strategy. Kirman and Teyssière (2002) show that such a feature can generate long-term dependence in absolute and squared returns. A third class of models tries to capture non-local interactions through field effects, as for example in Lux (1995, 1998): the main feature here is that traders are assumed to be influenced not by other individual agents, but by the overall mood of the market. Such models can generate fads or herding in the market that lead to autoregressive dependence in higher moments. Finally, some authors have explored the importance of the topology of interactions on financial markets. Bouchaud and Cont (2000), for example, build on the percolation model popular in statistical mechanics and place traders on a lattice with interactions among neighboring agents forming clusters: the ensuing distribution of returns shows fat tails but higher moments are uncorrelated, thus failing to match one key stylized fact of financial markets. Subsequent works have tried to improve on this framework: for example, Iori (2002), using a different network structure, has been able to generate time series that more closely match those observed in financial markets. Among these approaches based on stochastic interactions among agents, we believe the mechanism at work in our framework is closer in spirit to the one used in models with field effects, where individual decisions are affected by aggregate features of the economy. In our case the (individual) demand for the risky asset depends on the risk aversion coefficient, which changes endogenously in response to changes in excess returns, an aggregate feature of the market. Despite the similar interpretation, the way we model such effects, from the aggregate to the individual level and back, differs sharply, as in our case the link from macro to micro goes through an explicitly identified and endogenous response of agents’ preferences to their environment. We believe that, compared to models with field effects, our approach is more intuitive from an economic perspective. A key feature of our model will be the time-varying nature of risk aversion. This is not new in the literature. Brandt and Wang (2003) present a model in which the coefficient of risk aversion changes in response to news about consumption growth and inflation, and find empirical support for the hypothesis that aggregate risk aversion varies in response to news about inflation. Li (2007), instead, assumes a countercyclical risk aversion that drives a pro-cyclical risk premium in asset prices, but finds that such a feature may not help explain important facts such as the predictability of long-horizon stock returns or the univariate mean-reversion of stock prices. Park (2014) proposes a model of heterogeneous risk aversion, where fundamentalists have constant risk aversion while chartists’ risk aversion varies over time due to psychological factors: the time variation in risk attitudes increases price fluctuations and generates chaotic dynamics. Finally, Smith and Whitelaw (2009) find empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that risk aversion moves countercyclically. An important theoretical paper for our modelling choice of risk aversion is Netzer (2009), who proposes a model of the evolution and adaptation of hedonic utility and provides an evolutionary explanation for risk attitudes that adapt according to changes in the perceived distribution of possible alternatives. We will discuss this point at length in Section 2.1.1. In terms of evidence about short-horizon returns on financial markets, stylized facts are presented in a number of papers in the literature, such as Cont (2001) and Tseng and Li (2011). Both works show that the same stylized facts discussed in Section 1.2 below hold for a large number of financial time series, including Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, NASDAQ Composite Index and Hang Seng Index, series for individual stock prices such as IBM, Microsoft and BMW, and even series for exchange rates. As we mentioned before, the main stylized facts identified for short-horizon returns on financial markets are: i) the distribution of returns is not Gaussian, and presents instead fat tails; ii) there is no correlation in returns; iii) there is positive correlation (with slow decay) in absolute returns; iv) returns show volatility clustering, i.e., large fluctuations tend to cluster together. Such stylized facts hold for returns computed from many asset price series (see, e.g., Tseng and Li, 2011). As an example, we report here statistics for the S&P500 index, for the period 02/01/1957 until 12/04/2012,Footnote 2
 Returns are computed as 
  where p

t
 is the price of the asset or index at time t. It is also common practice to normalize returns as follows 
  where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of returns. Absolute returns are then defined as 
 For the S&P500 index, μ

r
 = 0.000294 and σ

r
 = 0.0100 and returns and normalized returns are plotted in Fig. 1. It is clearly evident the volatility clustering of returns, with large movements that tend to cluster together at particular times.
 Returns and normalized returns for the S&P500 index We compute then the empirical probability density function (pdf) for normalized returns and overlay it with the analytical normal pdf for comparison (Fig. 2): it is evident that the distribution of returns deviates from normality. Non-normality is also confirmed by the 4th moment of the distribution, kurtosis, which in the data is 24.378, while the value for a Gaussian distribution is 3, and by the Jarque-Bera test, which rejects at 5 % significance level the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance. Note that the estimated tail index for returns, which represents the order of the highest finite absolute moment, is 3.1083 , so the estimate for the fourth moment of the distribution is not reliable, which is consistent with previous evidence on asset returns (Cont 2001). The tail index conveys information about the tail of a distribution: the lower the index, the fatter the tails.Footnote 3
 Empirical pds of normalized returns and normal fit As for the correlation of returns and absolute returns over time, the serial correlation of returns is usually analyzed by computing the autocorrelation function (ACF). For the S&P500, the ACF for returns drops to zero after one period, while it stays positive for absolute returns at long lags, being still above .1 at 100 lags (See Fig. 3).Footnote 4 This is a typical finding in financial markets: returns have short-memory and present exponentially decaying autocorrelations, while absolute (or squared) returns display long-memory and are characterized by hyperbolic exponential decline in autocorrelation.
 ACFs for returns and absolute returns for the S&P500 index We have presented in this section a brief exposition of the main stylized facts concerning statistical regularities in financial returns. We now develop a simple model that will be able to replicate closely all such facts.",5

Footnote 1 van den Bergh and Gowdy (2003) outline the promises and problems of developing the micro-foundations of macroeconomics, from an evolutionary perspective. They address a range of approaches, from multi-agent models including complexity and hierarchy to group selection as well as the need to recognize heterogeneity of firms in analyzing macro processes. More specifically in this line of reasoning, Dosi et al. (2008:601) stress that four basic notions are: 1) innovation is a key driver of economic growth; 2) the heterogeneity of firms; 3) markets are selection devices that affect decentralized decisions like entry and exit; and 4) the above three Schumpeterian micro-foundations are complementary with a Kuznetsian perspective on industrial dynamics. Within management literature inspired by evolutionary economics and organizational learning, a key concept has been ‘firm search’, often related to the creation of economic opportunities (Laursen 2012). This paper focuses upon how to help explain how and why firms differential abilities to ‘navigate’ through three dimensions of innovation spaces influence their ability to recognize opportunities, and therefore, in longer run, be able to compete and generate aggregate economic growth. This paper is an initial step in developing this understanding. This paper therefore uses elements of existing theoretical and empirical understanding in a new combination, in order to propose a new synthetic conceptualisation of the innovation process in firms as the navigation of a complex space involving different types of opportunities. Empirically, these topics are increasingly important to both firms and economies, due to the globalization of all types of business activities – from research and development through production, service and customers. Archibugi and Iammarino (2002:99) define globalization as ‘a high (and increasing) degree of interdependency and interrelatedness among different and geographically dispersed actors.” Similarly, the authors provide empirical evidence of globalization, and why this shift matters for invention and innovation. Taking this proposition of globalization seriously also means that firms increasingly have to search and develop opportunities globally. Globalization thus also requires a more complex theoretical understanding of how such interdependencies and interrelatedness affect firms, and the observation that firms struggle with search and opportunities on a global scale prompted this line of research to better conceptualize the processes. A key concept used in this paper is opportunities. Opportunities are most often discussed in recent years within entrepreneurship literature, although also inherent in Schumpeter’s (1934, 1942) conceptualization of the dynamics of the economy. Within entrepreneurship literature, there has been a debate about whether opportunities are created or discovered (Alvarez and Barney 2007; Alvarez et al. 2013). In the creation theory within entrepreneurship literature, the nature of opportunities means that the actions of the entrepreneurs create opportunities, as compared to the situation where opportunities exist and are simply uncovered. Ex ante, the persons who become entrepreneurs may not be significant different from those who do not become entrepreneurs – but the process of having been and becoming entrepreneurs probably does change them, ex post. Given that firms develop innovations in relation to the creation of opportunities, their knowledge about the future is limited yet as they act, they also create new knowledge (Holmèn and McKelvey 2013). Accordingly, some work has stressed that the firms’ innovative search occurs in an environment of co-evolution with market, technologies and institutions, as widely acknowledge in the innovation system literature (Nelson 1993; Lundvall et al. 2002) and related literature (McKelvey 1996, 2004; McKelvey and Holmèn 2006). This paper therefore starts from the viewpoint that opportunities are created over time, which is also in line with an evolutionary epistemology (Buenstorf 2007; McKelvey et al. 201). In order to conceptualize whether, how and why firms do, or do not, move through complex space, it is necessary to start from two insights from evolutionary economics: a) that firms search for opportunities under conditions of selection and b) that the ability to identify and exploit that knowledge is related to firm internal capabilities (see review in Salter and McKelvey 2016). The implication is that firm search is necessary because this ability to innovate – and to create opportunities – is not randomly spread over the population of firms in an industry, but is concentrated in firms with certain capabilities and routines. Moreover, in the existing literature addressing evolutionary economics, there are different approaches, methodologies and theories, which this paper makes no claim to address all of them. This paper only focuses on three core questions of an evolutionary approach to the development of knowledge and innovations in the economy– namely from where do different types of opportunities emerge? Why do we assume that firm search is necessary for innovation? And how does the innovation system help define the industrial, regional and national context, within which firms search? The answers to these questions are used to develop a conceptualization, which includes the microfoundations of firm search with the macro processes involving technology, markets and institutions.",13

The aim of this exercise is to clarify the consequences of a resource constraint for the evolutionary adjustments triggered by the arrival of new methods of production. In the evolutionary approach to technical change adaptation is recognized as a selection process, where differences in the efficiency of used methods, certain routines of firms and the economic as well as the institutional environment determine the rise of superior methods and the decline of inferior ones. This ‘restructuring’ is seen as a vital source of growth and technical change and typically exhibits a logistic pattern (Metcalfe 1998, 2008). In simple variation-cum-selection models which prefer a macroeconomic interpretation, such as Nelson and Winter (1982, chap. 10) and Silverberg (1984), labour supply conditions play an important role for the selection process and its effects. For example, Englmann (1992) shows that the response of the real wage rate to selection dynamics shapes the overall employment effect of the diffusion of a new method. Although different wage adjustment mechanisms are explored, the common assumption made in simple variation-cum-selection models is that there always is enough labour to fully employ the capital stock. In this context, Metcalfe and Steedman (2013) argue that this implicit assumption of surplus labour is not as innocuous as it may seem. They draw attention to the fact that the nature of adaptation depends on whether surplus labour exists or not: If the supply of labour is unlimited, adaptation is driven by the differential abilities to invest by means of retained profits. But if the supply of labour is fixed and in short supply, a different mechanism called ‘growth predation’ here effectuates adaptation. It relies on the idea that firms using the superior method can attract workers employed elsewhere through offering wages that are higher than what firms employing inferior methods can pay. Through this the superior method displaces the inferior one not only in relative but also in absolute terms through depriving the inferior one of the basis of its very existence. A further important difference between the two cases is that in the surplus labour case the amount and distribution of capital limits total output, whereas in the labour shortage case the amount and distribution of labour limits total output. This has important implications for the growth effect of competitive selection, which depends both on the bias of the innovation and the state of labour supply; see Haas (2015) for a typology of new methods and their growth effect for the case of surplus labour. The paper develops the idea of ‘growth predation’ in a simple model in order to put into sharp relief the effects of a resource constraint that potentially limits output at the population level. A causal analysis helps to shed light on the crucial forces and features of what may be called an ‘evolutionary traverse’, i.e. the path from one full-employment steady state to another when the original steady state is disturbed by an innovation. With minor differences, this approach resembles Schumpeter’s (1934) analytical scheme for understanding economic development based on the concept of what he called the circular flow (Kurz 2008). In line with Metcalfe and Steedman (2013), adaptation is brought about by output share dynamics only; the problem of imitation is not discussed. In contrast to Metcalfe and Steedman (2013), we assume that capital is not circulating but perennial and non-malleable. This means that capital does not depreciate and cannot be transformed to serve other purposes. Thus in the case of a labour shortage some firms have to accept that part of their equipment lies idle. Note that under-utilisation of capital results from a lack of complementary means to employ it and not from a lack of effective demand; the latter problem is neglected in this paper. The main findings include: (i) The implementation of certain types of new methods causes unemployment which is relieved through the above-normal growth potential of ‘new’ firms; (ii) as long as unemployment prevails, adaptation through differential accumulation features a logistic replacement pattern, a typical feature of evolutionary models, whereas adaptation through ‘growth predation’ leads to an exponential replacement pattern; (iii) the aggregate growth rate depends both on the question of whether there is full employment or not and the bias of the innovation. Growth is unsteady and the diffusion of an innovation is not always expansionary. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a simple growth model with two rival firms. In Section 3 the relation between adaptation and growth for different types of innovations is explored by means of a causal analysis. Section 4 concludes. The Appendix shows that the traverse towards a fully automated system differs fundamentally from other cases.",1

And what is its relationship with economic policy ad“vice”?,January 2017,Heinz D. Kurz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Schumpeter variously criticized Ricardo for having developed utterly simplistic models to deal with complex economic problems and, furthermore, models that are typically underdetermined. Ricardo is also said to have used these models boldly and unwarrantedly to derive wide reaching policy conclusions. With respect to these two alleged shortcomings of Ricardo’s analysis, Schumpeter spoke of the “Ricardian Vice”. Finally, he maintained that Ricardo, as did Adam Smith before him, had a wrong conception of conflicts of interest between different social groups or classes. Ricardo and Smith saw conflicts of interest, where there are none, and missed others by lumping together capitalists and entrepreneurs. In this paper I deal with Schumpeter’s view of the role of economic theory as the foundation of economic policy. I first scrutinize Schumpeter’s criticism of the Ricardian Vice and his view of the “law of motion” of modern society. His perception of the complexity of the object of investigation makes him put forward numerous reflections and insights that are difficult to reconcile with a kind of economics that has ready-made answers to each and every problem that might possibly crop up. Schumpeter rejected what we may, for short, call “push button economics”: by pushing the right button of a model it will tell you the correct answer to whichever problem you pose. Things are not so simple, and economic models, which by their very nature are of necessity under-complex, can at best give a first, broad and preliminary orientation regarding the problem at hand. In a second step, historical, cultural, social and political specificities of the case under consideration have to be taken into account and second and third round effects of the suggested measures contemplated. This is the only way to avoid as best as possible economic policies that are ineffective or even lead to results that worsen the situation instead of improving it. This was clear to Schumpeter, but as will be seen, it was also clear to the two economists whom he criticized most: Ricardo and Keynes. Therefore, these authors typically refrain from giving definite answers to particular problems or from advocating the same kind of policy for dealing with issues that, on the surface, look similar. A one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate, and informed reasoning has to complement economic theory and models. The first part of this paper, consisting of Sections 1–5, scrutinizes Schumpeter’s criticisms of Ricardo. Section 2 briefly summarizes Schumpeter’s three objections above. Section 3 then shows that these are foreshadowed in the earlier literature, especially in the writings of William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras. Section 4 argues that the first two criticisms are difficult to sustain and reflect the fact that subsequent to what has (somewhat misleadingly) been called the “marginalist revolution”, Ricardo’s analysis was seen through the lens of the new theory. This resulted in a misapprehension of the genuine significance and analytical structure of Ricardo’s “classical” approach to economic theory. Section 5 then summarizes a few important elements of Schumpeter’s theory, which sets it apart from other economic doctrines and especially the economic mainstream. The second part, consisting of Sections 6–8, turns to the problem of economic policy. Section 6 deals with Schumpeter’s writings on policy issues and tries to extract from them a general method Schumpeter applied when approaching such issues. Section 7 deals briefly with a few fields of economic policy to which Schumpeter contributed, responding to the problems of his time. Section 8 summarizes his plan to pay off the public debt Austria had accumulated during World War I and compares it to Ricardo’s plan to deal with the British public debt in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. Section 9 contains some concluding remarks.",6

If we consider the pages dedicated to entrepreneurship and to democracy, we see that the intellectual toolbox he used in his previous works - based on the economic thought of the French and Austrian schools, and to some extent limited by the implicit contrasts between those two schools - has undergone a radical evolution. Schumpeter’s new ideas on the nature of democracy also entail new ideas on the nature of human behavior within institutions, and these ideas conflict to a certain extent with the corpus of traditional economic doctrines. It follows that there are only two alternatives: either to attempt to explore whether its depiction of market and democracy can be interpreted within a unified frame, or to consider the analysis of market and of democracy as separate conceptual domains. The latter is the traditional approach, while the former – I suggest - implies a reading of Schumpeter’s thought in the light of the recent advancements in the cognitive approach to human behavior: a mental experiment that I propose in the following pages. The chances of successfully applying this approach are facilitated by the fact that Schumpeter himself reflected on the meaning of rationality in many parts of his works. He started from the classical definitions provided by Max Weber and then moved significant steps ahead, urged by the necessity to encompass under the same notion of rationality the different kinds of contrasting behavior manifested by the subjects that populate his theory : entrepreneurs, consumers, citizens and political leaders are in fact depicted as carriers of different kinds and levels of rationality. In what follows, I will show that Schumpeter’s theory is, to some extent, a forerunner of the basic principles of bounded rationality. In this introduction, I will summarize Schumpeter’s main assumptions on rationality and their consequence to the architecture of his theory of democracy, by extracting Schumpeter’s’ ideas and interpreting them through the concepts of cognitive psychology. Schumpeter’s analysis presupposes limits on the rationality and knowledge of individuals both in economics and politics. These limits are clarified and explored under the label of “conscious rationality”: in his view individuals may have different degrees of conscious rationality, and so, to practice rationality in a given domain, it is necessary to hold specific competence and knowledge. When competence is very high, as is the case of entrepreneurial activity, rationality can be described as a process of creative response, i.e., of discovery under uncertain conditions, analogous to Simon’s procedural rationality. When competence is missing or is very modest, the emotional and routine elements of reasoning supplant logical thought and individuals are exposed to irrational external messages, forms of persuasion and advertising, both in the economic and political arena. (Schumpeter (2003), 363) Given that an economic or a political decision requires expertise, individuals may decide with full competence and rationality only in a limited number of domains. The element that reinforces competence is the familiarity with and proximity to a given decision context, and, for this reason, at least a part of economic decisions can be made in a more competent way than political ones. To paraphrase Schumpeter, when we move away from the private concerns of the family and the business office into those regions of national and international affairs that lack a direct link with the private concerns, individual volition ceases to fulfill the requirements of conscious rationality : the degree of conscious rationality dumbs down to a very modest level. (Schumpeter (2003), 259–261) Democracy is based primarily on delegation because of the limits of competence and knowledge of its citizens. Leaders are supposed to possess the specific competence in politics that is modest or missing among those they represent. They collect the will and reflect the opinions of their constituency, but to a limited extent; in fact, as with the entrepreneur, the political leader may be an innovator, able to bring forth new ideas and proposals that may conflict with the common feeling or the average opinion of his constituency. Such an ability requires vision and the ability to persuade. This means that leaders “may fashion and, within very wide limits, even create the will of the people. “(Schumpeter (2003), 263) Of course, a leader may use his persuasive power in two ways: in a positive sense, if he tries to convince his constituency by virtue of an attempt clearly and transparently to expound his proposals; or in a negative sense, if he conveys information, ideas or ideologies to the citizens in a systematically distorted way. In the latter case, the leader does not appeal to rationality but rather uses communicative and persuasive techniques typical of advertising, based on psychological associations and related emotions. (Schumpeter (2003), 263) The previous points imply that, in a democracy, leaders can manipulate opinions and produce systematic distortions of the popular will: this is a crucial aspect of Schumpeter’s analysis. It follows that if we do not want to relegate it to a pure description due to his acute insight, it is necessary to appeal to the modern theory of psychology of cognition, in which the characteristics of reasoning and, in particular, the role of persuasion and manipulation, has been extensively studied and experimentally proved. To this end, the next section is dedicated to the connections between Schumpeter’s notion of conscious rationality and the modern theory of bounded rationality. Schumpeter depicts democracy as an institution that allows people to achieve political decisions without necessarily having a high degree of awareness and competence. The main problem that Schumpeter has to solve in sketching the fundamentals of democracy is conceiving institutions that produce rational, or at least reasonable, public decisions despite substantial limits in terms of individuals’ rationality and competence. He highlights the observation that a defining property of democracy is its being an institution that may function even if the degree of awareness, competence and analytical effort of citizens is low, provided that it is balanced by responsible behavior on the part of its leaders. Naturally, this view attributes fragility to democratic institutions, insofar as they are exposed to serious risks: risks that emerge if the design of the internal workings of democratic institutions does not allow the process of collective decision-making to work properly with a transparent allocation of responsibilities. In this case, ambitious leaders may implement various forms of shirking that can lead to a dangerous undermining of the quality of democracy. This is the reason why competition is an essential element of democracy: it is the only method that permits the emergence of a definite will among citizens, by raising the level of conscious rationality through a pacific political struggle. The only method that reduces the citizens’ chances of being fooled by irresponsible leaders and assures a good quality of democracy is a process of reducing the citizens’ competence gap, which, according to Schumpeter, can only occur in the long run.",4

If consumer needs are indeed insatiable, there is little reason to doubt that any extra income generated by economic growth will continuously be converted into increases in demand ad infinitum (Stiglitz 2008). This is the position adopted by much of the growth literature that typically does not consider the possibility of non-homothetic preferences. In contrast, Keynes started to outline a more nuanced approach in this essay. In line with other scholars preceding him (e.g. Menger 1871) – Keynes considered the nature of the underlying needs that motivate consumption and how rising affluence may impact their satisfaction. He conjectured that there are two types of needs: absolute and relative needs. Absolute needs are satiable and Keynes argued that within a hundred years, these needs would be sufficiently satisfied to the extent that further energies could be devoted to non-economic purposes (Keynes 1933; Pecchi and Piga 2008). However, relative needs are insatiable because their satisfaction is linked to a desire for superiority over others. Thus, the character of the needs that are the ultimate ends of economics activity must be taken into account in order to take proper stock of the extent to which long run economic growth translates into rising human welfare. Moreover, the possibility that the economy has shifted from satisfying absolute needs towards satisfying relative needs also raises deeper questions concerning the extent to which further increases in per capita consumption levels are desirable (Easterlin 2001; Frank 2001; Van den Bergh 2011) and what behavioural processes and social institutions are responsible for shaping the evolving character of demand (Scitovsky 1976; Pasinetti 1981; Bowles 1998; Witt 2001; Bisin and Verdier 2001; Earl and Potts 2004). The purpose of this special issue is to reconsider the coevolving relationship between income and the character of household consumption patterns and its implications of the economy, as well as society at large. Will per capita consumption expenditures always continue to grow in the same manner as it has in the previous two centuries? There is little doubt that current, resource-intensive consumption patterns in the developed world are setting important trends for an emerging class of affluent consumers in developing countries. Given that by 2030 around 3.1 billion people are projected to enter the middle class around the word (OECD 2010), questions arise about how sustainable these shifts in global consumption patterns are. At the same time, consumption patterns in the West are also being fundamentally reshaped as consumers, thanks to rising real incomes and technological progress, have well and truly moved beyond satisfying their basic needs. Here, the nature of the economic problem is increasingly focused on more non-material and abstract aspects of life such as social interactions, the allocation of time and other cognitive concerns, as well as the avoidance of boredom (Bianchi 2002). The time is rife to consider the implications of these global trends as a renaissance is currently underway in the contemporary study of demand and consumer behaviour. In microeconomics, the role of the social environment has become a prominent issue (e.g., Frank 1997; Hopkins and Kornienko 2004; Arrow and Dasgupta 2009). There is also a shift towards considering how biological evolution shapes consumption patterns (Witt 2001; Robson and Kaplan 2003; Rayo and Becker 2007; Frank 2012). In macroeconomics, there is a growing awareness of the role that income inequality plays in shaping consumer demand (Bertola et al. 2014). These new research perspectives have created the impetus to reconsider longstanding questions in micro- and macroeconomics that are still largely unanswered. For example, do consumers have an insatiable appetite for novel goods and services, and if so, to what extent is the insatiable nature of consumer demand co-determined by the influence of social institutions? Apart from Engel’s law, what other empirical regularities exist in the manner in which consumption patterns change under the influence of a growing per capita income? How do these changes transform the structure of growing economies? If consumption growth is to some extent endogenously influenced by economic and social processes, what possibilities are there for inducing consumers to adopt sustainable consumption patterns?",3

Since about two centuries, per capita income and consumption grow exponentially despite the rapidly rising human population (Maddison 2001). In the most advanced economies, already lower-income classes can now enjoy a standard of living that two centuries ago would have resembled a state of affluence. The flip side of the massive growth of consumption is an increasing toll on the natural environment. Both at a local and global scale, climate change, resource depletion, soil and water degradation, species extinction, and many other forms of environmental decay threaten the living conditions of future generations (see, e.g., UNEP 2014). Nonetheless, motivated by the quest for better life, calls for further economic growth still dominate in the political and public debate even in the most prosperous economies. But, leaving aside the social costs for the moment, is it at all likely that the equation “more consumption = better life” which was valid for the past two centuries continues to hold? Do ever higher expenditures indeed assure steady improvements in preference satisfaction irrespective of the level of consumption already reached? As is well known, canonical text book economics approaches these questions as follows (see, e.g., Mas-Colell et al. 1995). Consumer preferences are assumed to be invariably given, i.e. the possibility of forming new preferences on innovations in goods and services is ignored. What the consumers’ preferences are is not specified. They are only claimed to satisfy some formal properties which imply utility functions that increase monotonously with rising consumption expenditures. It then follows that consumers always attain a higher utility index, i.e. realize a welfare gain, by spending more. The equation “more consumption = better life” is guaranteed to hold. But can such a claim indeed be made without knowing how consumers satisfy what preferences? Moreover, can their preferences be taken as a invariable measuring rod for welfare that is independent of what it is supposed to assess, namely the growing consumption possibilities (see Binder 2010 for a critical reappraisal)? Doubts regarding the empirical relevance of such a portrayal of economic behavior were raised early on (e.g., Veblen 1909, Sen 1977, Elster 1982). Evidence clearly points to preferences that are neither always consistent nor invariably given. If it is admitted that preferences do change, an inter-temporally consistent measuring rod for welfare may still be logically possible. The necessary proviso is, however, that individual preferences only change in a particular, unidirectional way (von Weizsäcker 2005, Bernheim and Rangel 2009). The relevance of this assumption cannot be assessed, of course, without a richer understanding of the causes and mechanisms underlying the changes of consumer preferences. In order to advance this understanding a behavioral theory of preferences is needed. The key to such a theory, it will be argued in this paper, lies in the relationships between preferences over actions on the one side and the motivational forces driving actions on the other. From a preference subjectivism point of view, asking what motivates consumers to choose specific actions may appear futile, if it can be assumed that the reasons of choice reside in the individuals’ inextricable subjective sphere. Admittedly, subjective idiosyncrasies are likely to result in some irreducible inter-personal variation in consumer behavior. This does not mean, though, that there are no commonly shared motivational forces which exert a systematic influence on the mean behavior in the population. As explained elsewhere (Witt 2001), among others innate needs and drives signify as human universals and provide a basis for a generic analysis of the reasons of choice and, hence, of the individuals’ revealed preferences. Theories assisting an analysis of human motivation in general and the motivation to consume in particular are interdisciplinary by their nature and refer to the evolutionary bases of human behavior (see Brown and Richerson 2014). To better understand the motivational forces and to develop a richer theory of preferences the present paper draws on hypotheses from several disciplines. Among them are the biology of drives and needs and of behavioral adaptations (Leslie 1996, Staddon 2014a, b), sociobiology (Wilson 1978), evolutionary psychology (Saad 2007), cognitive psychology (Bargh et al. 2010), empirical happiness research (Kahneman et al. 1999), and also the revival of sensory hedonism in economics (Kahneman et al. 1997). On this basis it can be discussed in detail why and how consumption changes systematically with a growing income and what the consequences are for human welfare. The paper proceeds in three steps. Section 2 presents a brief review of relevant biological, behavioral, and psychological hypotheses. They relate to innate (heritable), learned (conditioned), and cognitive motivational forces. It is discussed how these forces change and whether such changes imply a shift in preferences. Section 3 derives some implications of these hypotheses for explaining the evolution of consumption. It is shown that a crucial role is played on the one hand by multi-level learning processes which affect existing motivations to consume, generate new ones, and thus induce preference changes. On the other hand, the development is characterized by differences in the satiation dynamics across different motivations. Both kinds of motivational changes become manifest and transform consumer behavior as increases in per-capita income raise the ability to spend and to learn new behaviors. Section 4 turns to the welfare-theoretic aspects of the evolution of consumption, i.e. to the question of whether and when the equation “more consumption = better life” holds true. As will turn out, the answer raises doubts about how calling for yet more consumption growth can be justified even in the most prosperous economies. Section 5 presents the conclusions.",24

The ’systemic’ aspects of technology shifts have been stressed in a variety of empirical and theoretical accounts (Dahmén 1950; Rosenberg 1969; Gille 1978; Hughes 1987; Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991; Nelson 1994; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995; Helpman 1998; Freeman and Louça 2001; Perez 2002; Lipsey et al. 2005; Markard and Hoffmann 2016) and these perspectives permeate policy-oriented research based on the notions of national, regional and sectoral innovation systems (Lundvall 1992; Breschi and Malerba 1996; Malerba 2002; Cooke et al. 2004). The received literature proposes that technological change takes place by way of strong mutual interdependencies between certain industries, sometimes geographically localized, and that innovation activity is profoundly shaped by these interdependencies. Given these insights, the relevant empirical questions are: what industries and technologies are actually characterized by such interdependencies and how do such interdependencies evolve over time? The concept of development blocks gives an avenue for such a research agenda, emphasizing the dynamic interdependence of the components of large or small systems of technologies, from actor-networks to general-purpose technologies. In this view, strong incentives to develop new technologies are provided by the complementarities and imbalances that arise as development blocks evolve (Dahmén [1942], 1950, 1991; Carlsson and Stankiewicz1991; Schön 1991, 2010). Delimiting the boundaries of development blocks and studying the complementarities and imbalances systematically is however typically a difficult affair. The present study addresses this problem, arguing that development blocks can be approached empirically by studying two facets of innovation activity: i) the flows of innovations across industries, ii) the problems and opportunities that spur innovation. This has been made possible by the construction of new literature-based database, SWINNO, containing over 4,000 Swedish innovation objects (Sjöö et al. 2014; Sjöö 2014; Taalbi 2014). Using this data, the aim of the present study is to describe interdependencies in the network of Swedish product innovations, 1970–2007. This description aims both to describe subsystems of innovations and to analyze the impulses to innovation that stem from imbalances and complementarities within development blocks. This is achieved by combining recently developed statistical techniques for community detection with analysis of biographic information on the problems and opportunities that have spurred innovations. Three aspects of the network of innovations are studied: 
 
Are there subsystems in the network of innovations? The community structure of the network of innovations is explored to delineate closely interdependent industries. 
What roles do industries have in innovation networks? The structure of the network of innovations is explored statistically to describe the roles of industries as suppliers and users of innovation. 
How have opportunities and imbalances provided incentives to innovations? The qualitative character of innovation as response to problems and opportunities is explored through the lens of innovation biographies. By answering these questions, the structure and character of technological interdependencies between industries can be described, arguably approaching Dahménian development blocks. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses how industrial interdependencies are posited to affect innovation activity according to previous literature and discusses major differences between the notion of development blocks and related notions such as general-purpose technologies and technological systems. Section 3 introduces the literature-based innovation output database and the construction of the network of Swedish innovations. Section 4 explains the network and community detection analysis and presents the results from statistical analysis of the network of innovations and then discusses the qualitative character of problems and opportunities that have spurred innovations. Section 5 concludes.",10

The controversy between advocates of the “demand-pull” and those of the “technology-push” theories has been resolved by pointing out the importance of both the information flows of scientific and technical knowledge and information from users of products and processes for innovative activities (Freeman 1994). Consequently, this paper studies the contribution of demand-side variables (market size) and supply-side variables (technological opportunities) to innovative activities using data from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. On the one hand, the importance of demand for innovation in this sector has been pointed out by many scholars (e.g., Cerda 2007; Acemoglu and Linn 2004). On the other hand, there is much evidence that innovative activities in this sector rely on scientific advances, particularly in the field of biotechnology (e.g., Rasmussen 2010; McKelvey 1996; Gambardella 1995). Hence, the pharmaceutical industry provides an almost ideal case to analyze the importance of demand- and supply-side variables for innovative output. While researchers studying the determinants of innovation can apply a broad range of usually quite well defined demand-side variables, some important supply-side variables lack a clear definition or operationalization. In particular, the concept of technological opportunities has been found to be a key variable for explaining innovative activities across different industries, but there is no clear consensus concerning its empirical approximation (e.g., Klevorick et al. 1995). Early studies of the importance of technological opportunities relied mostly on industry dummies or survey-based indicators of the importance of different knowledge sources. In contrast to these contributions, I will use a quantitative proxy for technological opportunities, following an idea proposed by Andersen (1998, 1999), and operationalize technological opportunities by the growth rate of the knowledge stock in a given field of research. The empirical analysis is performed on a unique dataset that encompasses data from different sources. Data concerning new pharmaceuticals come from the Drugs@FDA database. Cinical trials data are obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. Market size is constructed using the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).Footnote 1 Publication data from the Web of Science databases is used to construct proxies for technological opportunities. The data are analyzed using an “entry stock” Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE), as suggested by Blundell et al. (1995), since it accounts for dynamic feedback and unobserved heterogeneity. Moreover, the Poisson QMLE is consistent under the assumption of a correctly specified mean and does not require Poisson-distributed data. The results indicate a significantly positive response of the number of new pharmaceuticals to market size. The positive response holds true for new molecular entities as well as for new drug approvals and is fairly robust against different specifications of the market size proxy. Technological opportunities have a significantly positive relation with the number of new pharmaceuticals. However, the analysis does not reveal a robust significant relation between technological opportunities in biotechnology and basic research and the number of new pharmaceuticals. This result may be driven by the construction of the database and the knowledge stocks, which may better account for applied research. I take time lags of seven years into account, which corresponds to the average time needed from the first clinical testing of a promising compound to the approval of a new drug. The results suggest no clear-cut relationship between lagged market size, lagged technological opportunities, and the number of pharmaceutical innovations. By instrumenting market size by market size five years previously, I find no evidence for reverse causality. The number of phase II and phase III clinical trials, a proxy for new compounds under development, respond positively to (potential) market size and to technological opportunities at the beginning of the clinical research process. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the relationship between demand and pharmaceutical innovation is often analyzed on a rather aggregated level, e.g., drug categories or disease groups. Instead, I use a more disaggregated level of analysis, namely medical indications. Second, by operationalizing technological opportunities as growth rates of knowledge stocks, I add a quantifiable proxy for this variable to the analysis. Third, the publication data used to construct the knowledge stocks are more closely related to the definition of technological opportunities than are patents or other types of data previously used in the literature. Particularly in a science-based industry such as pharmaceuticals, publications may reflect the possibilities for innovative activities more directly than, e.g., patents, which can be seen as a realization of specific possibilities for innovation. This interpretation is supported by a high number of citations from patents to bio-pharmaceutical publications (cf., Narin and Olivastro 1992) indicating that knowledge in scientific publications in this field of research may, on average, be more basic, occur prior to patented knowledge, and may contain knowledge that cannot be patented. Additionally, the number of approved drugs and the number of clinical trials provide a more appropriate measure for the industry’s innovative activities as compared to patent counts. Due to the specificities of the industry’s R&D process, almost all promising compounds are patented before their therapeutic potential is fully examined, but only few new compounds are approved for marketing, as the vast majority usually do not meet expectations in terms of safety and efficacy. Hence, the number of patents might considerably overestimate the number of successfully developed products. As a potential proxy for scientific and technological development, patents face the problem that classification schemes are usually oriented towards the chemical structure of compounds and not towards disease specific applications. Moreover, the specific therapeutic use may not be fully determined when the patent application is filed. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature on the demand- and supply-side determinants of innovative activities. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and Section 4 explains the construction of the variables and the different data sources used. The empirical results can be found in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",5

We show that this GA-model, taken almost directly from Anufriev et al. (2015), is able to replicate well the main findings of an experimental study by Assenza et al. (2013). The GA learning model therefore explains individual (micro) as well as aggregate (macro) behavior of different laboratory economies. In dynamic macroeconomic models, such as the standard New Keynesian model, expectation feedback plays an important role in the shape and stability of economic equilibria. Traditional literature (Muth 1961) would disregard the potential heterogeneity of forecasting behavior and focus instead on the model consistent Rational Expectations. However, limitations on individual rationality are likely to prevail (e.g. Cornea et al. 2017), especially when the individuals need time to learn the structure of the economy (Sargent 1993). Once we allow for bounded rationality, a non-linear price expectations feedback can lead to complicated and potentially volatile dynamics and multiple equilibria (Anufriev et al. 2013a). On the other hand, there are many different forecasting rules that individuals can use to form their expectations about future prices. It is, therefore, important to study how such rules are selected in a realistic learning environment, and how learning in the context of macroeconomics relates to forecasting in other economic settings, including financial or commodity markets. In order to study the individual forecasting behavior in a controlled laboratory environment, Learning-to-Forecast (LtF) experiments have been introduced (Marimon et al. 1993). The role of human subjects is to forecast prices, which are then translated into realized prices through some market mechanism, such as a simple supply-driven cobweb economy in which the subjects are framed as advisers to the commodity producers. The LtF experiments typically have a straightforward and unique fundamental equilibrium, and hence can be directly used to assess individual learning dynamics. In practice, they show that individuals indeed have heterogeneous expectations (Heemeijer et al. 2009; Hommes 2011; Anufriev and Hommes 2012), which greatly depend on the specific structure of the feedback market. Moreover, subjects can coordinate away from the fundamental equilibrium, or even on oscillatory time paths (Hommes et al. 2005; Assenza et al. 2013). In order to understand this heterogeneous behavior, the LtF experimental data can be used to construct and assess learning models. A notable example is work by Anufriev and Hommes (2012), who adapted the Brock-Hommes model (Brock and Hommes 1997) into a Heuristic Switching Model (HSM) with four simple rules, and apply it to explain the experiment of Hommes et al. (2005). Assenza et al. (2013) use the same model to explain their experimental findings in a New Keynesian setting, while Anufriev et al. (2013b) fit a 2-type HSM to explain the difference between aggregate behavior in positive versus negative feedback systems. In general, HSM remains a versatile model that can approximate the individual learning of forecasting behavior across different experiments. A generalized, agent-based counterpart of HSM is the model of individual learning based on genetic algorithms (GA; Haupt and Haupt, 2004). GA is an optimization method based on a population of arguments that compete on their function value and can therefore be applied to a wide class of problems: they rely on an intelligent search of a large but finite solution space using statistical methods and can deal with discrete variables and noncontinuous cost functions (Haupt and Haupt 2004). Arifovic (1991) has developed an augmented GA model, which was consequently applied in different economic settings such as a cobweb model (Arifovic 1994; Hommes and Lux 2013) and an overlapping generations model (Arifovic 1995). Following a more developed version of the model by Hommes and Lux (2013), Anufriev et al. (2015) have shown that a model in which individuals independently optimize their prediction rules using GA is able to replicate experimental findings from three different LtF experiments, based on commodity or financial markets. A great advantage of this approach is that this model is a generalized version of the HSM without pre-specification of forecasting rules, and hence can be used to motivate the parametrization of simple HSM’s (Anufriev et al. 2015). This paper follows up on Assenza et al. (2013) by using a GA model to replicate the results from their LtF experiment based on a New Keynesian macro model. We use the same GA model as Anufriev et al. (2015), i.e. we update heuristics with an adaptive, an anchor an a trend extrapolation coefficient. In this way, we contribute to understanding LtF experiments in a New Keynesian environment using GA. Unlike Arifovic et al. (2012) who have investigated GA in a New Keynesian environment as well, we explain the heterogeneous behavior with heuristics that depend only on the realizations and previous predictions by the agent, similar to the heuristics used by Heemeijer et al. (2009), Anufriev and Hommes (2012) and Assenza et al. (2013). Moreover, we use experimental settings with different types of complexity and show that LtF experiments with increasing complexities can be explained using the same GA model. This shows that the GA model is versatile and can replicate varied experimental economies, but also remains robust against the object of the forecasting task. Our paper thus shows that the original GA model by Anufriev et al. (2015) explains the individual learning to forecast not only in a univariate model of prices in a specific market, but also a more complex macrosystem with two variables with expectations feedback and two different groups of forecasters for inflation and output gap. We replicate results for six different experimental treatments: three different treatments with increasing complexity (1, 2 and 3), each subdivided into two treatments (a and b) with more or less aggressive monetary policy. The results from the treatments 1, 2 and 3 in the experiment can be classified in three types of aggregate behavior, respectively: converging, oscillatory and dampened oscillatory behavior. The main goal of this paper is to show that all three types of behavior can be reproduced using 50-period ahead simulations of one GA model. We use Monte Carlo simulations as in Anufriev et al. (2015) to investigate how well the model explains the experimental data. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our model. We give a description of the New Keynesian framework, the experimental treatments and results, and elaborate on the GA model that we use to replicate the experiments. The results are described in Section 3, where we graphically show the replications of the experiment and compare the experiment to our replications using descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we present our conclusions and recommendations.",7

The fate after 15 years of a quarter of a million UK firms born in 1998,January 2018,Michael Anyadike-Danes,Mark Hart,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The theory of firm growth is in a rather unsatisfactory state. Indeed a reading of some recent contributions to the literature suggests that there may be something of an impasse. To summarise, albeit somewhat crudely, one view is that firm growth (certainly in a firm’s early years) can be regarded as essentially ‘random’; the alternative view is that a firm’s characteristics and its choices can have a systematic effect on its growth. Whilst these competing views provide a context for this paper, our starting point is different. We propose to make use of a relatively newly available large firm-level dataset to begin building an evidence base which, by providing a detailed picture of growth across the UK firm population, might be used to underpin the development of more satisfactory approach to the theory of firm growth. One of the most striking findings from following a birth cohort of firms, as we do here, is the extraordinary force of mortality: by age 15, 90% of a cohort of UK firms born in 1998 are dead; and, of those that do survive to age 15, the hazard of death is still about 10% a year. It is against this background that we investigate the growth paths – what we call the ‘growth trajectories’ – over 15 years of the 26 thousand survivors of the 239 thousand firms born into the cohort. We find that very few of the 26 thousand 15 year survivors grow very much, but of those that do, smaller firms grow faster than larger. Moreover for most of the surviving firms that do grow, fast growth is concentrated in the first five years. The key data analytical device which we use to track survival and growth, is a classification of firms into size-bands. We then follow firms progress (or demise) using a series of ‘Origin/Destination’ tables.Footnote 1 For each pair of years we cross-classify firms into their size-bands in year t – these are their origins – the rows of the table, against their size-bands in year (t − 1) – these are their destinations (one of which is ‘death’) – the columns of the table, and these annual tables allow us to chart the rhythm of the growth process. Complementing these annual tables, a cross-classification of size-band at birth against size-band at age 15 provides an effective tool for organizing the data on the growth trajectories of the 26 thousand survivors. Then, by plotting the ‘slope’ of the growth trajectories, we are able to reveal the evolution through time of a set of size-differentiated growth paths which exhibit a period of relative turbulence in the early years up to age five, followed by a decade long period of relatively stable growth (or in some cases decline). The next section reviews the literature on firm growth, followed by a section describing data sources and construction. There are then five sections which make up the main body of the paper, and these, 
 introduce the cohort of firms born in 1998 (cohort98) and summarise its performance over its first decade and a half of life report survival functions, for the cohort as a whole, and by size-band use an origin/destination matrix to investigate the connection between firm size at birth and at age 15 and growth over the period use a set of annual mobility tables to summarize the pace and direction of the change in jobs describe trajectories by size-band, and the ’slope’ of those trajectories and what the ’slope’ plots reveal about growth over the first 15 years of surviving firms’ lives A final section sums up.",19

Occupation-industry transitions and self-employment success,April 2018,Sierdjan Koster,Martin Andersson,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Self-employment success importantly hinges on the human capital available to the business owner. Part of the human capital is built up in the course of a labor market career. People develop skills, build up relevant professional networks and acquire problem solving capabilities. They can capitalize on the combined stock of experiences available to them by starting their own firms. The specificity and quality of these experiences are important determinants of self-employment success (Phillips 2002). In addition, the range of the skills is important. Successful business owners tend to rely on a wide variety of skills, which allows them to oversee all aspects of the business. This view is established in the so-called ‘jack-of-all-trades’ theory as developed by Lazear (2004) and empirically tested by Bublitz and Noseleit (2014), among others. Unger et al. (2011) argue that human capital is most valuable in relevant contexts, i.e. when it is task-specific. Two persons with identical skill sets may experience very different outcomes, depending on the context in which the human capital is deployed. The correspondence between the context of on-the-job learning and the context of deployment is thus an important aspect in explaining and understanding heterogeneity between entrepreneurs in their success in entrepreneurship and self-employment. In explaining self-employment success, the correspondence between the learning context as an employee and the context of deployment in entrepreneurship has mostly focused on the industry dimension. This follows a large literature on spinoffs and organizational heredity, which shows that new firms that start in the same industry as the parent organization tend to perform better than other types of start-ups in terms of both growth and survival. There is empirical evidence in this regard from studies with firms as the unit of analysis (Klepper 2001), as well as from studies with individuals as the unit of analysis (Hamilton 2000). Hence, self-employed with same-industry experience are likely to outperform those who lack such specific experience. Learning, however, is multi-faceted and part of on-the-job learning may be occupation-specific rather than industry-specific (Kambourov and Manovskii 2009). As a result, focusing on same-industry experience alone clouds considerable underlying heterogeneity in on-the-job learning. This study expands the existing literature by not only assessing the role of same-industry experience in self-employment success, but also regarding the effect of the correspondence between the occupational background and the industry in which the self-employed is active. The intuition of the idea is illustrated by the fact that many firms have a strong division of labor and consequent specialization of tasks. Large manufacturing firms such as Ericsson, ABB, Philips, and Unilever typically have a broad set of employees with specialized skills in occupations that, in themselves, would not classify as manufacturing as such. Examples include software development, accounting and human resources. The experiences built up in these types of occupations likely better prepare for self-employment in, respectively, the IT-sector, financial services and business services than for self-employment in manufacturing. This shows that the relation between tasks performed and industry may be rather detached. Addressing this issue, Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) remark that industry classifications were never meant to reflect differences in learning. To account better for on-the-job learning, the occupation is relevant (Gathmann and Schönberg 2010). We apply this idea to self-employment. The occupational background of individuals who switch to self-employment is important in two distinct ways. First, certain occupational groups have a higher propensity of moving into entrepreneurship (Lazear 2004; Bublitz and Noseleit 2014). Managers, for example, possess general and easily transferable skills that prepare them well for entrepreneurship.Footnote 1 Transition rates into entrepreneurship are thus expected to vary across occupational groups. Second, over and beyond the selection effect into entrepreneurship, we postulate that a relevant occupation-industry combination may be positively related with entrepreneurial success. To account for this, we identify the most common start-up industry given a certain occupational background. In doing so, we assume that those occupation-industry combinations reveal the closest match between a certain occupational background and the skills relevant to an industry. The firms started by entrepreneurs that make this most common transition are labeled ‘occupational spin-offs’, similar to the generic term spin-offs that denotes firms started by entrepreneurs with same-industry experience (See, Garvin 1983; Klepper 2001). In analogy to Neffke and Henning (2013) - who use between-industry worker flows that are over and beyond expected worker flows given the respective sizes, growth rates and wage levels of the industries -, we argue that transitions from occupations as employees to industries as self-employed reflect ‘revealed-relatedness’ between the two. We analyze a detailed matched employer-employee database for Sweden that allows us to identify employees who choose to leave their job for entrepreneurship (Andersson and Klepper 2013; Hyytinen and Maliranta 2008). We restrict this transition to entrepreneurs who go from being fully employed to being fully self-employed. In addition, only new firms with sole ownership are included. By imposing such restrictions, potential unobserved and confounding skill sets or resources that may be available to the new firm through a current employer (in the case of hybrid start-ups) or team members (group start-ups) are eliminated from the analysis. The main findings are that occupational spin-off entrepreneurs have higher success, as evidenced by higher business income and longevity as entrepreneurs. These results are robust to the inclusion of a full set of theoretically motivated control variables that account for other modes in which relevant experience is gained (including employer size, job tenure, age and industry) and other controls for entrepreneurial success (including migration, regional context). In addition to the main conclusion of the study regarding the pertinent positive effect of a relevant occupational background, the results confirm recent findings in the literature regarding the effects of the variables mentioned in the above. The intuition of the results is that the occupational background of self-employed is an important element in representing the multi-faceted nature of learning-on-the-job processes. Our analyses contribute to the existing literature on the relationship between firm-specific (Becker 1964) and industry-specific learning (Klepper 2001) and built-up experiences and entrepreneurial success. As such, the argument speaks to important debates around the type of contexts that stimulate the recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities and the decision to act successfully on them (Shane and Venkataraman 2000; Shane 2003). These underlying mechanisms are crucial in understanding the heterogeneity in entrepreneurship, both in its manifestations and its success. The findings also suggest that descriptions of regional specialization and diversification can be meaningfully extended beyond industry-structure to also include information on the occupational structure of the regional economy.",6

In the strategic delegation literature a firm’s owners incentivize managers to include market share or the relative profits with respect to rivals into their objectives (Vickers 1985; Fershtman et al. 1991). In mixed oligopoly models, a welfare-maximizing public firm competes with profit-maximizing private firms (De Fraja and Delbono 1989). The motive for maximizing other things than profit can also be non-strategic. A large body of literature in experimental economics has demonstrated that players have other regarding preferences (ORPs) that can be included into the maximization problem by complementing the utility functions with such factors as concerns for efficiency or reciprocity (Cooper and Kagel 2016). Various models of strategic behavior also take beliefs into account. A traditional way to model beliefs in the industrial organization literature is to assume that firms conjecture that competitors react to variations in own strategies by nonzero variations in their strategies. As in the case of ORP models, the conjectural variations models can represent many different outcomes in a single framework (Varian 1992). However, conjectural variations have been criticized as imposing a dynamic process of belief formation into a static framework (e.g. Makowski 1987). Presently, conjectural variations are modeled in contexts that have some sort of an implicitly or explicitly dynamic nature (Figuières et al. 2004). In these models, the conjectural variations equilibria are interpreted as shortcuts to modeling outcomes of dynamic games (Dockner 1991; Cabral 1995). Alternatively the conjectures can be assumed to result from behavior that is boundedly rational, either in belief formation (Friedman and Mezzetti 2002; Jean-Marie and Tidball 2006) or in short-term fitness maximization in the presence of evolutionary selection pressure on the conjectures (Dixon and Somma 2003; Müller and Normann 2005; Possajennikov 2009). Common to these bounded rationality approaches is that they justify the consistent conjecture, i.e. a conjecture that represents correctly anticipating the competitor’s reaction (Bresnahan 1981). The appeal of the evolutionary approach is that it can also justify the origin of the conjectures. In the models studying the evolutionary selection of conjectures in infinite populations, the evolutionarily stable conjecture coincides with the consistent conjecture (Müller and Normann 2005). Possajennikov (2009) argues that this occurs because the first-order conditions of payoff maximization and fitness maximization coincide and the players solve the correct maximization problem. Our motivation in this paper is to demonstrate cases when the consistent conjecture is not justified by evolutionary arguments. We use the indirect evolutionary approach to derive conjectures in a model where other-regarding (altruistic or spiteful) behavior is possible. We show that the evolutionarily stable conjecture does not coincide with the consistent conjecture if the players maximize a simple utility function that takes ORPs into account, thus contrasting with the results obtained by Müller and Normann (2005). We consider the two classical models of duopoly competition, quantity competition (Cournot) and price competition (Bertrand). Both games have evolutionarily stable conjectures with ORPs that do not coincide with the consistent conjectures. The model of ORPs that we consider is a linear rule that imposes a concern for the total payoff distribution. Varying the ORP parameter allows the representation of altruism, spite, or self-regard. A concern for relative payoffs can be modeled with a change of the parameter. As this model has only a single parameter, it is selected over competing and more complex models of other-regarding behavior (such as the inequity aversion model of Fehr and Schmidt (1999) or the egocentric altruism model of Cox et al. 2007) for its analytical tractability. Although the ORP parameter is symmetric among the players, the model captures the essence of distributional preferences. Some evolutionary models in the literature subject the ORP parameter to selection pressure and derive conditions for stability of altruism or spite (Bester and Güth 1998; Possajennikov 2000). In our model only the conjecture is shaped by selection pressure but the ORP parameter is free of that pressure. Thus, in an evolutionary sense the phenotypic variability is maintained in the model via the ORP parameter. We find that this variability is maintained also in the conjectures themselves, i.e. the conjectures (beliefs) depend directly on ORPs. We analyze the Cournot duopoly game in Section 2 and the Bertrand duopoly game in Section 3. In each of these sections we first derive the consistent conjecture and then analyze the evolutionary stability. Section 4 discusses the results and Section 5 contains all the proofs.",

Users have seized these new opportunities to bypass well-established businesses for production and trade. In this research, we focus on those online platforms that give anyone an opportunity to share their possessions for profit – such as airbnb.com, blablacar.com and turo.com. These platforms operate in a grey area between traditional marketplaces (supplied by formal firms) and the not-for-profit part of the Sharing Economy (Belk 2014). Consequently, specific forms of market governance have to be found in order to provide an efficient platform that would embed both profit motive and the willingness to share. Due to its rapid growth, this sector has been largely scrutinized in the media and in the academic literature. Codagnone et al. (2016) provide an extensive literature review showing how the potential of these platforms is widely assumed to be correlated with regulatory matters. In the same line, Frenken (2017) sketches three potential futures of sharing based on different institutional decisions by the markets, governments and the public. Here, we take a different approach by showing how economic governance at the platform level alone can provide predictions of the potential successes and failures of the platforms. By doing so, we question the ability to provide economic governance by relying only on intermediation technologies. We show that the online platforms of the profit-based sharing economy are not neutral technologies. Only specific forms of governance over the transactions can help the platform to meet the expectations of the sharing economy to benefit all participants. The focus on internal governance supplements the widely discussed external factors of platform success and failure, e.g., the different levels of government regulation, the competition with other platforms or incumbents, and their social legitimacy. Our interest in this issue comes from the emergence of a hybrid form of governance between intermediation and community building. On the one hand, these platforms define themselves as ‘intermediaries’, creating an apparent proximity with other online intermediaries such as eBay.com, Craigslist or Facebook, because of a strong technological integration with the Web 2.0 (including social networks and user reviews) (Belk 2014). The main difference between intermediaries and merchants is the distribution of control between the platform and the participants (Hagiu 2007). While the merchants keep full control over the sale (e.g. pricing, quantities), intermediaries only control the affiliation to their platform, taking the form of a two-sided platform connecting independent sellers and buyers. On the other hand, by putting forward the idea of sharing, these platforms position themselves in a moral system interested in social welfare (Botsman and Rogers 2011). Assuming that learning and enforcing morality is the result of both individual attributes and social relations (Hodgson 2014), decentralized platforms do not provide the structure for this kind of social enterprise. For instance, we can observe this ambiguity in the governance of Airbnb, in which the platform emphasizes its role of intermediary by describing itself as “a trusted community marketplace”Footnote 1 rather than a company or a merchant. Yet, on September 8th 2016, Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb addressed an email to the entire community of users entitled “Discrimination and Belonging”.Footnote 2 The core of the email consists in the acknowledgment of discrimination on the platform, and the description of new platform policies implementing stronger control over the users’ behaviors. In this paper, we study the interaction of platform governance and participants’ behavior using an agent-based simulation model. The model consists in the formal representation of a marketplace where we simulate pricing and purchasing decisions by the participants. Our objective is to study the specific conditions under which the online platforms of the sharing economy can approach the allocative efficiency of a clearing house (i.e. a fully-informed and fully-centralized intermediary that generates the maximum value and volume of transactions). As an intermediary, the platform governs the diffusion of information between the participants. This is the central component of the model that simulates it via mechanisms controlling what information is accessible to the participants so as to copy the search engines available for the buyers to find a seller. In addition, we assume that purchases and user reviews are the main sources of information available to the sellers. At the individual level, the model implements behaviors by assuming that actions are motivated by monetary or non-monetary incentives, also known as extrinsic and intrinsic motivations (Benkler 2004). The original work by Frey and Jegen (2001) studies the positive and negative influences of extrinsic motivation (monetary incentives or punishments) when the action was originally performed using intrinsic motivation. This paper aims to provide a better picture of the potential evolution of the platforms, in line with the recent concerns that emerged about the predatory or greedy nature of the for-profit platforms of the sharing economy (e.g. Frenken and Schor 2017; Slee 2016). As a result, this modelling framework gives us the opportunity to study the interplay of specific structures of platform control and individual motivation. For each structure, the simulation shows patterns of allocative efficiency from two perspectives: the platform perspective (aggregated level) and the participant perspective (individual level). In a nutshell, the limited information generates local market frictions. The individual adaptation to these frictions leads to specific types of failures at the aggregated platform level, depending on the participants’ motivations. From the platform perspective, the market failure is more systematic when participants are only extrinsically motivated and when control is either too constraining or completely absent. From the participant perspective, we are able to specify which categories of participants and transactions are banned from the platform: the low-end of the demand side cannot access the marketplace due to the overpricing of the low-end of the supply side, and the high-end of the supply side is undervalued. The simulation results also give us the opportunity to discuss insights for platform policies to increase successful trading. This view of platform control and individual motivation is based on Landini (2016), who describes this evolution as a key characteristic of the evolution of the digital economy toward one equilibrium of high control and extrinsic motivation. However, our mechanisms of control are more limited: platform owners can never achieve full information about the participants. They cannot control the timing of purchases, they can only influence the information available for that decision.",19

Simulating compatibility-based learning in a network of networks,December 2018,Michael P. Schlaile,Johannes Zeman,Matthias Mueller,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Knowledge is important for the economic system both as input and output (see, e.g., Ancori et al. 2000; Antonelli and Link 2015; Barley et al. 2017; Foray 2004; Mokyr 2002, 2017; Smith 2000) and a central building block of innovation and economic evolution (e.g., Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Dosi 1988; Jensen et al. 2007; Lundvall 2004, 2016; Lundvall and Johnson 1994). Consequently, many authors study knowledge dynamics as a fundamental pillar of innovation both from empirical and theoretical perspectives (see, e.g., Morone and Taylor 2010, for a review). Recently, several agent-based models and simulations have emerged that aim to capture various dynamics of knowledge creation and diffusion in (innovation) networks (e.g., Ahrweiler et al. 2016; Bogner et al. 2018; Cowan and Jonard 2004; Gilbert et al. 2007, 2014; Luo et al. 2015; Morone and Taylor 2004, 2010; Mueller et al. 2017; Schmid 2015; Tur and Azagra-Caro 2018; Vermeulen and Pyka 2017). Knowledge and information as well as their diffusion can be modeled in various forms (see, e.g., Cowan and Jonard 2004; Ferrari et al. 2009; Morone et al. 2007; Weng 2014, for different approaches). In previous models, knowledge has often been represented as a vector of knowledge types or categories (e.g., Cowan and Jonard 2004; Luo et al. 2015; Mueller et al. 2017). However, as Piergiuseppe Morone and Richard Taylor (2010, p. 37) note: “considering knowledge as a number (or a vector of numbers) ... restricts our understanding of the complex structure of knowledge generation and diffusion”. Arguably, when representing knowledge itself as an easily quantifiable cumulative entity in terms of numbers or vectors, the analysis of knowledge diffusion processes may provide an incomplete picture. There are many examples where knowledge generation and diffusion involves more than “stockpiling” additional pieces of knowledge, for example, by establishing meaningful connections and complex relations (cf. relational knowledge, Halford et al. 2010). Consequently, knowledge is not only cumulative (e.g., Boschma 2005; Foray and Mairesse 2002), it can also be tacit or sticky (see, e.g., Antonelli 2006; Cowan et al. 2000; Polanyi 1966; Szulanski 2003; von Hippel 1994), and learning must be considered as a path-dependent process (e.g., Baddeley 2010, 2013; Boschma and Lambooy 1999; Dosi et al. 2001; Rizzello 2004; Hayek 1952). The aim of our article is to contribute to this broad line of research by proposing a meso-analyticFootnote 1 agent-based simulation model that presents an alternative approach to modeling knowledge and its diffusion by taking into account the relational, cumulative, and path-dependent aspects of (social) learning. More specifically, we explicitly take into account the following inherent characteristics of knowledge: 
 The network character of knowledge, compatibility of newly acquired with already existing knowledge (an important aspect of path dependence in social learning processes), and competition among knowledge units for attention. Consequently, the central purpose of our article is to shed light on the potential implications and advantages of modeling knowledge and its diffusion differently. We develop a model that can more adequately capture the complexity of diffusion processes resulting from incorporating these three characteristics of knowledge. At the same time, the model is kept simple enough to be analyzed in a conclusive manner. The article is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background of our approach. In particular, we review important literature and elucidate the article’s research focus (Section 2.1), motivation and foundations (Section 2.2), and then describe our model (Section 2.3). Subsequently, in Section 3, we present the analyses of the simulation results. More precisely, in Section 3.1, we start with the results of a baseline scenario that aims to illuminate the changing diffusion dynamics once we explicitly consider the network character of knowledge and compatibility-based learning. Building on this, Section 3.2 tackles the important topic of knowledge diversity within and between agents in an innovation network and the consequences for the performance of knowledge exploitation vs. exploration strategies. Thereafter, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 address the issue of measuring knowledge diffusion—while taking the three characteristics mentioned above seriously—both on an aggregated (Section 3.3) and an individual (Section 3.4) level. Finally, Section 3.5 contributes to discussions on the impact of an innovation network’s structural properties on the overall diffusion performance. In the last section of our article (Section 4), we draw our conclusion and suggest directions for future work.",18

Nelson and Winter (1982), using this approach, created a theoretical core with an analytical apparatus that has inspired, among others, De Bresson (1987), Dosi et al. (1988), Saviotti and Metcalfe (1991) and Witt (1992). Recently, this Schumpeterian theoretical core was also embedded into a macroeconomic framework (in particular, an agent-based one) as shown by Dosi et al. (2010). Otherwise, evolutionary economics is deeply rooted in the Veblenian avenue of economic analysis that dealt originally with the interrelations of consumer behavior, social class and institutional change (Veblen 1899). Even though the latter research strand found continuous improvements (Tool 1977; Bush 1987; Gruchy 1990; Hodgson 1998), it did not develop a common analytical apparatus, nor has there been any proper application in a macroeconomic framework. Our contribution aims to close this research gap by highlighting Veblenian consumption dynamics in an agent-based macroeconomic model. In this undertaking we basically follow the methodology of agent-based macroeconomics that received increased attention in the Great Recession. As argued by Stiglitz (2015), the design of macroeconomic theory has to change substantially in order to arrive at a meaningful economic policy. The idea to integrate complexity and heterogeneity into macroeconomics has been articulated at several occasions over the last ten years; see especially Tesfatsion and Judd (2006), LeBaron and Tesfatsion (2008), Farmer and Foley (2009), Delli Gatti et al. (2010), Kirman (2011), Stiglitz and Gallegati (2011) and Dosi (2012). Many have already followed this agenda and brought these claims to life in agent-based macroeconomic models; compare Dosi et al. (2010), Ciarli et al. (2010), Cincotti et al. (2010), Delli Gatti et al. (2011), Seppecher (2012), Lengnick (2013), Riccetti et al. (2013), Chen et al. (2014), Rengs and Wäckerle (2014, 2017) and Caiani et al. (2016) for the recent publication of a new benchmark model in this realm. Evolutionary economists have started to develop their own theory of consumption within the last 15 years (compare Chai 2016), as illustrated by Witt (2001), Nelson and Consoli (2010), Chai and Moneta (2010), Valente (2012) and Kapeller et al. (2013). One of the first microeconomic models in this evolutionary direction was developed by Cowan et al. (1997) with a focus on bandwagon and snob effects in a heterogeneous population of consumers. Malerba et al. (2007) and Safarzynska and van den Bergh (2010) provided a basic simulation model of the co-evolution of industries, technological innovation, niche markets and ‘experimental users’. The latter article already introduced a differentiation between a “snob” and a “network effect” in the social mediation of preferences. However, this line of research has never found integration into macroeconomic models, with the exception of Ciarli et al. (2010) and Lorentz et al. (2016). Technically speaking, we do not know much about the endogenous welfare effects of signaling-by-consuming effects. Elsewhere, macroeconomists have conducted similar welfare experiments following neoclassical (Fisher and Hof 2005; Wendner 2010) as well as post-Keynesian approaches (van Treeck and Sturn 2012; Kapeller and Schütz 2015). However, the latter approaches have only limited explanatory potential for a deeper analysis of structuration processes at work, since they build on an aggregated representative agent model that has come under serious criticism for its explanatory limitations (Kirman 1992).To this extent, aggregated macroeconomic models face crucial limitations in addressing the interactive dynamics of imitating and innovating heterogeneous agents central to endogenous economic development (Veblen 1899; Schumpeter 1934). Instead, we follow an evolutionary macroeconomic approach – considered as integral to the larger research program of evolutionary political economy (Hanappi and Scholz-Wäckerle 2017; Hanappi et al. 2017) – with endogenous consumer behavior dependent on social class. Economic agents are characterized as heterogeneous, diverse and boundedly rational. Their behavior depends on cognitive decision heuristics as well as on social norms and imitation. In this regard, we follow roughly a micro-meso-macro framework (Dopfer et al. 2004; Elsner 2007; Dopfer et al. 2016), highlighting the social mediation of consumer preferences as a meso foundation in a complex evolving macroeconomic system (Scholz-Wäckerle 2017). The approach of evolutionary macroeconomics was originally formulated by Foster (1987) and was revived quite recently by Verspagen (2002), Foster (2011), Dosi (2012) and Hanappi (2014). While Dosi et al. (2010) as well as Ciarli et al. (2010) do not explicitly refer to evolutionary macroeconomics, their models implicitly follow the elementary evolutionary blocks, as presented in Dosi (2012). The model presented in this article focuses on a Veblenian meso foundation and thereby contributes to evolutionary macroeconomics with a novel analysis of the dynamic implications of social distinction on the co-evolution of firm size, income/wealth distribution and macroeconomic aggregates such as unemployment and GDP growth. Computational simulation experiments indicate that a wide adoption of conspicuous consumption behavior in the household population drives the macroeconomic system into turmoil, leading to unsustainable unemployment as well as severe losses in aggregate demand. We also show the simultaneous microeconomic effects on firm specialization due to different consumption behavior. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The characteristics of the Veblenian meso foundation and the corresponding class dynamics are expressed in Section 2. The general structure of the agent-based macroeconomic model, the goods market, the labor market, the credit market as well as the government and the central bank are explained in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the computational simulation experiments and its results. Section 5 concludes.",13

A micro simulation model",March 2019,Huub Meijers,Önder Nomaler,Bart Verspagen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"For a little while after the 2008 global crisis, it seemed as if the macroeconomic community was drastically re-thinking its theoretical framework (Economist 2009). With comparisons between the 2008 crisis and the Great Depression of the 1930s being made immediately, it was logical that such a re-thinking would involve a “Return of the Master” (Skidelsky 2009). However, some ten years after the crisis, it is no longer obvious that macroeconomic theory is taking new roads. In the policy discussion about the European crisis, the dominant perspective is entirely based on government budget discipline, and seems in no way to have been influenced by changing perspectives due to the crisis itself. An important part of the criticism about the relevance of macroeconomic theory was concerned with the way in which the financial sector, and especially its interaction with the “real” sector of the economy, is modelled (Economist 2009). This is the topic of the current paper, of which the aim is to present and analyze a simple macroeconomic model in which the financial sector is modelled, although is a rather basic way. We follow in the post Keynesian tradition of Godley and Lavoie (2007), whose stock-flow consistent approach has been a dominant perspective in non-mainstream macroeconomics. We start from their ideas because they provide an approach in which the financial sector is fully endogenized as interacting with the “real” economy. Where we extend the stock-flow consistent approach is by looking explicitly at one aspect of financial crisis, this being bankruptcy. We look at this as an important factor in the actual macroeconomic dynamics of the business cycle. Bankruptcy puts firms out of business, but also has effects on wealth stocks (assets) of those who lent money to these firms. Allowing for firms (and households) to go bankrupt forces us to adopt a multi-agent perspective. Obviously, in a model with a single representative firm or household, bankruptcy does not make much sense. Our model also has important differences as compared to the Godley and Lavoie approach. In particular, our modelling of the financial sector is much simpler than theirs, as we do not distinguish at all between different kinds of financial assets, and our model also does not model money explicitly. Thus, our model can be seen as being outside the post Keynesian tradition, even if it embraces some of the basic (post) Keynesian ideas. Besides the stock-flow consistency, another basic Keynesian idea that we use is that of the role of demand. The business cycle that our model generates is driven by demand. We also look at the role of demand as an alternative way of macroeconomic coordination. Instead of Walrasian market clearing, macroeconomic coordination in our model is achieved by the multiplier, much in line with Robinson’s (1936) interpretation of Keynes’ general theory. Because our model also obeys supply restrictions, it is ready to be enhanced with innovation and productivity growth, which would turn it into a growth model. We leave this extension to a future paper, however. We will present, below a so-called agent-based computational economics model of the macroeconomy. This is presented in Section 4, while Section 5 presents and discusses some model analysis (as achieved by simulations). Before we get to the model, however, we first lay out, in Section 2, our main ideas about macroeconomic coordination, and, in Section 3, the way we look at stock-flow consistency, and what it implies for our model.",6

However, some classes are much larger than others, some classes are much older than others, and more importantly none of these classes can be thought of as a once-and-for-all well defined entity. Due to its important legal role, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has constantly devoted resources to improve the classification of inventions, so that the classification system has greatly evolved over time, reflecting contemporaneous technological evolution. Classifications evolve because new classes are created but also because existing classes are abolished, merged and split. In fact, all current classes in 2015 have been established in the U.S. Patent Classification System (USPCS) after 1899, even though the first patent was granted in 1790 and the first classification system was created in 1829-1830. To give just another example, out of all patents granted in 1976, 40% are in a different main class now than they were in 1976. To maintain the best possible level of searchability, the USPTO reclassifies patents so that, at any single moment in time, the patents are classified according to a coherent, up-to-date taxonomy. The downside of this is that the current classification is not meant to reflect the historical description of technological evolution as it unfolded. In other words, while the classification system provides a consistent classification of all the patents, this consistency is not time invariant. Observers at different points in time have a different idea of what is a consistent classification of the past, even when classifying the same set of past patents. In this paper, we focus on the historical evolution of the U.S. patent classification. We present three sets of findings. First we study the evolution of the number of distinct classes, contrasting current and historical classification systems. Recent studies (Strumsky et al. 2012; Strumsky and Lobo 2015; Youn et al. 2015) have shown that it is possible to reconstruct the long-run evolution of the number of subclasses using the current classification system. This allowed them to obtain interesting results on the types of recombinations and on the relative rates of introduction of new subclasses and new combinations. An alternative way to count the number of distinct categories is to go back to the archives and check how many classes did actually exist at different points in the past. We find important differences between the historical and reconstructed evolution of the classification system. In particular, we find that historically the growth of the number of distinct classes has been more or less linear, with about two and a half classes added per year. By contrast, the reconstructed evolution – which considers how many current classes are needed to classify all patents granted before a given date – suggests a different pattern with most classes created in the 19th century and a slowdown in the rate of introduction of novel classes afterwards. Similarly, using the historical classes we find that the relationship between the number of classes and the number of patents is compatible with Heaps’ law, a power law scaling of the number of categories with the number of items, originally observed between the number of different words and the total number of words in a text (Heaps 1978). Using the reconstructed evolution Heaps’ law does not hold over the long run. Knowing the number of distinct classes, the next question is about their growth and relative size (in terms of the number of patents). Thus our second set of findings concerns the size distribution of classes. We find that it is exponential, confirming a result of Carnabuci (2013) on a much more restricted sub-sample. We also find that there is no clear relationship between the size and the age of classes, which rules out an explanation of the exponential distribution in terms of simple stochastic growth models in which classes are created once and for all. Third, we hypothesize that new technology fields and radical innovations tend to be associated with a higher reclassification activity. This suggests that the history of reclassification contains interesting information on the most transformative innovations. Our work here is related to Wang et al. (2016) who study how a range of metrics (claims, references, extensions, etc.) correlates with reclassification for three million utility patents granted since 1994. We used the data since 1976, for which we observe the class of origin and the citation statistics. It appears that reclassified patents are more cited than non-reclassified patents. We also construct a reclassification flow diagram, with aggregation at the level of NBER patent categories (Hall et al. 2001). This reveals that a non-negligible share of patents are reclassified across NBER categories. We find that patents in “Computers” and in “Electronics” are often reclassified in other NBER categories, which is not the case with other categories such as “Drugs”. We then discuss three examples of new classes (Fabric, Combinatorial Chemistry and Artificial Intelligence). Finally, we argue that it is not possible to explain the observed patterns without accounting for reclassification. We develop a simple model in which classes grow according to preferential attachment but have a probability of being split. The model’s only inputs are the number of patents and classes in 2015 and the Heaps’ law exponent. Despite this extreme parsimony, the model is able to reproduce i) the historical and reconstructed patterns of growth of the number of classes, ii) the size distribution and (partially) the lack of age-size relationship, and iii) the time evolution of the reclassification rates. The empirical evidence that we present and the assumptions we need to make for the model make it clear that the USPCS has evolved considerably and it is hardly possible to think of patent classes as technological domains with a stable definition. The classification system cannot be well understood as a system in which categories are created once-and-for-all and accumulate patents over time. Instead, it is better understood as a system that is constantly re-organized. Because of this, using the current classification system to study a set of older patents is akin to looking at the past with today’s glasses. In this paper, we not only show the differences between the historical and reconstructed reality, but we also explain how these differences emerged. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details our motivation, gives some background on categorization and reviews the literature on technological categories. Section 3 describes the USPCS and our data sources. Section 4 presents our results on the evolution of the number of classes. Section 5 discusses the size distribution of classes. Section 6 presents our results on reclassification since 1976. Section 7 presents a model that reproduces the main empirical patterns discovered in the previous sections. The last section discusses the results, motivates further research and concludes.",15

Our focus is on the distinction between the economic contributions of the adoption of foreign technology and local innovation from the perspective of two contrasting theoretical developments, namely the mainstream neoclassical and evolutionary economics.Footnote 1,Footnote 2 In this context, we discuss the controversy that has arisen from the critiques of evolutionary economists to the neoclassical approach in regard to the study of technology, technology diffusion and economic growth in backward countries. The importance of technology in explaining income and income growth differences across countries is apparent. A vast amount of specialized literature agrees that the productivity of workers is closely related to a country’s available technology. On some accounts, productivity, or technology, differences are held to explain up to between 60% and 90% of the growth differences and more than 90% of the difference in levels of income between poor and rich countries.Footnote 3 Yet, there is less agreement among growth economists when it comes to accounting for the sources of technology progress. Among mainstream economists there is a widespread—though not unanimous—tendency to associate technology in a narrow way basically with “high-tech” developments; and foreign technology is held to account for the “lion’s share” of productivity growth in backward countries, with some evidence showing that it accounts for more than 90%, and even as much as 99%, of the productivity of countries in the receiving end.Footnote 4 Among evolutionary economists, on the other side, the importance of technology diffusion/adoption notwithstanding, the true engine of growth is (local) innovation, in a context where innovation is defined in a broader sense—as we explain below. The controversial nature of this discussion, namely, the relative importance of foreign versus local technology as sources of economic growth, is illustrated not just by the fact that mainstream and evolutionary economics have different approaches to these issues—as seems evident from the disagreement that has arisen also among mainstream economists in this regard.Footnote 5 Our point, however, is that the debate has been far more controversial between mainstream and evolutionary economics than within mainstream economics. For one thing, the evolutionary theory represents the radical alternative to the neoclassical paradigm regarding the emphasis on intertemporal optimization, the assumption of rational and foresighted individuals, the very notion of technology, and the proper role of the government in the economy.Footnote 6 Thus, in trying to assess the economic contributions of foreign and local technology, we are faced with the concern central to the review in this paper: reasonable answers stem from premises grounded on contesting theoretical frameworks. The review below aims for a close examination of these theoretical issues. Let us pose in a more concrete way what we claim are the core contributions of this paper: First and foremost, we aim to provide an integrated framework for understanding what economists from different backgrounds think technology is, and the relationship between technology and growth. The notion of technology, even in the narrow field of growth economics, usually reflects quite different meanings among different economists (e.g., productivity, artifacts, ideas, high-tech inventions, small innovations).Footnote 7 Thus, to overcome the hurdle imposed on our review by conflicting definitions and to provide a more cogent scenario for analyzing the impact of technology on the growth process, it is necessary, in the first place, to put together the different concepts and interpretations of technology both from the viewpoint of the mainstream theory and the evolutionary theory. Second, we use the above conceptual definitions of technology to elaborate in-depth on the distinction between the economic impacts of adoption (of foreign technology) and (local) innovation, which is one of the key subjects creating major—if little promulgated—contention between mainstream and evolutionary economics. We discuss various arguments to show the contrast between the mainstream’s prominence of technology transfer as a major engine of growth in backward countries and the evolutionary contention that the true driver of growth is (local) innovation instead—the ability to translate technology into new and ever-changing commercial applications—even if the latter takes place along major technology trajectories (steam engine, electricity, electronics, ICT, nanotechnology, biotechnology). Our third contribution relates to the distinct policy implications of these competing views on the relationship between technology and the economy. In doing so, we discuss how the disagreement relates to contrasting theoretical assumptions with regard to, among other things, the idea that the economy is populated by rational “optimizing” individuals subject to the logic of price-competition, and the effectiveness of self-organizing markets to coordinate the economic activity, both of which result in competing interpretations about the proper role of government in matters of innovation policy. In particular, we argue that the policy implications of the evolutionary approach—most commonly related to the literature of the National Innovation Systems approach, which we narrow down to aspects of sponsorship, leadership and coordination—stand in stark contrast to those drawn from the mainstream analysis, which stresses ideas of distance to the frontier and the advantage of backwardness. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the conceptual understanding of technology. Section 3 discusses the controversy between mainstream and evolutionary economics over the fundamental aspects of technology that positively affect the growth and catch up processes. Section 4 addresses the implications of this controversy in terms of the ability of backward countries to realize their advantage of backwardness. Section 5 elaborates on the distinct policy implications drawn from the contesting theoretical frameworks under discussion. Finally, Section 6 presents the usual concluding remarks.",6

Bagley,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Prior studies have shown that industrial clusters may arise from an entrepreneurial spawning process where employees of incumbent firms depart and establish spinoffs, which occupy the same or a related sector (Klepper 2007a; Boschma and Wenting 2007). Additionally, firms in industrial clusters are said to take advantage of localization economies, which includes the sharing of information regarding local labor markets and other types of industry-specific knowledgeFootnote 1 (Marshall 1890). Evidence suggests that there are two main sources of knowledge that give spinoffs in clusters a performance premium compared to other types of new firm. The first channel, which draws from the literature on spinoffs and industrial dynamics, enable the passive transfer of knowledge and routines from parent firms to spinoffs (Renski 2011; Rosenthal and Strange 2005). Spinoffs locate close to their parents and inherit tried and tested routines that convey superior performance. The second channel, gleaned from the literature on industrial clusters, concerns the returns from locating alongside other establishments in their sector, taking advantage of knowledge spillovers and face-to-face contact with other firms and clients (Klepper 2001; Agarwal et al. 2004). Firms that happen to locate in clusters thus benefit from external scale economies. While the latter knowledge channel is a true ‘environmental effect’, the former is not. In this paper, we measure these knowledge channels separately and test them in a common analysis to gauge their effect on firm survivalFootnote 2 in industrial clusters. We test the hypothesis that spinoff firms gain a performance premium via the occupational background of the entrepreneur. Those firms that survive then provide a source of potential knowledge for other firms in the same geographic area. The aim of this paper is thus to explore how the varying structure of inherited knowledge channels affect the prospects of survival among spinoff firms, and to disentangle these effects from those that arise from co-location. Studies disentangling this mechanism of localization have been sparse. Frenken et al. (2015), in their survey of recent literature in industrial dynamics and clusters, found that there is an empirical gap in studies that analyze the effect of localization economies on firm survival, and the conditions, mechanisms and spatial scale that affect different types of firms are not well understood. Due to the lack of longitudinal data, knowledge channels between parent firms to spinoffs have mostly been inferred rather than identified and measured. But this does not fully capture the underlying mechanisms that may give certain firms an advantage in performance, namely the knowledge and routines inherited through the founder’s history. Firm success may not derive from geographic clustering in its own right but from the experience of the entrepreneur. Routines and knowledge gained from experience are genealogical in nature, as they reflect multiple generations of parent-progeny relationships. Furthermore, the lack of studies using continuous spatial scale have contributed to conflicting results concerning the survivability of spinoff firms in and outside industrial clusters. Some authors, such as Arzaghi and Henderson (2008), found that the benefits of co-location attenuate sharply with distance, with any gains from such externalities restricted to the neighborhood level rather than the city level. We argue that geographic proximity has a role to play in localization after controlling for other types of knowledge channels. This role may not necessarily be linear. Due to supply- and demand-side competition effects, geographic proximity may act as a cost (Sorenson and Audia 2000; Stuart and Sorenson 2003) as well as a benefit. To separate these two knowledge channels, this paper examines the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) cluster in Stockholm county, a research-intensive sector that exhibits a high degree of clustering in that region. Using Swedish employer-employee matched data for 1990 to 2010, we construct a network based on parent-spinoff relationships. We may then measure the level of connectivity of a firm relative to the rest of the network, and this serves to measure the inherited and passive knowledge channels of the firm, which may act as a conduit of established knowledge and routines. To account for knowledge channels that derive from geographic proximity, coordinate data allows for a continuous measure of distance from a firm’s location to the cluster’s core, which may shed some light on any potential nonlinearity of the returns from co-location. We use a Cox proportional hazard model to understand the effects these measures have on the survival rates of new firms. We expect that a firm’s genealogical background is a major explanator of firm survival rates, and that the effect of geographic distance from a cluster’s core on firm survivability is nonlinear in nature. These effects are expected to differ depending on the underlying motivations of the entrepreneur, and the reasons for establishing a new firm. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin by introducing the evolutionary framework of industrial clusters, which describes the inherited knowledge and routines of new firms, as well as an overview of past survival studies regarding spinoffs in industrial clusters. This leads us to provide an overview of the current research gaps in this field, and to introduce two types of information flow for the firm: realized and unrealized knowledge channels. The next section introduces the data, which includes spinoff identification, the rules for assembling the network, and an overview of the variables used in regression analysis, including the measurements used to proxy different knowledge channels. The fourth section gives the results of the Cox survival analysis, which we expect will unmask some of the underlying mechanics of localization economies. The final section concludes.",12

In evolutionary economics, economic development “is seen as a continuing process in space and time” (Boulding 1991, p. 9). It implies that the economy and our knowledge about it are assumed to be continuously evolving. Consequently, universally valid laws and time-invariant facts do not exist therein, which includes policy. “During the process of policy making, and in its aftermath, the positive and normative knowledge that informs the actions of the agents involved can change through experience and induced inventive learning” (Witt 2003, p. 77). On the one hand, this view makes policy, its design and consequences, much more complex and less straight-forward. On the other hand, it offers a more realistic understanding of the economy that amongst others, allows for adequately analyzing path-dependent and path-breaking dynamics as well as spatial processes shaping the economy. Of particular importance in this context are knowledge diffusion and innovation, which define the pace and direction of these developments. In addition, they shape (future) economic growth potentials. Therefore, it is not surprising that innovation policy is at the center of the policy-oriented evolutionary economics literature (e.g., Metcalfe 1994, Cantner & Pyka 2001, Smith 2018) and of related fields such as regional policy (e.g., Lambooy & Boschma 2001), environment policy (e.g., Faber & Frenken 2009) and the literature on the relevance of institutions (e.g. Potts 2007). Notably, Witt (2003) puts forward that taking an evolutionary perspective on policy-making does not imply the need for a totally new concept of economic policy. Rather, the evolutionary approach adds a new perspective that emphasizes behavioral and contextual elements in the design and application of policy. This special issue originated from the conferences of the German Section on Evolutionary Economics in Hannover (2016) and Marburg (2017) that were organized by the editors. It combines a series of theoretical and empirical articles that all share the evolutionary perspective on policy. In the theoretical works behavioral and institutional aspects are discussed that tend to be ignored by policy discussions in the existing non-evolutionary literature. For instance, this includes the coordination and directionality character of policies (Foray), the existence of behavioral biases in policy making (Schubert & Schnellenbach), and the crucial role of institutions for economic development in general (Herrmann-Pillath) and for entrepreneurship in particular (Wegener). Similarly, the empirical works extent traditional empirical evaluations by shedding light on aspects that have received little attention so far. These include the stabilizing function of the largely publicly funded R&D sector in times of crisis (Günther et al.), the supportive role of this sector for regional economic restructuring (Brenner & Pudelko), and the knowledge diffusion enhancing effects of R&D subsidies (Broekel & Bednarz). Accordingly, this special issue gives testimony to the richness and breath of the Evolutionary perspective on policy analysis in general and innovation policy in particular. Moreover, it shows the complementary character of this perspective to the existing traditional economic literature.",3

The utilization of external knowledge requires the diffusion of knowledge between organizations and across space. Since the pioneering work of Hägerstrand (1967) it is known that knowledge does not diffuse frictionlessly within socio-economic systems. Despite technological advantages, geographic distance remains a significant obstacle. Other factors such as cognitive, institutional, organizational, and social distances add to an unequal, selective, and potentially too low diffusion of knowledge (Buisseret et al. 1995; Boschma 2005). Policy has recognized this and established measures seeking to stimulate knowledge diffusion, foremost by subsidizing joint R&D projects (Buisseret et al. 1995; Broekel and Graf 2012). The EU-Framework Programmes are a well-known example for such an initiative (Scherngell and Barber 2009). Despite such initiatives existing for decades, evidence for a positive contribution to knowledge diffusion remains scarce. While their effects on firms’ and regions’ innovation activities has been frequently documented (Hewitt-Dundas and Roper 2010; Maggioni et al. 2014; Broekel 2015), little to no evidence exists on their effectiveness for inter-organizational or inter-regional knowledge diffusion. The present paper seeks to fill this gap by using an empirical approach frequently applied to study the diffusion of knowledge in space. Following the work of Jaffe et al. (1993), we used patent citations as indications of inter-regional knowledge diffusion and tested for the effect of joint R&D projects subsidized by the German Federal Government. Hence, besides modelling knowledge diffusion directly, we contribute to the literature by studying the effect of subsidized knowledge networks among regions of a single country, as most existing studies focus on knowledge diffusion at the European level (Maggioni et al. 2011). In the empirical analysis, we use information on patents and patent citations for 141 German labor market regions between 2000 and 2009. On this basis, technology-specific knowledge diffusion, regions technological relatedness and co-inventor relations are established. Following Broekel and Graf (2012), we construct policy induced networks emerging from the subsidization of joint R&D projects by the German federal government, which are matched to the patent data. The paper is structured as follows. The second section discusses the mechanism of knowledge diffusion between organizations and in space. The empirical data and variables are described in section 3. Section 4 introduces the empirical approach. The results of the analyses are presented in section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with a short summary, and discussion on its limitations, future research prospects and political implications.",12

Nonetheless, EAT as we currently know it emerged at the beginning of the 1990s. Most of the contributions in this strand of literature are empirical works based on some specific case studies (see Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; 1996; Perotti 2013) or larger cross-country data samples (see Alesina and Perotti 1995; 1997; Alesina and Ardagna 2010; 2012; Alesina et al. 2015). They adopt an inductive methodology, trying to validate a more general, supposedly universal, theory starting from the observation of a more or less timely and geographically delimited empirical evidence. EAT is characterized by four main postulates: At least under certain circumstances, discretionary expansionary fiscal policies can induce economic contractions rather than expansions. In particular, this can happen when fiscal expansions generate quite large fiscal deficits, which in turn can impinge upon the solidity of public finances and cause an increase in interest rates. This non-Keynesian outcome of expansionary fiscal measures gets even more likely in the presence of an already high level of the public debt stock.Footnote 1 Symmetrically, fiscal consolidations can prompt economic expansions, even in the short run and even in the midst of a recession, by squeezing public deficits, reducing the public debt stock, and creating the expectations for a more solid macroeconomic environment. In order to do so, however, fiscal consolidations must be well-designed. Not only the overall fiscal stance, but also the composition of specific fiscal measures matter. A well-designed fiscal consolidation plan is based on a mix of deep, persistent and credible cuts in public expenditures then possibly followed by a reduction in taxes. According to Alesina and Perotti (1997), expenditure cuts in successful fiscal consolidations (“type-1 adjustments” in the jargon of the authors) “rely primarily on cuts in transfers, social security, government wages, and employment”, whilst “tax increases are a small fraction of the total adjustment, and, in particular, taxes on households are not raised at all or are even reduced” (Alesina and Perotti 1997, p.211). This type of well-designed, supposedly expansionary, fiscal retrenchment is to be preferred to likely contractionary “type-2 adjustments”, which “rely mostly on broad-based tax increases, and often the largest increases are in taxes on households and social security contributions” (Alesina and Perotti 1997, p.211).Footnote 2 There are three channels through which a well-designed fiscal consolidation package can release expansionary outcomes. First, upfront public spending cuts can constitute a sign of a regime change that can positively affect the behavior of private economic actors, especially households, through the “expectation channel”. Households can be induced to form optimistic expectations by anticipating future tax reductions and consequent increases in their own (permanent) income. This, in turn, may incentivize them to raise consumption immediately, giving momentum to current economic activity. Second, a “financial channel” is to be taken into account. Tough fiscal corrections that prove to be effective in reducing public deficit and the public debt stock can stimulate investment and growth by reestablishing bond vigilantes’ trust in the solvency of public finances and prompting a significant reduction in interest rates. Third, an “export-led channel” may be at work. Cuts in public wages can establish a climate of wage moderation in the labor market, and engineer an internal devaluation of the real exchange rate. Thus, this can boost exports and ultimately growth. It goes without saying that this last channel is of particular relevance in countries adopting a fixed exchange rate regime or a supranational currency such as in eurozone member states. The vast majority of the existing critiques of EAT have addressed the several shortcomings of the econometric techniques adopted by EAT supporters in order to validate their theoretical propositions empirically (see Guajardo et al. 2011; Baker and Rosnick 2014). The aim of this paper is different, since that it focuses on theory and aims at enquiring the logical solidity of EAT through a simple analytical post-Keynesian/evolutionist model. More in detail, we intend to scrutinize two crucial propositions at the heart of EAT’s policy proposal. First, we critically investigate the assertion by Alberto Alesina, according to which “many even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run” (Alesina 2010, p.3). We perform such analysis in the short-run part of our model through two distinguished (for the sake of clarity) policy exercises. First, we detect whether a well-designed discretionary cut in public transfers followed by an expected reduction of taxes on households’ income effectively increases the level of economic activity. Second, we test the logical soundness of the “expectation channel” by looking at the macroeconomic outcomes of a cut in the public sector’s wages and, hence, of a EAT-type internal devaluation. We end up arguing that EAT theoretical foundations are extremely fragile. By no means can even a well-designed fiscal contraction easily conduct economic expansions. On the contrary, EAT’s economic mechanisms are rather weak and state- and institutional-contingent, to say the least. Second, we critically discuss the more recent idea that fiscal consolidations may imply short-term costs, but lead to far larger long-run benefits in the form of sound public finances and revived economic activity (see Section 3 on this point). We perform our analysis in the long-run part of the model by looking at some long-run dynamics possibly set in motion by austerity measures. We conclude noting that austerity-led short-run costs and long-run benefits are likely inconsistent. Even mild short-run recessionary responses to adjustment programs can give rise to instable evolutions in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, so that the short-run costs of austerity measures may eventually breed even larger long-run damages (rather than benefits). Our model blends together the post-Keynesian and evolutionary/institutionalist traditions. From the post-Keynesian tradition, we take the demand-driven logic that permeates the functioning of our model. Moreover, we pay attention to the importance that mounting Keynesian-type radical uncertainty after the eruption of the global financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone may play in shaping economic actors’ expectations and behaviors. According to the evolutionary approach to system dynamics (Radzicki and Sterman 1994), we describe an economy in which cumulative mechanisms give rise to path dependence and multiple equilibria. We also put emphasis on the crucial role that country-specific institutions play in shaping diverging economic trajectories. We note that austerity may lead to different outcomes depending on the specific “monetary environment” in which it is implemented. Whilst the short-run expansionary outcomes of austerity hardly emerge in monetarily sovereign and non–monetarily sovereign countries alike, the way central banks intervene to stop financial distress proves to be a decisive factor in taming or feeding long-run macroeconomic instability. In the case of non–monetarily sovereign countries, in the absence of any deep institutional discontinuity, debt forgiveness may eventually stand out as the ultimate solution for restoring economic soundness. This fact notwithstanding, changes in monetary institutions’ commitments taking place in the eurozone since mid-2012 show that economic variables and institutional factors often co-evolve in response to existing economic problems. Such an endogenous institutional change may eventually give rise to structural breakthroughs and set new and much more stable dynamics. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the short-run part of our model and analyzes the effects of allegedly well-designed consolidation packages on economic activity and on the deficit-to-GDP ratio. Section 3 moves to the long run and shows how fiscal variables (and eventually economic institutions) may (co-)evolve as a consequence of (and perhaps in reaction to) the short-run effects assessed before. Section 4 concludes.",1

The output of the offshored activity is then imported for use as an input to domestic production. The primary objective of offshoring, according to enterprise surveys in advanced economies, is to cut costs (OECD 2007). The immediate and observable effect of offshoring on the domestic economy is a job loss: the tasks that had previously been performed by workers on domestic territory are now performed by workers abroad. Within the confines of the pure theory of trade, the question to what extent offshoring influences aggregate employment cannot be asked – by virtue of the full-employment assumption, the jobs lost in one industry will be gained in another, and the ease with which this structural change will occur depends upon the extent of frictions and rigidities in factor markets. This article is concerned with the relation between offshoring and demand-deficient unemployment. It uses a small-open-economy macro model to study the consequences of offshoring when output is demand-constrained and full employment is a special case. In an otherwise standard model in the tradition of John Maynard Keynes and Michal Kalecki, offshoring is introduced as labor-saving import-using technical change. The model economy combines two factors of production – domestic labor and imports – to produce a good that can be consumed and invested domestically or exported. Equilibrium output depends on domestic expenditure, which is a function of the wage bill and profits, and on foreign expenditure, which is a function of the real exchange rate. Labor demand follows from goods market equilibrium. It will be shown that offshoring creates unemployment in the model economy if the loss of domestic labor income reduces domestic demand to a greater extent than the improvement in international price competitiveness raises foreign demand. A given employment level can be sustained only if the price elasticity of export demand is high – otherwise offshoring creates unemployment. If firms use the cost advantages gained by offshoring to raise markups, rather than to lower prices, offshoring reduces employment and domestic demand unambiguously. The model intends to illuminate a facet of the German economy from 1995 to 2005, Germany’s “sick man period”. During that time period, Germany maintained world market shares in manufacturing trade while most high-income countries lost market shares and emerging markets gained. The relatively strong export performance represents a foreign demand injection; a foreign trade multiplier process, it could be argued, should have generated robust income and expenditure growth. But the macroeconomic performance of the German economy was poor by historical standards and poor in comparison with other high-income countries, and unemployment remained high throughout the sick man period. The coexistence of export boom and near stagnation suggests that some kind of demand leakage was counteracting the foreign demand injection. Offshoring is a candidate explanation. A high share of foreign value added in the value of exports implies that a country’s export growth can be decoupled to a considerable degree from its aggregate income and employment growth (Timmer et al. 2013). A rising share of foreign value added in domestic production implies that income and employment may stagnate even as gross exports and domestic demand are growing. Offshoring increases the share of foreign value added in domestic production; offshoring can potentially contribute to an explanation of the sick man of Europe. The literature has modeled offshoring as trade in inputs (Jones 2000), trade in factor services (Bhagwati et al. 2004), or trade in tasks (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008). Most models include two factors of production – high-skilled labor and low-skilled labor – and embody the assumption that real wages adjust to clear factor markets. With net effects on aggregate employment ruled out by assumption, the primary object of study is the reward of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor. Full-employment trade models have been amended by the inclusion of labor market imperfections that give rise to frictional unemployment. Davidson et al. (1999) introduce Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search-and-matching frictions in a Heckscher-Ohlin model, and Helpman and Itskhoki (2010) introduce the same type of frictions in a heterogeneous-firm model that builds on Melitz (2003).Footnote 1 A research question in this branch of literature is whether the presence of labor market imperfections alters some of the propositions that emanate from frictionless trade models. A second question concerns the impact of trade on the natural rate of unemployment. The models, it should be noted, assume that in the absence of frictions, the natural rate of unemployment would be zero, with or without international trade. Trade may influence the natural rate of unemployment because labor market frictions vary by region or sector, and trade-initiated structural change alters the “weights” of regions or sectors in the aggregate economy. This article has a different focus and studies a type of unemployment that does not originate in the labor market; it studies under what conditions offshoring leads to demand-deficient unemployment. The article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents empirical evidence supporting the case that German firms were offshoring production to a greater extent than firms in other high-income countries. Section 3 presents a standard Keynes-Kalecki model and adds labor-saving import-using technical change to it. Section 4 explains the results, whereas the derivations are in the Appendix A. Section 5 discusses the connection between the model and the German experience in the sick man period.",2

Its impact is visible, not least, in the shifting employment and value added shares of the different sectors of the economy. In the early phases of economic growth, the expansion of the industrial sector dominates (at the expense of an agricultural sector shrinking to minor significance). But its dominance is soon contested by the service sector. In fact, by the end of the twentieth century, there is no advanced economy in which the service sector has not absorbed the largest share of employment and value added (see, e.g., Schettkat 2007). This transformation – often described as the rise of the “service economy” – has since long been noted and addressed in economics (see, e.g., Fourastié 1952, Chenery 1960, Kuznets 1971, Pasinetti 1993). Nonetheless, the causes and contingencies are still not entirely clear. An explanation that is frequently cited goes back to Baumol (1967) who identified a “cost disease” in the service sector and attributed it to a lower productivity growth in that sectors. In a nutshell he argued as follows (see, e.g., Nordhaus 2008). Let the productivity of labor in the industrial sector increase faster than in the service sector. Wages in the industrial sector are then likely to rise. If the labor market is sufficiently competitive to prevent the wage levels in the two sectors from drifting apart, labor costs per unit of output in the service sector increase relative to those in the industrial sector. As a consequence, the price level of services increases relative to that of industrial products. Provided the rising prices of services do not induce a strong substitution of industrial products for services, the paradoxical result is that the sector with the lower productivity gains grows more in terms of the value added than the sector with the higher productivity increases. At the same time, relatively more jobs are maintained or generated (as a result of economic growth) in producing services rather than in industrial production so that the employment share of the service sector also goes up. This explanation is supported by several empirical observations (Baumol et al. 1985). Productivity differentials between the sectors and corresponding wage cost differentials per unit of output indeed grew over time. Despite a significant increase of the relative price level of services, a large-scale substitution of services by industrial products did not take place. Under these conditions it is not surprising that the employment share of the service sector grew. Because of the inflated relative prices of services the value added share of the service economy must also grow (Henriques and Kander 2010, Baily and Bosworth 2014). The question left open is why there are productivity differentials between the sectors in the first place. To explain the differentials one can refer to the sectors’ strongly differing capital intensity which is ultimately a consequence of the sectors’ production technology. Industrial production involves the transformation and relocation of materials to a large extent at a mass production scale. This requires relatively more machinery and other equipment per unit of output than the production of services. However, the sectors’ differing capital requirements are intimately connected to another feature of their production technologies by which they differ a lot, namely their energetic requirements. As convincingly argued by Georgescu-Roegen (1971) with reference to the second law of entropy, an exclusive focus on capital would ignore that industrial production processes are fundamentally dependent on the use of relatively cheap, non-anthropogenic energy. For most of the production taking place in the service sector this is not true, a fact reflected in the significant difference of the sectors’ energy/output ratios. The question thus arises what role the energetic differences between the sectors’ production technologies play for the inter-sectorial productivity differentials and, hence, for the rise of the service economy. The present paper is devoted to a discussion of this question. Focus is on a period in the twentieth century during which the service sector in the U.S. gained its present dominance over the other sectors of the economy. Following Georgescu-Roegen’s plea that physical features and energetic constraints matter for understanding economic production processes we explore the energetic contingencies of this rise to dominance. In Section 2 we discuss the energetic differences between the sectors’ production technologies. They result in unequal incentives for the sectors to take advantage of the era of relatively cheap energy through substituting energy for increasingly more costly labor inputs. With these considerations in mind we briefly review in Section 3 the empirics of the rise of the service economy in the U.S. in the years from 1970 to 2005. During this period there were no significant policy interventions yet, addressing the climate change effects of national energy consumption. Moreover, the U.S. economy experienced a comparatively stable phase of growth. These conditions only changed substantially with the Kyoto climate protection protocol entering into force in 2005 – leading to a first commitment period 2008–2012 – and the financial crisis in 2008, respectively (both likely to disrupt the circumstances under which sectorial change had taken place before). In Section 4 we introduce a simple sectorial production function model. It serves to specify a testable hypothesis, namely that during the period 1970–2005 the sectors’ unequal energetic substitution incentives correspond to differences in the extent to which productivity changes can be attributed to a changing energy/labor ratio. In Section 5 we describe the data and the method we use to test the hypothesis. Section 6 summarizes the test results and discusses some insights that may be drawn from the analysis regarding the future of the service economy. Section 7 presents the conclusions.",15

While there is an extensive stream of literature exploring the factors of recombinatorial success at the firm level (Kogut and Zander 1992; Savino et al. 2017), the influence of knowledge recombination on the technology knowledge base and its evolution over time is so far not well understood. It is well known that technologies evolve along their knowledge base, which itself shows certain dynamics and evolves over time (Malerba and Orsenigo 1996, 2000). Besides internal knowledge accumulation, the in-flow of knowledge from sources external to a technology is crucial for its evolution in terms of initiating, redirecting and refreshing the knowledge accumulation processes (Dosi and Nelson 2013). The way external knowledge diffuses into a technology, the source from which it comes, and the type of actors involved appear to be core determinants of that technology’s further development (Grant 1996; Dosi and Nelson 2013). The evolution of a technology can be stylized along a life cycle. Anderson and Tushman (1990) propose a cyclical model of a technological life cycle (TLC). The model distinguishes four phases, an era of ferment, the emergence of a dominant design, an era of incremental change and a discontinuity, which restarts the cycle. This TLC model has been widely used to analyze technological development and is extended into various dimensions, for example covering the influence of cognitive factors (Kaplan and Tripsas 2008), specific phases (Murmann and Frenken 2006) or the level of granularity (Taylor and Taylor 2012). However, knowledge, the technology’s knowledge base and the influence of different types of knowledge along the TLC have been neglected from a theoretical and empirical perspective. While there is first empirical evidence that different kinds of knowledge matter along the technological development (Krafft et al.2011, 2014a), no theoretical foundation has been provided explaining the underlying factors and processes. The aim of the paper is to close this gap by extending the Anderson and Tushman (1990) model proposing how recombination of different kinds of knowledge shapes a technology over its life cycle. The extension states that in each TLC phase different sources of knowledge are required for successful recombination and technological evolution. The proposed extension of the Anderson and Tushman (1990) model is empirically tested for two technologies, namely, wind power (WP) and photovoltaics (PV). In particular the development in Germany for the period from 1970 until 2006 is analyzed. After the oil crisis in the 1970s both technologies were considered as means to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and to mitigate climate change (Jacobsson and Johnson 2000). Since then, severe effort has been put forward to enhance the technologies and both are nowadays competitive with incumbent technologies (REN21 2015). These makes WP and PV ideal cases to analyze how technologies evolve and mature over their life cycle. The period covers several TLC phases and allows us to draw conclusions how knowledge recombination patterns change over time. Patent data is used to proxy the technological knowledge base, while inventors and their inventive experience are used to characterize different sources of knowledge. Patent forward citations are taken as recombinatorial success and proxy the contribution to the knowledge base (Carpenter et al.1981; Harhoff et al. 1999, 2003, Jaffe and de Rassenfosse 2017). Negative binomial regressions are used to estimate the effect of different kinds of knowledge embedded in the inventors on the patents contribution to the knowledge base. Regressions are estimated for the overall period as well as for the different TLC phases. Furthermore, rolling-window regressions are used as a novel approach to capture dynamics on a fine grained level over time. Results show that different sources of knowledge matter for technological evolution in general but differently in the phases of the TLC, by and large in line with the proposed theoretical model. For the overall technological development, inventors who possess specialized knowledge are most influential. In WP also, de-novo inventors matter, those who induce knowledge that has not been used before, as well as inventors who were previously active in unrelated technologies. Along the phases of the TLC, the era of ferment in WP is mainly shaped by inventors with unrelated knowledge but relevance shifts over time towards specialized and de-novo inventors. In PV, the era of ferment is shaped by several types of inventors, but here also a shift towards specialized inventors takes place over time. The rolling window regressions provide a more detailed picture and show how different kinds of inventors and their knowledge is also changing inside the phases. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of a technology’s knowledge base and the knowledge dynamics that take place along the TLC. The understanding how knowledge matter in different stages of a technology is crucial for policy maker to implement relevant policies and support the relevant actors, as well as for management to pursue an appropriate R&D strategy. Furthermore, the theoretical contribution by the extension of the Anderson and Tushman (1990) model provides a general framework to understand technological evolution and the respective knowledge dynamics, as well as the influence of knowledge from different origins and its integration success into the knowledge base. This complements previous work and allows a detailed approach to understand recombination and technological development along the TLC. From an methodological point of view, the utilization of previous patents of inventors to distinguish different sources of knowledge allows us to analyze long term developments, which cannot be captured, for example, by surveys (Conti et al. 2014). Additionally, rolling-window regressions prove to be a useful approach to shed light on dynamics in technology evolution. In the following, Section 2 reviews the literature about knowledge base, knowledge recombination and their relevance for technological evolution and integrates these concepts into the TLC model, providing the theoretical framework for the empirical analysis. Section 3 introduces WP and PV as the technologies under consideration and discusses how they develop over time. Section 4 presents the data, econometric approach and the results. The last Section discusses findings and concludes.",12

In this sense, the potentialities of biotechnology, nanotechnology, cyber physical systems or environmental technologies (among others) have been investigated in order to establish if they constitute technological systems capable of driving great changes at innovation trajectories, learning sources and productive structures (Linstone 2004; Bainbridge and Roco 2006; Coccia 2010; Daim et al. 2006; Jazdi 2014; Colombo et al. 2017; etc.). These debates usually put the public sector in a central place, since it has historically played a very important role in the emergence of new technologies, from the promotion of variety (e.g. financing basic R&D), through the generation of technology selection mechanisms (e.g., regulations, public procurement), and consolidating and accelerating technological trajectories (Cimoli et al. 2006). For example, mission-oriented policies towards defense goals carried out by US Department of Defense during the second post-war period are often highlighted, especially since they led later to various spin-offs and spillovers in non-military sectors with special relevance in those of medium and high technology (Chiang 1991; Ruttan 2006; Mowery and Rosenberg 1999; Mazzucato and Penna 2016). In this regard, mission-oriented policies, although motivated in coping with social challenges, were grounded in their capacity to expand industrial capacity and competitiveness in a wide range of activities. Defense, health, energy, among other sectors have been exposed (in different times) to challenges that justified strong interventions oriented to the configuring of new technological systems, which were drivers of competitiveness, growth and development (Ergas 1987; Sampat 2012; Mowery 2009, 2012; Foray et al. 2012; Mazzucato 2015; UNCTAD 2017; among others). However, possibilities of cross-fertilization and knowledge spreading between sectors are not static, but depend on the technological context. Ruttan (2006) argued that, while defense and defense-related research, development and procurement in the current context are unlikely to generate new technological systems able to expand national competitiveness,Footnote 1 molecular biology and biotechnology are emerging as a new source of technological opportunities in the early decades of the twenty-first century. Some authors have also perceived a decline in the capacity of the defense technology system in its innovative potential (Yudken 2010; Steinbock 2014; Sempere 2017), while other authors have postulated that the health technology system is the key to the shaping of a new paradigm centered on biotechnologies and health equipment, among others (Lipsey et al. 2005; Linstone 2004; Linstone and Devezas 2012; Lavarello and Jelinsky 2017; among others). These debates take place simultaneously with the recent emergence of works that vindicate the role of the state in technological policies and point to the need to “return” to mission-oriented policies, now around the new social challenges of the twenty-first century, many of them linked to health, such as the treatment of diseases without a cure (Swedish EU Presidency 2009; European Commission 2011; Foray et al. 2012; Mazzucato 2015, 2018; Mazzucato and Penna 2016; UNCTAD 2017; UCL 2018). Based on evolutionary works, in this paper we state that technological systems are characterized by a high degree of technological relatedness, which is positively associated with the possibility of a system to generate variety through the recombination of knowledge from a common base. Therefore, a common base of knowledge may act as a channel through which competitiveness spread out the productive structure, extending the competitiveness from one sector closely related to the technological system to another with a different degree of proximity (Hidalgo et al. 2007; Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009). Following this statement, this work aims to analyze correlation in sectoral competitiveness of countries between defense (and health) technological system(s) and related products. Based on international trade data, and different measures of proximity and relatedness, we compare defense and health technological systems regarding their potential of generating related variety, as well as variety on high and medium technology products. We estimate variety from health and defense groups of products on two different targets: first, on related products, following Hidalgo et al.’s (2007) and Saviotti and Frenken’s (2006) definitions; second, on high (and medium) technology products (Lall 2001), trying to grasp the effect of those technological systems on technologically dynamic products. This will be assessed in a trade panel data with information for 60 countries and 17 years.Footnote 2 The structure of the work is as follows. In the next section, a theoretical discussion about different dimensions of variety generation processes is developed, emphasizing the usefulness of technological system concept to explain sectoral trajectories as variety in an evolutionary framework. In the third section, we present the two empirical analyses made to answer the research questions and hypotheses. In the fourth section, we express the conclusions.",

The transition raises many questions which have to be addressed in order to help overcome the uncertainties that stand in the way of the change process. One of those uncertainties concerns the macroeconomic opportunities and risks associated with the energy transition. It raises the question which companies will provide the technology and which countries will benefit from it. To add to this debate this paper will analyze the development of the global wind energy industry. Its aim is to provide insights into the industrial development of this sector and its drivers for the discussion on the design of framework conditions. The main theory that this paper will refer to is the industry life cycle theory (ILC) (Klepper 1997). It has been used for the empirical analysis of the development of various industries producing capital goods as well as consumer goods (see also Gort and Klepper 1982, Klepper 1996, Agarwal et al. 2002, Giachetti and Marchi 2010) and services (Menhart et al. 2004). The hypothesis that motivates the work on this paper is that the ILC of the wind energy industry might differ to the industries analyzed so far as its market creation and development have been strongly dependent on political support instruments and have therefore not been driven by innovation alone (see chapter 2). Changes in support policies for wind energy technologies due to varying political interests led to expansion paths that were unstable beyond what can be expected for capital goods markets. Therefore, the main research question that this paper wants to address is if the development of an industry that is marked by instability in demand on national level differs to the characteristics described by Klepper (1997) in the ILC. Since this question is quite complex, it can be divided into two aspects. The first one addresses the geographic delineation, which leads to the question whether the national or the global market development was more relevant for the evolution of the wind energy industry. The other aspect is the relevance of support policies in the development of the wind industry. It raises the question if RES policies have had a significant impact on the development of the wind industry through their impact on the market development. Looking at the evolution of wind energy for the production of electricity three different development paths can be observed. One is the utilization of small wind turbines for self-supply; another is the use of onshore wind energy with the priority to feed the electricity into the grid, and the third is the utilization of offshore wind energy. Historically the use of onshore wind for the grid has evolved from the strand of self-supply turbines. However, in the last few years a new line of turbine manufacturers has evolved which focuses on wind turbines for self-supply. Regarding the offshore wind development a similar picture can be drawn. New manufacturers appeared with the utilization of wind energy offshore alongside large incumbent onshore wind companies. The relevance of existing manufacturers in the offshore market strongly differs to the one onshore. Therefore this paper follows the view that the development of wind energy technology should be considered as the evolution of three different trajectories (Dosi 1982). The analysis in this paper will focus on the strand of onshore wind energy for the grid but will also give some insights into the offshore development. Chapter 2 will give an introduction of the relevant theories and findings for this paper. Chapter 3 introduces the empirical data and methodology used in this paper and assesses their relevance. The results of the data analysis are presented in chapter 4. In the final chapter conclusions will be drawn and the need for further research will be indicated.",

As shown in Fig. 1, a common trend seems to emerge. Independently of the socio-economic welfare model,Footnote 1 labor productivity growth in the European countriesFootnote 2 in the four panels has displayed a decreasing or stagnating pattern.Footnote 3 Rate of growth of labor productivity (moving average over three years), selected countries. (See Figure 2 in the appendix for some descriptive evidence on non-European countries, which substantiate the claim of a worldwide productivity slowdown.) Source: own elaboration on Eurostat data The main purpose of this article is to provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact of some major socio-economic phenomena on the dynamics of labor productivity. We aim to show both theoretically and by means of an econometric model applied to EU countries that four main channels contribute to explaining the evolution of our variable of interest. First would be the speed of investment (measured by the rate of investment growth), which incorporates innovation and favors an expansion of aggregate demand and an increase of LP (in the sense of Kaldor and Schumpeter). We will discuss the role of institutionsFootnote 4 in fostering innovation; in this sense we build a bridge between Schumpeterian and Kaldorian insights. More specifically, Kaldor’s ideas – and in particular his technical progress function – are recalled, to stress the importance of investment in physical assets as a vector of technological advancement. However, the productivity stagnation commenced, in different countries, a few years earlier than the slowdown in capital accumulation. Hence, the latter cannot be the causa causans of the former, but more a reinforcing factor for an already underway process. For this reason, we look for other co-determinants of the phenomenon we are trying to explain. The second channel is the speed of investment in Research and Development (R&D), which allows for the creation of new ideas and shows the “dynamism of a society” in the sense of Kaldor, with positive effects on LP. The third channel is the deregulation of the labor market and the increase of temporary employment, along with stagnant wages, all of which encourage labor-intensive strategies by firms, with low value-added and low productivity gains, following the Sylos Labini approach. The fourth channel is the direction of structural change. If this takes place in services industries experiencing Baumol’s disease, which suffer from specific obstacles to innovation and tend to be intensive in unskilled labor, there is little room for productivity gains and labor productivity is likely to slow down. Therefore, we argue, structural change needs to be governed and channeled with proper incentives both in the labor market and in the investment sector. Policies and institutions are crucial for this objective. Innovation and technical progress take place within an institutional framework able to create the proper incentives for agents to invest, risk and interact. This framework also needs to adapt to the new technological systems that have meanwhile emerged. Over the last three to four decades, many advanced economies have experienced significant changes in their productive structures and their industrial strategies.Footnote 5 While the post-WWII period of expansion – qualified by some scholars as “The Golden Age of Capitalism” (Marglin and Schor 1990) – was characterized by the manufacturing industry exerting the leading role, in more recent years a massive shift in employment has been taking place in most Western countries. Indeed, a steady decline in the share of workers employed in manufacturing and a transition towards the service sector is a well-known feature of contemporary capitalism.Footnote 6 Additionally, as highlighted, for example, in Szirmai (2012) and Rodrik (2016), such deindustrializationFootnote 7 trends are similarly observable in developing countries, with a relative exception being presented by Asian industrial exporters. In the remainder of this article, we will try to explore channels that operate through both the demand and the supply side of the economy, with a special focus being placed on labor market flexibilization and transformations in the productive structure of the economies involved. In Sections 2–4, we will conduct a selected review of the literature to try to uncover possible explanations for the slowdown of productivity growth that is being experienced by most European countries. The paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we explore the possible threats to the dynamics of labor productivity that can arise from an ungoverned process of structural change. To do this, we draw first on the classic works of Baumol and Kaldor, which are then enriched with more recent contributions that outline the heterogeneous nature of different service industries. Section 3 establishes a link between labor flexibility and productivity, claiming that a certain degree of rigidity in labor market institutions can be beneficial as it deters the adoption of labor-intensive strategies and pushes, through creative destruction, non-innovators out of the market. Section 4 discusses the role of institutions in fostering innovation and investment and tries to find the meeting point between Keynes, Schumpeter and Kaldor. In Section 5, we submit the main ideas of Sections 2–4 to empirical scrutiny by means of a panel data analysis conducted on a sample of 25 European countriesFootnote 8 for the period 1995–2016.

In particular, the establishment of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the introduction of the Euro had raised high hopes for rapid convergence among member states (e.g. Blanchard and Giavazzi2002). Until the financial crisis of 2007/2008, a series of empirical patterns were indeed pointing towards a process of convergence: increasing integration in terms of trade and investment had resulted in a catching-up process of Eastern European countries (Goedemé and Collado 2016), the integration of financial markets had reached unexpected heights (Baldwin et al. 2015; Hale and Obstfeld 2016), and the successive harmonization of environmental legislation, labor standards and consumer protection regulation had contributed to a partial unification of regulatory environments within Europe. Until the crisis started, most economists and policy-makers therefore reckoned that the Eurozone as well as the wider part of the European Union were undergoing a process of widespread convergence. This belief was strengthened by the fact that major macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment, economic growth, per-capita-income and interest rates, were indeed converging in pre-crisis times (Gräbner et al. 2017), which was widely interpreted as evidence for overall economic progress within Europe (Giavazzi and Spaventa 2010). However, even before the crisis, the simultaneous divergence of current account balances had already indicated that the convergence of certain macroeconomic indicators might not reflect long-term structural changes to the benefit of all EU countries (Simonazzi et al. 2013; Storm and Naastepad 2015b; Gräbner et al. 2017). Rather, the observed catching-up process of periphery countries was in large part driven by expansions of private indebtedness and by the corresponding emergence of large-scale housing bubbles in some countries (e.g. Storm and Naastepad 2016; Heimberger and Kapeller 2017). Capital flows and private debt expansion were fostered by the harmonization of interest rates across Eurozone countries and the corresponding regulatory integration of financial markets (Baldwin et al. 2015; Celi et al. 2018). However, after the financial crisis, the debt-driven growth-models of the Eurozone’s periphery countries quickly turned out to be unsustainable: the underlying structural polarization between core and periphery countries became apparent (Gräbner et al. 2017), as the catch-up tendencies observed after the turn of the century had merely obfuscated the emerging structural polarization among EU countries, and large parts of the convergence process eventually proved to be unsustainable. In this paper, we aim to rationalize the complex dynamics of convergence, divergence and polarization in Europe with reference to theories of path-dependency in international trade (Myrdal 1958; Krugman 1991), where past “success breeds further success and failure begets more failure” which leads, “to a ‘polarisation process’ which inhibits the growth of such [manufacturing, the authors] activities in some areas and concentrates them in others” (Kaldor 1980, p. 88). Theoretically, we argue that European countries follow different developmental trajectories, which are shaped by mechanisms that give rise to path-dependency (Dobusch and Kapeller 2013), such as the presence of increasing returns to scale (in manufacturing) and network externalities that arise from differences in technological capabilities (Arthur 1989) as well as rules and standards that can only be changed at high costs (Heinrich 2014). We take the increase in economic and financial openness and international economic integration as a conceptual starting point for exploring convergence and divergence in Europe’s more recent past. Using data for 26 EU countries covering the time period from 1960 to 2016, we employ the local projections method proposed by Jordà (2005) to estimate how several macroeconomic variables have responded to the openness shock brought about by European economic integration. Based on our regression results, we use a hierarchical cluster analysis that points us toward a taxonomy of developmental trajectories across European countries. In this empirical context, we also check whether we are able to identify systematic structural differences in the response of EU economies to increasing economic and financial openness. We can preview the results as follows: our findings suggest the existence of four structurally different developmental trajectories prevailing in the European Union. While large parts of the debate so far have focused on the different developments in Eurozone core countries (called ‘northern export-oriented capitalisms’ in the political economy literature; see e.g. Iversen et al. 2016) and Eurozone periphery countries (debt-led Southern European capitalisms, e.g. Johnston and Regan 2016Behringer and van Treeck 2017), we propose a typology of four country groups. This typology consists of core and periphery countries, financial hubs and catching-up countries. Our findings stress that – due to different growth models operating within the EU (e.g. Stockhammer 2015; Gräbner et al. 2017) – we can neither expect convergence to occur endogenously, nor can we hope to develop adequate policy conclusions without taking the structural differences between these four country groups seriously. By developing our typology of European countries, we contribute to various streams of literature that make use of such typologies. First, the debate in macroeconomics focuses on whether country groups that vary in terms of their growth models have been affected differently by European (monetary) integration (e.g. Stockhammer 2015, 2016; Gräbner et al. 2017). Second, the comparative political economy literature analyzes whether different varieties of European capitalism and their specific sets of institutions have been equally able to cope with increasing trade and financial openness (e.g. Iversen et al. 2016; Baccaro and Pontusson 2016; Bohle 2018; Regan 2017; Vermeiren 2017; Johnston and Regan 2018). Third, structuralist scholars have studied how the uneven distribution of income and technologies as well as the asymmetric power relations between core and periphery reinforce existing inequalities (e.g. Simonazzi et al. 2013; Cimoli and Porcile 2016; Celi et al. 2018). Fourth, the innovation literature engages with the role of technological capabilities in shaping path dependent trajectories of European countries by focusing on the relevance of non-price competitiveness and sectoral composition (e.g. Dosi et al. 2015; Storm and Naastepad 2015b; Baccaro and Benassi 2017). In our analysis, we bring together these four strands of the literature by studying the effects of increasing economic openness on macroeconomic developments as well as by inspecting trends and changes in the sectoral composition of exports in EU countries in the process of European economic integration. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: the next section aligns our contribution with the existing literature. We proceed by studying the impact of increasing European economic integration on macroeconomic developments in the European Union (Section 3). Our results suggest that country-specific characteristics in the response to the openness shock variable have to be taken into account. Section 4 builds upon this observation and provides both empirical and theoretical arguments for the co-existence of currently diverging developmental trajectories in Europe. Section 5 exploits this taxonomy and shows that the four country groups have indeed responded differently to the openness shock of European integration. Section 6 concludes by suggesting policies that take the various developmental trajectories into account and are geared towards achieving technological and economic convergence in Europe.",20

M. Applegate,Adam Lampert,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Firms are the medium through which individuals participate in the productive aspect of an economy, and in aggregate compose the domain of business that is one of the three pillars of macroeconomic theory. Despite the central role in a myriad of economic questions, an individual firm is classically modeled as a black box that essentially serves as a vehicle for a production function. This formulation is unsatisfying to anyone interested in understanding the macroeconomic implications of firm dynamics where heterogeneity in firm characteristics is important, firms interact with each other and dynamics are endogenous. Firm dynamics determine the relative proportions of different size firm populations, and these proportions are linked to macroeconomic questions, such as what types of firms provide the most employment (Birch 1981; Haltiwanger et al. 2013), which types innovate (Acs and Audretsch 1987; Hathaway and Litan 2014) and whether a large variety of firm types promotes social well-being (Hannan and Freeman 1993). Understanding the drivers of firm dynamics is therefore of importance not only to academics but also to management professionals and policy makers. Early models exploring firm dynamics focused on empirical firm size distributions and the equations that described them. In 1931, Robert Gibrat examined firm plant sizes across France and derived a logarithmic relationship between firm population and size where firm growth was in proportion to its size. This became popularly known as Gibrat’s Law of Proportional Effect. Later work built on this law and produced variants that modified birth, growth and mortality parameters (Kalecki 1945; Simon and Bonini 1958; Mansfield 1962). The Gibrat distribution and its variants fit the larger end of the firm size spectrum well but failed to adequately predict the distribution of small firm sizes, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 where the Gibrat distribution is mapped against empirical firm size data from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) database. The BDS dataset is an aggregated longitudinal dataset with complete representation across all firm size categories.Footnote 1 Firm sizes are organized into 12 categories based on numbers of employees: 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 99, 100 to 249, 250 to 499, 500 to 999, 1000 to 2499, 2500 to 4999, 5000 to 9999 and 10000+. Econometric work attempting to clarify these breakdowns in the Gibrat assumption (Hall 1986; Dunne et al. 1988) found statistical regularities in the empirical data, namely that survival increases with size and growth decreases with size. Smaller firms fail more often and grow faster than larger firms. These results appear to hold regardless of how size is defined, whether by output, plant size or employees (Sutton 1997; deWit 2005).
 BDS Statistics for Average Size. The Business Dynamics Database (BDS) firm size distribution averaged over all industries and all years from 1977 to 2014 is shown as solid blue line with a dashed line describing the classic Gibrat distribution, and a dotted line the Zipf distribution. Note the ‘hump’ toward the left hand side of the empirical distribution More recent size distribution work proposes alternative distributions such as the Zipf (Axtell 2001; Bottazzi et al. 2015), Rank (Podobnik et al. 2010), log-log OLS (Di Giovanni et al. 2011) and Hill (Gabaix 2009). These distributions are considered valid only above a minimum firm size and don’t attempt to explain the distributions at the smaller end of the size spectrum, in part due to data collection methods that focus on larger firms. Our use of the BDS dataset with representation across all firm sizes should mitigate this issue, as well as the fact that we are not seeking a statistical fit to the empirical data. Of particular interest is the ‘hump’ between the second and sixth size category presented by the empirical data, which is unexplained by the Gibrat or related distributions. A more descriptive exploration of firm dynamics arises out of the management literature, where populations of firms are considered in the context of industries and firm dynamics considered as industry life cycles. This industry life cycle work identified regularities in behavior within populations of various sized firms such as shakeouts, where a large number of entrants falls to a small number of persistent firms, explained as the process of winnowing excess capacity and settling on a minimum efficient scale, as well as a positive correlation between firm entry and exit rates within an industry, known as turbulenceFootnote 2Klepper and Miller (1995), Klepper (1996), Klepper (1997), and Haltiwanger et al. (2013). This industrial dynamics theory considers competition as monopolistic, an imperfect form of competition as understood classically, whereby firm offerings are differentiated and surviving firms’ products and services address the needs of a particular niche. But there also exists a heterogeneous institutionalFootnote 3 competitive advantage enjoyed by established firms by way of supply chain relationships, established brands and legal protections, which is not explicitly addressed in these studies. These institutional advantages create barriers to entry for new firms (Bain 1954; Stigler 1964; Caves and Porter 1977; Demsetz 1982). Meanwhile, organizational ecologists viewed firm dynamics as determined by processes of competition (Sleuwaegen and Goedhuys 1998). Hannan and Freeman (1977), in particular, considered questions of firm dynamics to be “fundamentally ecological in nature”. Organizational ecologists paid considerable attention to the institutional setting in which firms complete (Nugent and Nabli 1992; Hannan and Carroll 1992; Hannan and Freeman 1993). Firm growth and survival depend on the competitive characteristics of other firms as well as the institutional settings that determine such factors as access to capital and the nature of competitive advantage. Generally speaking, “If processes generating variation and retention are present in a system and that system is subject to selection processes, evolution will occur” (Aldrich 1999). In this view, firms are adaptive entities that respond, according to their unique characteristics, to the environments in which they operate (Nelson and Winter 1982; Beinhocker 2006; Ebeling and Feistel 2011). Firms that don’t adapt will fail due to institutional and competitive selection pressures.Footnote 4 Hannan and Freeman theorized that firms don’t necessarily adapt to changing conditions due to the difficulties for large established organizations to change quickly, a quality described as structural inertia (Hannan and Freeman 1984). Larger firms may enjoy institutional competitive advantage, but smaller firms are more agile when it comes to adapting to new market opportunities because they are less inertial. Small firms also tend to have less available capital than larger firms to pursue innovations, but they also enjoy more attention from external investors, and the degree to which small firms can take advantage of their agility depends on the availability of this external investment. Venture capital typically funds startup firms for five years, at which point investment falls off dramatically as investors turn their attention toward exit strategies and realizing returns (Hall and Lerner 2010; Feld and Mendelson 2013; Gompers and Lerner 2001).Footnote 5 Venture capital chases startups because they have potential for higher growth through innovation and market capture than incumbent firms.Footnote 6 Putting this ecological picture together with the observed size-specific characteristics previously described, we could consider firms of various sizes as unique species with size-specific behaviors and characteristics, all competing within an institutional context. The outcome of these competitive dynamics produces a particular firm population distribution. Specifically, larger firms have a stronger competitive advantage, both through economies of scale and institutional barriers to entry, but are less able to adapt to changing environments due to structural inertia. They have lower mortality and growth rates than smaller firms. Smaller firms are better at adapting to change because they are less inertial, but the degree to which they can innovate is dependent on external investment. In summary, a brief inventory of the empirical regularities described gives us a list of seven stylized facts: 
 Firm survival increases with size (Dunne et al. 1988) Firm growth decreases with size (Hall 1986) A new market will initially generate a large numbers of small firms that fail (shakeout) (Klepper and Miller 1995) When mortality increases, more firms enter the market (turbulence) (Klepper 1997) Larger firms enjoy a competitive advantage over smaller firms (Demsetz 1982) Smaller firms attract more outside investment than larger firms (Feld and Mendelson 2013) Smaller firms are more agile than larger firms because they have less structural inertia (Hannan and Freeman 1984). The last two items are of particular interest, because taken together they suggest multiple flavors of competition at play in firm dynamics: institutional competitive advantage in established markets and agility in capturing new markets. Our premise of established firms operating under comparative advantages and newer firms innovating is reflective of the early Schumpeterian or entrepreneurial technology regime described by Winter (1984) and demonstrated econometrically by Breschi et al. (2000). We postulate that smaller firms are particularly susceptible to institutional effects, such as barriers to entry and investment incentives, and a model that directly addresses these realities will provide useful insights into firm dynamics, better explain how those dynamics affect the distribution of firms at the small end of the spectrum, and serve as an experimental sandbox to explore how modifications to the institutional context that modulate the selection pressures and innovation opportunities may affect firm size distributions. Given the emphasis on competition in the standard narratives of firm dynamics, combined with the growing understanding that firm size distributions are not fully explained by of market selection forces, minimum efficient scales, relative efficiencies or profitability (Dosi 2005; Dosi and Nelson 2010), we believe ecological modeling of firm dynamics is underutilized. Is there an ecological analogy that would apply to the multilevel competition description of firm population dynamics described above? We believe we have found such an analogy in David Tilman’s spatially structured competition-colonization dynamics (Hastings 1980; Tilman 1994). Tilman describes a Wisconsin prairie populated by different species of grass. One particular species has superior nitrogen-fixing ability, so tends to overrun areas populated by species with lesser ability. But all grass organisms have a mortality rate so regions of empty patches are continuously emerging, which can be populated by lesser-fixating grass species. The population dynamics on the prairie therefore consist of empty patches colonized by lesser fixating species that were eventually overrun by superior fixating species, while new space regularly becomes available for colonization through the deaths of individual plants. In the context of firm dynamics, a market could be analogous to a prairie, and larger firms with superior competitive advantage will take over the marketshare populated by smaller firms. Meanwhile, smaller firms will populate new marketshare (empty prairie in our analogy) before larger species because they are more agile. The degree to which they can populate empty space is governed by investment. Large firms excel at competition, while small firms excel at colonization, and we make use of the distinction between the types of competitive dynamics identified previously. The remainder of this paper will further develop the competition-colonization firm dynamics model with appropriate modifications. We will then propose a parameterization scheme based on empirical US firm size data and demonstrate that our model fit is superior in the small firm region than other distribution fits. We will then use the model to conduct experiments by altering a subset of the institutional parameters and observing the effects on firm size distributions.",

In particular, I look at the practice of modelling expectations using evolutionary schemes to allow agents to choose among a limited set of alternative rules or heuristics. I will highlight possible perils of such practice and then draw a comparison with another common way of modelling agents’ expectations under bounded rationality, namely, adaptive learning. Rational expectations (RE) represents a powerful way of closing and solving an economic model but they impose strong requirements on agents in terms of information acquisition and computational capabilities. In recent years, a growing number of studies have replaced RE with more realistic ways of modelling agents’ expectations and their dynamics. One popular method to model bounded rationality is adaptive learning, by which agents are treated as econometricians who repeatedly adjust the parameter values in their model economy based on previous forecast errors. Prominent examples are Sargent (1999), Evans et al. (2003, 2009) and, for an extensive treatise on methodology and applications, Evans and Honkapohja (2001). A second class of methods used to model the way agents revise their expectations over time relies on evolutionary dynamics applied to a predetermined set of heuristics. Agents are allowed to select among the available expectation formation rules on the basis of their relative performance. While adaptive learning can be interpreted to represent learning at the individual level, evolutionary dynamics on expectation formation rules better capture the idea of social learning, where agents tend to imitate strategies that are more successful in the population. Under adaptive learning, in fact, agents adapt their own forecast strategyFootnote 1 based on previous performance, as measured against actual outcomes; under evolutionary models, instead, agents adopt strategies (again, expectations formation rules) that have been relatively more successful in the population, i.e., the performance of which has been assessed and evaluated positively against other strategies. Under evolutionary dynamics, thus, the performance of a strategy is not evaluated against actual outcomes but only against the performance of other available strategies. A strategy can thus perform quite badly in absolute terms, but still outperform all other available strategies and prevail in a market. The two approaches, adaptive learning and evolutionary dynamics, have also been studied together in economic models: for example, Berardi (2015) combines evolutionary selection among heterogeneous classes of models with adaptive learning on the parameters of each model and finds that heterogeneous equilibria are possible but fragile; Branch and Evans (2006) propose the concept of misspecification equilibrium, where different underparameterized predictors are selected even in the limit under least-squares learning and dynamic predictor selection based on average profits; Guse (2010) considers a setting where agents can choose between a minimum state variable and a sunspot forecasting model and finds that, with an ad hoc cost to using the sunspot predictor, heterogeneity cannot be sustained under the combined evolutionary-adaptive learning dynamics. The relation between learning and evolutionary dynamics has also been studied extensively in game theory. Fudenberg and Levine (1998, ch. 3) derive replicator dynamics from models of individual learning while Borgers and Sarin (1997) show that, in a game theoretical framework, a learning model based on the reinforcement of strategies with higher payoff converges, in a continuous time limit, to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory. A key element to note is that, in these works, learning entails competition of strategies against each other, which differentiates crucially such learning mechanisms from adaptive learning. More generally, the relation between learning and evolution has been debated in biology for a long time: Sznajder et al. (2012) recently reviewed some of the literature concerning the so called Baldwin effect Baldwin (1896), i.e., the hypothesis that learning, by improving fitness, accelerates evolution. Closer to our field of investigation, Marimon (1993) considers a game theoretical framework and compares key properties of adaptive learning (adaptation, experimentation and inertia) with their counterparts in evolutionary dynamics (reproduction, mutation and conservation). An important difference between adaptive learning and evolutionary schemes as ways of modelling the evolution of expectations is that, in the first case, the researcher usually endows agents with a single forecasting model and then allows them to optimize the parameters in such a model through learning; in the second case, instead, the researcher selects a set of alternative forecasting models, and then allows agents to choose among this fixed set of rules based on their relative performance.Footnote 2Anufriev and Hommes (2012), for example,consider a fixed set of rules, or heuristics, available to agents and investigate how the switching between these rules can explain results from experimental data. I will argue that the coarse discretization of the beliefs space under evolutionary schemes can lead to the creation of artificial equilibria and thus to misleading conclusions about possible outcomes in an economy. Such equilibria can be stable under evolutionary schemes, though they disappear when the beliefs space is sufficiently expanded. From an empirical point of view, there seems to be quite a lot of dispersion in forecasts available through survey data (as seen, for example, from the Survey of Professional Forecasters). This means that households at any point in time have access, at least in principle, to a fairly large number of different predictors, represented by the different professional forecasters. Whether they actually take advantage of them, and whether any sort of convergence emerges among such predictors over time, are empirical questions that are beyond the scope of this paper. The aim of this paper is simply to point out the perils of artificially restricting, a priori, the set of available predictors to agents in a theoretical framework. Another important question that is outside the scope of this paper pertains to the best way to model expectations under bounded rationality, whether through adaptive learning, evolutionary dynamics or possibly other methods. The answer, I speculate, would probably be case dependent, as different schemes could provide a better approximation of how agents actually behave under different circumstances. One, for example, could imagine that, in competitive environments, where the pressure for improvement comes from the need to outperform competitors, evolutionary dynamics could do a better job at approximating the way beliefs are formed and updated over time by agents; in problems of individual decision making, instead, adaptive learning might be a superior modelling strategy, as agents are not competing against each other but are trying to do the best they can for themselves in “absolute” terms. Ultimately, this again seems to be an empirical question that can be settled only by empirical evidence. What I argue here is that it is important to understand the impact of using one or the other approach on the predictions that a model can deliver. The concept of evolutionary dynamics has been extensively applied in economics. In a seminal work, Brock and Hommes (1997) define the concept of adaptively rational equilibrium (ARE), in which agents adapt their beliefs over time by choosing from a finite set of different predictors according to a discrete logit model. They show how, in a simple cobweb model where agents can choose between rational (at a cost) and naive (free) expectations, highly irregular equilibrium prices can emerge. Building on this idea, Brock et al. (2005) introduce the concept of large type limit (LTL), describing the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous markets with many trader types. Applications of the LTL have been considered by Anufriev et al. (2013) and by Agliari et al. (2017): in both cases, from multiple steady states, the system moves to one unique steady state in the large type limit. This work will shed light on these results. In fact, in different settings, other studies - Aoki (2002) and Evstigneev et al. (2001) and Hens and Schenk-Hoppé (2005) - find that, as the number of strategies available to agents increases, heterogeneity in trading strategies tends to disappear. In related work, Evstigneev et al. (2006) find that only a rational market in which assets are evaluated by expected relative dividends is evolutionary stable. Similar to the LTL approach, Diks and Van der (2002) and Diks and van der (2003) propose a continuous beliefs system (CBS), where a continuum of strategies for forming beliefs are available to agents: while they are able to derive the limiting distributions for a number of performance measures, such distributions in fact degenerate into a point mass (and prices converge to the fundamental value) if agents are all allowed to choose the best possible predictor available. Again, the aim of this work is to understand such results more broadly. An application of the ARE concept to a New Keynesian macroeconomic model of inflation and output has been proposed by Agliari et al. (2017), showing how this way of modelling expectations can alter the conclusions in terms of stability and uniqueness of equilibrium compared to rational expectations. Branch and McGough (2016) find cycles and chaotic dynamics in a monetary model a la Lagos and Wright (2005), with traders switching between (costly) rational and (costless) adaptive predictors according to a discrete logit model. De Grauwe (2011) generates endogenous waves of optimism and pessimism (“animal spirits”) in a macroeconomic model with beliefs switching behavior implemented through a discrete logit mechanism where agents can choose among a limited set of simple but biased rules (heuristics) to forecast future output and inflation. The author, discussing the results, recognizes that “[...] the menu of heuristics which is extremely small in this paper, will have to be broadened so that the selection of the “fittest” rules can occur using a wider pool of possible rules.” This is the aspect upon which this paper focuses. In order to keep the analysis as general as possible, the evolutionary concept I will mainly rely upon is the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), proposed by Maynard Smith and Price (1973, 1974). I will also make use, at times, of two additional evolutionary schemes: the first is the concept of replicator dynamics proposed by Taylor and Jonker (1978) and used in economics, for example, by Sethi and Franke (1995) and more recently by Branch and McGough (2008); the second is a discrete logit model of beliefs selection, used, for example, in Brock and Hommes (1997).Footnote 3 The choice of focusing on the notion of ESS has its benefits, but it is not without costs. While in fact this concept allows for a sharper characterization of some results, it does not allow us to discuss properly beliefs dynamics in a way that schemes such as replicator dynamics or the discrete logit model would. In particular, the notion of ESS relates to local stability properties of the model, and it has nothing to say about the global properties of the system under consideration. These various concepts are, nevertheless, closely related, and Weibull (1995) shows that every ESS is (locally) asymptotically stable under replicator dynamics, though the reverse does not generally hold. In other words, focusing on the notion of ESS will lead to results that are conservative: the equilibria found using ESS are also (locally) stable equilibria under replicator dynamics, though there might be other stable outcomes that emerge under replicator dynamics that do not correspond to ESS.",

Therefore, scholars and policy makers have been questioning the effects of informality on the activities of formal firms and on the economy as a whole. The informal economy is heterogeneous (Ulyssea 2018; Bargain and Kwenda 2011), with informal and formal enterprises co-existing and operating in a continuum, that is, at different degrees of informality (Ulyssea 2018; Kraemer-Mbula 2016; Kawooya 2014; Chen 2006). As a result, informal enterprises may cause competition to formal enterprises through prices at the ‘local-level’ where competitive interaction is found to occur in product markets (Ali and Najaman 2015; Gonzalez and Lamanna 2007). While market competition between firms is widely recognised as a driver of efficiency and growth (Aghion et al. 2001), firm-level evidence examining the effect of competition on innovation is inconclusive, and it supports two main opposing views. Some of the studies support the ‘Schumpeterian effect’ whereby competition has a negative effect on innovation (Hashmi 2013; Aghion and Howitt 1992; Schumpeter 1942), while others provide evidence of the ‘escape-competition effect’ where competition has a positive effect on innovation (see Aghion et al. 2001; Blundell et al. 1999). A new strand of the literature identifies an inverted-U relationship between competition and firm-level innovations (Mendi and Costamagna 2017; Aghion et al. 2005). Most of these studies focus on developed countries and, therefore, examine mainly formal market competition with little implication of informal competition on innovation. In developing countries where the literature of informality has expanded, firm-level data reveal that the competitive behaviour of informal enterprises is one of the top three obstacles formal businesses face in product markets (Mendi and Costamagna 2017; Friesen and Wacker 2013; Gonzalez and Lamanna 2007). However, the economic implications of informal enterprises’ activities is found to be under-researched in the literature (Mendi and Costamagna 2017; Bruton et al. 2012). In particular, there are very few studies that investigate the effect of informal product market competition (hereafter informal competition) on the innovation strategies of formal firms in SSA. This paper aims to fill these gaps in the literature. To face informal competition, formal firms may introduce product innovations by employing vertical product differentiation in order to stay competitive. Innovations, particularly product innovations, remain a primary driver of firm technological competitiveness (market performance) through improvements in product quality, offering of new products or opening up new markets or groups of customers, thereby increasing the firm’s market share (Avenyo et al. 2019; Gault 2010; OECD 2005; van Dijk and Sandee 2002). However, imitation and the increasing complementary interaction between formal and informal businesses, coupled with the dynamic behaviours of informal enterprises may be blurring vertical product differences, particularly in the service sector. Consequently, the competitive advantage formal firms may have with vertical product differentiation may be lower in the face of informal competition. This raises the questions: (1) To what extent does informal competition affect formal firms’ incentives to innovate? (2) How is the market performance of formal firms affected by informal competition and imitation? This paper investigates these questions, and aims to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms through which these relationships occur in SSA. The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. It provides, to our knowledge, one of the first empirical evidence assessing the effect of informal competition on the sales of innovative products. It departs from the mainstream literature by analysing informal competition, and from similar studies (for example Mendi and Costamagna 2017), by going beyond the analysis of formal firms’ incentives to innovate. We argue that what may be relevant for firms is not only whether to introduce product innovation or not, but how the innovative products perform on the market in the face of competition from both formal and informal enterprises. Analysing the effect of informal competition on product innovation using a binary dependent variable (whether the firm introduces product innovation or not) only determines the incentives to innovate or otherwise. The paper, therefore, goes beyond establishing a relationship between informal competition and the probability of the firm to introduce product innovation by assessing the effect of informal competition intensity on the performance of product innovation in SSA. This paper also contributes to the literature by resolving possible econometric issues of bi-directional causality, and the use of subjective responses that may bias our estimates. We follow (Guiso et al. 2004) and (Ali and Najaman 2015) to construct an innovative ‘regional’ competitive intensity measure that ‘localises’ competition at the regional level thereby reducing the possible bi-directional causality between informal competition and sales of innovative products, as well as controlling for a possible bias due to the subjective nature of the data. We also employ the same procedure to construct an industry-level informal competition indicator across industries in each country. These approaches allow us to introduce non-linear effects into our model that could help explain, more rigorously, the relationship between informal competition and formal firms’ technological innovativeness (see Ali and Najaman 2015; Aghion et al. 2005; Scherer1967). In addition, we correct for possible selection bias that can affect our estimations. To do all these, the paper employs the Enterprise Surveys (ES) and the Innovation Follow-up Surveys (IFS) data sets from the World Bank for 5 SSA countries, namely the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana (GH), Tanzania (TZ), Uganda (UGA) and Zambia (ZAM). Previous studies (see Mendi and Costamagna 2017; Ali and Najaman 2015; Friesen and Wacker 2013; Gonzalez and Lamanna 2007) only employed the ES and, therefore, could not examine the intensity of product innovation. Furthermore, by merging the ES with the IFS, we are able to explore a larger number of variables in order to uniquely introduce additional and important variables that were previously omitted in the literature. For the analysis, we employ two econometric approaches that localise informal competition in the product market at the first-level of estimation, and control for self-selection and sample selection biases at the second level of estimation. The results show that ‘local’ informal competition matters for the performance of product innovations. Specifically, our results indicate the presence of a ‘Schumpeterian effect’ where informal competition is found to be detrimental to the performance of product innovations. Our conclusion is also found to be valid when we divide formal firms into sectors, ownership type and size. However, extension to industry-level informal competition indicates an ‘escape-competition effect’ of informal competitive activities on product innovation in formal firms. Our results also show through indirect mechanisms that firms with larger market shares tend to display an ‘escape-competition effect’ following increases in informal competition. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on the relationship between innovation and product market competition. In Section 3, the model and sources of data are presented. Section 4 presents the results from the empirical estimation in line with the objectives of the paper and discusses our results. Section 5 concludes the paper.",12
31.0,2.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,08 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-021-00726-7,Why do informal markets remain informal: the role of tacit knowledge in an Indian footwear cluster,April 2021,Yugank Goyal,Klaus Heine,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The tacit dimension of knowledge, largely attributed to Polanyi (1958, 1967) and Hayek (1952, 1967), has become a central category for understanding the role that knowledge plays in society. “Tacitness” means that large parts of knowledge cannot be conveyed explicitly and remain uncodified, as opposed to explicit knowledge which can be transferred or shared. Yet, if knowledge-based theories of growth (New Growth Theory) are to be considered seriously (Romer 1986; Grossman and Helpman 1994) then tacit knowledge becomes a ‘problem’, because knowledge which cannot be conveyed or transmitted, cannot be employed for accounting for growth in those frameworks. To put it differently, knowledge in a Romer-world can be re-used and distributed at no cost and must therefore become a source of increasing returns. But if one cannot transmit knowledge as easily, then there are limits to this modelling. Hence, it is no surprise that scholars of knowledge management put a lot of effort into the attempt to build frameworks that codify tacit knowledge in and between organizations and to make a connection with competitive advantage on the firm level, particularly employing a resource based view of the firm (e.g., Wernerfelt 1984; Barney 1991). Shifting away from the intriguing problems of conceptualizing knowledge as an economic driving force on the firm and societal level, it can be observed that the so-called informal sector is largely unable to create adequate economic value for the people directly or indirectly depending on it. While businesses ‘outside’ the formal legal and regulatory net of jurisdictions employ more than 60% of the global workforce (86% in Africa, 68% in Asia and Pacific, 67% in Arab states, 40% in Americas and 25% in Europe and Central Asia) at the same time it is correlated with low levels of GDP (ILO 2018). A good part of research about the role of knowledge in the economy has not focused on those informal markets, which are not only the sites of labour vulnerability, low productivity and poverty, but which are also reluctant to change. Literature suggests that businesses in the informal sector are disadvantaged in comparison with their formal counterparts because of their general inefficiencies and high labour vulnerability (Fandl 2008). Yet, informal businesses seldom transform into formal business, and there is little consensus on why informal enterprises do not transform, if the gains from an improved level of institutionalization are potentially high. Why do many market clusters remain in their small networks transacting informally? Even when structural transformation of industries takes place through exogenous shocks, it often leaves many informal practices untouched (Harriss-White and Sinha 2007). This contribution undertakes the attempt to shed more light on the nexus between the institutional rigidity of informal market clusters and tacit knowledge. To this end, we conducted a study in a very old informal business cluster in north India, namely the footwear cluster of Agra. In this study we extend the analysis of tacit knowledge beyond the formal firm and industry level by focusing on small-scale shoe manufacturers and their symbiosis with informal financial intermediaries. This will involve examining the notion of upgrading in informal clusters, something that has been largely ignored for local firms with no global linkages. More specifically, we look at one particular knowledge institution, namely that of trade credit. In the centuries old Agra footwear cluster, trading of shoes takes place through credit. Poor shoemakers sell shoes on credit to the traders. To ensure a credible commitment in the relation between trader and shoemaker, the trader issues a paper slip to the shoemaker a so-called parchi which bears the outstanding amount, to be payable at the end of 3 months. The parchi is tradable in the market at a discount. The discount rate depends on the creditworthiness of the trader who issued the parchi. This means that if the trader is known to renege on his promise, his credit score will go down, the discount rate will increase and shoemakers will choose another trader whose discount rate is lower. Knowledge of creditworthiness and discount rates in this market is crucial for it to function. And this knowledge, being tacit in nature, is “sticky” and has resisted any institutional change in the market with respect to trade credit. In other words, we have to do with a market that emerged into a specific institutional configuration and has remained there unchanged for centuries, despite technical, economic and political disruptions around it. That leads to the hypothesis that tacit knowledge has a two-faced “Janus” effect in informal markets. On the one hand it makes those markets quite effective and profitable, but on the other hand it prevents the emergence of new institutional arrangements that might be necessary to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of the business in the long run. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we refer to the relevant literature and make a link between informal markets and tacit knowledge. In Section 3, we describe the leather footwear industry in Agra, and its emergence, and we focus into the co-evolved trade credit institutions. In section 4, we explore the relation between the tacitness of knowledge and the institutional resistance to change. Section 5 concludes.",2

Entrepreneurs act to not only exploit but also create innovative opportunities (Schumpeter 1934; Carlsson et al. 2013; Holmén et al. 2007); they tackle risk and uncertainty for the possibility of profits (Knight 1921; Fagerberg 2003); they create new knowledge over time which stimulates economic disequilibrium (Metcalfe 2002); and they further extend the cognitive base of the economy, which helps stimulate growth (Cantner et al. 2017). This article contributes with an analysis of the specific linkages between knowledge, innovation, entrepreneurship, and industrial dynamics, within the emerging literature on knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurial (KIE) firms. The conceptualization of KIE firms is derived from research on Schumpeterian entrepreneurship, innovation systems and evolutionary economics (Malerba and McKelvey 2018a, c). Various strands of this literature postulate how and why knowledge and capabilities in general help these entrepreneurs innovate and compete (McKelvey and Lassen 2013; Malerba et al. 2016; Protogerou et al. 2017; Gifford 2017; Lassen et al. 2018), and researchers have begun to analyze specific relationships between different types of knowledge and performance. Previous studies on the evolution of industries have highlighted the link between founders’ pre-entry experience in the industry and the survival of their ventures (Audretsch 1991; Caves 1998; Geroski 1995; Klepper 2002, 2009; Klepper and Sleeper 2005). In this article, we expand this prior work by studying how various types of founder experience relate to the performance in a large sample of European KIE firms. Recognizing the limitations of survival as a measure of firm performance (cf., e.g., Lieberman and Montgomery 2013), we adopt a two-stage approach, first analyzing firm survival over time and then focusing on high-growth firms. Entrepreneurship scholars have addressed a series of question about the relationship between the pre-entry endowments of founders and the performance of their firms (Brüderl et al. 1992; Gimeno et al. 1997; Parker 2004; Shane 2003; Helfat and Lieberman 2002). A meta-study by Unger et al. (2011) finds the human capital of founders and founding teams is influential for the success of new ventures in both high and low technology industries. Colombo and Grilli (2005) studied human capital in technology-based firms, finding synergistic gains from combining founders’ economic-managerial and technical education, in relation to experience from a specific industry. Other studies focus upon how founders’ pre-entry endowments affect access to resources and their ability to manage the firm (Shane and Stuart 2002; Delmar and Shane 2004; Dencker et al. 2009), whereas some distinguish the origins of firms in terms of whether they are corporate or academic spin-offs and then analyze performance of that category of firms (Wennberg et al. 2011; Zahra et al. 2007). Going further, Buenstorf and Heinisch (2020) demonstrate that doctorate-holding inventors contribute to entrant performance, which indicates that only focusing upon academic entrepreneurship limits our understanding of startups’ initial knowledge endowments. Although the extant literature shows the importance of pre-entry endowments of founders, previous research tends to focus on particular types of entrepreneurial firms (e.g. academic or corporate spin-offs; technology-based firms), particular industry settings, or particular types of founder knowledge (e.g. education or previous industrial experience). As recommended by Agarwal and Shah (2014), we take a more encompassing approach; we develop a more fine-grained neo-Schumpeterian perspective on pre-entry endowment and the performance of knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurial firms. Our article thus makes three contributions to the literature. First, we analyze a wide spectrum of types of entrepreneurial firms. KIE is an inclusive theoretical category. It denotes entrepreneurial firms that compete on the basis of various types of advanced knowledge and innovation, and which are found in low-, medium- and high-tech manufacturing as well as in services (Malerba et al. 2016). Based on previously established criteria (Malerba and McKelvey 2018a, b), we specify different degrees of knowledge intensity within this group of entrepreneurial firms, and analyze which types of founder and team knowledge are performance-relevant under which conditions. Specifically, our analysis focuses on three types of experience-based founder work knowledge: entrepreneurial experience, industrial experience, and academic experience. Second, we analyze a large sample including more than 4000 firms from ten European countries, linking detailed survey data with longitudinal register information encompassing data on firm activity and financial performance. We also extend the existing literature on firm performance, which has mostly focused on single measures (mostly survival or some financial indicator; cf. Lieberman and Montgomery 2013), or, in the tradition of the rich theoretical studies of Penrose (1959) and Stinchcombe (1965), focus on those firms that experience exorbitant levels of growth, also called gazelles or high growth firms (Henrekson and Johansson 2009a, b). In contrast, we take a two-stage approach to analyze the performance of KIE firms. We first use Cox regression to assess the likelihood of survival in relation to founder knowledge. Although many firms survive, growth is much less a frequent occurrence. Therefore, in a second stage of analysis, we analyze growth conditional on survival employing quantile regression (cf. Coad et al. 2016; Czarnitzki and Delanote 2012). This allows us to obtain a fine-grained picture of the upper end of the spectrum of firm performance. Third, our results demonstrate a distinct variety in the usefulness of different types of founder experience for the performance of KIE firms. On one hand, firms with founders who previously started firms or worked in the same industry are more likely to survive. On the other hand, high-growth outliers tend to have founders who previously started firms or worked in universities. This pattern indicates substantial heterogeneity in how the various types of founder experience affect selection processes that condition whether, and to what extent, entrepreneurial actions lead to industrial transformation. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we outline our theoretical considerations, including a discussion of knowledge-intensive innovative entrepreneurship, and our hypothesized associations between founder experience and firm performance. This is followed by research methods, results, and finally, our conclusions and recommendations for future research.",7
31.0,2.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,21 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-021-00722-x,The role of (dynamic) capabilities in the transformation of a multi-organizational setting,April 2021,Lauri Paavola,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This study explores the dynamic capabilities related to the transformation of a multi-organizational setting. More specifically, it examines how the capabilities of individual organizations can shape the context in which the organizations operate and/or the organization’s response to changes in the context. The research into the core organizational phenomena that purposefully adapt an organization’s resource base (for example, change and transformation) has prompted scholars to address the capabilities that underpin these phenomena (Helfat and Peteraf 2015; Teece et al. 1997; Teece 2007). Notwithstanding recent advances in understanding organizational change through dynamic capabilities, we lack a theoretical understanding of how such capabilities act across organizational boundaries within a transformative context. A multi-organizational setting consists of an organizational network where individual organizations seek to gain an advantage from the existence of the other organizations, despite the increased threat of competition (Sydow and Windeler 1998). Any individual organization in such a setting is influenced by its surroundings, which comprise two distinct parts. The context of the multi-organizational setting refers to the organizational network itself, and the environment refers to all the external actors that influence the context. A typical example of a multi-organizational setting is a shopping center, the context of which might include the owner, the coordinating body, the financiers, the managing consultants, the city planning department, and most importantly, the various tenants (Teller 2008). This context is influenced by environmental factors, such as accessibility, competition, and local customer needs (Teller et al. 2016). Individual organizations typically respond to the changing context and environment by transforming their operating procedures, creating a network of interactive influences within the particular context (Tsoukas and Chia 2002; Levinthal 1991). This paper uses an abductive case research approach to examine the dynamic capabilities involved in such transformations. The multi-organizational setting of the study is the Finnish shopping center, Itis, between 1970–2012. After a lengthy period of planning and development, the center was opened in 1984 and has since tripled in size. In 1992, as a result of its first expansion, it became the largest shopping center in the Nordic countries. Over the period studied, a total of 468 retailers have operated within Itis’s multi-organizational setting. The services provided have increased in line with the size of the center, which has hosted best-selling global actors such as H&M (Hennes and Mauritz) and Zara, as well as the major Finnish department stores Stockmann, Sokos, and Anttila. The shifting configuration and unique characteristics of the numerous individual organizations involved mean that transformations within a multi-organizational setting are often context-specific endeavors. However, I argue that the organizations have dynamic capabilities for either influencing or adapting to transformational events within such a context. By identifying and considering these capabilities, it is possible to determine the kinds of changes individual organizations are able to react to and how they do so, and thus explain the evolution of organizations (Levinthal and Marino 2015). In the literature, dynamic capabilities have been defined as the organization’s capability to purposefully adapt its resource base within the environment in which it operates (Teece et al. 1997; Nelson and Winter 1982). An organization that can recognize its capabilities can identify its effective and ineffective operating patterns (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000). I argue that this also applies to more complex settings that involve multiple organizations. Despite the numerous applications of the dynamic capability theory, the existing literature fails to address the capabilities associated with multi-organizational settings. This paper therefore explores the role of capabilities in governing contextual transformations within the multi-organizational setting of a shopping center, by identifying and classifying such capabilities and analyzing their aggregate influence. In short, I address the following research question: How do capabilities function in the transformation of a multi-organizational context? The paper proceeds as follows. First, I conduct a literature review. Since there is no existing literature on dynamic capabilities within multi-organizational settings, my review analyzes two distinct streams of literature: the literature on multi-organizational settings and the literature on dynamic capabilities. I combine these before describing my research methodology. Before engaging in theory building, I provide a rather detailed narrative of the history of Itis and its most important transformational events. Specifically, I identify five critical transformational events and divide the lifecycle of Itis into four distinctive eras or phases that are initiated by or culminate in these critical events. Finally, I identify dynamic capabilities related to these events, classifying them into three types. My analysis generates five theoretical results on capabilities that illustrate the interrelatedness of the context, the individual organizations, and the capabilities within a multi-organizational setting. Hence, my results contribute to the understanding of the role of dynamic capabilities in multi-organizational settings, thus providing insight into their management and coordination.",2

These two publications opened the European road not only for higher religious tolerance, but for general tolerance in different social dimensions. Voltaire, in his Treaty on Tolerance, asked “What is Tolerance?” and promptly answered: “It is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other’s folly – that is the first law of nature”. Tolerance is closely related to errors, faults, deviations from something that is perceived as ‘normal’ or ‘natural’. A tolerant socio-cultural environment leads to the existence of diversity. Contrary to the conviction of some human beings, tolerance and diversity ought to be associated with harmony, mutual forbearance and understanding. These virtues are noted in UNESCO’s ‘Declaration of Principles of Tolerance’ (16 November 1995)Footnote 1 where we read: “Tolerance is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world’s cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being human. It is fostered by knowledge, openness, communication, and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. Tolerance is harmony in difference. It is not only a moral duty, it is also a political and legal requirement. Tolerance, the virtue that makes peace possible, contributes to the replacement of the culture of war by a culture of peace.” As Ludwig von Mises wrote in Liberalism, “what impels liberalism to demand and accord toleration is not consideration for the content of the doctrine to be tolerated, but the knowledge that only tolerance can create and preserve the condition of social peace without which humanity must relapse into the barbarism and penury of centuries long past” (2005 [1927], p. 34). Similarly, in his magnum opus, Mises states that liberal policies and tolerance are the fundamentals for innovation and technological progress: “The idea of tolerance with regard to other people’s dissenting views could take root only when the liberal doctrines had broken the spell of universalism. … These grumblers do not realize that the tremendous progress of technological methods of production and the resulting increase in wealth and welfare were feasible only through the pursuit of those liberal policies which were the practical application of the teachings of economics” (Mises 1996 [1949], p. 148 and p. 8). Mokyr (1990) notes that “[t]echnological progress requires above all tolerance toward the unfamiliar and the eccentric”, and add that “[t]he factors determining the degree of tolerance toward deviants in any society are not much understood”. He generalizes that opinion in the context of ‘a culture of growth’. He writes (Mokyr 2016, pp. 53 and 234): “One important cultural value is pluralism: whether to tolerate incompatible values and beliefs, and whether to give new cultural elements—no matter how outrageous they sound—a fair chance to compete in the market place for ideas and values is itself a value that needs to be accepted. A belief in cultural (including religious) tolerance and free speech and thought, and the institutions it implies (such as the first amendment to the US Constitution) can be of great economic value when it is relatively rare; it allows an economy to attract and absorb religious and political refugees, who tend to be creative and well-networked. The willingness of the Netherlands and later Britain and the United States to tolerate Jews and dissenting Christians contributed a great deal to their economies, especially in high-skilled manufacturing and financial services. … In the market for ideas, one of the most successful ones that won out in the seventeenth century in much of Western Europe was the idea of tolerance”. Corneo and Jeanne (2009) identify tolerance with “respect for diversity”Footnote 2 and note that tolerance “is often viewed as a distinctive feature of modern western societies”. Cipolla describing the historical development of European Society and economy before the Industrial Revolution concludes that: “Down the centuries, those countries where intolerance and fanaticism prevailed lost to more tolerant countries that most precious of all possible forms of wealth: good human minds. The qualities that make people tolerant also make them receptive to new ideas. The influx of good minds and a receptiveness to new ideas were among the main sources of the success stories of England, Holland, Sweden, and Switzerland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries” (Cipolla 1993, p. 124).Footnote 3 The above short review of concepts on tolerance is the general inspiration for designing a series of simulation experiments in our evolutionary model of industrial development. The model contains some general scheme of all evolutionary processes (biological, technological, economic, cultural, social, …) based on general mechanisms of generation and selection of novelty. Our results correspond, e.g., with the observations of Melissa A. Schilling presented in her book Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World. In her opinion “studying … breakthrough innovators reveals some important commonalities that help give us insight into what made them able—and made them driven—to change the world in such dramatic ways. Although they were extremely intelligent, that is not enough to make someone a serial breakthrough innovator. Other factors played key roles. The innovators displayed some unusual characteristics—quirks—that had important implications for both the ideas they generated and the intensity with which they pursued them. For example, nearly every innovator I studied exhibited very high levels of social detachment” (Schilling 2018, p. 13–4). As our simulation experiments show, quirks are the primary sources of radical innovations, and to be frequently observed, a relatively tolerant selection environment ought to be created. In this paper, we show how tolerance allows accelerating the emergence of innovations, technological development and economic growth. The paper is a continuation of our earlier work on ‘Diversity and Development: Tempo and Mode of Evolutionary Processes’ (Kwasnicka and Kwasnicki 1986). The general conclusion presented in that paper was that “the main source of improvements (innovations) is the neighborhood, not, as is commonly believed, the best elements. The existence of the neighborhood diminishes the average quality of the population; that is, it causes a worsening of system performance. … the existence of diversity is of essential importance for long range system development seems to be intuitively acceptable, but we see a strong need for solid verification of this hypothesis.” Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1930), in his famous book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection stated his “fundamental theorem of natural selection” as follows: “The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time” and 11 years later “The rate of increase in the average fitness of a population is equal to the genetic variance of fitness of that population” (Fisher 1941). Fisher’s theorem has been widely discussed by biologists as well as other disciplines. In the context of evolutionary economics, the theorem was analysed by Metcalfe (1994). Metcalfe distinguishes what he calls “Fisher’s principle from various forms of his fundamental theorem of natural selection”. In his opinion “the principle is general and states that, in the context of a population of diverse behaviours across which selection is taking place in a constant environment, the rate of change of mean behaviour is a function of the degree of variety in behaviour across the population. … When these behaviours are one dimensional, the principle becomes the fundamental theorem of natural selection, that the rate of improvement of mean behaviour is proportional to the variance in behaviour in the population.” What we present here is partially related to the principle stated by Fisher. As we will show, variety is essential for long-term evolutionary economic development, but there is a crucial difference between our proposition and Fisher’s finding. Fisher based his consideration on the given and finite set of genotypes (solutions). We are asking to what extent the emergence of new solutions, i.e., innovations, is spurred up by variety (diversity) controlled by the selection environment. In this sense, we may say that it is the generalisation of Fisher’s principle to the long-term perspective of technological development. In the remainder of the paper, we first present shortly our existing evolutionary model, and then present a simulation study focused on the investigation of the role of diversity, tolerance and heterogeneity of firms’ behaviour in industrial development, particularly related to the rate of technological development (innovativeness).",3

Social norms and beliefs taught during up-bringing, adapted to or fortified by the environmental context and transferred to the next generation are key to the differentiation of cultures around the globe. Over the centuries, cultures have adjusted to local and economic conditions (Landes 1998). Nevertheless, our progressively industrialised world reveals enormous gaps in economic welfare, and although many economies are in the process of catching up, this process is sensitive to disruption. Aiming to understand the origins of the divergence in development paths, we examine culture as a determinant of economic performance. Thus far, most research has analysed the relation between culture and trade or culture and institutions to explain and verify the influence of culture on economic outcomes. These approaches run the risk of identifying spurious relations, as it is a difficult empirical exercise to disentangle economic growth from simultaneous social and cultural development. We thus suggest taking a micro perspective, which can shed light on the underlying mechanisms that connect cultural background and growth. Therefore, this paper investigates the link between culture and innovation, which is a key trigger for economic growth. Moreover, as we are considering the case of a developing country, we focus on the adoption of existing innovation, as it is considered a decisive comparative advantage in initiating the process of catching up. With regard to adopting innovation, chemical fertilisers are an advantageous choice because they bear the potential to increase agricultural productivity and thus fight malnutrition. Additionally, an increase in productivity in rural areas is often a first necessary step on the path to development. To test our hypothesis we use data on fertiliser adoption in Ethiopia, a country notorious for famines, malnutrition and the vulnerability of its socio-economic system (Block and Webb 2001; Rashid et al. 2013; IFPRI 2014). Although the use of fertiliser was promoted as early on as the military Derg Regime (1974 - 1991) already and application rates increased by 180 percent between 1993 and 2005 (UNDP 2010), fertiliser diffusion remains insufficient in rural Ethiopia (Rashid et al. 2013). Furthermore, the diffusion of chemical fertilizers in Ethiopian Peasant Associations seems to be an ideal case study, since it occurs in rural villages with a high degree of both religious and ethnic heterogeneity, it does not involve technical trade-offs, and it exhibits low cost of adoption (Beretta et al. 2018). Finally, agricultural practices in early-stages developing countries root in ancient cultural habits and, therefore, they are a suitable test bed to look at the impact of culture on adoption of innovations (Dessalegn 1984; Johnson 1972; MacPherson and Jackson 1975). A large body of literature on development and innovation has offered general explanations for the adoption and diffusion of agricultural innovation (Feder et al. 1985; Sunding and Zilberman 2001; Knowler and Bradshaw 2007; Duflo et al. 2011), and many scholars have focused on the specific case of Ethiopia (Croppenstedt et al. 2003; Asfaw and Admassie 2004; Dadi et al. 2004; Weir and Knight 2004; Carlsson et al. 2005; Dercon and Christiaensen 2011; Krishnan and Patnam 2014). However, there are no studies of cross-cultural dissimilarities as a determinant of the adoption of fertiliser. In the subsequent sections, we review the literature and suggest testable hypotheses. We then introduce the dataset and present the empirical results. Discussion and conclusions follow.",1

Firstly, coffee farmers manually harvest only ripe coffee cherries, which requires great effort due to the topography of the colombian Andes. Secondly, farmers carry out post-harvest processes, which entail the elimination of defective grains, pulping, washing, and drying. Later, the coffee is threshed to obtain parchment coffee, the raw roasting material. The economic importance of coffee as an export good is well justified by the impact it has on thousands of colombian families and millions of consumers around the world (Fedecafé 2019). According to the National Federation of Coffee Growers,Footnote 1 (FNC for the acronym in Spanish), about 560000 families grow coffee in Colombia on farms of less than 5 hectares and they are responsible for 69% of production. Of the 940000 hectares of coffee grown in Colombia, around 780000 correspond to technified crops, which means they are planted with improved coffee varieties, such as rust resistant trees (about 80% compared to only 35% that were in 2010). The annual production of Colombian coffee from 1956 to 2018, reported in Fig. 1a, shows a positive trend, with turnarounds typically related to climatic phenomena (such as El Niño). It is however evident from Fig. 1b that the revenue from exportations is not directly related to production. Global economic factors, such as the interaction with other international coffee markets, and even changes in the currency exchange rates, definitely influence the revenue, but there is a growing consensus on the role played by the coffee quality attributes, with respect to which the production is nowadays increasingly diversified. Indeed, a wide variety of specialty coffees are currently produced, and consumers around the world are learning the value of high quality coffee, for which they are willing to pay higher prices. The FNC defines the special coffees as those obtained through (i) the development of new equipment and new forms of preparation, which guarantee better beverage quality, (ii) the association of coffee production with concepts such as sustainability, (iii) caring for the environment, (iv) social responsibility, and (v) economic equity. Special coffees are becoming a source of income for small producers who mainly market their product locally or through alternative trade shops, or who manage to export their coffee with certificated origin and production. According to the report “Global Specialty Coffee Market Size by Grade (80–84.99, 85-89.99, 90–100) by Application (Home, Commercial) by Region and Forecast 2019 to 2025”,Footnote 2 the world market for coffee reached revenues up to USD 35.9 billion in 2018, with a prospect of USD 83.6 billion by 2025. Unfortunately, in Colombia, the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of accurate information on the production, processing, and sales of special coffees is not yet consolidated, mainly because special coffees are often produced in small quantities and marketed directly by the producer. Currently, the FNC statistical records of coffee exports are only available by type: green, decaffeinated green, roasted in beans, roasted and ground, and extract and soluble (Fedecafé 2019).
 a Anual registered Colombian coffee production in thousands of bags of 60 kg of green coffee. b Value of exports to all destinations—Anual total. Unit: Millions of dollars (Fedecafé 2019) Beyond the main denominations (i)–(v) of special coffees, one of the factors that most impacts the quality of coffee is the cultivation protocols, that must be optimized to minimize the attack of pests and diseases, eliminate outer fruit layers, and control humidity (Montoya-Restrepo 1999). The most widespread coffee pest worldwide is a beetle, the coffee berry borer (CBB) Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) (Pardey 2006). CBB adult females bore into coffee beans through the navel and into the endosperm, where it makes galleries to deposit its eggs. CBB causes different types of damage to the product, which are caused by (i) boring and feeding habits of adult and immature insects, which cause a reduction in yield and final product quality, and (ii) physical damage, which causes bored beans to become vulnerable to infection and further pest attacks (Damon 2000). Montoya’s investigation (Montoya-Restrepo 1999) strove to define what CBB infestation percentages and what levels of damage permit to obtain a coffee drink of acceptable quality. Specifically, the investigation supports the hypothesis that, beyond the damage, the CBB directly impacts the coffee market, by introducing a variety of different coffee types/qualities, classified depending on the proportion of bored grains that pass to production. As a result of this situation, significant efforts have been made to identify the best CBB control strategies, among biological control, carried out via parasitism and predation (Follett et al. 2016; Infante 2018; Monagan et al. 2017; Morris and Perfecto 2016; Rodríguez et al. 2017), chemical control methods, by means of insecticides (Pardey 2006), and cultural control, the safest of all possible, that refers to agricultural practices, such as collecting overripe and dry grains (black grains no longer useful) to prevent adult CBB insects from finding refuge (Alarcón et al. 2017; Pardey 2006). Institutions supporting coffee production in Colombia, such as the FNC, recommend a combination of the three strategies, known as the Integrated CBB Control (Constantino et al. 2017; Pardey 2006). The situation however calls for a more comprehensive view of the CBB phenomenon, that includes the market dynamics and its feedback on coffee production and on the whole agro-ecological context. It is indeed the final coffee consumer who exerts the selection to determine which new products invade the market and which get established or eliminated. In turn, strategic decisions on the production and commercialization sides are source of innovation for coffee types and qualities, innovations that are then filtered by the market competition. In this sense, it is important to study this feedback loop between market and production of coffee, when CBB damage is considered a cause of quality differentiation. Such a study should be able to determine the conditions under which an innovative special coffee, characterized by some quality attribute that differentiates it from standard coffee, can invade the market and either replace or coexist with standard coffee. In particular, conditions for coexistence open up the possibility for further diversification, even of two initially similar products. Under this comprehensive view, the role CBB control strategies will be particularly highlighted, not only limited at the pest containment, but extended to control the emergence of market niches for different coffee products. These kinds of questions are addressed by evolutionary modeling approaches, and particularly by the Adaptive Dynamics (AD) framework (Dercole and Rinaldi 2008; Dieckmann and Law 1996; Geritz et al. 1997, 1998; Metz et al. 1996). AD is a theoretical modeling framework which originated in evolutionary biology and describes the long-term evolution of quantitative traits (i.e., continuous attributes determined by the cumulative contributions of many genes). The key feature of AD is to explicitly consider the feedback loop that binds demographic and evolutionary change. In biology, demography selects the traits who win the competition and evolution proceeds through sequences of genetic mutations that are selected by demography. In economics, the role of mutations and selection are played by innovations on the production side and market competition on the consumer side. By focusing on incremental innovations, put forward at a frequency that is low compared to the market dynamics, AD describes the evolution of the products’ traits (the coffee quality in our case) in terms of a differential equation, called the AD canonical equation, thus characterizing evolutionary equilibria as well as transients and non-stationary regimes (Dercole et al. 2003, 2006, 2010; Dercole and Rinaldi 2010; Dieckmann et al. 1995). Most importantly, AD endogenously integrates the changing system’s diversity, as the number of coexisting product types increases when innovative and established products coexist and further differentiate, evolutionary branching, and is pruned when evolution eliminates outcompeted products, evolutionary extinction (Dercole et al. 2016; Doebeli and Dieckmann 2000; Geritz et al. 1997, 1998) (see Champagnat et al. 2006; Dercole 2016; Dercole and Geritz 2016; Genieys et al. 2009 for further theoretical developments). This is the most important added value of AD to the economic literature on diversification. As extensively discussed in Dercole et al. (2008), product diversity is both a means and a result of economic development and growth in variety is crucial and not independent from growth in production (Grübler 1998; Saviotti 1996, 2001; Stirling 1998). In the AD framework, product diversity indeed emerges as a result of the feedback between innovation and competition processes. Since its introduction, a wide range of applications have been published. Biologically oriented applications have addressed competition (Dercole et al. 2002; Doebeli and Dieckmann 2000; Johansson et al. 2010), and predator–prey interactions (Abrams 1997, 2003; Dercole et al. 2003, 2006; Dercole and Rinaldi2010; Dieckmann et al. 1995; Landi et al. 2013), food chains (Dercole and Rinaldi 2010), mutualistic (Dercole 2005; Dieckmann and Law 1996; Doebeli and Dieckmann 2000; Ferriere et al. 2002) and cannibalistic interactions (Dercole 2003; Dercole and Rinaldi 2002), evolution of dispersal (Colombo et al. 2008; Dercole et al. 2007; Parvinen 2002), and even evolution at the genetic level (Collet et al. 2013; Kisdi and Geritz 1999). In the socio-economic context, technological innovations (Dercole et al. 2008, 2010; Toro-Zapata et al. 2018) and the evolution of fashion traits (Landi and Dercole 2016) have been investigated with the tools of AD. However, to the best of our knowledge, no application have addressed an agro-industrial phenomena, such as coffee production. Here, a stylized AD model is formulated and analyzed to describe the evolution of coffee quality. An agro-ecological model describes the growth and harvest of the coffee plantation coupled with the demography of a CBB population, the latter explicitly structured into immature and adult individuals to reflect the damage caused by their reproduction and feeding habits. A market model describes the competition of different coffee types, defined by the proportion of healthy versus bored grains used in their production. Consumer preference favoring high or low quality is considered in competition describe their budget limitations, therefore, the model indirectly considers the rol of coffee prices. The model is, e.g., useful to derive the conditions under which a special coffee invades a market dominated by standard one; and conditions under which the special coffee eventually eliminates the standard one from the market, product substitution, or the two types coexist by sharing the market. Linking this conditions to the consumers’ preference for low or hight quality coffees is a way to consider their budget limitations and the roles of coffee price in market diversification. Finally, the AD canonical equation describes the evolution of coffee quality, closing the feedback loop between the introduction of new coffee types and their competition in the market. The analysis of the model provides insights on the impact of CBB population on the evolving structure of the coffee market. The major result is that, independently of the consumers’ preference for high or low quality, a mild control of the CBB population allows the emergence of several coffee types/qualities through evolutionary branching, whereas a strong (and expensive) pest control would impoverish the market diversity and could therefore lead to an economic loss.",1

Konrad,Florian Morath,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Groups often suffer from the following problem known as the volunteer’s dilemma: Several members of a group might have the option to take a costly action. If at least one of them volunteers and takes this action, this benefits all members in the group. The volunteer also benefits but–unlike the other members of the group–incurs a cost. So the volunteer’s net advantage is lower than that of other group members. Each group member would be willing to volunteer if nobody else does, but each would prefer that someone else volunteers. Examples can be found in many contexts. Teams in military combat need volunteers for dangerous special tasks or for actions that might rescue the whole team.Footnote 1 Firms choose whether to experiment, or to innovate technologies that have common-good nature, such that all firms of the same industry might learn or benefit from this volunteering activity.Footnote 2 Single firms or their CEOs take lobbying actions that benefit these firms but might also be advantageous for the whole industry.Footnote 3 Norm enforcement through social punishment is also a volunteering game: several players might observe a norm-violating behavior and think about whether to sanction the norm violator. The sanctioning activity is costly for the punisher and constitutes a contribution to the enforcement of collective rules, so each player has an incentive to abstain, hoping that someone else engages in this costly activity.Footnote 4 The volunteer’s dilemma also caught the attention of psychologists (see, e.g., Olivola et al. 2020). And the animal world provides further illustrative evidence. Archetti (2009a, 2009b) alludes to a set of empirical environments in which the problem emerges. A generic example is the choice of whether to make alarm calls that are costly for the call maker but alert the larger group, for instance, of an approaching predator.Footnote 5Archetti and Scheurin (2011) study the volunteer’s dilemma for the case in which the group benefit emerges only if multiple players volunteer. Mielke et al. (2019) used artificial dummies of snakes in a natural environment to study the possible motives of snake alarms. They considered multiple possible reasons for such behavior, including the motive of the alarm giving individual to signal his strength or fitness. They found results in line with the volunteer’s dilemma game. A related variant of the volunteer’s dilemma emerges in waiting games, i.e., when wait-and-see behavior becomes an option for the individuals in a group.Footnote 6 A vivid example is the story of the murder of Catherine Susan Genovese. According to early newspaper reports, thirty-eight random bystanders allegedly watched or listened to it for thirty-five minutes before the first person called the police (see Gansberg 1964, in a New York Times article).Footnote 7 Diekmann (1985) offers a Nash equilibrium analysis of the volunteer’s problem if players maximize their expected material payoffs. In the symmetric equilibrium players typically mix between volunteering and not volunteering, making each other potential volunteer just indifferent about whether to volunteer or not. We study the stochastic dynamics of Diekmann’s volunteer’s dilemma in the long run in a finite population. At each point of time the population consists of potentially several types, where an individual’s type is described by the probability that this player volunteers. The type composition of the population is determined by a Markov process in which strong forces of selection and weak forces of mutation describe the transition probabilities between population states. We study the long-run properties of this process, using a framework developed by Fudenberg et al. (2006). Finite population size is important for this concept, much like in Schaffer (1988), and may make spiteful strategies evolutionarily advantageous.Footnote 8 But unlike Schaffer (1988), the concept developed by Fudenberg et al. (2006) looks at the long-run composition of finite populations. It allows for a pairwise comparison of two strategies with respect to their asymptotic success frequencies.Footnote 9 We ask what the limit distribution of strategies is. As strategies that randomize between volunteering and not volunteering might yield superior outcomes (see, e.g., Bergstrom 2014), we allow for such mixing. For any two strategies we find that the limit distribution has two monomorphic populations of players. Groups might consist of players who all volunteer with the same positive probability - hence, there is some degree of cooperation in the limit distribution. Populations with the strategy type that volunteers less frequently turn out to be more likely than populations with the strategy type that volunteers more frequently, however. This evolutionary advantage of the less volunteering type holds for any pairwise comparison of volunteering strategies. The analysis of all pairs of evolutionary strategies drawn from a set that is a continuum of such strategies shows that there is a complete and transitive rank order on this set in the volunteer’s dilemma game. We also look at the comparative static properties. Volunteering groups are more likely if the material benefit from volunteering is larger. If the material benefit becomes very large in comparison to the cost of volunteering then, in a pairwise comparison of evolutionary strategies, the advantage of less cooperative types disappears so that monomorphic groups of players with higher or lower volunteering probability become equally likely. We also look at group size and find results suggesting that volunteering is more pronounced in smaller groups, i.e., if the positive spillovers from volunteering benefit a smaller group of other players. In the limit where the group size becomes infinitely large, only monomorphic groups of players who volunteer less frequently have a positive probability to exist in a pairwise comparison with any other strategy type.",

Recently, the collapse of the state-socialist countries of Eurasia in the 1990s and its socio-economic costs, a number of failing states, the apparent fragility of the entire global system, or the reduced collective-action capacity of the leading powers, when it comes to the maintenance of the global commons (e.g., Block 2000; Rasmus 2016), have become topical. Below entire systemic collapse, there usually are symptoms of institutional decline, at global, national or local levels. Examples include long-term economic downgrade, cumulative income inequality, social disintegration, or geographical fragmentation as well as symptoms of specific humanitarian crises as to food, health, water, land or shelter access, violence and wars, and subsequent enforced international migrations. Yet, the focus of evolutionary and institutional economics has been on the emergence of cooperation.Footnote 1 Considerations of collapse have been considerably fewer, and if so, only recent (e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Horiuchi 2015). The issue was largely left to other social sciences, particularly history, ethnography, anthropology, social geography (Weiss and Bradley 2001; Tainter 2003, 2006; Brooks 2012; Meija 2018), or law and business (Richman 2016). However, these accounts consider the reasons for collapse as exogenous: through the failure of a political system, mismanagement by elites, or through climatic factors, particularly ecological disasters. Sometimes, as in Tainter (2003) and Diamond (2005), a population’s failure to adapt to climate change takes effect, but the main explanation draws on exogenous factors. Few scholars have explicitly taken institutional aspects into account, such as biased collective decision-making in the presence of sunk costs of institutions (Janssen et al. 2003). In this paper, we will consider relatively low interaction costs of established institutions and relatively high interaction costs under institutional break-up and change, even if such change were appropriate and warranted. More generally, most historical instances, in which a complex society disintegrated and developed into less complex ones, where complexity and adaptability of collective decision-making fell below a degree required for the maintenance of the larger, changing commons, have been candidates for collapse (Tainter 2003; Turchin et al. 2013). Societies that are insufficiently complex or adaptive, when encountering change, face high interaction costs (Meija 2018). This causes a fragmentation of populations into smaller groups, constraining communication and interaction, and reducing higher-level collective-decision capacities, eventually leading to collapse. This article contributes to that still small but growing literature on the degeneration, inadequacy, and eventual collapse of institutionalized cooperation, by adopting an interdisciplinary and multiparadigmatic perspective. It is motivated by two key theses: First, collapse is not necessarily tied to exogenous events, but might well occur because of endogenous dynamics. This resembles the idea of “improving oneself into extinction” (Elster 1983, 54), which was applied to an individualistic rationality in ubiquitous social dilemmas. It also applies to the development of populations, when the reach, complexity, or adaptability of collective decision-making is no longer appropriate to the size, complexity, and change of the socio-economic and natural conditions, namely of their commons, and when this stems from the very success of the earlier institutionalized coordination of the population, but these very institutions have at some point become inadequate. Second, the collapse of cooperation is typically not merely a reversal of its emergence. Otherwise, its theoretical comprehension would be a simple derivative of the work on the latter. Rather, as the various disciplinary perspectives developed below indicate, collapse follows different rules than—and is asymmetric to—emergence. Hence, it should be a subject of investigation in its own right. Such an investigation is necessarily interdisciplinary and considers different levels of analysis. Therefore, the following sections integrate arguments from various disciplines (or scientific paradigms) that study emergence and collapse in specific contexts. They focus either on the individual (‘micro’), the group (‘meso’), or systemic (‘macro’) level. To facilitate the triangulation of these contributions, an overall methodological framework is helpful. Given its generality and explicit consideration of the micro-meso-macro distinction, we refer to the framework of ‘systemism’, which has originally been proposed by Mario Bunge (2004). It is widely used in both the social and natural sciences and has been used as an overall methodological framework for interdisciplinary and multiparadigmatic analysis (e.g. Gräbner and Kapeller 2017). To investigate the claims on endogeneity and asymmetry of collapse, we proceed by discussing the arguments from the different perspectives one by one: the biology and evolutionary psychology of the individual (Sect. 3), the anthropology of group behavior (Sect. 4), network science (Sect. 5), and evolutionary institutionalism applying evolutionary game theory (Sect. 6). At the end of each section, we derive hypotheses about the mechanisms and dynamics of collapse, i.e., its endogeneity and/or asymmetry. In Sect. 7, we integrate the perspectives within a common systemist framework and show that they in fact converge to a theoretical frame for modeling, where collapse is endogenous and asymmetric to emergence.",2

Rousseau’s general will concerns the common interest aspect of interactions: ‘it is always right’ and aims at the good of all people. Runciman and Sen (1965) view it as always fulfilling the conditions of Pareto-optimality. In contrast, the will of all results from the aggregation of private, particular interests. Despite being aware of this tension, Rousseau had strong faith that individuals could implement the common good: ‘if, when the people, being furnished with adequate information, held its deliberations, the citizens had no communication one with another, the grand total of the small differences would always give the general will, and the decision would always be good’ (p. 173).Footnote 1 A less triumphant, yet perhaps more sound, claim can be made with respect to the opposite case: when individuals’ modes of reasoning and learning cause decisions based on inadequate information to be made, the conflict between the general will and the will of all is often resolved in favour of the latter. This paper substantiates this view, examining how myopic comparative judgements can influence cooperative behaviour. One way of framing the relationship between the two wills is in terms of the contrast between mutual advantage and individual risk. The choice, to be taken independently of other people and without prior knowledge of their decisions, is between risky cooperation and safe defection. Joint cooperation pays the highest possible reward, whereas lone cooperation is less attractive than both lone and joint defection. The game used to represent situations of this type is the Stag Hunt — after a story, again by Rousseau, in which two hunters have to join forces to kill a stag but are tempted to abandon the hunt and catch a hare by themselves instead. The decision to hunt a stag involves a risk of going back home empty-handed, because there is the possibility that the other hunter will go for a hare. Catching a hare involves no such risk but implies forgoing the potential gains from a successful stag hunt. Mutual hare hunting and cooperating by jointly hunting a stag are both Nash equilibria, as each action is a best response to itself. Following Binmore (1994) and Skyrms (2004, 2014), the Stag Hunt can be seen as a prototypical representation of the social contract, where the state of nature corresponds to the everyone-for-himself equilibrium, or to a nonequilibrium state, and the social contract takes the form of a Pareto-improving reform. Implementing the contract poses a problem of equilibrium selection in that
 you can either devote energy to instituting the new social contract or not. If everyone takes the first course, the social contract equilibrium is achieved; if everyone takes the second course, the state of nature equilibrium results. But the second course carries no risk, while the first does (Skyrms 2004, p. 9). In this paper I study the evolution of cooperation in a population engaged in a Stag Hunt game. Interactions are modelled as pairwise encounters, and individuals are occasionally called to revise their actions. The resulting long-run conventions are derived by applying stochastic stability theory and studying which equilibria are most likely to be observed when agents make mistakes with a small probability (Foster and Young 1990; Kandori et al. 1993; Young 1993). The focus is on the implications of decision rules based on imitation, which has long been recognised as a common form of social learning (Hurley and Chater 2005a, 2005b; Rendell et al. 2010). Imitative heuristics can serve multiple purposes: they are cognitively and informationally undemanding (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier 2011), and can allow individuals to free ride on the knowledge of others. The tendency to engage in social comparisons and imitation may also stem from a drive for self-evaluation, a desire not to fall behind other people, and other culturally influenced attitudes (Festinger 1954). I consider two different imitative rules. The first makes revising agents compare their payoff with the payoff of their opponent, and then switch to the opponent’s action if and only if it performed better than their own. The second consists in comparing with, and possibly imitating, an individual drawn at random from the population. The results of these rules are contrasted with each other and with those of a third, non-imitative rule, namely best response to the distribution of play in the previous period, which serves as an opposite benchmark. As discussed in Section 3.1 below, best response and pairwise imitation differ in underlying rationale, requirements, and sensitivity to information externalities. Due to its complexity, a best response to the distribution of play is seen as an instance of globally informed, deliberative decision-making. Conversely, pairwise imitation is relatively effortless, relies on local sources of information, and meets needs for quick action. Depending on payoffs and the matching process being considered, best response learning can select either the rewarding All Stag equilibrium or the inefficient All Hare equilibrium as the stochastically stable state. On the other hand, pairwise imitative rules select the riskless, Pareto-inferior equilibrium; when decisions are made out of short-sighted, me-against-someone-else comparisons, it is very difficult for a society to settle on a social contract. This result is robust to assuming assortative interactions — often regarded as one of the main forces underlying the emergence of cooperation — and some heterogeneity in agents’ decision rules. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and gives some background on imitative rules. Section 3 sets up the model. Section 4 presents the main results and checks their robustness to alternative model specifications. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.",

Industry structure and evolution are shaped by firms persistently searching for, and adopting, new ideas and new organizational forms in their struggle for survival and for industrial leadership (Dosi and Nelson 2010). Few seminal contributions have emphasized the key role of scientific and technological paradigms in shaping the evolution of industries (see Nelson and Winter 1982; Dosi 1982; Dosi 1988). Along this tradition, since the Eighties networks of innovators have been studied in the literature as a key feature of industry structure and evolution (see Pisano 1991; Galambos and Sturchio 1998; Arora and Gambardella 1994; Powell et al. 1996; Orsenigo et al. 1997; Henderson et al. 1999). In fact, a division of innovative labour through collaborative agreements between small firms generating new ideas and large companies specialized in development and commercialization had diffused across different technological fields and industries (see Grayson 1960; Arora and Gambardella 1990; Arrow 1993; Arora et al. 2009), sustaining a collective distributed effort to reach a balance between exploration of multiple research trajectories and their exploitation (March 1991). In particular, the seminal contribution of Orsenigo et al. (1997, 2001) established a direct connection between the structure and evolution of knowledge bases and the structure and evolution of collaborative R&D in pharmaceutical innovation, studied as a science-intensive industry (see Gambardella and et al., 1995). Patterns of scientific and technological change concurred to transform some of the fundamental sources of competitive advantage of pharmaceutical firms. Over time, companies progressively redesigned their competencies and roles in drug discovery and development, within a dense network of contractual relations. Orsenigo et al. (2001) and Riccaboni and Pammolli (2002) showed how technological trajectories within the industry shaped the emergence and structural evolution of an extensive network of R&D contractual agreements between firms. Starting from the mid Seventies, the biotechnology revolution (Orsenigo 1989; Galambos and Sturchio 1996; Nightingale and Martin 2004; McKelvey et al. 2004) and the molecularization of physiology, pathology and pharmacology sustained a transition from an industry dominated by a stable core of large firms founded in the XIX Century to a novel division of labor between large firms and a new generation of innovative start up companies, vulnerable since they lacked the financial resources that would have necessary to play as integrated pharmaceutical companies (Arrow 1993; Pammolli 1996; Galambos and Sewell 1997). Orsenigo et al. (2001) found that, being grounded in novel scientific and technological knowledge bases, new research hypotheses and opportunities tended to be originated, under conditions of uncertainty, by cohorts of new specialized small firms active in specific domains. Over time, new originators entered the industry to exploit new research hypotheses, and a complex collaborative network raised, to match exploration of new research hypotheses with development capabilities. In the early stages of network evolution, established pharmaceutical companies were able to exploit their absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990) and their first mover advantage in clinical development and commercialization. Essentially, they succeeded in integrating most of the research hypotheses generated by the new entrants, who lacked financial resources to develop in-house promising new research opportunities they are able to generate (see Arrow 1993; Grayson 1960; Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Arora et al.2009; Pammolli 1996). In this phase, innovative activities continued to be dominated by a “quasi-random” search process (Malerba et al. 2016) and the entry of new companies did not imply a significant alteration of market structure as measured by market shares and firm turnover (see McKelvey et al., 2004 ). Both the final market and the R&D network continued to be dominated by a relatively small group of incumbent companies, which succeeded as “serial innovators” (Schumpeter 1934; Dosi et al. 1995; Malerba and Orsenigo 1996; 1997) with a corresponding remarkable stability of structure industry (Sutton 2001; Bottazzi et al. 2001; Pammolli and Riccaboni 2004; Buldyrev et al. 2020). However, over time the R&D network experienced radical changes in the roles of different actors. First, new general purpose research technologies in combinatorial chemistry and hightroughput screening enabled the emergence of a new generation of start up companies, which were able to sell their services and platforms to both large established big pharmaceutical companies and new biotech firms. Second, some of the new entrants succeeded in combining research collaborations with large companies and the development of their own successful projects and products. Those companies, which succeeded, finally started to become integrated pharmaceutical companies thanks to the high specificity of their research hypothesis and to the reduction of the cost of testing them (see Pammolli1996; Riccaboni and Moliterni 2009; Pammolli et al. 2020). Third, some of the large established companies succeeded in developing, also through collaborations and acquisitions, their own capabilities in the new fields opened by the molecular and genomic revolution, while the rate of entry of new specialized Originators has started to decreased. In this paper, we investigate how the evolution of the R&D collaboration network in pharmaceuticals has been shaped by a variety of underlying technological and relational regimes, which have co-evolved, complementing each other. In particular we investigate whether the relational mechanisms described by Orsenigo et al. (2001) are still in place in the pharmaceutical sector at the present days or whether new technological regimes have shaped the structure of the collaborative network. We document a promiscuity of roles between firms acting as Originators and as Developers after 2000: Originators have begun to act also as Developers, while some of the established Developers have incorporated the new research technologies and have started to act also as Originators of new projects and collaborative alliances and analogously, biotech firms have started to play also as Developers of R&D projects originated by both large and small firms. In our analysis, we combine an explorative topological inspections of the graph representing the contractual relations between firms at different points in time and a parsimonious stochastic representation of network formation (see Buldyrev et al., 2020 ). First, we have been inspired by Simon (1962) to analyze the transition between relational regimes, without introducing any assumption on the underlying dynamical laws ruling the evolution of the network (Riccaboni 2000; Pammolli and Riccaboni 2003) and, instead, relying on topological inspection of the network to infer some of their key features. Second, we complement our explorative topological analysis of the network with a parsimonious stochastic framework of network formation, which, once again, builds upon the seminal contribution of Herbert A. Simon (Simon 1955; Ijiri and Simon 1977; Barabási and Albert 1999; Buldyrev et al. 2020). We show that in the early stages of the evolution of the network of collaborative alliances, older established companies acting as Developers were able to capture new opportunities to collaborate proportionally to the number of their collaborations they had already in place (this is the so-called preferential attachment or rich get richer phenomenon). In a second stage of network evolution, the emergence of Originators which sold their technologies and services to both large and small firms produced those departures from the previous configuration, which were first documented by Orsenigo et al. (2001), with a dramatic change in the underlying relational regimes. Accordingly, the formerly dominant preferential attachment formation mechanism started to coexist with a second regime, were new links were established irrespectively of Developers’ connectivity. Finally, we document how the subsequent evolution of the network continued to be shaped by the co-existence of those basic relational regimes and, more and more, by changes in the roles of Originators and Developers. The paper is organized as follows. First, we expand the analysis of Orsenigo et al. (2001) to study the growth of the network over time. We extract relevant information on the evolution of the network, which allow us to characterize the roles of different types of actors in terms of their structural positions in the network (see Simon, 1962). Second, based on the results of our topological investigation, a simple network formation model is introduced, to account for the empirically observed patterns. In Section 2, we describe the dataset used for the analysis and the methods employed to describe the topological evolution of the collaboration network. In Section 3, we discuss our empirical results, while Section 4 introduces a network formation framework that we propose to reproduce the key results observed in Section 3. Section 5 concludes.",3

The hypothesis certainly proved correct, but for reasons different from those the author imagined. The role of agriculture in the Chinese economy declined rapidly, its employment share falling below 25% of the labor force by 2014 while its contribution to value added fell from a third in the 1970s to below 10% in 2014 (see Fig. 1). This was accompanied by a period of unprecedented growth, profound economic reorganization, and China’s rise into the group of technological advanced societies. For details on the reforms and the resulting changes in economics and policy, see, e.g. Brandt and Rawski (2008) and Fan et al. (2003). Unemployment was not a major concern, although large parts of the population moved to urban regions; the share of the industrial sector in the economy remained roughly constant in terms of output (value addedFootnote 1) while the service sector grew at the expense of the agricultural sector (Fig. 1).
 Changes in value added shares by sectors (data from Holz (2006) until 1999, after that from WIOD). Period covered in our micro-data and sectoral data shaded The details are more complicated, however. Growth of output and growth of employment differ significantly between sectors, labor productivities diverge, and unique dynamics emerge, setting the developing Chinese economy apart from the other extensively studied economies of developed countries. What is more, sectors are also not homogeneous entities but rich ecosystems of a variety of firms the characteristics of and growth dynamics of which differ widely, although firm-level variables can be recovered by regular distributional models with great accuracy. The present paper aims to shed light on the details of this structural change. We propose a multi-level framework of structural change that connects sectoral level and firm-level, the two levels on which we have empirical data. The framework is stated in equation form, it is testable and it will be used for the econometric analysis in Section 5. Further, we investigate whether a variety of correlation laws known from the literature as Fabricant’s laws (Fabricant 1942; Scott 1991; Metcalfe et al. 2006) hold at the sectoral and at the micro-level. Assessing whether empirical laws hold across multiple levels of aggregation allows us to understand where the regularities originate; whether they are universal properties of a self-organizing system, that might hold at every level, or emergent patterns, that arise at a specific level. If the economy is characterized by fractal, self-similar structures, we might assume that empirical observations at aggregated levels are mirrored in more detailed data, at the micro-level. Scaling relationships, for which this is the case, have indeed been found in many economic phenomena, from financial market time series (Marsili et al. 2002) to price developments (Farmer and Lafond 2016) to economic geography (Bustos et al. 2012; Haldane 2019) to industrial organization and firm-level data (Schwarzkopf et al. 2010). While this view is typical for a complex systems perspective in economics, Metcalfe et al. (2006), writing from an evolutionary economic perspective, appear to consider a similar view when forging their empirical findings into a general model of structural change and economic growth. Martin and Sunley (2007) offer a comprehensive overview over the complex systems perspective and potential synergies to evolutionary economics. Of course, scaling laws do not have to extend to the micro-level. Sometimes empirical laws emerge from phenomena at intermediate levels, in which case the characterization of these intermediate levels and the associated phenomena are of particular interest. While we can mostly confirm these laws at the sectoral level, we will show that they do, in fact, fall apart at the micro-level. We will characterize the properties and the dynamic processes at work in this multi-level system of structural change. Further, we address some related questions such as the nature of distributions of variables at the firm level and the autocorrelation and dispersion of the sectoral composition of the Chinese economy. We also show the development of some of the larger sectors in detail and offer some policy implications in the context of development economics, evolutionary economics, and industrial organization. China’s structural reforms were clearly a driving factor in China’s structural change. There were extensive privatization efforts, private enterprises were legalized and encouraged, rural industry was privatized, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were reformed. The PR China also increasingly encouraged foreign investments starting in the late 1970s, first promoting joint venture type ownership structures before allowing more direct foreign investments in Special Economic Zones, several of which were established starting in the 1980s. In 1988, the constitution was revised to legalize the private sector; private enterprises were now considered to be complementary to the socialist economy. Amendments in 1999 and 2004 further protected and encouraged private entrepreneurship and strengthened the private sector. Significant reforms of SOEs and TVEs (Township and Village Enterprises) were undertaken starting in the 1990s. Efforts were also made to stimulate innovation and to bolster R&D (Hu and Jefferson 2008); this included tax incentives and grants, improved formal procedures and legal framework in economic policy, enterprise law and patenting, consolidation and privatization of research institutes as well as some focused public research programs in basic and high-tech research (such as Program 863 and Program 973). There was also a focus on modernization of manufacturing sectors that aided productivity growth in this field (Brondino 2019). However, China’s development and transformation to a market economy was in many ways not spontaneous or unorganized, different perhaps from other transformation economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. There was structural change towards a market oriented system, but the transformation was government-organized and the economy remains partly under the control of the planned economic system (Shen et al. 2019). For example, early reforms in the 1970s and 1980s encouraged local management and stakeholders to assume a more active role in defining the firms’ objectives and strategy, first in agricultural TVEs, later in other SOEs (Naughton 2008).Footnote 2 Before 1998, the ownership type of the firms was rarely changed and state ownership was typically retained. The more radical and substantial SOEs reform in 1998 allowed privatizing SOEs and layoffs of substantial numbers of employees. TVEs were subject to a similar reform; the TVEs share of China’s GDP dropped from 65.1% in 1993 to 9.1% in 2000. This had multiple obvious effects for the industry structure: Large SOEs quickly lost ground, a multitude of private start-ups were established and the firm population became much younger across the board (see Section 4 and in particular Fig. 8). The layoffs likely also fueled the rise of the services sector the employment share of which grew from 30% in 2000 to 45% in 2014. China’s entry into the WTO in 2001 brought increased international integration of the Chinese economy, reduced tariff uncertainty, and fueled productivity growth of especially those regions and sectors with more reliance on exports and exposure to foreign investment (Erten and Leight 2019; Brandt et al. 2017). Unlike most countries, China also increasingly relies on domestic inputs for exportation, despite its deepening global engagement (Kee and Tang 2016). Finally, a four trillion Yuan fiscal stimulus program in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, while averting larger fallouts of the crisis, may have extended the life-span of many struggling firms, SOEs in particular (Yan 2020). It is to be expected that these processes would have had an impact on the dynamics of structural change at various levels. The fact that economic growth was rapid in China in the 1990s and 2000s, reaching growth rates around 10%, probably accelerated the structural change brought about by modernization and the reforms towards a market economy. At the same time, the Chinese case is unique in that detailed micro-level data are available that permit us to investigate structural change not just at the sectoral but also at the firm level (see Section 4). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous literature contributions, Section 3 offers some considerations on modeling of structural change at the sectoral and the micro-level with a focus on empirical applicability. Section 4 discusses empirical regularities, Section 5 fits some of the models introduced in Section 3. Section 6 concludes.",1

According to the prevailing commodity view, ‘sound money’ had to either consist of precious metals or be strictly backed by them. Carl Menger thus explained the evolution of money as a market-driven spontaneous order, which must eventually converge towards a good of utmost saleability. Later the situation changed due to factual circumstances, when fiat money became common after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s. However, the basic premises of monetary theory seemed largely settled, and the discipline was reluctant to re-examine them. Fundamental questions about the actual phenomenology of money had little appeal, as the vanguard of monetary research advanced ever new theoretical models of growing complexity. As a consequence, the recent advent of digital crypto-currencies that are based on inventive algorithms developed by computer scientists eventually took the economics discipline by surprise. The key message of this paper is that digitization forces us to rethink the basic phenomenology of money in the sense of Schumpeter’s conception of a social technology of account in the credit economy. At a time when money was generally conceived in its material form and intrinsic qualities, he identified its principal function with the clearing of current accounts that establish the accepted differences between debits and claims. He even pointed at a hypothetical general ledger of economic transactions as its purest form and logical conclusion. Furthermore, he believed that in the course of history the evolution of a form tends to crystallize its essential nature and indispensable functions and he was confident that this also applies to the social institution of money. The argument is elaborated in three steps. Section 2 starts with the Austrian theoretical discourse on the proper phenomenology of money, contrasting Menger’s canonical explanation with the ‘heretical’ and largely forgotten views of Wieser and Schumpeter. The latter correspond not only with modern historical records, but also surprisingly well with the recent development of digital currencies. Section 3 offers a brief look back at the early origins of money and shows that credit and related accounts became important drivers of financial development long before coins were minted. In Section 4 two major innovations of the current digitization of money are examined. First, the emergence of crypto coins, which demonstrates the technical feasibility of Hayek’s earlier vision of competing private currencies. And second, the upcoming policy response in the form of ‘central bank digital currencies’ (CBDCs). Section 5 concludes by contrasting the idea of spontaneous order through competing private currencies with the role of deliberate policy choices in the design of public digital fiat currencies.",11

TCE analyzes alternative governance structures while addressing the firm’s performance, its transaction attributes, and its external environment (Masten 1993). Carroll et al. (1999) stated that TCE, as a theory of organization, deliberates on ‘efficiency’. Moreover, Mahoney (1992) maintained the premise that ‘efficient’ transaction costs and ‘efficient’ organizational structures embodied a symbiotic relationship. Incurring transaction costs embody the costs, both ex ante and ex post, that are coupled with the decision to internalize market-transactions under a hierarchy (Williamson 1985; Mahoney 1992). Currently, most TCE empirical studies focus on contracts (Macher and Richman 2008). Consequently, this empirical study broadens its perspective to include the potential sources of transaction costs that limit the boundaries of a firm, particularly with regards to manufacturers competing in the Chilean truck market. Hence, by undergoing a transaction cost analysis (TCA) through two distinct empirical cases, this study will identify transactions as the number of units of heavy-duty truck sold between the contracting parties, namely the manufacturers (sellers) and dealers (buyers) in the Chilean market. The measurement of ‘efficient’ organizational performance among manufacturers is represented as the boundaries of the firms with respect to quantity of brands, which closely resemble the firms’ competitive market share. A firm’s boundaries remain of significant importance to economic theorists when determining internal and external determinants that impact their size, shape, and organizational performance (Belcher 1997). With regards to the theory of a firm’s boundaries, this empirical study investigates the Chilean truck market by applying three generalized principles: (1) brand culture as asset specificity of manufacturers’ intangible resources in order to conduct market penetration and evaluate competition within the Chilean market, (2) the firms’ resource endowment, that is, to financially offer international financing for their dealers, and (3) the firm’s specificity as the functionality of the firm, which is to efficiently satisfy market demand for specific environmental emission-efficient heavy-duty vehicles (Zott et al. 2006). Two empirical analyses on transaction cost determinants of the manufacturers competing in the Chilean truck industry assist to address these three principles pertaining to the boundaries of these producers. From the introduction in Sect. 1, the study proceeds to review the market relevance and industry background of Chile in Sect. 2; followed by highlights of the related literature, parameter selection, and hypotheses in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the data and outlines the study’s methodology. Empirical results and robustness checks are covered in Sect. 5. Section 6 elaborates on the overall discussion and limitations of this article, followed by Sect. 7 that presents the concluding remarks and assessments.",

Thorstein Veblen (1899) used the concept to bring forward original and provocative insights about the relation between consumer behavior and social status. Whereas Veblen focused on the elite of the middle to late nineteenth century western societies, conspicuous consumption is not limited to particular social groups but has an enormous diffusion to a vast part of contemporary human population. Over the past decades, consumers belonging in different economic, religious, ethnic and linguistic groups are increasingly engaged in conspicuous consumption. Has conspicuous consumption evolved? What are the psychological mechanisms that underlie conspicuous consumption? And can we relate human economic decisions to the evolution of a culture that rewards conspicuous consumption? Answering these questions is a daunting task. Sociological, biological, psychological and economic factors are deeply intertwined in the process of conspicuous consumption and it is difficult to completely isolate them from each other. Moreover, conspicuous consumption is a phenomenon driven by social interactions embedded in cultural groups, socioeconomic classes and communities in different regions and countries. Hence, it is hard to assert the primacy of particular causal factors. A growing body of research attempts to explain consumer behaviors by applying evolutionary insights and methods (Miller 2001 and 2009, Saad 2014, Witt 2017). The current trend in the evolutionary literature is to explain conspicuous consumption by applying sexual selection and costly signaling theory. A number of papers argue that conspicuous consumption has evolved as a sexually selected mating strategy that provides reproductive benefits to males (e.g. Zak and Park 2002, Griskevicius et al., 2007, De Fraja 2009, Nelissen and Meijers 2011, Sundie et al. 2011, Collins Baer and Weber 2015). Like peacocks’ large and colorful tails, conspicuous consumption impedes males’ chances of survival while it confers mating benefits. In what follows, I examine the arguments put forward by these evolutionary researchers and I identify areas of controversy that may spark a debate among economists, psychologists and evolutionary biologists. Given that evolutionary theory can contribute to our understanding of consumption practices,Footnote 1 I argue that in the recent literature evolutionary researchers attempt to examine the evolutionary underpinnings of conspicuous consumption without analyzing evidence about the ancestral environment, human psychological characteristics or socio-cultural parameters. In particular, an evolutionary explanation of conspicuous consumption based on sexual selection and costly signaling theory faces three problems: First, there is the issue of defining conspicuous consumption: Does this trait refer to psychological capacities that we have or certain types of behavior in which we engage? Second, there is the issue of whether conspicuous consumption has evolved as a sexually selected mating strategy: Conspicuous consumption does not conform to the conditions for the reliability of costly signaling traits. Third, there is an issue of the type of evidence needed to support an evolutionary explanation based on sexual selection and costly signaling theory: Available ethnographic evidence from foraging societies cast doubt whether conspicuous consumption evolved as a mating strategy. Given these problems, it is worth exploring alternative theories that could explain the evolution of conspicuous consumption. In particular, cultural evolution theory provides a plausible way to study consumption behaviors in modern environments. One answer to the question of why people engage in conspicuous consumption involves cultural transmission: people observe and learn the behaviors of others during social interactions. The implication is that conspicuous consumption does not evolve as a display to potential mates but as a result of pre-existing evolved psychological traits. Cultural evolution theory provides a framework that allows researchers to identify and classify the psychological biases that underlie conspicuous consumers. In contrast to an explanation based on sexual selection and costly signaling theory that focuses on displays that attract potential mates, I suggest that our psychological learning biases have a crucial motivating role in consumption decisions, including conspicuous consumption. These biases are genetically transmitted traits that influence the acquisition and retention of conspicuous consumption in the population. Some clarifications are in order. Cultural evolution theory has not made any major inroad into economics, despite its growing representation in contemporary evolutionary research. Given the novelty of applying this account to the study of economic behavior, I focus on the role of social learning biases in consumers’ decisions. However, the claim of this paper is not that the list of psychological biases I will present is exhaustive. Neither do I suggest that there are no other theoretical frameworks that could explain why we conspicuously consume. Instead, the aim is more modest: To present an evolutionary account that can facilitate future research on conspicuous consumption. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section I provide a brief and general introduction to sexual selection and costly signaling theory, focusing on the aspects I consider more relevant for the study of conspicuous consumption. In section 3, I examine what kind of traits evolutionary researchers have in mind by conspicuous consumption. Section 4 explores in more depth whether conspicuous consumption does in fact possess the main features of sexual adaptations. Section 5 deals with evolutionary history and the importance of evidence about the ancestral environment to support hypotheses about sexual adaptations. Section 6 explores areas of research where cultural evolution can provide an original contribution with its commitment to develop hypotheses informed by psychology and evolutionary theory. I focus on cultural transmission biases that influence the propagation of conspicuous consumption in modern environments. Section 7 concludes.",

The Knowledge production function using SFA,April 2022,Cristian Barra,Nazzareno Ruggiero,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over time, an increasingly amount of economic literature has been devoted to embed regional innovation systems (RISs) within the perspective of evolutionary economics. Several contributions, see for instance Cooke et al. (1997, 1998), Lambooy and Boschma (2001), Iammarino (2005), Morgan (2007), Uyarra (2010) and Gunnarson and Wallin (2011), have therefore attempted to link regional science to evolutionary economics, sharing two main features. On the one hand, indeed, these papers are concerned with the role of regional policies in shaping the innovative performance of regions. According to Cooke et al. (1997, 1998), three main policy instruments can be employed by regional authorities to enhance regional innovation. Specifically, regional policies can enhance innovation by increasing the amount of financial resources devoted to innovative projects, by financing infrastructures-intended as both telecommunications infrastructures and network links-and, finally, by favouring regional cooperation and learning. Lambooy and Boschma (2001), instead, emphasise the relevance of policies aimed at creating a favourable environment for the creation, the diffusion and the adoption of new technologies, though they warn, in our opinion correctly, that these policies are destined to fail if they deviate from the local context. Gunnarson and Wallin (2011), on the other hand, suggest that the regional governance can control the development path of innovation by facilitating cooperative and interactive behaviours and by coordinating public investments devoted to the creation of knowledge. The second, and most important for the purposes of this paper, common element shared by these contributions, is instead represented by the explicit acknowledgment of the relevance of local institutions in explaining the dynamics of regional innovation systems. In particular, the co-evolution of institutions and innovation is assumed to be a key factor in explaining the trajectories of regional innovation systems. As notably remarked by Cooke et al. (1998, page 1580) “the systematic dimension of innovation at regional level relies upon a combination of a well-endowed organisational infrastructure and an associative superstructure composed of an embedded civil society capable of activating social capital. Institutionally speaking, embeddedness will reside in the collective social order which evolves according to an informal microconstitution composed of microregulatory conventions, habits, routines, and rules of the game. Systematic innovation is facilitated by the constructive interaction of the institutional order and the organisation infrastructure”. Morgan (2007), on the other hand, stresses that, given the evolutionary nature of capitalism, the relevance of the quality of institutions lies in their ability to reduce the uncertainty and the instability faced by innovative entrepreneurs. Haschka and Herwartz (2020), propose a Bayesian stochastic frontier approach to assess the determinants of innovation efficiency in four high-technology sectors in Europe (i.e. chemicals, general electronics, pharmaceutical products and rubber and plastic products). Although their evidence indicates that R&D investments represent the major driver of innovation activities, a key role found for the flows of knowledge from neighbour areas or firms. Specifically, the geographical closeness to universities and competitors are found to stimulate the creation and the development of local networks and, through that, to promote and improve innovativeness. In particular, they show that firm-level innovation increases with the level of market competition, as the latter incentivises firms to undertake innovative activities to avoid other firms to prevail in the market. Further, their evidence points out to a differentiated effect of knowledge spillovers, which crucially depend on the sector examined. Indeed, firms operating in highly competitive sectors, such as pharmaceutical and chemicals, are more incentivised to pursue firm-level efficiency compared to general electronics and rubber and plastic products, where the degree of competition is lower. Though these contributions explicitly acknowledge that the regional institutional environment can play a key role in affecting regional innovation systems, little is said on how institutional quality affects their efficiency. In this paper, using regional data from Italy over the 2004–2011 period, we investigate the effects of local institutional quality on the regional innovation system (hereafter RIS) efficiency. In particular, we believe that an analysis based on Italy represents a promising field of analysis for various different reasons. The first, and somewhat more obvious, is represented by the persistent and large regional divides, in terms of both economic outcomes and institutional quality, between the core areas of the Centre-North and the peripheral regions of the South. However, beyond the persistent regional dualism, whose roots can be found in the different effectiveness and efficiency of the institutional environment (Tabellini, 2010; D’Agostino and Scarlato, 2015). there are other reasons which make, in our opinion, the Italian context particularly appealing. Indeed, two peculiar aspects of the Italian economy are respectively represented by the prevalence of Small and Medium firms (SMEs) (Cucculelli and Peruzzi, 2020a; Cisi et al., 2020) and by a concentrated ownership structure, as a large share of firms are owned and managed at the family level (Carletti et al., 2020; Cucculelli and Peruzzi, 2020b). Moreover, compared to other industrialised economies, Italy has historically exhibited a poor performance in terms of R&D intensity, whose levels did not converge to the ones registered by other OECD countries (Awaworyi Churchill et al. 2020). Further, as shown by Borin et al. (2014), the lower effectiveness and efficiency of the Italian institutional environment significantly constrained its growth, as it halted Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), which have been proven to be a relevant source of technological transfer and productivity. Given these considerations, we therefore believe that assessing the efficiency of the Italian RIS and evaluating how the quality of institutions affects the efficiency with which the RIS converts inputs into output, and hence, knowledge, is of significance importance for both scholars and policy-makers. It must be also clarified that the definition of institutional quality employed in this paper follows the approach of Kaufmann et al. (2010). Accordingly, governance is broadly defined as “the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes (a) the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; (b) the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and (c) the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.” (Kaufmann et al., 2010 page 4). For the empirical purposes of the paper, we propose the application of a knowledge production function, estimated through a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). In particular, although the previous literature on the Italian economy has proven that the quality of institutions has some role in stimulating both Total Factor Productivity (TFP) (Lasagni et al., 2015; Albanese et al., 2020) and patenting activities (D’Ingiullo and Evangelista, 2020), we believe that the SFA methodology, compared to these approaches, offers various different advantages. Specifically, the application of the SFA approach allows us to evaluate the efficiency with which the RIS converts inputs into output and to appraise how far the RIS is relatively to its best practices, summarised by the stochastic frontier (Triebs and Kumbhakar, 2018), something which cannot be directly captured neither by the TFP, nor by the amount of registered patents. Another advantage of the SFA compared to these alternative approaches lies in the fact that, through its application, it is possible to evaluate whether an improvement in the quality of institutions favours a more efficient use of resources, hence moving the RIS closer to its best practices. Following this discussion, this contribution aims at testing the following hypothesis: H1) the evolution of the institutional environment enhances RIS efficiency. Beyond providing an empirical analysis of the interactions between the quality of institutions and the RIS efficiency, this paper also employs a Fixed Effects estimator to investigate whether the benchmark results differ once a traditional knowledge production function is considered. We believe, hence, that our contribution is relevant even once we move away from the evolutionary perspective, where the nexus between the quality of institutions and RIS efficiency has received little attention, both theoretically and empirically. Indeed, the theoretical literature has been mostly concerned with the impact of institutional quality upon growth and innovation. Specifically, Rivera-Batiz (2002) proposes an endogenous growth model aimed at assessing the relationship between democracy, governance and innovation. The main theoretical prediction of this model is that improved democracy promotes innovation, provided that such an improvement is accompanied by a corresponding strengthening of governance. The latter, in particular, discourages corruption among public officials and makes innovative projects relatively more profitable, hence stimulating economic growth. Tebaldi and Elmslie (2008), on the other hand, developed a theoretical setting to investigate the relationships between institutional quality and long-run growth. To theoretically evaluate the impact of institutions upon economic growth, they propose a composite index of institutional quality which includes factors like control of corruption, pro-market regulations, the perceived effectiveness of the judiciary system and of the public administration and, finally, contract and property rights enforcement. According to their findings, countries with weak institutions exhibit low rates of technological change and output growth, a result which is essentially driven by the fact that countries with weak institutions generate an inefficient allocation of the available human capital in the economy. Aghion et al. (2016), within a Schumpeterian growth model,Footnote 1 assess the relationship between taxation, corruption and innovation. They show that increased corruption decreases the optimal tax revenues which, in turn, diminishes the investment in public infrastructures, hence discouraging innovation. At the same time, they show that increased corruption reduces the entrance in the market of potential innovative entrepreneurs. From an empirical perspective, though an abundant literature has investigated the impact of the quality of institutions upon the innovative performance of countries and firms, see for instance Giménez and Sanaú (2007), Asongu et al. (2018), Cahn et al. (2019) and Clò et al. (2020),Footnote 2 just a limited amount of papers has instead analysed how institutions interact with efficiency. Examples of this limited literature are, to the best of our knowledge, the contributions of Méon and Weill (2005), Castiglione et al. (2018) and Aldieri et al. (2020), which show unanimous consensus in ascertaining that increased quality of institutions is associated with higher efficiency. In particular, Méon and Weill (2005), identify three main channels through which bad governance is translated into lower efficiency. These channels can be summarised as follows: a) bad governance acts like a tax on innovators and diverts resources from productive activities. This, in turn, has a detrimental effect on both the accumulation of productive resources and the efficiency with which they are employed. From this perspective, typical examples are corruption and political instability. In particular, while corruption discourages productive activities as it acts like a tax on innovators that reduces the expected gains from investments, increased political instability heightens the risks related to productive economic activities, hence preventing them; b) bad governance reduces the incentives to invest in innovation. In particular, a weak rule of law forces innovative entrepreneurs to invest in property right protection, while an inefficient regulatory distorts entrepreneurs’ incentives, as they might find more profitable to take advantage of weak property rights and engage litigation, rather than innovating. An ineffective government, on the other hand, is assumed to stimulate rent-seeking rather than productive activities; c) bad governance hampers the diffusion of knowledge as it promotes the accumulation of generic rather than specific capital and discourages foreign direct investments. To anticipate our findings, the empirical evidence reported in this paper indicates that most of the institutional factors considered in the analysis play no role in affecting RIS efficiency, as we find a positive and highly significant impact for government effectiveness only, which drives the positive effect detected for one of the two composite indices of institutional quality employed in the paper. This result is robust to different assumptions about the underlying technology, to alternative lag structures between R&D and patenting activities and to the application of different R&D inputs. Moreover, this evidence is confirmed once instead of the RIS efficiency, we appraise the impact of institutional quality on the amount of registered patents, through the application of a canonical knowledge production function.Footnote 3 Two main policy prescriptions can be drawn from the empirical analysis performed in this paper. On the one hand, measures that improve and strengthen the endowment of regional socio-economic structures are highly desirable, as they enhance both RIS efficiency and patenting activities. Further, interventions for Southern regions should be designed to reduce the technological and efficiency gap with the core regions of the country. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the methodology used to estimate RIS efficiency. Section 3 describes the data, the production set and the empirical specifications proposed in the paper. The empirical evidence is described in Section 4, while Section 5 provides a sensitivity analysis. Section 6 concludes and discusses the main policy implications.",3

Their diffusion has also been spurred by the recent resurgence of interest towards a proactive industrial policy that responds to market failures and take into consideration social and environmental challenges (Rodrik 2004; Aiginger and Rodrik 2020), relying upon the drivers of high-road strategy, such as innovation, education, the adoption of new technologies, and sustainability, and addressing the collaboration between the government and the private sector (Aiginger and Rodrik 2020). In the context of smart specialisation strategy, cluster policy aims at tackling information and coordination failures of actors within innovation systems (Anderson et al. 2004) and the related underinvestment leading to suboptimal levels in the variety of economic activities in an economy, supporting cooperative relationships between the government and economic agents (De La Maza et al. 2012; Aranguren Querejeta and Wilson 2013). The literature has underlined that policy-driven cluster initiatives are different from spontaneous clusters in a cluster configuration, forms of cooperation, management and governance styles, performance, and value creation (Ferreira et al., 2012). Policy-driven cluster initiatives are usually more focused on public benefits and regional development. In contrast, spontaneous clusters support the needs of a specific group of businesses and intend to stimulate entrepreneurship (Fromhold-Eisebith and Eisebith 2005). The establishment of clusters by governments has been often justified by market failures associated with the provision of public goods (such as lack of skills, infrastructure, and R&D) and coordination failures (OECD 2000). Despite the growing interest in the topic, few empirical studies examine the process of value creation in cluster initiatives (Alberti and Belfanti 2019; 2021). Since clusters involve different actors and local stakeholders intending to transform regional economic systems and increase competitiveness, understanding their evolution and performance represents an important step towards evaluating EU regional policy (Asheim et al. 2017; Foray 2018; Lecluyse et al. 2019). In this respect, one of the most exciting avenues for research and policy debate refers to the analysis of cluster initiatives as a tool for implementing smart specialisation strategy (Aranguren Querejeta and Wilson 2013), which is a relatively new strategic approach to innovation-based regional growth in the EU. Many studies have confirmed a positive effect of cluster membership on the capability of cluster members to innovate and grow (Baptista and Swann 1998; Aranguren Querejeta et al. 2014). This impact unfolds through linkages, networking and the incorporation of different public and private organisations that interact, cooperate, share knowledge, and jointly provide value, develop new products, technologies, and services (e.g., Adner and Kapoor 2010; Baptista and Swann 1998; Baptista and Swann 1999; Laur et al. 2012; Ingstrup and Damgaard 2013). However, cluster initiatives might also fail (Sölvell et al. 2003), which is often the case with policy-driven clusters (Nightingale and Coad 2020). Policy-driven clusters can be simply a means for cluster participants to obtain windfall profits by externalising some internal costs instead of tackling some key market failures, thereby increasing innovative activities beyond the existing levels (Nightingale and Coad 2020). The inability to explicitly address the market failures as a major goal of cluster initiatives leaves the space for rent-seeking activities if clusters are used for lobbying for protection that is beyond the provision of public goods (OECD 2000). The generation of public and private values in the context of policy-driven cluster initiatives depends upon cluster actors, their individual characteristics, and facilitators that coordinate and promote the process of cluster evolution and the mechanisms of growth and development, which vary substantially across different industrial sectors (Su and Hung 2009; Huang et al. 2012; Ingstrup and Damgaard 2013; Hsieh et al. 2012; Alberti and Belfanti 2021). Different sectors require different policy actions and services and different management approaches and cluster governance, which impacts how value is generated and delivered in policy-driven clusters representing different sectors. In this paper, we examine how cluster initiatives developed by the government might generate value for their members across different sectors while promoting cluster growth and development within the smart specialisation strategy domain. Following the assumption that cluster initiatives are collaborative organisations whose development crucially depends on business support, we operationalise the driving forces for cluster development and growth through the business services cluster initiatives should provide to meet members’ expectations. We consider the perceived performance of the CCC as an indicator of value creation. Furthermore, we investigate what modes of management and cluster governance are most conducive to value creation across different sectors. In doing so, we explore the interesting case of Competitiveness Clusters in Croatia (hereafter CCC), a unique type of pre-planned policy-driven cluster initiatives that play an important role in implementing Croatia’s smart specialisation strategy. CCC cover 13 different industries ranging from low-tech, traditional manufacturing sectors to advanced service sectors, and we believe that this constitutes a perfect setting to explore the different types of services members expect from clusters. We exploit data from an original survey of 250 CCC members. Our paper contributes to the literature on value creation in policy-driven cluster initiatives in the following ways. First, we examine the value creation process from the members’ point of view across different types of industries. We determine whether and how CCC representing different industrial sectors might create value and discuss how private and public interests are aligned in value generation for cluster members. Our study extends the paper Anić et al. (2019) that looked at the most relevant objectives pursued by CCC and explored the differences related to the expected benefits members require from CCC. The existing contributions in the literature concerning the value creation for policy-driven clusters’ members have not considered sectoral specificities, even if it is well documented that different industries require different competencies and different types of support from cluster organisations (Andersson et al. 2004). There is evidence that the benefits from policy-driven cluster membership depend on the maturity of the industry, the process of technology diffusion, the links between firms and the university, the existence of networks among the different members and the role of venture capital (Braunerhjelm et al. 2000). Second, we investigate and compare what modes of management and governance are most effective in delivering value to CCC members across different industries. The theory suggests that the way the cluster management interacts with members and the governance of clusters have some peculiar traits in policy-driven clusters compared to spontaneous clusters (e.g., Fromhold-Eisebith and Eisebith 2005; Ingstrup 2013; Jungwirth and Müller 2014). However, the literature on this issue is limited (Chiaroni and Chiesa 2006), especially concerning the competitiveness of cluster initiatives in implementing smart specialisation strategy. We also intend to discuss the variance of different management and governance modes considering sectoral specificities. Our final contribution refers to the context of analysis, i.e., Croatia. Past research shows that cluster initiatives operate differently in diverse environments, which has a very different impact on clusters’ operational practices and performance (Ketels et al. 2006). Besides the macroeconomic environment, the industrial tradition and innovation system in each region produces differences in the growth of cluster initiatives in different sectors (Braunerhjelm et al. 2000). Croatia is a relatively new EU member state that has started the process of formal cluster development in 2013 and has even more recently adopted the smart specialisation strategy, therefore being still in the process of learning how to implement policy-driven clusters in practice. CCC have been promoted to enhance the competitiveness of different sectors. Still, their evolution and performance are very heterogeneous across industries, depending upon the alignment between the benefits required by the cluster members and the overall value provided by the clusters. In this context, our analysis intends to provide some policy recommendations on how to position CCC in value creation to be more attractive for their members and strengthen management and cluster governance in delivering value. The findings of our analysis might also help other new EU member states struggling with the cluster development process to gain new knowledge in this field. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical background, discussing the main characteristics and evolution of policy-driven cluster initiatives, the process of value creation, and the role of cluster management and governance. Section 3 outlines the program of competitiveness clusters in Croatia, while Sect. 4 illustrates the process of data collection and the methodology. Finally, Sects. 5 and 6 present and discuss the research results, while Sect. 7 provides conclusions and policy implications.",1

It is now widely recognized that the vast majority of growth experiences, even when considering now-rich countries, do not comply with a simple steady-state growth model (Ben-David and Papell 1995; Papell and Prodan 2014). Growth experiences are remarkably heterogeneous. Considering aggregate income data, it is common to observe several growth discontinuities of different kinds such as accelerations, collapses, sudden stops or level jumps (Easterly et al. 1993; Pritchett et al. 2000; Hausmann et al. 2005; Lamperti and Mattei 2018b). Nevertheless, there is clearly less consensus when it comes to characterizing growth instability with econometric models. A major issue is whether growth paths are better described by a trend-stationary model with relatively few structural breaks or by unit root processes in which permanent stochastic shocks are responsible for continuous changes. From an observational point of view, stationary models (or I(0) models) describe relatively stable growth dynamics with few changes in trend (e.g. growth accelerations or decelerations) or in levels (e.g. jumps or sudden falls). On the contrary, unit root processes (or integrated I(1) models) show an open trajectory depicted by random shocks with levels and trend continuously shifting at potentially any point in time. As pointed out by Perron et al. (2006), one should not restrict the analysis to these two limiting cases as there are several interesting instances in between. The key question is therefore: do the data reveal frequent and large growth discontinuities or do structural changes occur at most occasionally? From this standpoint, testing for unit roots, rather than discerning definitively between stationary vis-à-vis integrated models, allows for inferences to be drawn on where we stand between these two alternatives. Addressing this question has strong empirical and theoretical implications for practitioners working in the field of economic growth, by allowing researchers to inform new generations of growth models and to discern among existing ones, including for instance a comparison between endogenous growth and evolutionary models. Moreover, information on the presence of unit roots and structural breaks has clear relevance in many empirical applications such as convergence tests or the identification of growth episodes. We discuss these implications extensively in Section 2. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the presence of unit roots and structural breaks in long run time series of per capita GDP. Methodologically, we build upon the test in Kapetanios (2005) and add novel features to the literature, mainly along three dimensions: (i) we treat the number of breaks (not only their location) as unknown; (ii) we exploit the sequential approach of Bai (1997) to extend the number of breaks to four and, consequently, we include in the analysis also a group of developing countries with more volatile series; and (iii) we implement a robust search algorithm that resembles the practices for the identification of growth episodes adopted in the empirical literature. Our results provide less support for trend stationarity than previous contributions. In a sample of 34 countries we find 17 rejections of the unit root null hypothesis. Interestingly, developing countries exhibit only four rejections, thus, showing a more complex and unstable dynamics than advanced ones. Moreover, even less evidence against the unit root hypothesis is found when we relax the assumption of Gaussian innovations by using bootstrapped critical values. This points to the general conclusion according to which the dismissal of the unit root hypothesis in GDP series may be premature. In particular, more attention should be devoted to investigating the role of the various search algorithms implemented in unit root tests, as well as of the assumptions on the distribution of the shocks, in driving the evidence against integrated models. From a theoretical perspective, we conjecture a relationship to evolutionary growth models which point at remarkably heterogeneous growth trajectories with frequent discontinuities and non-Gaussian distributions of shocks. The remainder of this work proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses the theoretical and empirical implications of our analysis; Section 3 presents a literature review of existing tests and their applications; Section 4 describes the methodology; Section 5 shows some Monte Carlo experiments to assess power and size properties of the test in finite samples; Section 6 presents the empirical strategy while in Section 7 we introduce and discuss the results; Section 8 concludes.

32.0,3.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,30 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-022-00763-w,Can the evolution of joint savings agreements counter the effect of higher costs of migration on its intensity?,July 2022,Oded Stark,Marcin Jakubek,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to the canonical economic model of migration, if migration is costlier, there will be less of it. (Early examples of this model include the widely cited articles by Sjaastad, 1962, and Todaro, 1969.) In migration research and in migration policy formation, this notion has become the conventional wisdom, mainly because of its intuitive appeal. In this paper we show that an increase in the cost of migration can result in intensification of migration: we say that intensification occurs when more people migrate during a time interval that follows the increase in cost than would have migrated during the same time interval had there been no increase in cost. The reason for this outcome is that an increase in the cost of migration can trigger changes in the financial and social circumstances designed to enable would-be migrants to save enough to pay for the cost of their migration. Specifically, as explained below and modeled in the next two sections, the increase in cost can shift the line of demarcation between the set of lone savers and the set of joint savers in favor of the latter. Because saving jointly speeds up the accumulation of funds to pay for the cost of migration as compared to saving alone, the number of migrants during a time interval that follows the increase in the cost need not decrease, and may even increase. In a review of immigration in American history, Abramitzky and Boustan (2017) remark that in the nineteenth century “[o]nce migrant communities were established in US cities and rural areas, many prospective migrants were able to travel on prepaid tickets financed by friends or family” (p. 1314). In evaluating the role of costs in shaping migration patterns, Abramitzky and Boustan note that those costs “need not imply that the poor are priced out of migration because of a lack of credit or financing for their journey. Both in the past and the present, there is evidence that immigrant networks can alleviate such financial constraints” (p. 1325). Ilahi and Jafarey (1999) report that in Pakistan informal contracts agreed between migrants and their extended families, whereby the latter finance the migrants’ travel abroad: about 58% of the migrants borrow from their extended family, with the amounts borrowed covering, on average, nearly half of the cost of migration. Borrowing from the extended family is more common among migrants of rural origin, who face higher costs of migration and are on average poorer, than among migrants of urban origin. Akkoyunlu and Siliverstovs (2013) provide evidence that a higher cost of migration from Turkey to Germany encourages the conclusion of informal financial contracts between would-be migrants and their extended families to pay for the cost of migration, and that the remittances that the migrants send back are likely to be used to finance subsequent migration by other family members. Genicot and Senesky (2004) report that Mexican migrants whose travel to the US was arranged by “coyotes” (migrant smugglers) were more likely to have received financial support from relatives and friends than Mexicans who set off to the US on their own. A higher cost of migration (arising from paying a “coyote”) appears to have been linked to reliance on an extended financial support network. Indeed, Mexico-to-US migration, where an increase in border patrols made migration more difficult and hence more expensive, but possibly resulting in higher flows, could serve as a case study. Texts on migrants’ remittances have particularly acknowledged and documented that would-be migrants are helped by their families in obtaining the funds needed to pay for migration, and that once they have migrated and landed gainful employment they share their destination earnings with their families by means of remittances. (The articles on the reasons for sending remittances by Lucas and Stark, 1985, and by Stark and Lucas, 1988, have inspired a large empirical literature that has yielded insights about the motives for sending remittances and about the roles that the earnings of migrants and the incomes of their families play in determining the incidence of remittances and the sums remitted.) The line of reasoning advanced in this paper is distinct. We model the behavior of a would-be migrant who enters the “game” with own savings - these can be savings accumulated alone or jointly with his family - yet still faces a period of waiting in order to amass the required funds. Cooperation with another would-be migrant who faces a similar constraint is a strategy that goes farther than reliance on the support that might be provided by their own family. This perspective is similar to a setting in which a person who seeks insurance, while already covered by some level of self insurance, can gain from an exchange of insurance promises with another, independent self-insurer. And as mentioned below in footnote 7, the perspective has features reminiscent of Rotating Savings and Credit Associations. We consider a setting in which people who seek to migrate are financially constrained, so that prior to migrating they have to collect the funds needed to pay for the cost of migration and initial settlement in a country of destination where incomes are higher than at origin.Footnote 1 We assume that a would-be migrant can do this either by accumulating the required funds himself, “lone financing,” or by cooperating with another individual, “joint financing.” In lone financing, the financier and the migrant are one and the same, and the raising of funds to pay for migration precedes and is completed prior to migration. In joint financing, migration and the financing to pay for migration are intertwined: migration begins when sufficient funds are amassed to allow one of the joint savers to set off, and co-financing by the migrant, who lands a job in the country of destination, helps secure the funds needed to facilitate the migration of the co-saver who has yet to migrate. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. Lone financing is free from the possibility of others reneging, but it takes longer than (successful) joint financing. On the other hand, while joint financing speeds up the accumulation of funds, it is subject to the possibility that the co-saver who departs first might fail to support the migration of the co-saver who has yet to migrate.Footnote 2 What incentive does a migrant have not to renege? What measures are available to an individual, who contributed to the savings pool but did not end up as the first-to-go, to effectively dissuade the co-saver who has already left from reneging? If they use means that help cement joint saving, the perceived risk involved in joint financing can be moderated, and this form of financing will be attractive. Conversely, when such means are not available, lone saving will be more appealing. A standard menu of responses to the preceding two questions includes social deterrents, reputational concerns, and repeat transactions, with obvious linkages between the three. Compliance can be strengthened by applying social pressure, for example in the form of sanctions such as ostracizing the miscreant migrant and his family. The option of sanctioning will be effective when the migrant is close in social space to a co-saver who has yet to migrate, but will not have teeth when the contracting parties are distant in social space. Furthermore, sanctioning will be more effective when the migrant wants to keep open the option of return migration, regardless of whether return is imposed or voluntary, and regardless whether return is temporary or permanent. In the “grand” scheme of things, this implies that migration is not a final event, the last act in a sequence of moves; rather, it is a stage in a process, part of a broader, lasting, and dynamic relationship. (This discussion implies that although altruism can support compliance, if it is absent or fails, there are still available means to press for adherence.) Let the opening configuration be such that the population of would-be migrants is divided into two sets: those who save enough by themselves to pay for the cost of their migration, and those who pair with others to jointly pool savings to pay for the cost. The first set consists of people who accepted the time required for lone saving or who, while preferring to save jointly, did not find people in sufficiently close proximity in social space to make low risk co-saving arrangements feasible. Let the cost of migration increase. Then, lone savers will be less hostile to entering a joint financing arrangement with people who are farther in social space if the risk arising from participation with them in joint financing is more acceptable than the delay in migration caused by the time required to provide for lone financing. As a result, in a time window following an increase in the cost of migration, the incidence of migration need not be less. As a back-of-envelope illustration of such an evolution of the financial environment, suppose that at time zero there are four individuals at origin who seek to amass the funds needed for them to migrate. Two individuals are lone savers, the other two save together. Suppose that monthly income is 2, that the cost of migration is 12, that individuals can set aside all but one unit of their monthly income, and that income at the migration destination is twice the income at origin. The pattern of migration will then be as follows. At the end of month six, one individual out of the two who save together will migrate. Assuming the migrant sticks to the terms of the joint savings agreement, three months later the other individual will migrate. And after twelve months, the two lone savers will migrate. Now let the cost of migration rise from 12 to 14 and suppose that, consequently, the two lone savers shift to joint saving; saving alone as before would lead to too long a postponement. Then, after seven months two individuals will migrate, and three and a half months later the remaining two individuals will migrate. If we look at the time window of the first seven months, then we will see that prior to the increase in cost, migration would have been by one individual, and that following the increase, migration is by two individuals. This is the intensification alluded to above. Figure 1 which presents these configurations is drawn under the assumption of perfect compliance by the individuals who migrate first.Footnote 3 The timing of migration in months, \(t\), of four individuals: when the cost of migration, \(C\), is 12 (in which case, two individuals are lone savers, and the other two individuals save together); and when the cost of migration is 14 (in which case, two pairs of individuals who save together are formed). Light circles represent a migrant when the cost of migration is 12, dark circles represent a migrant when the cost of migration is 14. In Section 2 we construct an intertemporal utility model to investigate the possibility that an individual enters a co-saving agreement with another individual to save together the sum needed to pay for the cost of migration and initial settlement in the country of destination, thereby speeding up migration. In Section 3 we present our two main results. First, we show that the propensity to enter a co-saving agreement which carries the risk of a co-saver defaulting increases with the cost of migration. The reason for the evolution of such an arrangement is that when the cost becomes higher, people choose the lesser of two evils: joint saving which could be risky, and postponed timing of migration if saving alone. When it comes to the risk that a co-saver will renege, a stronger desire to save jointly lowers the bar of acceptable social affinity of co-savers. Second, we formulate a condition under which the dynamics (time pattern) of the migration outflow will be such that there will be a post cost-increase period during which the incidence of migration will not be lower when the cost of migration is higher. In Section 4 we list tentative empirical implications. Section 5 concludes. In the Mathematical Addendum we present a detailed protocol for solving the utility-maximization problem of individuals who save jointly. That procedure yields the parameters that we use in the streamlined analysis undertaken in the main text of the paper.",

Patel,Cornelius A. Rietveld,Jack I. Richter,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Although much of poverty alleviation research focusses on developing countries, poverty is also a concern in developed countries. According to the Federal Safety Net in the US, 44 million or one in seven citizens live in poverty,Footnote 1 and about 10 percent of the US citizens are permanently poor and welfare-dependent (Laird et al. 2018; Morello 2010; Morris et al. 2018). Similarly, in the UK and the European Union, the relative poverty levels are in the mid-teen percentages (Michálek and Výbošťok 2019). In efforts to alleviate relative poverty (i.e., “much less”), as distinct from absolute poverty (i.e., “not enough”) (Notten and De Neubourg 2011), policy makers in developed countries invest in a variety of safety-net programs. Policymakers face a vexing problem of allocating and managing public assistance to provide the much needed safety net to the economically vulnerable, but to also impel self-sustainability in such economically disadvantaged locales. As a result, encouragement of self-employment in disadvantaged neighbourhoods is of growing interest among policymakers (Sutter et al. 2019; Morris 2021). Most research on the influence of public assistance focuses on the contemporaneous associations of partaking in welfare programs. Public assistance programs may contribute the necessary safety net for improving investments in human capital and for supporting families that in turn may improve long-term labour market outcomes (Fryer 2017; Moffitt 1999; Sandberg 2016). Receipts of public assistance may influence the formation of the human capital of parents and children, increase local consumption levels, and have a long-term community influence in promoting, supporting, and engaging in self-employment. However, research over decades on the value of public assistance and vocational outcomes has shown that most of the individuals facing serious economic disadvantages have limited training and skills, and social programs seem to play a limited role in improving their economic conditions (Hamilton 2016). According to some critics, public assistance may lead to excess dependence on such programs and lower incentives to engage in self-employment. These competing narratives on the value of public assistance for promoting long-term economic outcomes such as self-employment call for a closer examination. Through the theoretical lenses of liability of poorness (Morris et al. 2020a) and regional development (Capello and Nijkamp 2019; Fischer and Nijkamp 2019), in this study, we aim to counter this gap in the literature by focusing on the long-term relationship between public assistance payments and self-employment in census tracts.Footnote 2 The long-term perspective we adopt is essential because public assistance may not relieve the short-term economic and non-economic binding constraints. With the goal of public assistance programs to improve communities and long-term economic outcomes, understanding the role of such programs in improving self-employment on aggregate may be central to further informing the efficacy of such programs. Specifically, we assess the influence of the poverty ratio on self-employmentFootnote 3 in the next decade and whether the proportion of households on public assistance (breadth) or public assistance per capita (depth) moderates this relationship. We analyse decennial data over four decades (1970 to 2000) to estimate the long-term relationships between public assistance policies and self-employment. Following Neumark et al. (2019), we use in our study the long-term longitudinal data available from the Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB) provided by GeoLytics (GeoLytics 2016). We are drawing on aggregated data on the census tract level because long-term individual-level data are not available in the US (Neumark et al. 2019). The historic tax returns data from the 1970s and 1980s are not fully digitized and recent works on generational mobility also draw on confidential tax return data from the 1980s. Moreover, those receiving public assistance may not have taxable income and because of their limited assets and investments using tax return data may be less useful for our purpose. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from 1984 to 2014 covers recipients of government programs, but it provides information on a four year rotating panel of individuals with the lowest granularity at the state-level. Although the analysis of long-term individual-level data would have been most ideal to answer our research question, only the NCDB data provide us the necessary geographic granularity and the time span to answer our research question. Our findings show that the poverty ratio of census tracts in the current decade is negatively associated with the percentage of households with self-employment in the next decade. The breadth of public assistance (proportion of households on public assistance) partially mitigates this relationship. However, the depth of public assistance (higher per capita public assistance) does not seem to be meaningfully associated with self-employment in the next decade. Though causal inferences are challenging to derive in the current context, a variety of robustness checks (including a model which controls for the geographical proximity of census tracts and a placebo test) support these inferences. Hence, the results provide suggestive evidence that higher poverty ratios may lower self-employment, and that increasing the breadth rather than the depth of public assistance in economically disadvantaged census tracts may result in higher self-employment rates. These findings are informative for research and policy debates in two main ways. First, with our research question that reverses the earlier focus in the literature on whether self-employment lowers poverty, our study is informative for the long-running policy debate on whether public assistance is successful in improving autonomy and self-reliance. Our longitudinal analysis across census tracts exploits variation in available safety nets to pursue self-employment. The income risk associated with self-employment is lower when public assistance may be available, and a large amount of research has focused on the role of enclaves, economic and social vibrancy of the neighbourhood, and the need for “keeping dollars in the community” (Andersson and Larsson 2016; Gittell and Thompson 1999; Stough 2016). Public assistance aggregating at the neighbourhood level could be a gathering force that builds over time to promote self-employment. However, economic self-efficiency may also deteriorate in the long term because successful self-employment is also rooted in the economic health of the neighbourhood (Braymen and Neymotin 2014). Our findings are informative for the type of policy (breadth rather than depth of public assistance) most suitable for stimulating self-employment. Second, with increasing concerns for intergenerational mobility in the US, it is important to be aware of the long-term impact of welfare programs on improving socio-economic mobility through self-employment. If the primary goal of providing safety nets is the upliftment of the economically disadvantaged, then extending prior works on the role of such programs (Neumark et al. 2019; Neumark and Young 2019) and the broader literature on distributional (Bitler et al. 2006; Friedlander and Robins 1997) and employment (Mariani et al. 2019; Rodriguez 2001) effects need to be further informed through the dimension of self-employment. Grogger (2003) found that welfare programs improved employment, however, whether it drives self-employment in the longer term remains less understood (Olds 2014). The efficacy of public assistance programs aggregates over time and may have spillover effects in the locale. By drawing on the aggregate public assistance payments at the census tract level in the period 1970–2000 and by accounting for the potential spillovers from these gains, our study contributes to our understanding of the long-term association between the breadth and depth of public assistance and the prevalence of self-employment. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature and derive our hypotheses. In Section 3, we describe the data and methodology. The empirical results are presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss our findings and provide conclusions.",1

In some instances, this led regional/local development planning to prioritize economic growth over landscape conservation (Rodriguez-Pose and Fratesi 2004), with the risk of an excessive land transformation (Ward and Brown 2009), soil sealing, and landscape fragmentation (Amato et al. 2013; Martellozzo et al. 2018), as it happened in the coastal regions to satisfy the growing demand fueled by the (unwisely) triggered mass-tourism dynamics (Sanagustin Fons et al. 2011). Also the Sustainable Development goals (SDGs) of the UNWTO (World Tourism Organization and United Nations) recognises that tourism has the potential to contribute to all 17 SDGs (WTO 2017) altough for the focus of this paper is of particular interest the SDG 15 - Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss - because tourism “can play a major role if sustainably managed in fragile zones, not only in conserving and preserving biodiversity, but also in generating revenue as an alternative livelihood to local communities” (WTO 2017, p.17). In line with SDGs of UNWTO, the standpoint we base our work upon, is the one pursuing sustainable development. In literature is well underlined how and why the development of RT should follow radically divergent dynamics from those of the development of coastal tourism (Randelli and Martellozzo 2019). In particular, since the latter has often induced highly depleting dynamics of the natural and semi-natural landscape. For the attractiveness of coastal regions this may not be critical as much as it is for rural areas, because the sea remains an invariant element of the landscape, whereas in rural areas the landscape natural heritage is the fundamental resource both for RT and other traditional rural human activities (e.g. primarily agriculture; Cánoves et al. 2004; Daugstad 2008; Randelli and Martellozzo 2018). Broadly speaking, we believe that rural and coastal tourism may show a similar early evolutionary stage, but we also argue that RT shall radically diverge from tourism massification dynamics while approaching a mature stage. As a matter of fact, coastal tourism has often been initially fuelled by aspirational values similar to the ones associated (and overmarketed) to RT; for example it began in several places with people visiting small fishermen’s villages and with the development of facilities and accommodation to host them; however, over time some of these villages have started sprawling onto surrounding landscapes (Sanagustin Fons et al. 2011; García-Ayllón 2015; Weaver 2017; Valdivielso and Moranta 2019). On the drawback side though, in several coastal region the intense urbanization consequential to tourism development has caused a decrease in the environmental value in the long term, with no progressive influence on the magnitude of tourism increment (i.e. the central-west and north-east coasts in Italy, Costa Brava etc.). In fact, several scholars argue and bring evidence that “classical beach tourism” have become obsolete (i.e. loss of attractiveness) in different regions from Great Britain (Agarwal 2002; Gale 2005) to Spain (Priestley and Mundet 1998), from Croatia (Vukonić 2001) to Italy (Mazzette 2004). In this regard, our supporting argument advocating for a necessary divergent path for RT, builds upon the fact that in the case of coastal tourism the attractive environmental variable cannot be fully depauperated (i.e. it is not possible to build over the sea), hence the main environmental resource to which tourism attractiveness is coupled cannot be completely eroded; whereas in the case of rural areas the environmental landscape elements conveying the added value attracting tourism, can be little by little irreparably weakened (i.e. full functional substitution). Hence, once the environmental value of the landscape is completely erased, the path for RT is irreversibly traced. It follows that while in rural areas a massive urbanization of land can compromise future tourism development, in coastal areas this may not be the case because the environmental resource can never be completely substituted by built-up development. Furthermore, Oueslati et al. (2019) brought generalized evidences from Europe that even low level of fragmentation due to built-up expansion may significantly curb agricultural productivity in the urban-rural fringe. However, it is important to note that on the one hand, in order to adequately support rural economies also through the development of RT activities, a certain level of built-up growth (e.g. new accommodation and leisure facilities and cognate infrastructures) is needed, and shall be considered inevitable. Nonetheless, sometimes it also allows the opportunity for public and private stakeholders to intervene by coupling built-up expansion with the restoration and securing of critical situations (e.g. hydrogeological risk, conservation and recovery of historical heritage, etc.). On the other hand, when over-RT is in place and mass-tourism dynamics are replicated in rural areas, this can lead to a depletion of the landscape resource (Akgün et al. 2011) that necessarily negatively affects the attractiveness of RT and also the productivity/profitability of traditional rural activities. Therefore, it entails as a paradigmatic example for the sustainable development paradox (Temenos 2009; Horlings and Marsden 2014; Martellozzo et al. 2018), and hence is of crucial importance for local development authorities to a priori: (i) assess a threshold value for RT development that should not be exceeded, so to prevent a harmful depletion of the landscape natural resource base; and (ii) hypothesize how that goal can be achieved while maximizing profits (both for traditional rural economic activities and for RT) without compromising the landscape resource. The goal of this work is to build upon the unequivocal decadence of a tourist destination, as evidenced by the well-known Butler’s rationale (Butler 1980), when a critical carrying capacity threshold for system’s resources is reached, by proposing a model that maximizes the profits of both main components of rural economies (i.e. tourism and agriculture), without compromising the ecological landscape resource at the base of rural systems (that in this study is exemplified through a peculiar input factor representing the added value of the land available). In this regard, a dynamic theoretical model is proposed in which is assumed that the land is homogeneous, and that it can be devoted indistinctly to RT, or to agricultural activities. Besides, the model also posits that the depletion of the landscape resource is proportional to the growth of RT revenues. At this point, as reasonable, if no exogenous elements intervene, the system’s evolution will see RT growing until rural systems’ landscape resources are exhausted, given that it is generally more profitable to devote land to RT than to agriculture activities. In this case, the model mimics exactly a dynamic like tourism massification. However, in order to allow a control over the progressive erosion of the landscape component in the dynamics described so far, we hypothesized the introduction of a policy toolFootnote 1 aimed at restoring the landscape resource base, for a quota inversely proportional to the posited detriment caused to the ecological landscape resource. As said, the analysis shows that in the event of the absence of any regulatory activity, RT soon exhausts the landscape resource, determining the ineluctable decline of the tourist destination, hence confirming the Butler’s model. Vice versa, the dynamics characterized by a landscape restoration policy tool, as the one proposed here, shows that a desirable (borrowing from Pareto’s vocabulary) coexistence of both components of rural economies is possible, yet favorable, while sustainably preserving the landscape resource. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the recent RTs’ developments, Section 3 presents the dynamic model analyzed in Section 4, Section 5 reports the results, and Section 6 provides some final remarks.",3

Goodhart’s (1988) general overview of early central banks’ establishment is partly based on his account of the Bank of England (BoE) (Selgin 1993). Similarly, V. Smith (1990 [1936]) sought to explore the origins and development of central banks with a particular focus on the Bank. The Bank is thus undoubtedly a paradigmatic example of how a for-profit bank becomes a bankers’ bank, and, finally, a central bank (Capie et al. 1994; Thornton 1978 [1802]).Footnote 2 Goodhart’s and V. Smith’s focus on the BoE echoes Bagehot’s (1873) original concerns about the establishment of central banks. Like Goodhart and V. Smith, Bagehot (1873) considered the Bank as a paradigmatic example of how central banks arose and developed from processes of political entanglement initiated by governments’ interventions in the banking system. These political dynamics—hinted at by V. Smith, Thornton (1978 [1802]), and Bagehot—comprise the core focus of this article. The analysis provides further evidence that challenges Goodhart’s (1988) and Congdon’s (1981) claims that central banks naturally arise and are therefore institutionally and logically indispensable. Despite social scientists having made important advances in illuminating the notion of institutional evolution and how institutional change occurs in social orders (Blyth et al. 2011; North 2005; Ostrom 2014; Van den Bergh and Stagl 2004), scarce work has expanded these ideas into banking theory or to central banks’ institutional evolution.Footnote 3 Ostrom’s (1990) seminal work on governing the commons has been extended into the notion of financial governance of systemic banking affairs, such as bank runs, self-monitoring, and financial resilience (Salter and Young 2018; Paniagua, 2016b, 2020). However, remaining gaps in the banking literature involve early central banks’ establishment and institutional development (Bindseil 2020; Salter 2014). The failure of extending such institutional analysis and insights into the banking literature has impoverished macroeconomic thinking and, ultimately, affected how economists think about banking institutions, leaving them conceptually trapped in dichotomies such as banking anarchy versus government-oriented bankers’ banks (Calomiris and Haber 2014). By borrowing from Calomiris and Haber’s (2014) framework, this article contributes to filling such gaps on early central banks by analyzing the case of the Bank of England at its initial establishment and subsequent development, 1694–1708, then important institutional changes during the period 1797–1821 and up to 1890. The article proposes a framework for the institutional evolution of early proto-central banks, based on examining the historical progression of the BoE as a paradigmatic—yet unintended—case study of banking evolution (Goodhart 1988). As Blyth et al. (2011: p. 307) recognize, ‘many social scientists today are groping for a better understanding of origins and mechanisms of institutional and political change. The problem is that most social science models assume fixed mechanisms.’ This problem is particularly acute in the banking and fiscal literature which usually treats institutions as the rational equilibrium outcome of a one-shot maximizing strategy (Broz 1998). Instead, political economy can be fruitfully used to examine central banks; it can expand the narrow notion of institutions as established equilibria in rational maximizing exchanges (Blyth et al. 2011; Salter and Tarko 2019)Footnote 4 and has therefore the capacity to illuminate the phenomenon of institutional change (Ostrom 1990, 2014). Building from Goodhart’s (1988) main arguments and Broz’s (1998) theoretical and historical insights, this article proposes an alternative rationale for understanding the emergence of early (prior to the 1800s) proto-central banks. This alternative is essential for developing an institutional explanation to help explain why central banks are established and how they develop. The article contributes additional evidence in favor of central banks’ unintended and politically oriented developments, as opposed to their alleged ‘natural’ emergence. The findings contrast the conventional rationale for central banks since they suggest that the origins of, and catalysts for, the evolution of them resides mostly within bank bargains and privileges originally granted to them by governments (Selgin 1993).Footnote 5 If shown that central banks evolve out of political processes initiated by bargains, then not only will they prove Bagehot’s (1873) conjectures accurate, but they will also call into question Goodhart’s (1988) and Congdon’s (1981) ‘natural’ or ‘inherent’ claims. The following Section 2 reviews key concepts and definitions, especially the notion of bank bargains and the framework of entangled political economy. Section 3 explores the Bank’s early history, starting with its establishment in 1694 and its gradual changes up until 1708, as well as explains how charter renewals exacerbated the entanglement. Section 4 analyzes the Bank’s change based on the subsequent process of concentration of the English banking system’s reserves, enhanced by legal precedents and accumulated privileges between 1797 and 1821 (known as the Restriction Period). Section 5 concludes.",4

The combination of individual characteristics, values and experiences determines whether a team is able to generate ideas and turn them into successful innovations (Lazear, 1999; Talke et al., 2010; Cooper et al., 2014; Hoogendoorn et al., 2013s et al., 2013; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017). The evidence on the relationship between team diversity and innovation is not entirely conclusive (Huber et al., 2014; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Lazar et al., 2020), both because different authors use different concepts of diversity, and because there are many, relatively unexplored factors mediating the relationship between team diversity and innovation. Analysing the role of diversity for a team’s innovative performance is particularly relevant in the context of new ventures, since most of new firms are founded by teams (Carland & Carland, 2012; Klotz et al., 2014; Åstebro & Serrano, 2015; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017). So far, the existing literature has looked either at the diversity of skills/knowledge of individual entrepreneurs (or solo founders), i.e. jack-of-all-trades (Lazear, 2005; henceforth JOTs), or at the diversity of founding team members in terms of age, gender, education, previous work/industry experience, personality and behavioural preferences (Coad & Timmermans, 2014; Visintin & Pittino, 2014; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Lazar et al., 2020). Here we consider both perspectives, since the endowment of individuals in terms of competences and knowledge background is a multi-faceted and composite concept. Individuals are themselves endowed with composite sets of skills and abilities (Lazear, 2005; Coad & Timmermans, 2014), so that, in principle, one might observe a high level of knowledge diversity even in a solo founder new venture. We therefore claim that diversity in founding teams may derive from two possible sources. On the one hand, it may originate from the combination of many individuals, each with a multifaceted human capital in terms of knowledge and skills (Lazear, 1999) and in terms of previous work experience and professional background (Shane & Stuart, 2002; Hsu, 2007). On the other hand, it may result from the combination of different individuals, each with a different knowledge background that is possibly complementary to the one of other team members. Since the impact of founding team diversity on innovation can be different according to the source of this diversity, studying this relationship requires an in depth analysis of the origins of diversity and of the conditions under which the interactions among diverse founders can lead to higher or lower levels of innovation (Huber et al., 2014; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Lazar et al., 2020). This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it provides a reappraisal of the relationship between founding team diversity and firms’ innovative activity, based on a specific operationalization of team diversity that combines both the team-level diversity and the individual-level diversity. The numerous works that have investigated the diversity of founders within multi-founder teams so far have measured team members’ diversity by assigning a single skill or knowledge field to each member. Instead, we argue that each member of a team is endowed with diverse knowledge, since she possesses a set of different skills that form her knowledge background and expertise, problem-solving attitudes and creativity (Huang et al., 2012; Tidd, 2014; Kristinsson et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017). Within multi-founder teams we therefore distinguish two types diversity: diversity due to the existence of many JOTs – i.e. “…individuals who need not excel in any one skill but are competent in many” (Lazear, 2005, p. 649) - and diversity due to the existence of different (possibly complementary) founders, who may excel in one specific knowledge field. We posit that it is the second type of diversity that is more conducive to a new venture’s degree of innovation. Second, we explore contextual moderators of the relationship between founding team diversity and innovation (Klotz et al., 2014; Kristinsson et al., 2016) and claim that the impact of diversity on innovation varies depending on the knowledge base embedded in the team. Innovation is a complex, non-routinary and uncertain task, especially in the context of new ventures that have a technical knowledge base that often results in technical innovations (Garnsey, 1995), whose commercialisation requires the transformation of scientific and technical knowledge into marketable products and services, which entails both scientific and market uncertainties. The greater the degree of complexity, the greater the uncertainty of the innovation process and the greater the diversity of the knowledge and expertise needed to improve decision-making and implementation as to achieve innovation (Kristinsson et al., 2016). Therefore, having a diverse founding team is particularly important for innovations when the new venture has a scientific and technical knowledge base (Zahra et al., 2007; Visintin & Pittino, 2014). Empirically, we rely on a dataset collected within the framework of the AEGIS survey (Protogerou et al., 2017). This survey was administered in 2010 to more than 1,800 founders of new multi-founder firms established in the period 2001–2007 in the European Union, in the manufacturing and service sectors. In addition to firm-specific and market-specific information (e.g. dynamic capabilities and innovative strategies), and standard information on founders’ demographic characteristics, educational background, and previous work experience, the survey collected detailed information on each founder’s bundle of skills and abilities (i.e. knowledge background). We therefore exploit this information to measure diversity in a way that acknowledges the composite knowledge background of each founder, and the combination of those knowledge backgrounds within the founding team. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature and formulates the hypotheses to be tested. Section 3 describes the data and section 4 discusses the methodology, the empirical model, and the variables used. Section 5 presents the results of the empirical analysis and section 6 concludes by discussing some managerial implications.",

Rietveld,Pankaj C. Patel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The gender gap in entrepreneurship, usually proxied by the difference in the engagement in entrepreneurship between males and females (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2019), is a topic of prime interest among policymakers in both developed and developing countries (Foss et al. 2019). With the increasing contribution of female entrepreneurs to economic development (Brush and Brush 2006; Dean et al. 2019; Kevane and Wydick 2001), it is not only important to increase the participation of female entrepreneurs in mainstream entrepreneurial activities but also to lower barriers hindering their entrepreneurial success. Increasing the levels of female entrepreneurship may not only add the needed cognitive and human capital diversity to the entrepreneurial process but female-led startups and businesses lower unemployment and are known to contribute to economic growth (Hechavarria et al. 2019). The returns females derive from their businesses, especially in developing countries, could contribute to improved family support (Hundera et al. 2019; Kevane and Wydick 2001), and with females on average more directly involved in day-to-day family caretaking and support than males, entrepreneurship may provide them with additional resources to improve household outcomes such as child education and well-being. Starting a business may therefore improve the status and social standing of females and their households, and enhance the pursuit of self-realization goals (Carter et al. 2003; Manolova et al. 2008). Despite the known benefits of female entrepreneurship, female-owned firms remain underrepresented, and entrepreneurship remains a male-dominated activity. Globally, the percentual engagement of females in the early stages of entrepreneurship is approximately three-quarters of this engagement of males. Moreover, female entrepreneurs are less likely to own established businesses than male entrepreneurs (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2019). The deadweight loss of the limited inclusion of female entrepreneurs highlights the importance of analyzing how gender inequality is associated with systematic distortions in the labor force participation of females and their engagement in entrepreneurship. The distortions catalyzed by gender inequality, in addition to institutional, social, and cultural factors, may systematically distort the structural characteristics of the working-age population in the entrepreneurial undertaking. Such structural differences induced by gender inequality may lead to less desired outcomes, including engagement of females in necessity (push-based) instead of opportunity (pull-based) entrepreneurship. However, the potential displacement loss from opportunity- to necessity-based entrepreneurship has so far remained relatively less explored. In this study, we analyze whether country-level gender inequality, as measured by the World Economic Forum since 2006, is associated with the gender gap in opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship. Answering this research question helps to shed light on the possible double-whammy that females may face—lower engagement in entrepreneurship, and higher engagement in necessity-based entrepreneurship. By answering this research question, we respond to calls to developing a deeper understanding of female entrepreneurship (Brush and Cooper 2012; Dean et al. 2019; McAdam 2013). To examine the role of gender inequality on differences in opportunity versus necessity-based entrepreneurship, we draw on the literature on female entrepreneurship. Gender inequality through multiple modalities may influence how females perceive their abilities to start a business, develop an entrepreneurial mindset, navigate in the socio-economic and cultural environment, and develop relationships (McAdam 2013; Minniti 2009). In addition to regulations, gender inequality reinforces ascriptions and support for success in entrepreneurship. The ongoing and pervasive effects of gender inequality may therefore influence within- and between-national differences in the uptake of opportunity-driven versus necessity-based entrepreneurship. Answering our research question is important, because, although several studies have indicated that the gender gap in entrepreneurship varies systematically across countries (Estrin and Mickiewicz 2011; Hechavarría and Ingram 2019; Ribes-Giner et al. 2018), gender inequality may also have a heterogeneous impact on the types of entrepreneurship. Gender inequality could introduce systematic distortions at multiple levels of an economic, social, and political system and may also influence individual perceptions of self-efficacy and skills for undertaking opportunity-based entrepreneurship. In addition, gender inequality could reinforce stereotypes and systemic biases that may further limit participation in opportunity-based entrepreneurship. Economic and regulatory conditions are indeed important, but gender inequality also has a deep impact on social and economic behaviors, and gender inequality is not limited to economically less developed countries (Gerecke 2013; Kalpazidou Schmidt and Cacace 2017). Therefore, by focusing not only on the involvement in entrepreneurship but also on the type of entrepreneurship, our study attempts to provide a more complete picture of the gender gap in entrepreneurship and is informative for the further research discourse on female entrepreneurship. If there are systematic differences between male and female entrepreneurs in opportunity-driven and necessity-based entrepreneurship, gender inequality will be an important driver that may further lower the individual, social, and economic benefits of female entrepreneurship. Based on data from 97 countries (1,905,665 individuals) from the years 2006 to 2017, we provide evidence that gender inequality is associated with variations in both opportunity and necessity-based entrepreneurship, a gap that closes between males and females with increasing gender equality. The closing of the gap is indicative of the constraining factors that may limit females from considering, pursuing, and thriving in opportunity-based entrepreneurship in more gender unequal countries, because economic and political inequalities are the main drivers of the estimated interaction effects. Thus, rooted in internalized and ascribed roles and behaviors reinforced by gender inequality (Eagly 1997, 2009), our findings further add to our understanding of systematic variations in entrepreneurship between males and females. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we develop hypotheses about how gender inequality influences involvement in entrepreneurship as well as how it moderates the relationship between gender and entrepreneurship. Thereafter, we describe the data and methodology in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the empirical results. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss the empirical findings and provide directions for future research and conclusions.",2

Janssen,Koen Frenken,Alexander S. Alexiev,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is increasingly understood that service encounters might provide a fruitful basis for innovation (Leiponen 2005; Lages and Piercy 2012; Sundbo et al. 2015). Delivering services is essentially a process in which firms like engineering companies, consultancies, design bureaus or ‘servitized’ manufacturers co-produce value together with their customers (Tether et al. 2001; Bowen and Ford 2002; Gallouj and Windrum 2009). The associated customer-seller interaction can yield insights that are informative for improving service providers’ existing products as well as for developing new ones (Lundvall 1988; Chatterji and Fabrizio 2012, 2014). As a result, firms are encouraged to invest in capabilities for sensing customer needs as a means to evaluate, process, and integrate feedback effectively (Teece 2007; Den Hertog et al. 2010). Such capabilities are embedded in organisational routines for processing information on customer demands. Strong capabilities involve systematically analysing and interpreting signals, while weak capabilities are typically geared to collecting simple feedback only (Day 2002; Teece 2007). Generally, well-developed sensing capabilities are believed to be crucial if a firm is to stay adaptive and competitive (Bharadwaj and Dong 2013). A strong customer-centred approach to pursuing innovation, however, does not guarantee successful outcomes (Felin et al. 2017). Hamel and Prahalad (1991) and Christensen and Bower (1996) have suggested that a strategy focused on optimally fulfilling the demands of existing customers can lead firms to ignore other potential customers. Over the past decades, the caveat known as ‘the innovator’s dilemma’ (Christensen 1997) has been echoed in a myriad of studies on technology strategy, organizational change and disruptive innovation (e.g. Danneels 2002; Danneels 2003; O’Reilly and Tushman 2008; Laursen 2012). As existing customers exert greater influence than potential customers, firms are held captive by their current customer base, searching only for new solutions along established paths (Laursen 2011). Investing in sensing customer needs may, therefore, tie down the firm’s resources to myopic innovation, which neglects the development of new customer segments. To what extent the sketched peril also holds for service firms providing customer-specific and largely intangible solutions is far from obvious. According to recent research, it is recommended to asses this by also considering the customization degree of service offerings (Cabigiosu and Campagnolo 2019). Depending on whether provided services are tailored or standardized, firms are required to engage more or less intensively with individual customers (Tether et al. 2001; Laursen 2012). The customers’ actions and signals provide cues to which firms may respond when pursuing improved customer satisfaction. This customer feedback can vary in its intensity and clarity: in some cases, customers are simply sending complaints while, in other cases, they are more willing and able to offer suggestions for service improvement (Alam 2002; Baldwin and von Hippel 2011). A high dependence on interaction with customers that continuously provide signals can, in turn, be fed into the process of new product development (Tether et al. 2001; Visnjic Kastalli and Van Looy 2013). The outcomes of customer sensing capabilities are thus driven by recursive mechanisms affected by both firm and customer characteristics: the customization levels of a firm’s offerings and the quality of feedback provided by its customers (Gallouj and Weinstein 1997). Linking back to the innovator’s dilemma, we pose the question whether these characteristics also influence the risk of using sensing capabilities for moving towards services tuned solely to existing or small sets of customers. As existing research has barely touched upon the influence of customization on feedback utilization amongst innovation pursuing service providers, there is an insufficient basis for theorizing on performance implications. In this paper, we use simulations to explore the relationship between sensing customer needs capabilities, feedback quality and the degree of customization, on the one hand, and innovation-based firm performance, on the other. We draw upon the literature on evolutionary search processes and the NK model (Kauffman 1993; Levinthal 1997) to identify four basic types of interactive search strategy used to experiment with new service offerings in a multidimensional design space (Chae 2012a; Querbes and Frenken 2017; Vuculescu 2017). The model and corresponding performance pay-off simulations allow us to make sense of the complex interrelatedness among our key concepts, and to formulate hypotheses. The interaction between customer feedback quality and sensing customer needs capabilities is expected to have a positive influence on a firm’s innovation success when its offerings are standardized. The interaction is predicted to have a negative effect when firms offer customized services. In a second stage, we use field data from a firm-level survey of 292 Dutch firms to test the extent to which sensing capabilities and customer feedback are related to innovation-based turnover. The regression results support the findings from the stylized simulation model. Contrary to their less-customizing or non-customizing counterparts, customizing service providers can fail to increase innovation-based output when focusing strongly on articulated customer needs. While a relentless commitment to fulfilling customer needs may offer short-run benefits, untempered tailoring can act as a distraction. Rather than choosing a suboptimal product standard (typical for myopic innovation in goods-centred firms), it may well be the customer-specific fine-tuning of solutions that prevents customizing firms from deploying innovation with a large market potential. These findings shed new light on what might cause firms to rely excessively on customer feedback, which is usually believed to be a matter of the firm’s and customer behaviour only. The fact that no drawback is observed for firms hardly customizing their services suggests that also the provided type of offering is crucial in this respect. This study contributes to the (service) innovation strategy and management studies literature by elaborating specific conditions that can explain the outcomes from investing in customer-sensing capabilities. The rare combination of simulations and initial empirical tests has allowed us to highlight certain boundary conditions that nurture myopic innovation (Ganco 2017; Dosi et al. 2019; Baumann et al. 2019). A second contribution is specific to the literature on the innovation of customized services (Visnjic Kastalli and Van Looy 2013; Cabigiosu and Campagnolo 2019). Firms providing such offerings arguably form the vanguard of firms whose core business consists of delivering and developing differentiated offerings tailored maximally to the needs of – and co-created by – individual customers (Tether et al. 2001; Alam 2002). In their wake, we find an increasing number of manufacturing firms realizing that globalized economies and communication technologies promote customer-centric business models rather than the traditional supply-impelled market logic (Teece 2010; Baden-Fuller and Mangematin 2013; Hienerth et al. 2011). With customizing service providers leading the way into customer-needs-driven business strategies, investigating their dependence on sensing capabilities and feedback is relevant both from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. The remainder of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we develop a theoretical framework regarding the interaction between a firm’s sensing activities and its customers signalling activities. In Sect. 3 we theorize on the moderating role of customization. The design and outcomes of our simulation models are presented in Sect. 4, which results in the hypotheses that are empirically tested in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",1
32.0,4.0,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,18 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-022-00773-8,Diversity and mechanisms of economic evolution,September 2022,Agnieszka Lipieta,Elżbieta Pliś,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economic mechanisms understood as a set of rules and regularities governing the economic life play, along with innovations, entrepreneurship and competitiveness, a major role in Schumpeter’s approach to economic development (Schumpeter 1912, 1982). The concepts of innovation and economic mechanism and their importance in economic evolution are the subject of study in some subfields of economic theory, primarily the theory of economic development (Nelson and Winter 1982; Day 2007), theory of economic growth (Solow 1956; Aghion and Howitt 1992, 1998), competitiveness theory (Garud 1994; Bukowski et al. 2021), theory of entrepreneurship (Alchian 1950; Hessels and van Stel 2011), organizational theory (Aldrich 1999) and mechanism design theory (Lipieta and Malawski 2016; Lipieta and Ćwięczek 2020). In his approach, Schumpeter (1950) assigned a special role to the mechanism clarifying the structure of the economic development process called creative destruction. Creative destruction, by Schumpeter, is the coexistence of two opposing processes: innovation resulting in the introduction of new commodities, new technologies and new organizational structures, etc., and processes of elimination of existing, outdated solutions. Thus, innovations are the result of some kinds of mechanisms, and the study of the mechanisms revealing within the evolution of the economy is essential for a comprehensive analysis of the Schumpeterian economic development. The concept of diversity has been present in the theory of economic development from its beginnings (see Malerba 1992; Metcalfe 1994), however, there is no explicit definition of a diversity of the economy as a whole. The lack of a properly studied “theory of diversity” in the theory of economic development can be filled up by the contribution of Nehring and Puppe (2002). Their practical but strongly theoretically founded, definition of the diversity function for a collection of objects was adapted by Pliś (2020) to the case of the economic system. Having a properly defined value of diversity for the subsets of l-dimensional space of commodities, Pliś (2020) provided a definition of the diversity of a production system, as the value of diversity of the set of all production possibilities at a given stage of economic development. These production possibilities refer to the production plans available to the producers due to their state of knowledge and technological level at the time considered. Thanks to the operative definition of diversity, it was possible to study the causal relationship between the occurrence of innovation and the increase in the diversity of the economic system (Pliś 2020). In this context, the paper aims at analyzing a relationship between some properties of economic mechanisms revealing within economic evolution, formalized by the use of mathematical apparatus borrowed from the theory of general equilibrium (Arrow and Debreu 1954; Mas-Colell et al. 1995), and the diversity of economic systems understood as in the paper by Pliś (2020). The mathematical approach to mechanism design was initiated by Leonid Hurwicz (1960). Such an approach enables to formalize, compare and potentially drive economic processes to get desired goals. Hurwicz mechanism is a relational system (see Adamowicz and Zbierski 1997) consisted of a message space, a message correspondence and an outcome function (Hurwicz and Reiter 2006). Determining of an economic mechanism in the sense of Hurwicz begins with defining the so-called economic environment. The economic environment is a set of characteristics that determine individuals and firms as economic agents in the considered economic system. In any environment, economic agents, consciously or unconsciously, send signals about their market activities. The link between economic environments and the set of messages is described by the message correspondence. Formally, it assigns to every environment, hence indirectly to economic entities, the signals (information) that can be identified and analyzed by economic agents. These signals can be interpreted by agents and influence their actions in the future. Hence, to study the relationship between observable signals and market activities, in the full or partial access to information, makes sense. Therefore, the outcome function, which assigns to every message the outcome of activities of economic agents undertaken as a result of this message, is defined. The concept of Hurwicz mechanisms has been widely researched and used in many areas of life, above all, economics (for example Maskin and Riley 1984), medicine (see for example Roth et al. 2004), and logistics (for instance Abdulkadiroǧlu and Sönmez 2003). When analyzing the agents’ behavior on non-equilibrium markets, the structure of information plays a central role. As we study macroeconomics mechanisms resulting from the specific behavior of market participants, our consideration can be seen as a part of the research on the microfoundations of macroeconomics (see for example: Weintraub 1979, van den Bergh and Gowdy 2003, Hoover 2010). In his classic book on microfoundations, Weintraub (1979) outlined the main paths to move economic analyses from mainstream micro to mainstream macro-models. Our approach can be classified as an example of what Weintraub called the Edgeworthian general interaction model (Weintraub 1979; Hurwicz et al. 1975), being “one of the various ways in which general equilibrium theory can be modified to provide a conceptual base for the formulation of macroeconomic concerns”. In our model the variety of mechanisms can be the source of economic diversity. We extend the analysis of the diversity of the competitive economy (Section 3) initiated by Pliś (2020). By applying the concept of the Hurwicz mechanism, we formalize the relationship between the properties of the mechanism revealing within economic evolution and the diversity of the economic system under study. As a result, we prove that the increase of diversity of the economy is caused by innovative mechanisms (Theorem 1, Corollary 1). Moreover, we show that eco-innovation, and hence eco-mechanism connected with the process of creative destruction, can increase the diversity of the private ownership economy (Theorem 2, Corollary 7). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. In Section 3 we describe various transformations of the economic system and analyze associated changes in diversity. Section 4 indicates the relationship between diversity and the type of economic mechanism and illustrates the change of diversity connected with eco-innovation. Section 5 contains a discussion.

Liotti,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The Eurozone is a currency area that has always experienced alternating fortunes. From its creation until 2008, a generalised process of convergence seemed to occur (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2002). With the eruption of the financial crisis and its subsequent transformation into a sovereign bond crisis, a number of imbalances emerged that revealed the fragility of the currency union (Calmfors et al. 2012). Among these imbalances, those arising from the balance of payments play a special role. They are favoured by a policy structure in which monetary policy is centralised and fiscal policy is left to the management of individual states (Bini Smaghi 2011). It threatens to be a source of persistent and self-fulfilling disequilibria (De Grauwe and Ji 2013). This paper investigates how these external imbalances affect divergences inside 11 Eurozone countries, connecting the Target2 (T2) balance of payments mechanism of compensation with poverty. Target2 can be assimilated into the change in official reserves necessary to cover the balance of payments disequilibrium in a fixed exchange rate regime. They arise as a symptom of expected divergences and are worsened by investors’ speculative behaviour. Its effect on interest rates seems to mirror those that occur during a currency crisis in a fixed exchange rate regime. However, difficulties do not arise in the way that first-generation models predicted (Krugman 1979) because of the exhaustion of foreign reserves − T2 imbalances can potentially reach infinite levels − but rather because of the automatic effects on interest rates of net capital flows. This result resembles those presented in the second (Obstfeld 1986a and 1986b) and third (Eichengreen and Hausmann 1999) generation currency crisis models in which national central banks raise interest rates in an attempt to preserve exchange rate parity and hinder speculative behaviour by investors. When the loss in terms of internal equilibrium is too high, the exchange rate becomes free to fluctuate. However, in the Eurozone case, the eventual abandonment of the fixed exchange regime does not occur but rather continues to feed distances across countries. We measured such distance through poverty. To measure poverty, Eurostat refers to two main categories of indicators: the first one captures relative poverty and the second captures absolute poverty. That measuring relative poverty is “monetary poverty” or “people at risk of poverty after social transfers” and represents the share of the total population with an equivalised disposable income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold of 60% of the national median-equivalised disposable income after social transfers. Absolute poverty is measured by “material deprivation,” or the percentage of the population prevented by a lack of resources from having a “decent” life (see below for a detailed explanation; Eurostat 2016). Both indicators consider the “society” for which they are calculated since they refer to geographically and historically defined assets. However, while “monetary poverty” is country-specific and can be considered a measure of inequality as the number of poor people is calculated in respect to a threshold, “material deprivation” has the advantage of being comparable across nations that belong to the same economic area (Kenworthy 2011; Darvas et al. 2014; Crettaz 2015). Unlike inequality, which does not necessarily register conditions of difficulty for individuals, material deprivation measures the dimension of impoverishment in a society, which has to be taken into consideration when defining an economy as “advanced.” When connected with external imbalances, it allows measuring the effect of net capital flows inside the Eurozone on poverty in each single country useful to reflect on the policy structure of the currency area. It is an irrevocable fixed exchange rate regime in which the centralised monetary policy, together with fiscal constraints, seem to support disparities rather than convergence. The chosen point of view reconciles the two interpretations relating to T2 imbalances. They are the manifestation of a balance of payments crisis (Cesaratto 2017), which persists − despite the introduction of refinancing operations (RO) to support the banking sector − because of the restrictions required to respect fiscal parameters and the unwillingness of the European Central Bank (ECB) to assume the role of the unlimited purchaser of public debt (Febrero et al. 2018). Our investigation follows two routes. First, we ascertain how the relationship between T2 imbalances and poverty arises. T2 balances lead to differences in interest rates, whatever the policy rate and the non-conventional instruments the ECB implements (Rochon and Setterfield 2007; Jorda et al. 2020). These differences create gaps in growth and therefore in absolute poverty in each country. Second, we conduct an empirical investigation through a dynamic panel technique, the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator, in 11 Eurozone countries from 2008 to 2019. The starting date follows the occurrence of external imbalances that, up to that year had been equal to zero. We use the year average of T2 because of the availability of data about poverty. Despite the limited number of observations, it provides an insight into the proposed relationship and – differently from vector error correction (VECM) models – release consistent results in presence of heterogeneity across panel members. However, results appear to be robust even when introducing—one by one—a number of control variables affecting absolute poverty, capturing the institutional conditions of each single country as well as Eurozone policy choices. We follow, therefore, rather than the first generation currency crisis models predicting that deteriorating fundamentals push the economy into the currency crisis, the second and third generation models, according to which expectations of deteriorating fundamentals are ex-post factors to pull the economy into a crisis. If the commitment to preserve the parity if very high – as in the case of the EMU- the cost in term of output volatility is very high as well (Obstfeld 1986a, 1986b, Saxena 2004, italics borrowed from Flood and Marion 2000). Our main argument pivots on the different effects on interest rates arising from T2 imbalances. We are not in search of the whole set of determinants of target imbalances, but rather of a correlation between T2 and interest rates, following the idea that the higher the commitment toward the fixed exchange rate the higher the cost in terms of internal equilibrium. In fact, the increase in interest rates, have opposite sign effect on poverty through its effect on output and employment and therefore on the number of those at the lower end of income distribution. Indeed, the indicator of absolute poverty can be considered a proxy of the per capita income growth rate of the poorest living in the countries considered. They do not have access to international capital markets and are therefore deprived of any instrument that would prevent them from slipping into poverty. These effects are not of secondary order – i.e. determined by the different degree of trust toward single countries financial stability – but rather of primary order as they are driven by the financial markets strong belief that peripheral countries are deprived of any instrument to compensate asymmetries while core ones gain tools supporting internal growth. (Canale et al. 2021 and for similarities with second generation models, Flood and Marion 2000). The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 focuses on T2 imbalances and the corresponding differences in long-term interest rates (LTR) on government bonds calculated by the ECB for convergence purposes, deserving attention to the direction of causality from T2 to LTR. Section 3 presents the stylised theoretical model to show how the presence of T2 imbalances affects poverty. Section 4 features the empirical investigation. The data are described and the supposed relation is introduced. Section 4.1 presents the methodology and results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and provides some policy reflections.",

However, Japan’s experience during the 1990s changed the consensus of economists and central banks around the world. After the financial bubble burst at the beginning of the 1990s, Japan experienced deflation, during which, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) continued to cut the nominal interest rate down to zero. Facing deflation and the zero-interest bound at the same time, the BOJ found it difficult to effectively conduct monetary policy, making Japan’s stagnation unusually prolonged. The “Japan problem” made economists aware of the long-forgotten danger of deflation. In the prewar period, deflation was a menace to the economy, and its danger was emphasized by famous economists such as Keynes (1931) and Fisher (1933). To prevent deflation, central banks must seek low inflation rather than zero inflation or a stable price level. Following this idea, many central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, BOJ, and European Central Bank, target 2% inflation of the consumer price index. However, few central banks have achieved this goal satisfactorily. The too-low inflation that concerns central banks today translates into the “Phillips curve puzzle”. The benchmark Phillips curve is expressed as (Phillips 1958; Frıedman 1968):
 where π and u are the inflation and unemployment rates, respectively. π∗ is either the inflationary expectation or inertia of past inflation. u∗ is the natural rate of unemployment or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), and \(a,b>0\). According to conventional macroeconomics, Eq. (1) or the Phillips curve plays an important role in determining inflation. In the U.S. and Japan, in the course of recovery from the Great Recession after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the unemployment rate steadily declined to a level commonly regarded as lower than the NAIRU, u∗. However, inflation remained low at 0.5% for Japan and 1.5% for the U.S. The Phillips curve puzzle is acute, particularly in Japan, because the core of Japan’s notorious deflation is the stagnation of nominal wages. For example, in 2019, the U.S. PCE of manufactured products declined by 0.5%, whereas its Japanese counterpart rose by 1.0%. However the consumer price of labor-intensive services rose by 2.4% in the U.S., whereas it rose only by 0.5% in Japan. This difference reflects the stagnation of nominal wages in Japan. Figure 1 shows that Japan is unique among advanced economies in that nominal wages have stagnated, and occasionally even declined, for a prolonged period. Therefore, to understand Japan’s deflation, we must analyze nominal wages. In contrast, for the U.S., Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), Del Negro et al. (2020), and Hooper et al. (2020) focus on the price Phillips curve and regard the flattening of the wage Phillips curve as irrelevant. As Fig. 1 demonstrates, cross-country differences exist and may contribute explaining the deflation. In this study, we analyze the wage Phillips curve rather than the price Phillips curve.
 Nominal wage index in Japan,the U.S., and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (1990 = 100). Source: OECD In terms of the Phillips curve (Eq. 1), two patterns have been detected. First, the coefficient b for inflationary expectations or lagged inflation has declined significantly almost to almost zero in recent years. Blanchard (2018 Figure 7), for example, finds that b, which was almost zero in the early 1960’s, rose sharply to one in the late 1960s, stayed that way for 30 years, and then declined suddenly to zero at the beginning the 2000s. While the decline in inflation since the 1990s has been often attributed to better policy management —even the term “Great Moderation” was coined (Clarida et al. 2000)—more recent analyses have identified the anchoring of inflation expectations as one of the main factors for the change in the trade-off between inflation and unemployment (Barnichon and Mesters 2021; Blanchard 2016). Greenspan (2001) remarks: “Price stability is best thought of as an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.” The second factor is the change in coefficient a for the unemployment rate in Eq. (1). A decline in a entails lower inflation than otherwise when the unemployment rate declines. Some researchers even argue that unemployment no longer affects inflation, at least within some unemployment and inflation ranges. Figure 2 (a) displays Japan’s wage Phillips curve, namely, the quarterly relationship between the unemployment rate and nominal wage growth for 1980.II–2019.II. We can indeed observe that the wage Phillips curve has flattened in recent years. As we analyze employment rather than the unemployment rate in the model, for the reader’s convenience we also show the Phillips curve in terms of employment in Fig. 2 (b).
 Japan’s wage Phillips curve: Unemployment rate and nominal wage growth of 157 quarters from 1980.π to 2019.π. (a) The abscissa represents the unemployment rate in %. (b) The abscissa is reversed and represents the employment rate (= 100-unemployment rate (%)). Colors: 1980s (red), 1990s (green), 2000fs (blue), 2010fs (orange). The last several years’ data (in yellow) show definite deviation from those of the earlier years, with low nominal wage growth despite of the low unemployment. Sources: (Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare 2020) and (Statistics Bureau of 2021) These issues define the “Phillips curve puzzle.” In this paper, we leave the first problem untouched; we simply take b as zero. Figure 1 demonstrates that in the case of Japan, the expected wage inflation is a minor factor, simply because the level of nominal wages has stagnated for two decades, The BOJ’s new monetary policy, introduced in April 2013 under the new governorship of Mr. Haruhiko Kuroda, aimed to raise price/wage hike expectations by doubling the monetary base, but failed to deliver for more than eight years. Thus, ignoring b, we focus on the second problem, namely, why a becomes smaller in Eq. (1). For this purpose, we consider a minimal model of the labor market. We believe that it is useful and important to establish a minimal model to organize various issues concerning the Phillips curve puzzle. In a simple model of the dual labor market (as in McDonald and Solow 1981, 1985; Gordon 2017), we explore the kinds of changes in the economy that flatten the Phillips curve. The analysis of the model reveals that the level of bargaining power of workers, the elasticity of the supply of labor to wages in the secondary market, and the composition of the workforce are the main factors explaining the Philips curve. Our main contribution is to provide a compact model that considers the joint evolution of structural factors that have been hitherto investigated separately in the literature.Footnote 1 The main finding is that the change in the shape of the relationship between the level of economic activity and wage inflation can only be explained by the joint effects of these four factors. More specifically, none of these factors by themselves appear to generate the shift in the wage Phillips curve observed in the data. This conclusion introduces a new and original perspective because, to the best of our knowledge, the theoretical literature has so far either focused on subsets of factors at the time, or provided a microeconomic explanation based on changes in the behavior of employers and workers. Our study suggests that any attempt to explain the dramatic shift in the relationship between wage inflation and the level of economic activity observed for Japan should focus on the deep structural modifications in the labor market that have occurred over the last three decades. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical model and the analytical solution. Section 3 presents some comparative statics and sensitivity analysis, which are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides some concluding remarks.",

The persistence of high demand for paper currency is mostly – according to Rogoff – due to the profitability of the use of cash for illegal activities such as tax evasion, criminal activity and terrorism. Krueger and Seitz (2018) reassume the debate on pros and cons in the use of cash. Most analyses focus on the macro framework, suggesting the need for cash payment limitations imposed by governments whose efficacy against informal economy, tax evasion, criminal activities and terrorism is a matter of debate (Passas 2018). An issue that is under-investigated in this field is the micro foundation of cash preference and its relevance to also determining high levels of cash usage in a totally legal framework. The policy evaluation of cash payment limitation should also address its implications for consumer behaviours, inequality issues and institutional design. Consequently, in this paper, we collect some insights from psychological and economic literature on the individual preferences for cash payments to investigate if a specific preference for cash usage can be a consumer’s trait, attitude or characteristic justifying a micro analysis of purchasing behaviour that could explain a relevant use of cash in a legal economy. On the bases of these insights from scientific literature, we propose an agent-based model describing an economy with individuals with heterogeneous preferences about the means of payment to analyse the aggregate results in different scenarios. The focus is on the shares of cash transactions in terms of number of transactions and transaction value, and how their divergent and different figures can be explained by different preferences and consumption structures. By assuming that the majority of consumers has preferences for means of payments differentiated according to the transaction value and that transactions are mainly concluded among individuals with similar preferences, simulations results show that the value and the number of cash transactions is determined both by the preference structure and the frequency of low-value transactions (consumption structure). Results are compared with main figures of cash usage in EU, where countries have strongly differentiated measures, both in their absolute value and in the distance between transaction numbers and their values. Simulations results are coherent with EU average data for the percentage value of cash transactions, but underestimate the share of cash transactions by number. Since the main objective of this study is to obtain simulations data that are comparable with countries’ data, according to different preferences distributions and legal rules on cash transactions, simulations results are compared with disaggregated data for 19 countries. To the best of our knowledge, a similar attempt to model cash preferences was conducted by Arango-Arango and colleagues (2018), who compare simulation results with empirical data for 4 countries to test the validity of certain assumptions concerning cash payments and holdings. A major difference in our work is in assuming that individuals are heterogeneous in preferences for cash payments, and in testing whether these differences can explain the observed behaviour in terms of the share of cash transactions by number and value of transactions, considering a wider range of countries (19 countries). Furthermore, Arango-Arango and colleagues (2018) concentrate on the use of cash as a mean of payment and on cash management to test two optimal policies. Our work mainly concerns the use of cash as a mean of payment and how it is differentiated according to the transaction value. Results in the study by Arango-Arango and colleagues (2018) well explain cash payment shares by transaction value for Canada, France and Germany, but not for the Netherlands, whereas, our results sufficiently explain data for 14 of the 19 countries considered, including the Dutch and the German case. In details, countries’ validation confirms simulations results for almost all EU countries where no cash payment limitation is imposed by law. Where cash policies are adopted, results show a better fit for countries nudging consumers to adopt non-cash means of payments compared with countries forcing them not to use cash. The paper is organized as follow. In the following sections, we review scientific literature and empirical evidence both from economics (Sect. 2) and psychology (Sect. 3) to develop basic hypotheses on consumer behaviour about the means of payments (Sect. 4). Section 5 describes the behavioural model and Sect. 6 presents the simulation results and their comparisons with country data. Concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 7.",

Radical transformation of the workplaces (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011; Ford 2015) may lead to the displacement of large fractions of the workforce as tasks will increasingly be done by intelligent machines (Frey and Osborne 2017). This is one projection of what to expect. Another perspective emphasizes that also this transformation will bring prosperity as it was the case with technological advancements in the past. Among the countervailing forces to the displacement of workers, it has been put forward that automation might augment tasks carried out by workers, thereby increasing their productivity, that total productivity increases may lead to higher aggregate demand thus increasing labor demand, and that it may create new jobs as tasks will emerge that did not exist in the past (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b, 2019a; Autor and Salomons 2018; Vivarelli2014). In this paper, we aim to shed more light on the consequences of automation for economies paying particular attention to the distributional effects of automation. We do this by building a dynamic industry model with task-based production on the firm level where firms decide on whether to allocate workers or machines to different tasks. Firms compete both on the product and the labor market. We are interested in how the allocation decisions of firms change in the presence of different forms of automation. In particular, we consider four different types of automation: deepening of automation which affects the productivity of machines, labor augmenting technological changes which affect the productivity of workers, automation that affects both capital and labor, and a shift in the set of tasks that constitute the production function. A central feature of our analysis is that we analyze the consequences of these various forms of automation on the distribution of wages between and within firms, and on the functional income distribution. An important aspect of our analysis is that we explore how the effects of automation depends on the competitiveness of the industry. We distinguish between industries in which high barriers to entry prevent the entry of additional competitors and industries without entry barriers where recurrent entry and exit, triggered by positive respectively negative firm profits, occurs. We examine to which extent and why the competitiveness of markets alters the distributional effects of automation. Moreover, we analyze the role of heterogeneous as opposed to homogeneous agents. We compare the outcomes of automation when workers have homogeneous skills to the outcomes we get with high skill and low skill workers. In addition, we explore a version of our model with two types of firms. One set of firms has high wage setting power, and another set of firms has low wage setting power. Our analysis, paying particular attention to the distributional consequences in the light of potential market entry and exit of firms, extends existing analyses of the economic effects of automation. Our investigation borrows from task-based models studying the consequences of automation for labor markets and the macroeconomy (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018a; 2019a). Also the distinction between different types of automation addressed in our analysis builds on this stream of literature, which emphasizes the countervailing forces that different changes in productivity have, in particular, on labor demand. A recurring theme here is that, on the one hand side, automation reduces the amount of labor as more tasks are done by machines. On the other hand, as capital can perform tasks more cheaply, productions costs of firms decrease making them more productive. To the extent that firms expand due to the productivity effect, labor demand will increase, and more so when automation is accompanied with the creation of new tasks. Which of the two effects dominates will determine how employment and earnings are affected. Related to the productivity effect in this strand of the literature is also an observation that automation that comes with low productivity effects, which Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019b) call “so-so technologies”, will likely be detrimental to workers. While the economic mechanisms driving the results of our analysis are also related to different types of automation and their effect on the productivity of firms, we consider a dynamic industry framework, where the task allocation decisions are made on the firm level rather than on a macroeconomic level. This allows us to incorporate competition effects and to more closely pay attention to industry dynamics and the role that heterogeneous workers and firms may play with respect to the economic consequences of automation. We rely in our analysis on an agent-based modeling approach, which has become a widely used approach for studying issues related to innovation and industrial dynamics from an evolutionary perspective, see, e.g. Nelson and Winter (1982), Dosi et al. (1995), Landini et al. (2017), and Dawid et al. (2019), or the survey in Dawid (2006), as well as in labor economics (Neugart and Richiardi 2018), and macroeconomics (Dawid and Delli Gatti 2018; Dosi and Roventini 2019). Several recent contributions have studied different implications of automation using an agent-based approach. Vermeulen et al. (2020) investigate an agent-based model with multiple sectors and occupations. They explore the effect of productivity increases and the creation of new sectors on employment and wages, and various policies to mitigate the negative consequences of automation on workers. They find that robotization causes the stagnation of wages as there is less wage competition across sectors. Robotization, however, also leads to the emergence of new sectors where labor shortage leads to price-wage spirals pushing up wages. Fierro et al. (2022) also base their analysis on a multi-sector model. Workers have heterogeneous skills and firms post vacancies requiring different skills due to an endogenous skill-biased technological change. They show that automation leads to job polarization, and how a minimum wage policy may increase aggregate productivity. Job polarization is driven by automation that mainly affects manufacturing and triggers the emergence of high skill and low skill occupations in the service sector, and reduces the number of occupations requiring medium skills. Central to this result are stronger consumption preferences for personal services of the high skill workers, who profit from automation, compared to the rest of the population. Dosi et al. (2022) extend the well established K+S agent-based macroeconomic framework to a multi-sector setting with endogenous occurrence of technological paradigms to study the employment effects of automation. It is shown how aggregate income balances labor creation and destruction to avoid persistent technological unemployment. The findings, in particular with respect to technological unemployment, are the result of new technologies leading to the destruction of sectors as well as the emergence of new sectors. Product innovation affects aggregate demand via consumption rules that are linked to the emergence of products that households have a preference for. Depending on their income consumers allocate their income to basic goods or luxury goods. Overall, it is shown how a resilient economy can absorb technological shocks by avoiding negative feedback loops that affect the labor market and the income distribution by fostering the pass-through of productivity growth to wage growth. Bertani et al. (2020, 2021) incorporate digital assets, which are produced in a separate sector and increase productivity of consumption good producers into an agent-based macroeconomic model. They show that in such a setting technological unemployment emerges in the long run. The productivity effect of the digital assets leads to a reduction in employment in the production sector that cannot be compensated by new jobs created in the digital sector. More generally, effects of (rapid) technological change on the wage distribution have been studied in numerous agent-based settings, see e.g. Dosi et al. (2017), Dawid et al. (2018), Caiani et al. (2019), and Dawid and Hepp (2021). In contrast to these agent-based studies, our approach features market entry and exit of firms, and various forms of automation that we compare. Moreover, using a task-based approach, we are able to speak to the effects of automation on the wage distribution disentangling the effects on between firm and within firm wage effects. Within our framework, these wage effects can be traced to the firms’ decisions on how to allocate machines and workers on tasks, and the firms’ decision to enter or leave the market as a consequence of automation that changes profits to be earned. In this respect, our theoretical analysis also relates to empirical studies that explore the consequences of automation on the firm level. Due to data limitations this is still a small literature, that, however, has already interesting insights to offer.Footnote 1Barth et al. (2020) shows that robots have positive effects on average wages, and that wages of high skill workers increase relative to wages of the low skill workers in firms that robotize. Dixon et al. (2021) find that investment in robots increases total employment within firms, which, in their sample of Canadian firms, is a composite effect of higher employment of high skill workers and of low skill workers, and lower employment of middle skill workers. In contrast, Koch et al. (2021), based on Spanish data, find that employment in firms adopting robots increases for all skill groups. Moreover, they show that the labor cost share in firms adopting robots decreases. Domini et al. (2021) document that the channel through which automation raises firms’ employment growth rate is through a higher hiring rate and a lower separation rate. Interestingly, they also show that automation spikes are not associated with changes in the occupational composition of firms or changes in jobs that can be characterized as routine or non-routine. In a follow-up paper, Domini et al. (2022) again use French firm-level data to explore the effect of automation on within and between firm wage inequality. They find that the largest part of the wage inequality within each sector is due to within firm inequality and that automation spikes have hardly any impact on this inequality. Our task-based theoretical analysis with heterogeneous worker skills offers economic mechanisms that may help to better understand the empirical effects of automation on the firm level. In particular, we can demonstrate how automation changes the task allocation of firms that produce by combining different tasks, where lower ranked tasks are more likely run by machines and higher ranked tasks are more likely done by workers. This is accompanied by changing wages paid to high skill and low skill workers driven by changes in the productivity of tasks and by changes in the composition of workers doing specific tasks. Moreover, we can show how high skill workers may crowd out low skill workers on lower tasks, or in some instances may withdraw from lower tasks and rather apply for higher tasks as new firms enter the market due to better profit opportunities caused by automation. We proceed by introducing our task-based simulation framework in Section 2. In Section 3, we parameterize our model and introduce the experiments. Section 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 concludes.",

However, while researchers understand the tax system’s impact on economic behavior and performance in the short run, few have studied the long-term evolution of the tax incentives that entrepreneurs face. A long-run perspective is informative because formal institutions such as tax systems generally change slowly and entrepreneurs need time to adjust. That said, three related problems – one theoretical, one empirical, and one data-related – complicate the examination of entrepreneurs’ long-term tax incentives. First, there is no clear theoretical consensus on how entrepreneurship should be defined (Hébert and Link 2006). Second, there is an empirical problem related to the fact that tax codes never recognize entrepreneurial income as a distinct tax category. Third, there is a general lack of sufficiently long and detailed time series. By addressing these three problems, we can examine the long-term evolution of the taxation of Swedish owner-entrepreneurs, adding to the literature on institutions and entrepreneurship in several ways. First, we theoretically associate entrepreneurship with profit-oriented ownership following the argument of Knight (1921) that the pursuit of profit is entrepreneurs’ major motivation in introducing innovations and that they can only exercise entrepreneurial judgment when they own productive resources. The judgment-based definition suggests that firm ownership should be concentrated in entrepreneurial firms because entrepreneurs prefer to appropriate as much of the potential profit possible and because entrepreneurs and external investors may disagree about the value of entrepreneurs’ investment projects, especially in the early phases. Moreover, scholars holding this view generally argue that the unit of analysis in entrepreneurship should be investments rather than, e.g., opportunities (Foss and Klein 2012: 102). The solution to the second (empirical) problem follows from our solution to the first. Here, we treat owners of closely held corporations as a relevant pool of potential entrepreneurs. Swedish tax law also differentiates between active owners, i.e., owners who take part in corporate governance and development, and passive owners, who merely provide capital. Thus, the theoretical definition enables us to resolve the problem of the lack of a tax category for entrepreneurial income by capturing entrepreneurship as investments made by active owners of closely held corporations, which serve as an empirical approximation that is theoretically congruent with the judgment-based entrepreneurship perspective. Third, we resolve the time-series problem by exploiting Swedish tax data from 1862 (when Sweden implemented a major new state central government tax system) until 2018. This period encompasses Sweden’s industrialization, urbanization, and democratization, as well as the more recent turn from a managed to an entrepreneurial economy (Audretsch and Thurik 2000). While Sweden is often considered something of an institutional outlier, we argue that the country’s institutional evolution has been similar to other OECD countries: the country was in general characterized by high-quality institutions for the entire period, and only really diverged in terms of tax policy for a few decades in the second half of the twentieth century (de la Escosura 2016). We therefore deem the results of our study to be generalizable beyond the Swedish case. More specifically, we analyze the evolution of capital income taxation of investments faced by owner-entrepreneurs, defined as active owners of closely held corporations. We calculate the marginal effective tax rate (METR) on capital income by means of the King and Fullerton (1984) method, developed with the explicit purpose of comparing tax rates across countries and investment projects. A recent extension enables us to include the tax rules for closely held corporations for the whole period based on the King and Fullerton framework (Wykman 2022). To further understand how the evolution of the tax system shapes entrepreneurial incentives and distortions, we distinguish the tax effect on investments when entrepreneurial incomes and sources of finance differ, updating and complementing earlier data with recently compiled tax data on closely held corporations (Wykman 2022). Except for Swedish studies (e.g., Henrekson and Stenkula 2015), we are unaware of any other taxation analysis offering a similar level of detail or coverage. In addition to producing long-term tax series for active owners of closely held corporations as a proxy for entrepreneurs’ taxation, our focus is on examining whether the tax system has been characterized by distinct periods with different entrepreneurship incentives. The analysis reveals that the Swedish tax system experienced dramatic changes from 1862 to 2018; the results suggest the emergence (and disappearance) of several tax regimes with distinct conditions for entrepreneurship, a fact that we confirm econometrically by means of structural break analysis. We identify five tax regimes and characterize them according to three metrics indicative of each regime’s entrepreneurial incentives: the magnitude of the METR, the difference in the METR between average- and top-income entrepreneurs, and the difference in the METR according to the source of finance. Regime I corresponds to the period until the middle of World War I. The regime stands out for its particularly favorable entrepreneurial incentives, with a low METR irrespective of income and source of finance. The METR grew during regime II (lasting until late World War II) and III (ending around the mid-1960s) to peak during regime IV (ending around 1990). The increasingly higher general taxation level likely had adverse effects on entrepreneurial incentives to establish and grow firms, as did the pronounced differences in treatment between top- and average-income entrepreneurs. The favorable treatment of retained earnings over new share issues during regimes II–IV likely favored well-established incumbents with prior profits at the expense of new entrants lacking retained earnings. During regime V, which may be labeled corrective, the METR decreased substantially. Differences between average- and top-income taxation virtually vanished, while taxation differences related to the source of finance decreased. Our analysis reveals considerable differences in how the institutions of the tax system have affected entrepreneurial investment incentives in Sweden. When we tie these findings to long-term indicators of entrepreneurship, the results suggest that growth-conducive tax incentives for high-impact entrepreneurship help explain the establishment and success of most of Sweden’s largest entrepreneurial firms during the first regime. Likewise, the relative dearth of high-impact entrepreneurship during most of the twentieth century can be partly explained by the meager tax incentives that evolved during regimes II, III, and IV.Footnote 1 Conversely, regime V’s improved incentives likely help explain why Sweden has experienced an entrepreneurial renaissance. We contribute to the previous literature in two core ways. First, we use a clear theoretical definition of entrepreneurship (the investment activities of the owner-entrepreneur) to arrive at a legal definition (investments made by active owners of closely held corporations) that is sufficiently discriminant to allow empirical study. Second, while elucidating the tax system’s long-term effect on incentives to establish and build entrepreneurial firms in Sweden, the study also has a bearing on the broader literature on institutional evolution and quality, highlighting a general phenomenon through an in-depth analysis of a specific country. The analysis is transparent and potentially applicable to other countries.",

Rising concentration levels in the economy fuel demands for antitrust to do more. However, the neoclassical economic methods applied in practice constrain application of antitrust law to a limited number of straightforward cases like cartels and mergers to monopoly. Other antitrust cases are excessively costly to bring and fail to deliver appropriate and timely responses to business conduct and transactions that harm competition. Besides, the practice of antitrust law is governed by a set of protocols, rules, and tools that makes limitative assumptions about the economy. The methods of antitrust law were good enough for a simple agrarian economy with decreasing returns, fungible production factors, and technological maturity. The sophistication brought by price theory and microeconomics also worked well in the context of the 20th-century industrial economy, with the growth of large, multi-product firms and global markets. But today, the method of antitrust law appears ill-suited to a complex economy with unprecedented types and levels of increasing returns, feedback loops, and technological dynamism. Unless neoclassical antitrust makes a ‘complexity’ leap, it is doomed to irrelevance, and a diminishing role in the “broader gestalt of technology and industrial policies.” (Teece 2018).",1
