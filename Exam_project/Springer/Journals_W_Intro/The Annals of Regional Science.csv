One reason for this is the outcome of technological change itself. In the traditional models of the knowledge production–regional economic growth complex accessibility is defined in terms of the potential of face-to-face interaction as determined by geographical or time distance between regions. However, in the light of the development of a vast range of modern communication media such as Internet, the notions of face-to-face interaction and accessibility need to be reconsidered and redefined. Particularly, the impacts of these changes for the knowledge production–regional economic growth complex need to be assessed. Another reason for intensification of research in this area is the increasing demand from policymakers. For instance, the European Union’s ambition to become the most competitive economy in the world, as formulated in the Lisbon Agenda, requires a substantial increase in knowledge production and innovation. This, in its turn, can be boosted by research on the knowledge production–(regional) economic growth complex. A third reason is the changing institutional context in which this kind of research has taken place. Whereas the typical institutional framework for most research on the knowledge production–regional economic growth complex used to be the national state made up of regions with local or national players, the new playing field is increasingly international or global with both nations and regions as constituting units and international or global players. The free movement of goods and, to a more limited extent, people at the continental level of e.g. the enlarged European Union and North American Free Trade Association and globally in the context of the World Trade Organization as well as the rapid growth of developing countries like China and India, have opened the possibilities for large scale outsourcing and off shoring. The analysis of the impacts of these developments for the knowledge production–(regional) economic growth complex is still in its infancy. Research on topics in this field poses both methodological, theoretical and empirical challenges. In this context further research is also needed on the role of intermediaries. To sum up, in spite of its long tradition in regional science there exists a most challenging, urgent and highly policy relevant research agenda on the knowledge production–(regional) economic growth complex.",

By autonomy, we mean the capacity of a firm to operate relations within its own region or with other, more remote regions (Grosjean and Crevoisier, 2003). Autonomy is therefore the contrary of autarchy (which means no relations with others): it is a capacity to act with, and on, the environment (Varela, 1989). In regional endogenous development approaches,Footnote 1 regional autonomy is necessary because it allows local interaction to take place in order to build local resources and to innovate. During the last 20 years, the development of the financial system and its growing impact on the real economy is raising new questions about regional autonomy and about the limits of endogenous development theories. One of the major areas of evolution within this system corresponds to the process of disintermediation, which consists of the financial institutions becoming removed from their role as the intermediary between savings and credit in order to devote themselves to offering financial services. The link between saver and the investor, which was once carried out by an intermediary, is becoming a direct link between the shareholder and the company. Disintermediation has forced SMEs and family-owned firms to find new equity capital. At the same time, financial markets are providing better access to capital for large companies that use the stock exchanges for this purpose. The consequence of these developments is an increased integration and concentration of corporate ownership as a result of mergers and acquisitions. In France for example, Chabanas (2002) shows that the number of controlled firms was four times higher in 1999 than in 1980. In such a context, one could in fact wonder whether regional autonomy still exists, and thus whether and to what extent endogenous development theories can still be upheld. The “Global City” approach (Sassen, 1991) shows how financial activities have developed in a highly concentrated manner, and consequently the way in which financial centres have concentrated their control over a globalised economy. Since these “global cities” control a significant part of the economy, this naturally means that other regions have at least partially lost their autonomy. In this article, we address the question of regional autonomy by means of an analysis of regional, inter-regional and international corporate ownership in Switzerland. In order for an endogenous development policy to be efficient, it is necessary for the region to have a sufficient degree of autonomy. But are the Swiss regions autonomous? Are they regions that have closed themselves in? Do they have major relationships between each other? Are they all integrated within the international network? The responses to these questions will make it possible to discover which spaces are considered pertinent for the various regions. Autonomy thus becomes a question of primary importance for the regional political authorities. Switzerland has experienced a considerable transformation of its economy over the last 20 years. The international and national financial centres have grown considerably and, in parallel, industry and tourism have encountered difficulties. From a geographical point of view, the regional production systems (RPSs) that constituted the financial centres (Zurich, Geneva, and to a lesser extent Lugano and Basel) have developed, while RPSs that focused on more traditional exports (industry and tourism) have undergone a decline (Corpataux et al. 2003; Crevoisier et al., 2001). In this paper, autonomy is not viewed in the sense of autarchy but rather as the capacity to handle external relationships. The first part of it will therefore address the notion of autonomy in relation to ownership structures. Starting with Sassen’s “Global City” concept and summarising the topic of ownership in literature concerning RPSs, it proposes a typology of regional autonomy based on the various types of inter-regional ownership (controlling regions, controlled regions, etc.) that can be observed. The second section describes data on ownership, followed by a brief description of the regions analysed (RPSs of Switzerland), and then by an explanation of the method used. The third section summarises the main results obtained. The performances of the RPSs are evaluated with the assistances of indices on a national and international level before presenting the overall results and the basic constraints of the study. The final section recalls the main results and draws the parallel between the behaviour of the various regions and their structural specificities.",8
39.0,4.0,The Annals of Regional Science,19 November 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-005-0022-x,Banking structure and regional economic growth: lessons from Italy,December 2005,Stefano Usai,Marco Vannini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The deepening of research on finance and growth over the last two decades has placed on a sound theoretical ground the link between financial development and economic performance (see the surveys by Pagano (1993) and Levine (1997, 2003)), but the evidence gathered so far on the role of intermediaries in the growth process is still incomplete. At the same time, due to regulatory reforms and economic integration, the banking sector is undergoing radical changes worldwide, with significant reallocations of ownership and sheer decline in the number of firms, particularly small banks specialising in small business lending. How is this going to affect economic growth? Unfortunately, the classical cross-country analysis can provide only partial answers. One reason for that is the difficulty of obtaining a suitable breakdown of financial intermediaries across nations with different history, institutions and legal frameworks. By contrast, this can be done with reference to regions of a single country. Moreover, if in the latter production activity happens to be significantly affected by SMEs and the relevant variables vary sufficiently across time and space then, at least indirectly, one may take up the above issue. In what follows we exploit Italy’s features before the liberalisation of European financial markets in order to study from a regional perspective the partial effect of different categories of banks on the rate of economic growth. Although the application can be seen as a robustness check for cross-country analyses, as a matter of fact it relates to a wider set of problems concerning the performance of banks with different lending styles and type of ownership. Two distinct streams of literature relate to our paper. The first is the large body of work on financial structure and economic development originated by Goldsmith (1969) and its follow-up within the endogenous growth literature. The second is a relatively smaller and scattered set of contributions which investigate the relationship between various dimensions of the banking firm (e.g. ownership, as in La Porta et al. (2002), or organisational structure, as in Berger and Udell (2002)) and its lending behaviour. As is well known, Goldsmith (1969) provided considerable evidence on the positive correlation between indicators of financial development and the level of economic activity, but due to data limitations and insufficient theoretical underpinning, was unable to lay bare causal links and growth effects. This task has been carried out by many scholars within the endogenous growth research programme, by stressing the role of financial intermediaries in a world of imperfect informationFootnote 1. In an influential paper by Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990), for instance, trading arrangements are costly to establish and technological shocks have two components—aggregate and project specific—which cannot be observed separately. Organisational structures, like financial intermediaries, arise endogenously to facilitate trade in the economy: “[T]hrough a research type process, intermediaries collect and analyse information that allows investors’ resources to flow to their most profitable uses. By investing through an intermediary, individuals gain access, so to speak, to a wealth of experience of others” (p. 2). Thanks to their large portfolios intermediaries can infer the aggregate productivity shock and select the best technology relative to the current realisation of the shock. Furthermore, by performing their traditional risk pooling activities, they are able to offer individuals both a higher and safer return. As the economy grows it becomes possible to implement costly financial structures, which in turn promote growth by allowing a higher rate of return to be earned on capital. Bencivenga and Smith (1991), instead, derive new links from the basics of banking, i.e. borrowing from and lending to large numbers of agents. This being the case, the law of large numbers implies that withdrawal demand becomes fairly predictable, which in turn means that the bank can channel funds to productive investment while offering deposits to risk averse savers keeping a smaller amount of liquid reserve holdings relative to a situation of direct finance. By providing these services optimally, the banking industry reduces the fraction of savings that society has to hold in the form of unproductive liquid assets and increases the rate of capital accumulation. If growth is modelled as an endogenous process, this is going to affect positively the rate of economic growth. A direct mechanism was suggested by King and Levine (1993a,b), who restated in a modern general equilibrium framework Schumpeter’s idea that profit-seeking innovators are the main actors of economic growth. Accordingly, financial institutions stimulate growth by sorting and funding innovative entrepreneurial activities, i.e. by accelerating the pace of technological changeFootnote 2. These new insights have produced a large empirical literature. We provide a short account of these applications in the next section. It is worth stressing, however, that although most findings are broadly consistent with the prediction that countries with better-developed financial systems grow faster, they are still controversial and, what’s more, provide little guidance to policymakers. As pointed out recently by Zingales (2003), there are at least six weak links in the quest for a reliable relation between finance and growthFootnote 3. Our attempt here addresses directly one of these, namely the limitations of measures of financial development, and has the ambition, by studying the role of different bank intermediaries, of providing some clue to policymakers for evaluating the present-day consolidation. The second stream of literature relevant for our work focuses on two closely related aspects: the interaction between lending styles and the organisational structure of the banking firm; the influence of ownership on bank behaviour. Following Berger and Udell (2002) lending can be categorised into four different technologies: financial statement lending, asset-based lending, credit scoring and relationship lending. The first three technologies, also known as transaction-based lending, require as input “hard” information that is relatively easily available at the time of loan origination and does not rely on ‘soft’ data gathered over the course of a relationship with the borrower”Footnote 4 (p. 36). In contrast, under relationship lending “the lender bases its decisions in substantial part on proprietary information about the firm and its owner gathered through a variety of contacts over time” (p. 37). A pivotal role within relationship lending is played by the loan officer, who collects and provides to the bank soft, hard to quantify information concerning the firm, its owner and the local community. Clearly, this type of lending is worthwhile with informationally opaque customers, like many small businesses. In any event, in order to offer relationship lending, greater authority must be delegated to the loan officer, with the twofold consequence of worsening agency problems between the officer and the bank and creating the need for an organisational structure capable of coping with them. Viewing bank lending as the outcome of a hierarchy of contracting problems in which the interaction between the loan officer and the small business borrowers is just the first layer of contractingFootnote 5, Berger and Udell (2002) argue that small banks may do better than large banking corporations in activities based on soft information. Several studies confirm this prediction (see, in addition to the works referred to in the paper, Berger et al. (2002) and Cole et al. (2004)), hence we should expect larger institutions to be less likely to make relationship loans. As to the influence of ownership on bank behaviour, two recent works need consideration here. La Porta et al. (2002) investigate the consequences for economic and financial development of government ownership of banks according to two different perspectives, the “development” view and the “political” viewFootnote 6. The former places government ownership of banks within a broader plan for reaching social objectives through government control of strategic economic sectors. The latter emphasizes political objectives, i.e. the provision through the control of enterprises (including banks) of employment, subsidies and other benefits in exchange for votes and political support. Both views imply greater pervasiveness of government ownership in poorer countries or, more generally, countries with less well functioning institutions. However, ceteris paribus, the development view implies that government ownership of banks should benefit subsequent economic development, whereas the political view implies a detrimental effect due to crowding out of private firms. The empirical findings, using data from 92 countries around the world, support some elements of the development view but are overall more favourable to the political view (p. 267). Much in the same vein, Paola Sapienza (2002) considers three main views of state-owned enterprises (social, agency and political) and tests their validity by looking at the differences in the credit policies of both privately owned and state-owned banks. The analysis, based on a unique dataset on over 37,000 Italian firms, examines the interest rate charged to similar companies (in terms of risk profile) by the two types of banks. Overall, the results are supportive of the political view and suggest that “state-owned banks serve as a mechanism to supply political patronage” with “distorting effects on the financial allocations of resources” (p. 3). In light of these findings it is evident that a large body of the current empirical research on finance and growth, based on aggregate cross-country measures, is neglecting an important trait of the financial structure. Our contribution exploits the peculiarities of the Italian context before the unification of the European financial market to fill this gap. Using a panel approach we find that, irrespective of ownership, large banks are, if anything, negatively correlated with growth, whereas cooperative banks and special credit institutions do have a positive influence. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section selectively discusses recent empirical work on finance and growth. Section 3 documents the importance of SMESs for economic performance across the main world economies and their dependence on external finance provided by banks. Section 4 describes the Italian context over the estimation period. Section 5 presents the methodology and the main empirical findings. Section 6 concludes.",45

A study of the literature reveals that knowledge is maintained to be the most important as well as the most generic input into innovation processes [see, inter alia, Lundvall, 1992]. Consequently, much research has focused on how firms gain and generate new knowledge and how such processes relate to innovation performance. The lack of confidence in the linear model of innovation (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986; Fischer et al., 1999; Fischer, 1999) has indeed made this a complex task. It is increasingly being recognized that firms should not be studied in isolation. Interdependent relations with the surrounding environment are also important factors to be incorporated in the analysis (see e.g. Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Accordingly, a firm's knowledge is not only dependent on its internal learning activities, but also on the learning activities of various actors around the firm. A mixture of externalities based upon localization economies can be used to explain how and why the performance of an individual firm is affected by factors external to the firm. From the seminal works of Marshall (1920), Arrow (1962) and Romer (1986), the idea of so-called MAR-externalities has been advanced. In principle, it tells us that the size and the intensity of (positive) industry-specific externalities increase with the size of the industry. MAR-externalities are sometimes referred to as static externalities (see e.g. Echeverri-Carroll and Brennan, 1999), since it is the current scale/size of the industry that generates the externalities. Despite the recognition of the MAR-externalities, some authors claim that dynamic externalities play a greater role than static ones. For example, Krugman and Obstfeld (2000) maintain that externalities stemming from the accumulation of knowledge are probably more important for innovation performance. Notwithstanding the distinction between different types of externalities, it is clear that the economic milieu in which a firm operates has an effect on its performance. The impact of external knowledge on the innovation performance of the firm is most often explained by knowledge spillovers, a particular type of MAR-externalities. What are then knowledge spillovers? In the literature, Griliches (1992) makes a distinction between 1) pure knowledge spillovers (or idea spillovers) and 2) rent spillovers.Footnote 1 Pure knowledge spillovers are pure externalities, in the sense that they are uncharged, unintended and not mediated by any market mechanism. Rent spillovers are those externalities that are at least partially paid for. For instance, they may be embedded in goods or they may be the result of explicit transactions of patent rights, etc. A precise distinction between the two categories is difficult to draw in practice, especially as spillovers become more complex and there is a ‘club element’ to knowledge. For instance, suppose that being a member of a network of skilled knowledge workers involves the sharing of useful information with other members of the network. If a member expects some information in return in the future, is this a pure knowledge spillover or a rent spillover? Clearly there is some important middle ground for which the literature has yet to come up with precise definitions. Johansson (2004) fills this gap by parsing the menagerie of agglomeration and network externalities. Much attention in the literature has been given to spatial aspects of knowledge flows (among others Jaffe, 1989; Acs et al., 1992, 1994; Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Anselin et al., 1997, 2000; Autant-Bernard, 2001). Such flows are seen as being most effectively mediated through face-to-face (FTF) contacts. Thus, proximity between knowledge exchangers is deemed critical. Recalling the well-established axiom in regional economics that “interaction decreases with distance,” (Beckmann, 2000, p. 129), it is clear that proximity has a role to play. Some confusion can easily emerge around such a reasoning. On the one hand, flows of knowledge need not be bounded by space. Geroski (1995), for instance, refers to knowledge as the classic example of a public good, i.e. it is non-rival and non-excludable. On the other hand, all kinds of knowledge are not distance-insensitive. Different forms of knowledge certainly require different amounts of efforts to be transmitted. The concept of tacit knowledge is repeatedly employed by many authors to explain why FTF-contacts are necessary for efficient transmission of knowledge (e.g. Audretsch and Feldman, 1996). In fact, it seems to be a consensus among researchers that much relevant knowledge is tacit in nature (see e.g. Maillat and Kebir, 2001; Lorenzen, 1996). In contrast to knowledge that can relatively easily be transformed into information and, hence, is possible to transmit via existing communication channels, tacit knowledge has been defined as semi-and unconscious knowledge that does not exist in printed explicit forms (Leonard and Sensiper, 1998). For example, learning to ride a bicycle is something most easily done by practice, and is difficult (if possible) to communicate in written form. The unit of observation in this paper is a corporate group, which is defined as being either an individual corporation or two or more corporations with ownership relations. A company is a parent company of another (subsidiary) company if it owns more than 50% of the latter's total stock.Footnote 2 It has long been recognized that R&D may be placed in special departments, or companies. For example, Whitehead (1926, p. 98) wrote that “The greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the invention of the method of invention.” Mowery and Rosenberg (1998) describe the importance of the development of formalized R&D institutions in the U.S. in the 20th century. Thus, R&D decisions may be taken centrally at group headquarters, rather than in the individual companies belonging to the group. This gives credit to the use of the whole group as the observational unit when studying R&D. Also, knowledge flows between research departments within the same groups can be expected to be higher than knowledge flows emanating from other groups' R&D departments. The purpose of the present paper is to study how accessibility to knowledge sources affects the production of new knowledge in Swedish groups. In this process we check for effects arising from being close to other knowledge handlers, including those within the group. We use groups as our unit of analysis, because many of the research-intensive firms are part of large groups (multinationals) in Sweden (see Braunerhjelm, 1998) that are connected via “parent and daughter” relationships. For instance, Fors and Svensson (1994) report that 83% of total Swedish industrial R&D is conducted in multinational enterprises. In addition, the effects of (mainly product) R&D in Swedish multinational enterprises seem to have a causal bidirectional relationship to foreign sales, indicating that the benefits of Swedish R&D mainly occurs abroad (Fors and Svensson, 2002). No previous analyses have, to the authors' knowledge, been made in this setting using groups as the unit of analysis. The analysis is conducted by investigating the relationship between a group's innovativeness and its accessibility to R&D resources. Innovativeness is measured as the number of patents granted to a group. The patent data used in the analysis come from the European Patent Office (EPO, 2002). It should be mentioned that patents are not the only way to signify innovations. In addition, R&D, innovation expenditures, sales of imitative and innovative products and new product announcements have been used. R&D is in our approach seen as an innovation input rather than an output.Footnote 3 Although patent data are not without their problems (most importantly, we do not know the commercial value of a patent), they are common and useful indicators of innovation and can be assigned to specific firms. We note that no indicator can match patents in terms of the availability of data on fine geographical levels, and over longer time periods. A potential problem of using EPO patent data is that European Patents are more costly to apply for than national patents. These costs are higher because the search for earlier priority (technical knowledge) becomes more pronounced and because more monetary value can be extracted from the monopoly right awarded the patentee. Thus, smaller firms with less far-reaching ambitions with regard to their patenting are likely to be excluded from the data. We believe that this is a minor problem with respect to the sources of data, since the R&D data mainly spring from large firms anyway. However, it implies that the material is somewhat more likely to reflect larger firms, in comparison with the use of national patent data. An advantage, in comparison with using national patent data is, however, that EPO data should more likely reflect a higher value to the group, since its investment is larger. The R&D resources upon which a group's innovativeness is expected to depend, can be divided into internal and external sources: (1) the total input of R&D personnel (man-years) in the group; this represents deliberate efforts to influence innovative output and should be the most fundamental factor, (2) the average accessibility among the group's R&D staff; the accessibility within the group's units (companies) could have an effect on the outcome, (3) the average accessibility to other groups' R&D staff; this represents the possibility to access other groups' R&D efforts, and (4) the average accessibility to university R&DFootnote 4; this factor represents the accessibility to public R&D.Footnote 5 Inspired by the work by Johansson and Klaesson (2001), a distinction is made between intra- and extraregional accessibility. This gives us the opportunity to evaluate the relative benefits of accessibility to different R&D resources. The logic for including a company's accessibility to its own R&D comes from the fact that the total R&D staff of a group are often scattered over separate locations. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, a review of a selection of the studies on “knowledge spillovers” is presented. In Section 3, the dataset and the construction of variables are explained (part of the algebra has been put in an appendix). Thereafter, in Section 4, the model used for empirical estimation is presented, followed by empirical results and comments. Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines some directions for future research.",52
39.0,4.0,The Annals of Regional Science,19 November 2005,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-005-0016-8,Is it time to use activity-based urban transport models? A discussion of planning needs and modelling possibilities,December 2005,Staffan Algers,Jonas Eliasson,Lars-Göran Mattsson,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"For some decades now, transport researchers have put considerable efforts into developing what is called activity-based approaches for modelling urban travel demand (for overviews see Arentze and Timmermans 2000; Ettema and Timmermans 1997; Jovicic 2001; McNally 2000). The basic idea is that travel demand is derived from people’s desires to take part in different activities. In particular, the interrelationships among different activities with respect to temporal and spatial constraints are in focus. It means that an activity-based model typically, or ideally, attempts to derive the travel demand from the desire or need to perform activities, that it focuses on households and interactions among them rather than on individuals, that it handles interdependences among activities across the day, and that it observes the spatial and temporal constraints that the individuals of the households have to obey. Conventional travel demand models, on the other hand, usually take single trips (or possibly tours) of individuals as their starting point. The trips are then modelled with respect to their generation, distribution, modal split and assignment to the networks for road and public transport. This class of models has turned out to be very useful, and also reasonably easy to furnish with data and to implement. One of the major achievements has been the theoretical development of methods of calculating traffic equilibria so that congestion on the road network can be endogenously determined in response to transport policy changes. It has also been possible to extend their area of application as new policy issues have come to the forefront. Yet there is a growing awareness that these models may be inadequate for many important policy issues. They are sometimes criticised for being more suitable for construction of new infrastructure than for analysis of how an efficient management of existing demand can be accomplished (Gärling et al. 2002; Kitamura et al. 1997; Pendyala et al. 1997). Activity-based models with their explicit focus on how people organise their activities in time and space, seem to provide an appropriate perspective in evaluating such strategies. This may also be true for other urgent issues such as the implications of information and communications technology (ICT). This involves ICT for short-term traffic control, effects on short- and long-term demand for transport and on the location of activities that give rise to mobility and goods movement. However, conventional models rely on a long history of experience, while activity-based models are still close to the research frontier and have only been applied in policy studies to a limited extent. Activity-based models do not constitute a well-defined family of models. Some models are fairly close to conventional models in so far that they apply the same kind of probabilistic discrete choice framework based on random utility maximisation (RUM) as in conventional models (e.g., the Portland model by Bowman and Ben-Akiva 2001). Other activity-based models focus more explicitly on the scheduling process. They usually make a distinction between fixed (say work) and flexible (say shopping) activities. The open periods between the fixed activities can be filled up with different flexible activities. These activity choices can be modelled by logit models, as in PCATS by Kitamura and Fujii (1998), or by decision tables representing decision rules, as in Albatross by Arentze and Timmermans (2000, 2004a). AMOS (Activity–Mobility Simulator) by Pendyala et al. (1998) represents still another approach. Here the idea is to predict how observed activity patterns change in response to a specific policy change. An important distinction of activity-based models is that they are tour-based rather than trip-based. This means for the Portland model that all travel is viewed as round trips starting and ending at home and that the temporal and spatial connections between the activities within one tour are cared for (Bowman and Ben-Akiva 2001). A daily activity pattern, which consists of a set of tours, forms the basis for the individual’s activity and travel demand. The tours are modelled with respect to destination, mode and time of day. It should be noted, however, that to be tour-based is not a quality of activity-based models only. Today many conventional models are also tour-based, following the implementation of the idea in the Dutch National Model System in the 1980’s (Gunn 1994). Albatross is a prototype of a rule-based system that focuses on the scheduling of the activities (Arentze and Timmermans 2000). The intention has been to exploit previous research on activity-based approaches to develop a tool that could be more useful than conventional models for assessing changes in various constraints like flexible working hours or longer opening hours of shops. The AMOS model, developed by Pendyala, Kitamura and others, has a different purpose. It is meant as a system for direct analysis of behavioural adjustment, e.g. in response to proposed travel demand management policies like parking tax, improved bicycle/pedestrian facilities and congestion pricing. The idea is to start with an observed daily activity pattern for an individual; generate a modified pattern as an adaptation to some change in the external conditions; evaluate whether this new pattern is good enough with respect to some satisfacing rule; accept it or continue the search process until an acceptable pattern has been found. The decision criterion belongs to the class of bounded rationality rather than utility maximisation. The activity-based approach is not new. The intellectual roots go back to Hägerstrand (1970) and his time-geography and to Chapin (1974) and his emphasis on individuals’ desires and the personal characteristics behind their engagement in different activities. Whereas Hägerstrand stressed various forms of constraints, Chapin’s interest was more on opportunities and choice. Hägerstrand (1970) introduced three kinds of constraints on the activities an individual can undertake: “capability constraints” are biological constraints related to, e.g. the need of eating and sleeping; “coupling constraints” reflect that certain activities like a meeting require people to be at the same place at the same time; and “authority constraints” are external institutional constraints set by various kinds of regulations such as opening hours of shops and working hours of employees. This in combination with the location of the opportunities where different activities can be performed, and considering with which speed the individual can move given available means of transport, determine the prisms in the time-space, inside which the individual has to act. Activity-based models are very much about to make this simple but brilliant idea operational. In the rest of this article we first discuss what demands we see on future modelling tools for (primarily urban) transport analysis. This discussion is somewhat biased towards what role activity-based models could play in meeting these demands. We then review in some detail three prominent and distinctly different representatives of operational activity-based models to give an indication of what new modelling possibilities they offer. In the final section we draw some conclusions about the prospects of these models and of their descendants.",29

Lipscomb,Michael C. Farmer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Several attempts have been made in the housing literature to manage the theoretical and empirical challenges posed by strong household preference heterogeneity for local amenities. The appearance of economically distinct submarkets or “types” in a study area suggests that planners and analysts will have to account for marked differences in preferences in their housing market equilibrium models. This has led to several attempts to model more complex housing market equilibria to account for taste variation among households. Many analysts now depart from the traditional hedonic pricing method where an analyst estimates the impacts of local amenities or structural characteristics on dwelling prices from an hedonic equation using a regression model. Some employ discrete choice methods (Bayer et al. 2002; Quigley 1985; Chattopadhyay 2000), others use locational equilibria (Sieg et al. 2002), and still others explore random bidding models (Ellickson 1981; Lerman and Kern 1983; Chattopadhyay 1998) as alternative devices to capture diversity considered inaccessible from a single hedonic equation. Yet even these alternative works appeal to some degree to a relatively strong form of Tiebout’s (1956) “voting with your feet” model whereby similar households coordinate to supply an optimal bundle of local amenities befitting their type. Even as Tiebout’s (1956) classic model hints at a “one neighborhood, one type” equilibrium, both Tiebout (1956) and Samuelson (1954) already anticipate its violation. The presence of fixed urban space (the premier scarce resource in a real estate market equilibrium) routinely checks the capacity of any single group to install a set of amenities at the desired scale (i.e. minimum average cost) before they begin to compete for space with other groups. In such a market, “voting with your feet” expands to allow several types to coordinate to supply amenities to one area; or one neighborhood with several types. The prima facie constraint on space has enormous implications for modeling housing market equilibria if the resulting preference diversity for local amenities is far greater than entertained in the alternative equilibria models above. Most housing submarkets are identified for analysis by large, spatially delineated areas such as a census tract, a city, or a county wherein households have similar enough preferences to be to be treated as a single group within that area [Palmquist (1984) and Brasington and Hite (2005)]. Household heterogeneity typically is captured in a single hedonic equation where attribute value falls along a continuum of demographic traits distributed over the market (Leggett and Bockstael 2000; McFadden and Train 2000). These exogenous determinations of submarkets are common in the hedonic price literature. A notable exception to an a priori exogenous definition of a market along the “one area, one type” model is Bourassa et al. (2003) who define real estate appraiser submarkets as a “set of statistically generated submarkets consisting of dwellings that are similar but not necessarily contiguous” (p. 12). In this paper we test whether an endogenous assignment process that uses data on households and the parcels they occupy yields more consistent and efficient estimates of the impacts of amenities or housing structural features on dwelling sales prices. Like Bourassa et al. (2003), we do not mandate parcel contiguity for household types. We consider a small 820-dwelling neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia, well partitioned away from other residential areas by a major interstate highway to the east, a 137-acre closed steel mill to the north, Georgia Tech to the south, and a commercial corridor to the west. A priori, one might argue that a single household type, which can be analyzed using single-line regression models, lives in this neighborhood. Using a unique data set that includes publicly available and survey data, we find three distinct hedonic price functions that each meet the statistical conditions for aggregability of demand for local amenities and cannot be efficiently or consistently combined. Equivalently, we discover that several economically distinct household types occupy the same neighborhood and together they access a uniform bundle of amenities across that space. The approach used in this paper is closest in spirit to Ellickson’s (1981) random bidding model (RBM) in that we examine the household type that is most likely to occupy a given residence. One limitation of the Ellickson model, though, is that it defines household types exogenously, using arbitrary partitions of continuous demographic variables to define groups by discrete income or age categories. Subsequent applications distinguish households by income and family size (Lerman and Kern 1983), by resource access and life-cycle differences (Chattopadhyay 1998), by school districts or by common package of local amenities (Sieg et al. 2002), or by assuming that everyone differs by only a single taste parameter so that all households in a market equilibrium order the most preferred to least preferred neighborhood in exactly the same way (Smith et al. 2004). Critically, in each case these a priori methods for market segmentation are adopted without actually testing the assumption. More diversity in a single neighborhood introduces a new market equilibrium burden on the policy analyst. To respond to the added burdens of modeling and properly estimating a market equilibrium that entertain this higher incidence of preference diversity, we use more information: (1) the continuous variables are not discretized into arbitrary categories and (2) we gain efficiency by allowing regression residuals for each household type to correlate with each other in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model. Finally, we directly test our equilibrium assumption. Our results pass every efficiency test that we can find (please see the Appendix) and the SUR regression system estimation suggests that the groups cannot be combined consistently. The SUR model results are particularly informative. By defining types empirically based on aggregation conditions that satisfy an estimated demand, this housing market equilibrium accounts for competition across groups for particular housing units that cohabit a single neighborhood. Separate hedonic equations by group are no longer truly independent but are related by their mutual entry and competition for housing units in the same neighborhood. The SUR estimator allows for the joint estimation of several distinct hedonic equations and also locates the household type most likely to occupy a given dwelling, closing the key equilibrium concerns in modeling household diversity in a single contiguous space. The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: first, the theory of market segmentation is discussed, followed by an iterative assignment procedure that utilizes principal components analysis PCA and the SUR method. Next, we report our SUR results. Finally, we draw some conclusions.",23

In an attempt to solve these problems, the Swedish Parliament has long conducted a regional policy. In this paper, I intend to evaluate the efficiency of this regional policy using economic theory. I analyze the goals and means of the Swedish regional policy as presented in Government Bills 1997/1998:62 and 2001/2002:4. I begin by presenting the goals and means expressed in these bills. I interpret these goals in terms of economic theory and discuss the realism of the government’s goal of sustainable growth for all regions in the country after reviewing the literature on economic growth and localization. The government’s more important means to achieve its regional policy goals are analyzed—such as subsidies to private and municipal companies in problematic regions, the municipalities tax and subsidy system, investments in transportation infrastructure and investments in regional colleges. Finally, I present my conclusions.",10

The geographic concentration of German manufacturing industries and its determinants,March 2006,Björn Alecke,Christoph Alsleben,Gerhard Untiedt,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Being much inspired by case study work such as Porter (1990) one explicit aim of German regional policy has become the promotion of high-technology industry clusters which are believed to be a universal tool for bringing growth and prosperity to backward regions. The “BioRegio” contest set up in 1995 was an initiative that gave financial aid to the three most promising biotechnology clusters in Germany, and the “InnoRegio” initiative launched in 1999 allocated funds to the least developed regions in East Germany in order to promote the emergence of business clusters. Two important questions are associated with such policy initiatives: (1) which industries tend to agglomerate at all and (2) why do they so? Answering these questions may reveal important leverages for policy initiatives be they for efficiency or equality reasons. In this paper we choose Ellison and Glaeser’s (1997) index of geographic concentration (EG index) and explore to what degree German manufacturing industries are agglomerated due to natural advantages or spillovers.Footnote 1 The focus is on high-technology industries because German regional policy appears to be obsessed with the idea of “high-tech clusters” and devotes large funds to their promotion all over the country. There is a substantial literature on geographic concentration of industry and agglomeration economies building on Marshall (1920). One strand of the literature looks for direct evidence of knowledge spillovers in the sense that it tries to quantify the effect of agglomeration. For example, Jaffe et al. (1993) estimate the effect of agglomeration on local patent citations, Anselin et al. (1997) on the relationship between private and university R&D and Gleaser et al. (1992) and Henderson (1997) on the growth of industry employment. From this field of literature we learnt that knowledge does flow between private and/or public institutions but there is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of inter- vs. intra-industry spillovers (urbanization economies in the spirit of Jacobs (1969) vs. localization economies). Glaeser et al. (1992) and Henderson (1997) argue in favor of the former while Black and Henderson (1999) find only evidence for the latter. In a recent contribution Acs et al. (2002) look at high-technology industries and find evidence for neither of them. A second part of the literature takes an indirect approach and examines geographic concentration of industries, which according to the theory is a prerequisite for spatial spillovers, in detail and with the help of more sophisticated measures.Footnote 2 In some early work Audretsch and Feldman (1996) show that even after controlling for the concentration of production, knowledge-intensive industries in the U.S. tend to cluster. In more recent studies plant-level data is exploited and Ellison and Glaeser’s (1997) index of agglomeration is used, such as in Devereux et al. (2004) for the UK, Maurel and Sédillot (1999) for France, Mayerhofer and Palme (2001) for Austria and in Barrios et al. (2003) who compare in depth Portugal, Ireland and Belgium. An exception is Duranton and Overman (2002) who propose and apply a distance-based measure. In addition to exploring geographic concentration in the U.S. and in West Germany, respectively, Rosenthal and Strange (2001), Dumais et al. (2002) and Keilbach (2002) explain it in a regression analysis to determine the forces that drive agglomeration. In most of these studies extractive industries tend to be the most concentrated ones and there is some tentative evidence that high-technology industries are relatively little concentrated. Our work is in the spirit of this field of the literature. We explore the geographic concentration of German industries and explain it in a regression analysis. We find that high-tech business is not concentrated much neither in absolute nor in relative terms. Since we concentrate on three-digit industries the results can be read as evidence against localization economies from knowledge spillovers. The next section discusses the concentration measure used and describes the agglomeration pattern of the German manufacturing industries. In Section 3 the results of the regression analysis are presented and Section 4 concludes.",70

This approach emphasizes the economic transactions that focus on knowledge itself, and which lead to rapid changes in production. These in turn become incorporated into the economic processes of (a region’s) agents. It follows, therefore, that regions, territories, or space, should not be seen as mere ‘containers’, in which attractive location factors may (or may not) be present, but rather as milieus for collective learning through intense interaction between a broad range of actors (Maskell and Malmberg 1999). A milieu is a created space that is both a result of and a precondition for learning and becomes, as Coffey and Bailly (1996) adduced, an active resource rather than a passive surface. Romer (1990) further argued that on the one hand rapid growth is strongly related to access to new technological ideas, and on the other to the diffusion of such ideas through the productive structure. In this sense, regions should not just be seen as homogenous units across geographical space, but rather as “competitive geographical units that try to obtain an economic advantage through developing or adopting technologically advanced products or processes” (Button and Pentecost 1999 p. 57). This contrasts the traditional neo-classical and post-Keynesian approaches, Footnote 1, which rely only on the mobility of factors of production. Regional competitiveness and development can thus be seen as more related to the efficient use of endogenous resources through technological innovation; rendering such knowledge creation activities as key for the development of regions. It is thus of little surprise that such activities are examined in a growing number of regional studies (e.g. Oakey et al. 1980; Jaffe et al. 1993; Paci and Usai 2000; Kim and Knaap 2001; Sohn et al. 2003; Fischer and Varga 2003) that emphasize the role of innovative and knowledge producing sectors in promoting regional development, and/or the geography of innovation (Piergiovanni and Santarelli 2001). Conversely, such studies draw inspiration from models of endogenous growth, Footnote 2, in which knowledge and innovation is created deliberately through the decisions of economic agents to invest in R&D and innovative sectors. As endogenous growth places emphasis on knowledge and research spillovers from the innovations produced by the R&D sectors; investments in R&D and scientific institutions cease to be mere indicators of economic growth and become producers of substantial interregional differences (Guerrero and Seró 1997). The geographical concentration of a large number of highly educated people is therefore expected to create an appropriate environment for the rapid transfer of knowledge and ideas, which are then transformed into new products and innovative processes. Lucas (1988) for example argued that regions with a high level of innovation have become a ‘destination’ for highly skilled labor and a motivation for further improvements in physical and social infrastructures. Furthermore, technical progress is not an automatic outcome of investment in R&D, but requires an appropriate institutional environment, which is conductive to the adoption and assimilation of new ideas into the production system. Such an ‘environment’ can be considered as a ‘collective learning process’ within which many individuals interact and exchange ideas and information; thereby developing a ‘knowledge-rich’ environment that determines technical progress across space. The existing empirical literature, although placing particular emphasis on innovation as the primary force behind regional growth, it does not address explicitly the specific factors that influence the locational pattern of innovative activities across space. To remedy this, an empirical model is proposed in this paper to examine the factors that affect the location of ‘innovative labor’. Moreover, in the case of Greece and although an increasing number of regional studies (cf. Alexiadis and Tomkins 2004; Christopoulos and Tsionas 2004), have paid attention to issues of regional growth and convergence, the empirical assessment of the location patterns of R&D labor have not so far received the due attention. In this paper an attempt is thus also made to remedy this by shedding some light on the factors that determine the regional distribution of R&D labor in Greece. In particular, the relation between R&D, the economic conditions, the production structure and infrastructure, as well as the extent of agglomeration of the Greek regions will be empirically established. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 descriptive statistics on the key variables are provided so to set the context for the model’s specification. The model is specified in Section 3 together with some discussion of the data. The econometric application is undertaken in Section 4. The paper ends with some conclusions in Section 5.",5

Hammond,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Policymakers and researchers have noted long-standing and large income differences between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions. Indeed, in 2001, per capital personal income for the non-metropolitan U.S. was 69.5% of the metropolitan level, which translates into a per capita income difference of $9,900. In addition, non-metropolitan income is now further below the metropolitan average than it was in 1969, when it was 71.5% of metropolitan income. In other words, non-metropolitan incomes have lagged far below their metropolitan counterparts during the last 30 years and have fallen even further behind. This is important because in 2001 55.6 million (19.5% of U.S. population) people lived in non-metropolitan counties and because these income differences are a crucial input into the policymaking process for the national and regional economic development communities. Theoretical efforts to explain regional income differences and convergence trends often begin with a neoclassical growth model, which assumes that regions share many characteristics in common, especially production technologies (assumed to be subject to constant returns to scale), saving rates, and population growth rates. This economy will exhibit absolute β-convergence, which means that regions will tend to converge to their shared steady state due to diminishing returns to capital. The theoretical literature also allows for a number of different convergence trends to emerge across metropolitan and non-metropolitan economies, depending on differences in steady state determinants, types of production technologies, and the importance of agglomeration economies. For instance, if regions differ in saving/investment rates, population growth rates or other steady-state determinants, then they need not exhibit absolute β-convergence. Instead, diminishing returns to capital may drive regions to their own unique steady state (for more on conditional β-convergence, see Barro (1991), Mankiw et al. (1992). Even after accounting for differences in steady state determinants, we may not find evidence in support of conditional β-convergence if the production function does not exhibit constant returns to scale. This, in turn, might arise from the importance of human capital accumulation. If human capital is less likely to exhibit diminishing returns, then even regions that share identical steady state determinants, and differ only in terms of initial income levels, may fail to converge. Further, agglomeration economies created by knowledge spillovers may offer another route to income divergence, particularly for cities. In this case, the degree of geographic concentration of an industry or the size of the city in general may generate increasing returns to scale. For instance, a large city may offer its firms and workers an environment that facilitates large knowledge spillovers which make the region more competitive as its size increases (Glaeser et al. (1992)). This has the potential to generate regional income divergence, particularly when the overall economy includes both metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions. The empirical literature on metropolitan/non-metropolitan convergence trends has noted the fact that, on average, the metropolitan/non-metropolitan per capita income gap has remained wide during the last 30 years and that where convergence has been observed, it has been within groups of metropolitan or non-metropolitan regions, rather than between them (Henry (1993), Nissan and Carter (1999), Hammond and Thompson (2001), and Hammond (2003)). However, the literature has focused on the evolution of the overall income distribution, without analyzing in detail the convergence characteristics of particular regions. The contribution of this paper is to apply time series methods developed by Carlino and Mills (1993, 1996) to study the aggregate, sub-group, and regional convergence trends exhibited by metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions within the lower 48 U.S. states during the 1969–2001 period. The empirical analysis tests metropolitan and non-metropolitan aggregates for two forms of convergence (stochastic and conditional β-convergence). The results for per capita income suggest that non-metropolitan income has been diverging from below the national average, while metropolitan income has shown little significant evidence of either convergence to the national income level or divergence from it. I also find a strong association for metropolitan zones between high initial levels of educational attainment (measured as the share of residents with four or more years of college) and high starting income levels and strong subsequent income growth. This suggests that agglomeration economies may have played a role in the observed non-convergence of metropolitan zones during the last 30 years. For non-metropolitan regions, those with initial concentrations in farming and mining exhibited the strongest tendencies to diverge from below the U.S. average income level. Non-metropolitan zones with higher initial manufacturing employment shares showed more mixed results. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the time series methodology and provides a discussion of the data and regional aggregation. Section 3 examines the empirical results by region type and by Census region. Section 4 concludes the paper.",11

While von Thünen considered productive land use, in the 1960s several authors developed a version of the model based on residential land use (see, Alonso 1964; Mills 1967; Muth 1969). The residential choice is driven by the trade-off between accessibility and space and determined by the land price pattern. The market equilibrium is known to be efficient (see, e.g., Fujita 1989, pp. 71–75). On the other hand, factor mobility across regions is a main topic of standard international and regional economics. In the absence of mobility costs, marginal products should be equalized across regions if agglomeration is not complete. Under constant-returns-to scale technologies, the market equilibrium ensures efficiency by equalizing factor prices. This paper connects both strands of literature. It considers the allocation of resources when people choose separately their residence and the place of work. The analysis aims at deriving necessary conditions for an efficient distribution of workers and residents. Equalization of marginal products of labor is being tested in the presence of commuting costs. The analysis relies heavily on Wrede (2003). Another aim of the paper is to analyze local public good supply within this spatial model. It raises the question, of whether and how the distribution of labor and, therefore, residents affects the optimum local public good supply and vice versa. Although the principles of local public good provision have been extensively analyzed and land and transportation have already been introduced to local public good theory (see, e.g., Arnott and Stiglitz 1979; Starrett 1988; Hochman et al. 1995; see also Fujita and Thisse 2002, pp. 133–166) to the best knowledge of the author the relationship between the distribution of workers and the distribution of local public good consumers has been neglected by most researchers. One exception is Thisse and Wildasin (1992) who considered household locations and firm locations in the presence of a public facility. However, they analyzed strategic location choices of two firms while this paper assumes a large number of firms and takes the locations of firms as given. Furthermore, whereas Thisse and Wildasin consider only one single public facility, this paper focuses on mobility of residents when public goods are supplied at more than one location. The paper is organized as follows. The basic one-good model within a one-dimensional spatial framework is developed in section two. This section focuses mainly on efficiency conditions. Section three introduces local public goods into the straight-line model and analyzes the impact of local public goods on the distribution of people and vice versa. Afterwards section four sketches the market equilibrium. Finally, section five summarizes the main results and shows some points of departure for further research.",

Kymn,Brian Cushing,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"When trying to understand regional economic performance in the United States and why it varies across regions, scholars and policymakers generally focus on standard factors such as industrial mix, infrastructure development, work force quality, and taxes. Perhaps due to the assumption that capital flows freely, relatively little attention has been devoted to the effect that monetary policy and the banking system might have on regional economic performance. In recent years, several papers have considered whether the banking system contributes to the differing economic fortunes of U.S. regions. Most have focused on the “credit channel” or “credit view,” which posits that conditions in the financial sector can affect real economic activity. From a regional perspective, the credit view suggests that a region’s banking sector health affects its aggregate economic performance. This paper examines the credit view theory at the state level. We investigate whether states having healthy banking sectors experience stronger economic growth compared with states that have less healthy banking sectors. The paper focuses especially on how the distributional imbalance of bank capital across states influences relative economic performance. This research differs from previous work in several ways. First, unlike all but a few papers, we examine the credit view theory at the state level, rather than at the national or regional level. Second, we use a two-equation model to examine the two critical components of the state-level credit channel. One equation focuses on the relationship between state banking sector health and loans made within a state. The second equation explains the link between loans and state economic growth. Third, we use a very specific measure of loans, which we refer to as “investment-oriented bank loans” (IOBL). As discussed later, this excludes a few categories of loans that we consider as “non-investment-oriented bank loans” (non-IOBL). We believe that IOBL provides a better measure of direct state investment and is more appropriate for analyzing the credit view theory. Fourth, the analysis uses per capita gross state product (GSP) to measure state economic performance, rather than proxies for output such as per capita personal income or employment that most others have used in state-level studies. GSP more directly measures state economic activity. Finally, we analyze our panel of data (annual observations on each of the 48 contiguous states for the 10-year period, 1984–1993) using recent dynamic pooled estimators not previously used in state-level credit view analysis. In the next section, we briefly discuss the credit view theory and the relevant literature, particularly recent state-level studies. In Section 3, we lay out the theory that suggests the presence of a state-level credit channel, and then derive the empirical model. We discuss the data and estimation methodology in Section 4 and analyze empirical results in Section 5, before finishing with concluding remarks in Section 6.",1

With a nation’s unemployment commonly seen as a barometer of its economic health, Japan’s increased unemployment has worried the government and prompted consideration of several policy options. Previous studies have analyzed unemployment rate in general (e.g. Rosen 1984; and Partridge and Rickman 1997). However, the issue of unemployment has stimulated particular interest in Japan because the unemployment rate varies so remarkably among regions. Large metropolitan areas such as Tokyo have generally had lower unemployment rates than smaller cities. Even among large metropolitan areas, however, there is a puzzling exception; the second largest city, Osaka, suffers from a high unemployment rate. In October 2002, the Kansai region, including the Osaka metropolitan area, recorded an unemployment rate of 7.2%, much higher than the average Japanese rate of 5.5%. Theoretically, regional differentials of unemployment rate are attributed to the friction resulting from adjustments to the mismatch between demand and supply of labor markets among regions. These factors consist of the costs of exchanging information, moving, conducting transactions related to housing, and dealing with psychological effects. While these components are important, they do not fully account for regional differentials in unemployment rate. In fact, industrial structure seems to have a clear effect on unemployment rate, and this paper examines that effect, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that more industrially diversified metropolitan areas have lower frictional unemployment rates. This paper follows the theoretical justification of Simon (1988), who, by assuming that the frictional component of employment fluctuations is a random variable and independent across industries, argues that industrial diversity attains a lower frictional unemployment rate. Simon’s empirical analysis of 91 large U.S. SMSAs strongly supports the hypothesis. More recently, Izraeli and Murphy (2003), by using a data set of 17 states spanning a 38 year period, examine the effects of industrial diversification on state unemployment and show that well diversified states experience lower unemployment. Although Simon’s work makes important contributions to the study of the relationship between frictional unemployment rate and industrial diversity, it fails to clarify structural factors affecting unemployment rate. Izraeli and Murphy’s study is important in that it analyzes effects by using careful statistical methods, but because the authors use state rather than SMSAs samples, structural effects on unemployment, such as immobility between metropolitan areas, are not fully considered. In the present study, by analyzing 118 metropolitan areas in Japan for the year 1995, we seek to make the relationship between industrial diversity and frictional unemployment more clear. What we hope to contribute to the discussion can be stated as follows. While Simon does not clearly outline structural factors in a region, we investigate the relationship between frictional unemployment rate and industrial diversity by clarifying them. In particular, we incorporate into our analysis of unemployment the location quotient of industries, a factor that can explain three other types of unemployment rate (i.e., cyclical, seasonal, and structural unemployment) in a region. Second, as for studies of metropolitan unemployment rate, ours is the first in Japan, as there has up to now been no authoritative definition in Japan of a metropolitan area. We begin our study, therefore, by defining metropolitan areas and collecting data about them. We used a data set from Japan’s 118 metropolitan areas from the year 1995. Our analysis shows that although industrial diversity might reduce the frictional unemployment rate of a metropolitan area, its effect is not statistically significant in our model. It also shows that the location quotient for industries, considered to be related to three other types of unemployment, has a stronger impact on unemployment rate than industrial diversity. In particular, it was found that for both the manufacturing and the construction industry, location quotient has a negative relationship with the unemployment rate of a metropolitan area. We also discovered that the more highly educated a metropolitan population is in terms of the percentage of graduates of institutions of higher learning, the lower its unemployment rate will be. In the first section, we discuss the theoretical background of unemployment and industrial diversity. Then we summarize previous studies on this topic. In the third and fourth sections, we explain the empirical model and the empirical results. Last, we draw conclusions about the factors which affect unemployment rate.",25

Procedures for estimating expected job expansion date back to the early 20th Century. Before then, evaluation, especially of publicly funded or sponsored projects, was seen essentially as a political process; evaluation with implicit net benefits determined by legislative debate. The role for explicit economic analysis was limited. The pre-cursor of modern welfare economics began in the 18th Century (Bentham 1789). The essential principle involved viewed outlays by individuals as moving along a “hill of pleasure” to achieve the greatest utility, subject to their income. The aim of policy was to distribute income and or identify public projects so as to achieve “the greatest good for the greatest number”. By late 19th Century, this principle came to be less ambiguously formulated (Edgeworth 1881) when it came to be viewed as an overall allocation of resources so as to maximize aggregate satisfaction by equalizing marginal utilities of income over all individuals. Realizing that not everyone gained from government intervention, Vilfredo Pareto added the condition that the “gains to the gainers” exceed the “losses of the losers” (Pareto 1906). Finally, in A. C. Pigou (1920), Marshall (1928), and Nicholas Kaldor (1939) these changes in aggregate welfare would depend on whether or not the gainers from any initiative could, in principle, compensate the losses to the losers. These theoretical developments laid out the possibilities of constructing an actual “calculus of welfare maximization”. Dramatic floods in eastern U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries resulted in thousands of deaths and extensive property damage, leading to widespread interest in the Federal government assuming some responsibility for flood control, along with their historic interest in navigation on inland waterways. Just keeping floodplains empty was an alternative, but would have had very high opportunity costs for regional economic development, even if constitutionally permissible. This emerging public concern led to procedures for determining costs and benefits of flood control as a practical consideration in the New Deal policies of the 1930s. Benefit–cost was enacted into law in the Flood Control Act of 1936 (74th Congress, 2nd Session), and its principles were later applied to other Federal, state, and local government programs. There are a number of conceptual complications involved in the conception of benefits of a particular project. Most important is that under the Flood Control Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) was to recommend flood control projects, if and only if, “…the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated cost”. The proviso of “whomsoever” produced the issue of whether regional benefits to a local region from an isolated project might conflict with net national benefits from the same project seen in broader geographic context. An example would be where the total of individually estimated recreation users for a set of facilities could exceed the users for all facilities combined, as the building of any one project would reduce the expected use of other projects. Conflict between “regional and national benefits would be sensitive to the definition of “project area” for any individual project. The Congress provided no outlines for specification of the appropriate area for any particular project, nor any guidelines for the protocol to be used in estimating benefits for an individual project. Further conceptual complication arose as a consequence of the Appalachian Redevelopment Act of 1965 (89th Congress, 1st Session, as amended, 2000). This act specified that benefits for any project should included, “ …in addition to the benefits accruing from the project itself (primary benefits), those developmental benefits to the region affected (secondary benefits) such as would be consistent with optimum development of the Nation”. Here too, the Congress provided no guidelines as to how a “developmental benefit” was to be defined or estimated. Only at the end of the 1960s was a system for comprehensive estimation worked out by Leven, et al, in a study for the Institute of Water Resources of USCOAE (Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information 1969). Some issues with benefit–cost analysis that will not be discussed here should be noted, such as: the appropriate rate at which to discount future benefits (Bailey and Jensen 1972); the use of net benefits, (B–C) where they produce different rank ordering than B/C (Eckstein and Krutilla 1958); quantification of benefits where project services ordinarily are not sold at market prices (Summers and Wolfe 1977); allocation of costs to particular purposes in multipurpose projects (USACOE 2004). These are not considered in this paper because, while estimates of them might be in error, there is no reason to expect errors to be biased in any particular direction. Also, we will assume that the estimates of cost by developers of projects would accurately indicate the costs involved—an assumption not always valid. A variety of important issues will be taken up in later sections, but first, we specify the range within the spectrum of total economic activity over which job creation will be estimated. The standard classification of benefits distinguishes among direct and indirect primary and secondary benefits. In the case of a single purpose project like a recreation reservoir, for example, primary direct benefits would consist of the value of the services (which often would be measured by the number of jobs required to produce these services) to the users of the reservoir. Primary indirect benefits would consist of the value (or employment) required as inputs to the production of inputs to the primary services, such things as electric power, maintenance, operation of parking and safety facilities, etc. Secondary direct benefits would be the value (or jobs generated) of induced demands of recreation users for related services, like swim suits or water equipment, boats, fishing gear or other complimentary supplies sold by firms in the region, and/or meals or entertainment purchased by the primary users of the reservoir. Secondary indirect benefits would come from production (or jobs needed) as inputs needed to produce these secondary direct benefits, such as purchases by local manufacturers of fishing equipment or boats, or food and beverage purchases by eating and drinking places or food stores, etc. The sum of Primary direct and indirect and Secondary direct and indirect benefits would constitute total project benefits. A related and somewhat perplexing aspect of benefit measurement concerns the units in which benefits would be expressed, i.e., user days or, time-weighted attendance, or just the dollar value of use. This latter metric may be hard to observe directly where there are no user charges, but even then, they could and have been measured indirectly by the value of user costs incurred to use the facility, like the marginal cost of travel to the recreation location. A second related complication is that we are aiming at the impact of changes in a spatially defined area of impact. It is not the total induced changes in all sectors anywhere, but rather those induced within the same region as the project that are relevant. Total change stemming from any project would stem from an estimate of primary direct benefits multiplied by a “multiplier” that would expand the primary direct-benefits estimate to an estimate of primary and secondary, direct and indirect benefits, i.e., total benefits. Section 2 will focus on theoretic problems of specifying this “multiplier” and Section 3 will discuss methodological problems in arriving at empirical estimates of such multiplier. Section 4 will discuss problems in identifying the “multiplicand”, i.e., the primary direct effects. Section 5 will discuss briefly how the asymmetries in policy preferences and biases in estimating project cost affect regional development policy choice and possible alternative approaches to impact estimation.",1

Mulligan,Alexander C. Vias,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Nearly 30 million Americans—approximately 10% of the entire U.S. population—now live in micropolitan places. These emerging metropolitan areas typically offer residents a balance or compromise between high-density urban living and low-density rural living (Elliott and Perry 1996). Private firms increasingly target these places for business operations because they have lower wages, rents, and property taxes, and because they usually have ready access to the national interstate highway system. Micropolitan environments seem especially attractive to persons who share family values and exhibit preferences for small-town lifestyles (El Nasser 2004). Given the dramatic changes that occurred in these mini-metros during the late 20th century, the U.S. Census Bureau recently decided to recognize micropolitan areas as a category separate from, and intermediate to, metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas (Office of Management and Budget 2000). But social scientists have given very little attention to the economic, political, and social attributes of these places. As a consequence, today’s planners and policy-makers can only speculate about the probable role of this new and increasingly popular type of settlement in the U.S. space-economy. The best-known studies of micropolitan places are the two quality-of-life almanacs written by Thomas (1990) and Heubusch (1997), who suggested that these places should have urban-core populations of at least 15,000 (but not more than 50,000) and county-wide populations of at least 40,000. Based on these twin criteria, 219 of the nation’s 3,141 counties were designated as being micropolitan in nature.Footnote 1 Further generalizations about growth and change in these counties were then made in a series of papers (Glavac et al. 1998; Vias et al. 2002; Mulligan and Molin 2004). Here, among other things, the economies of micropolitan places were found to be remarkably heterogeneous and their recent growth rates were shown to be surprisingly variable. But these results must be greeted with some skepticism if only because the authors used an entirely unofficial list of qualifying counties. For more than a decade prior to 2000 the Office of Management and Budget (2000) and the Census Bureau sought to create a new classification system that would recognize the myriad of counties that are intermediate in size and complexity to the widely accepted metropolitan and non-metropolitan categories. Using the available data from the 1990 census, and apparently adopting criteria similar to those of Thomas–Heubusch, a preliminary but nevertheless “official” list of 581 micropolitan counties was eventually drawn up just prior to the 2000 census. Moreover, in numerous cases functional consolidation was thought to be appropriate—much like for the larger and more familiar metropolitan areas—and a number of extended, multi-county units were created. Eventually a total of 496 separate micropolitan areas were identified from the qualifying counties. In this paper we have excluded (for practical reasons) a few counties in Virginia as well as those found outside the lower 48 states, thereby confining our interest to 487 separate areas spread across 577 different counties. When the Thomas–Heubusch list was compared to this second list, we calculated that they chose 193 counties correctly, assigned 26 other counties incorrectly, and entirely missed 384 (or two-thirds) of the “correct” counties. Clearly analysts must be skeptical about any findings, including our very own, that have been based on the highly truncated list of counties proposed by Thomas–Heubusch. By 2000 the U.S. Census Bureau had developed and agreed upon an entirely new classification system for all 3,141 counties. (For further information on the details of this new system, see the Federal Register of 12/27/2000). This system makes extensive use of Core-Based Statistical Areas whose standards were developed by the Metropolitan Areas Standards Review. Like their larger metropolitan cousins, micropolitan areas were identified for the first time using a novel concept called urban clusters. Now each micropolitan area was required to have a central county with a minimum population density of 1,000 people per square mile and a total urban-cluster population ranging between 10,000 and 50,000. In addition, outlying micropolitan counties, some very small in population size, were added to adjacent central counties when commuting data indicated very strong economic interaction existing between those counties. Using these criteria a total of 674 micropolitan counties currently exist and, when consolidated into multi-county units, these form 565 separate metropolitan areas (U.S. Census Bureau 2003).Footnote 2
 So in fact there now exists three different micropolitan lists: the 219 counties first named by Thomas–Heubusch (which we call MICRO1); the 581 counties proposed (on a preliminary basis) by the Census Bureau to comply with the 1990 census (MICRO2); and the 674 counties officially named by the Census Bureau to comply with the new criteria of the 2000 census (MICRO3). As noted above we have already carried out extensive research on MICRO1 and now we would like to see how those findings carry over into an officially designated group of micropolitan units. However, before assembling our numerical data we had to choose between the two lists of micropolitan units that had been drawn up recently by the U.S. Census Bureau. For reasons that are made clearer in the next section of the paper, we favored using the counties from MICRO2 in looking back at the 20-year period just prior to the 2000 census. In this paper our main purpose is to examine growth and change in America’s micropolitan places over the last two decades of the 20th century. In adopting MICRO2 for our analysis, we certainly broaden the domain of our study well beyond the group of micropolitan counties that were first proposed by Thomas–Heubusch. Furthermore, making use of the new designations, we can for the first time examine attributes of both the individual counties and the consolidated, multi-county areas. In the next section of the paper we provide some descriptive statistics to better inform the reader about important differences in the three data sets mentioned above. Then, in the section that follows, MICRO2 is used to assess the very broad macro-geographic shifts that occurred in the relative sizes of U.S. micropolitan counties between 1980 and 2000. Here we show that recent micropolitan growth has essentially mirrored the widely known national trend of geographic deconcentration where, relatively speaking, both population and employment have shifted out of the Midwest and Northeast into the Southern and Western regions of the nation. The next two sections of the paper focus more squarely on the shifting economic attributes of micropolitan units. Changes in the functional status of the micropolitan economies are first identified, degrees of employment (industry and occupation) specialization are next measured, and then a regression model is used to assess possible reasons for this varying specialization. Finally, in the next-to-last section of the paper, we focus on the bi-directional, adjusted dynamics of growth and change in the micropolitan counties during these same two decades. Here we make use of a two-stage least-squares (TSLS) regression model in order to estimate the lagged interactions persisting between population and employment levels, as conditioned by a host of other geographic and economic factors that are commonly believed to affect the performances of all U.S. types of urban regions.",34

Murray,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The location of a facility, be it a fire station, retail store, transportation terminal, etc., very much dictates the success of the services to be provided. Facility siting typically represents a long-term investment due to property acquisition and construction (Owen and Daskin 1998). Therefore, to ensure the success of facilities and make the investment in them worthwhile, it is important that essential features of the situation at hand be modeled properly. The literature details a variety of location models that can be utilized to address a range of planning situations (for reviews, see ReVelle et al. 1970; Tansel et al. 1983; Owen and Daskin 1998; Farhan 2003). Most of these models are useful for desirable facility location (e.g., police and fire stations, grocery stores, etc.), but some explicitly deal with undesirable facilities (e.g., nuclear plants, recycling facilities, etc.) (for reviews, see Erkut and Neuman 1989; Murray et al. 1998). Such facilities are usually locally unwanted but are a necessary element of regional services. While numerous location models exist in the literature, basic fundamental problem features remain difficult, if not impossible, to simultaneously address using existing models when siting certain types of facilities. In this paper, we focus on three concerns: coverage range, distance decay, and partial regional service of demand. A primary concept in central place theory is range (Christaller 1966). Range, or coverage standard, is the maximum distance (or travel time) a user is willing to overcome to utilize a service facility (Hurst 1972). The coverage standard has been a crucial consideration in many planning applications, such as locating emergency services (Toregas et al. 1971), warning siren placement (Murray and O’Kelly 2002), and transit stop siting (Murray 2001). In the case of emergency services, it is not unusual to find a coverage standard for response time of 8 min or less to an accident or fire after a call for service has been placed (Murray and O’Kelly 2002). Coverage is important in siting facilities because service extent or demand for service generally has a maximum range (Hurst 1972). Given this, a coverage standard is utilized in facility location models to embody range considerations. In the case of undesirable facilities, a coverage standard can be thought of as an impact zone within which facilities would have a negative impact. As an example, toxic waste sites are observed as having a negative impact on the population within 10 miles (16.09 km) from a site, and a nuclear reactor has an impact zone extending some 22 miles (35.41 km) (Kohlhase 1991). Thus, considering coverage is important to minimize the negative impact of such facilities on local residences and businesses (e.g., loss in property value, exposure to risk, etc.). Distance decay, “the attenuation of a pattern or process with distance” (Johnston et al. 2000), is a focal concept in a variety of modeling contexts, such as transportation, migration, and location theory (Olsson 1970; Fotheringham and O’Kelly 1989). This tenet of central place theory was formalized in the work of Losch (1954), where the demand curveFootnote 1 was recognized as a feature of range (for a review, see Hurst 1972). Given this, the fact that demand for service decays with distance means that siting facilities either as close to or as far away from potential demand is an important planning objective, depending on whether we are attempting to maximize or minimize demand being served. A practical reality of many planning situations is that budget limitations mean that all potential demands cannot likely be suitably served. Partial regional service was first modeled in Church and ReVelle (1974) recognizing that limited resources typically prevent complete coverage from being provided. Thus, partial coverage of demand is a byproduct of not being able to serve an entire region by located facilities within a maximum service standard. However, one would like to cover as much potential demand as possible. That is, due to budgetary restrictions, it may not be possible to site enough facilities to provide a minimum level of service, but it is still desirable to do the best possible with available resources. Alternatively, for undesirable facility location, not all areas may be impacted. Thus, one must be able to mitigate and objectively model spatial inequities in service coverage or impact. The ability to simultaneously address distance decay, coverage range, and partial regional service issues is necessary across different planning contexts. One example is park-and-ride facility siting. Distance decay is important because the closer a park-and-ride lot is to potential ridership demand, the more likely it will be used (Spillar 1997). The maximum service coverage range is a concern because there is a travel time/distance beyond which park-and-ride users are unwilling to use the facility (Allen 1979; Stevens and Homburger 1984). Furthermore, because resources are limited and park-and-ride facilities cannot be established everywhere in a region, only partial service to potential ridership is typically possible. Unfortunately, existing location models do not simultaneously address these issues. Another context in which these three issues may arise is locating recycling centers. Such facilities have been gaining importance in the United States as they reduce the need for landfill sites, save energy, and help decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, among other benefits (Moon 1994; EPA 2003). However, recycling facilities typically have negative impacts (e.g., pollution, odor, noise, etc.) on those who reside near such centers (Flahaut et al. 2002; Columbus Dispatch 2002). Thus, distance decay, coverage range, and partial regional service are of particular importance here because the farther an undesirable facility is from residences and/or businesses, the less likely it will have a negative impact. However, there are costs associated with getting to these facilities, so they should not be too far away from points of waste generation (residences and businesses). Given the need to deal with distance decay, coverage range, and partial regional service in a single modeling framework, this paper develops a general approach that can be used for siting both desirable and undesirable facilities. The next section reviews previous work in this area. We then present developed spatial optimization models that can be used to address distance decay and coverage issues. Next, application results are presented. Finally, conclusions are provided.",42

The consequences for estimation and inference of the presence of stable spatial processes were widely studied (Haining 1990; Anselin 1988; Bivand 1980; Richardson 1990; Richardson and Hémon 1981; Clifford and Richardson 1985; Clifford et al. 1989). A recent study (Fingleton 1999) takes the first steps into analyses of implications of spatial unit roots, spatial cointegration, and Spatial Error Correction (SEC) models. The present paper contributes to the further development of these topics in Section 2 by introducing a general Spatial Autoregressively Distributed Lag (SADL) model and different variants of this—a SEC model, a Spatial Baardsen (SBA) model, and a Spatial Bewley (SBE) model. As none of these models can be consistently estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), a consistent Instrument Variable (IV) estimation procedure is investigated in Section 3. The finite sample performance of this estimator is evaluated in Section 4 using Monte Carlo simulations while addressing the impacts of sample size and controlling for varying proximity structure. Finally, the concepts are illustrated using an out-commuting model presented in recent research.",8

In NEG models, agglomeration of economic activities and population is based on increasing returns to scale and transport costs. Various models investigate the interaction of centrifugal and centripetal forces which shape the economic landscape. In a recent review, Neary (2001) states that ‘New economic geography has come of age’. Indeed, Ottaviano (2003) concludes that NEG has reached a theoretical consolidation. Both authors emphasize two directions for future research: policy and empirics. As Head and Mayer (2004) note in a survey, empirical research on NEG is lagging behind. Moreover, results of existing studies are difficult to compare, since different types of methodology are in use. The aim of the present paper is to add to the empirical evidence on NEG. The analysis focuses on one of the main propositions of NEG that access advantages raise factor prices. We investigate whether there exists a spatial wage structure in the European Union, i.e. whether there is a positive correlation between regional wage level and access to purchasing power. The study departs from the nominal wage equation derived from the Krugman ‘core–periphery model’. However, following the advice by Leamer and Levinsohn (1995), we ‘estimate and don’t test’. What this means is, that instead of testing a specific NEG model against alternative explanations of agglomeration, a specific model as well as the so-called market potential concept by Harris (1954), consistent with different NEG models, is applied. By investigating the validity of forces emphasized by NEG in a more general manner, we are able to compare our findings with results of related studies. In this context, we pay special attention to the geographic extent of demand linkages identified in different analyses. There is a long tradition of studies dealing with the significance of market access for regional disparities in Europe. Early studies by Clark et al. (1969) and Keeble et al. (1982) investigate the impact of European integration on the spatial structure of economic activity in the EU, based on market access considerations. However, the relevance of market access for regional development remains vague in these analyses, since a firm theoretical fundament is missing. NEG can supply this theoretical base, because it establishes the missing economic link between market access and regional development. Current analyses use this theoretical framework in order to investigate mechanisms of regional development. Previous studies have tended to focus on evidence for single countries: Tests of spatial wage structures have been realized for US and German regions by Hanson (2000), Roos (2001) and Brakman et al. (2004) and for Italy by Mion (2004). In contrast, this paper aims at analysing the spatial wage structure for a cross section of European regions. The regression analysis covers the period between 1985 and 2000. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 comprises a brief description of the model that constitutes the theoretical framework of the empirical analysis. In Section 3, the regression models are derived and the empirical implementation is illustrated. In Section 4, previous empirical evidence on the market potential is summarized. Data and regional system are described in Section 5. The results of the regression analysis are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.",39

As continuous environmental pollution threatens human existence, studies on sustainable development have progressed rapidly. So then, what kind of cities can decrease the damage to our environment and can human beings lead a sustainable life? There are many arguments to these points. The concept of “sustainable development or Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development (ESSD)’ is open to a variety of interpretations itself and its applications connected with urban planning give rise to even more confusion. There were also many discussions about what is a sustainable development for Korea. Although ways to apply ESSD to the urban phenomena have appeared recently in Korea, they are inadequate. Besides the “Compact City” or “Decentralized Concentration” is frequently insisted on from an intuitive basis for sustainable development, especially with regard to urban form, but with insufficient attention to the suitability for Korea. The existing foreign discussions about sustainable urban form are reflections upon the cities of low-density or sprawl and the situations are different in Korea. In some Western cities, they argue that they could improve public transportation services, decrease traffic congestion, reduce transportation energy, and made a pedestrian-friendly environment through policies of higher density development and the encouragement of mixed-use. However, many Korean cities have already passed the optimal density suggested by some Western researchers and do not have rigid zoning regulations—our regulations which permit the broad mixed land use; thus it is difficult to introduce these policies into Korea directly. If Korean cities implement the policy of a Compact City based on Western densities, inefficiencies due to congestion could occur. There are few studies on the relationship between city size, density, and transportation energy consumption, which focus on Korean cities. Under these circumstances, which one should we choose, policy to encourage high density development in existing built-up areas (mononuclear Compact City policy) or a policy to make multinuclei with high density developments (Decentralized Concentration)? This paper presents a vision for Korean cities through an analysis of the relationships between the characteristics of transportation energy and urban form with regard to sustainable development. This paper consists of two parts: the theoretical considerations and practical analysis of small- and medium-sized cities in Korea. Firstly, we examined the theories of urban form intended to decrease transportation energy consumption, reduce environmental impact, and improve other social functions. Nowadays Compact City and Decentralized Concentration theories are based on these relationships and either alternative could be chosen as the sustainable urban form. We will examine the existing theories on transportation energy consumption patterns, which are based on a city’s size, density, and the center distribution patterns. Next, in the analysis of the small- and medium-sized cities in Korea, we will verify which of the theories above are more applicable to Korean cities and determine how these differ from foreign cities. The target cities of this study are 61 small- and medium-sized cities in Korea (out of 71 total number of cities in 2002) based on 1999 data. The goal is to determine the urban planning implications with the purpose of achieving energy-saving cities based on an analysis of Korean cities.",34

The purposes of this paper are then to empirically examine the location determinants of Japanese greenfield FDI among Chinese provinces and to shed light on the location choices of foreign investors in China. Understanding these determinants and choices cannot only enrich the previous studies on the intracountry spatial distributions of FDI but also provide economic rationales for public policies that intend to influence the location choices of foreign investors in general and Japanese investors in particular. These policy implications are critical because China’s governments are trying to attract FDI into China’s western interior areas and to promote their economic growth in light of the success of FDI preferential policies and FDI-led growth in China’s coastal region.",76

This paper focuses on the “spatial mismatch hypothesis,” which states that the dispersal process of jobs from the center to suburbs creates a distorted equilibrium with high levels of employment and income in the suburbs, and unemployment and low income in the center. This hypothesis attributes this result mainly to the existence of a “housing segregation” effect preventing the poor (black) population from migrating to richer areas. This implies the existence of a deadlock situation, where an external obstacle (segregation) impedes the action of the free market process that could lead to a clean equilibrium with equal levels of employment and income in both regions. The consequence is a need for government intervention with compensatory measures such as social assistance and transfer payments (Coulson et al. 2001). The author wants to show here that a situation of inequality between regions in levels of income and employment does not necessarily indicate the existence of an impediment in the action of the free market and that this impediment may actually be explained by regular forces of economic behavior. This paper uses the framework of a general equilibrium model, which would identify and explain the mechanism of interregional labor markets. In this model, interregional inequalities (in terms of center–suburbs, or center–periphery) may be a stable equilibrium that results from a few main factors, which will be described in more detail in this paper. One such factor is the assumption that agglomeration economies are not a linear function of agglomeration. A second one is combined effect of land prices and labor supply on commuting and migration. In this case, the required policy of the government to diminish such interregional inequalities would be less in terms of a social assistance policy, and more in terms of a policy of economic intervention (such as land allocation, investments in transportation infrastructure, etc.).",2

McQuaid,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper considers the relationship between an unemployed person’s employability and job search success. The concept of employability has become a major component of labor market policy in many countries (e.g., OECD 1998; CEC (Commission of the European Communities) 1999; Gazier 2001) and sometimes identifies a more subtle range of demand and supply factors than were generally modeled in some theoretical literature. Employability is concerned with factors changing a person’s probability of getting a new or improved job and so intrinsically incorporates job matching (see McQuaid and Lindsay 2005). Job search theory considers the probability of a “match” between a job seeker and a job vacancy at a particular point of time as the product of the probability of getting an offer and the probability of accepting that offer (see, for example, Mortensen 1987). These probabilities in turn will depend on a number of factors related to both the potential job seeker and the employer, such as the length of unemployment, the intensity and effectiveness of their job search, unemployment benefits, and wages being offered and local economic circumstances. The different “mismatches” between employers  and the perceived employability of a job seeker can lead to jobs not being adequately filled and the job seeker remaining unemployed. “Structural” or “skills mismatch” can arise where job seekers are not seen by employers as having the necessary skills (Manacorda and Petrongolo 1999) or where job seekers fail to move to other geographic or occupational labor markets where their skills may be sought. “Frictional mismatch” within a local labor market can result from different employer and job seeker expectations combined with an asymmetry of information between them (Adams et al. 2000). The “spatial mismatch” hypothesis argues that groups of people who reside in certain areas due, for example, to racial discrimination or inflexible housing tenure, have a limited number and range of job opportunities and hence a lower likelihood of getting a job match (Holzer 1991; Brueckner and Martin 1997). The contrasting views on skills and spatial mismatch are considered below. Some perspectives on employability focus “narrowly” upon labor supply-side factors such as an individual’s skills or job readiness (focusing not only on skills mismatch but also job seeker attitudes to work). However, under some circumstances (e.g., in a tight labor market), an employer may employ someone whom they would not accept if there were more job applicants (e.g., in a looser labor market) and also some job seekers with the necessary skills may not accept a job due to factors such the location of the job. Many writers on employability stress the need to consider both demand and supply sides and if employability is considered to be a person’s ability to get (or change) employment, i.e., to make a successful job match, then such a broader perspective of employability is useful (McQuaid and Lindsay 2005; De Grip et al. 2004). Hence, this may also include possible frictional mismatch. Such a “broad” employability model seeks to integrate both demand- and supply-side factors that determine the probability of a successful “job match,” by considering job seekers’ individual factors (including human capital), personal circumstances, and external factors. This can bring together literature on employability and hazard functions, where the probability of a job seeker getting a job is conditional upon both labor supply and demand factors, i.e., the range of broad employability factors. For instance, Arulampalam and Stewart (1995) found that high welfare benefits may reduce the outflow from unemployment, while being married, a car owner, prime aged male, and skilled increase the probability of leaving unemployment. In this paper, we know the actual outcome of the job search. This paper seeks to utilize a job search success model, building upon an employability framework to analyze factors that influence the success of unemployed job seekers in finding a job. It uses data from a survey of 169 unemployed job seekers. Section 2 considers the implications of employability for two contrasting views of the operation of metropolitan labor markets. Section 3 presents a framework of employability. Section 4 sets out the sample and model. Section 5 provides detailed hypotheses and the results, followed by the conclusions in Section 6.",39

Involuntary unemployment and widespread underemployment characterize most metropolitan areas. Under such circumstances, job creation impacts local workers by opening opportunities for them to exercise skills they already possess. As workers move up, vacancies are opened for others. Newly created jobs generate a vacuum effect down the chain. Welfare gains originate as previously underemployed or not employed workers fill vacancies along the chain. The demand generated by new local job creation depends on the nature of the resulting job chain and, hence, the character of local supply. As the job chains approach makes explicit, demand is met by a number of sources of supply—existing jobholders, the local unemployed and out of the labor force, and in-migrants. Because public policy has played a role in generating local labor demand, a logical question emerges as to the wisdom of attempting to influence or restrict which workers benefit from the public program, i.e., to alter supply conditions for these new jobs. Presumably, such restrictive efforts would be directed at promoting the chances of local residents vis-a-vis in-migrants (Bartik 2001). In a less obvious fashion, local development agencies might anticipate gains to the locally unemployed as larger than gains to the (under)employed who move up. Consistent evaluation of such propositions concerning supply restrictions requires the use of the same job chain framework used in the case of unrestricted supply. This paper presents a first effort to extend the job chains approach to such supply restrictions. Because the mechanics of our job chains model build around a Leontief-type matrix, it is not surprising that much of the discussion to follow is reminiscent of input–output approaches to import substitution.Footnote 2 Like that literature, the present effort assumes that all supply sources (in our case labor supplies) are equivalent in terms of price and quality. Elsewhere we have defended this assumption at some length (Persky et al. 2004, Chap. 2). Key to that defense are the widely acknowledged wage rigidities in developed countries (see, for example, Bewley 1999) and the persistent underemployment of skilled and semiskilled workers in those same countries (see, for example, Feldman 1996). Taken together, these substantial labor market imperfections suggest that commonly advocated efforts to restrict labor supply at the local level will result in no significant changes in the price or quality of available labor. In the next section, we review the job chains model. Building on this approach, we go on to perform a series of hypothetical policy experiments, in which we restrict labor market access in a number of ways. While hardly definitive, these experiments suggest that feasible supply restrictions generate only modest changes in the magnitude and distribution of program benefits.",8

Love,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In November 2003, as part of its efforts to develop innovation indicators for the EU, Eurostat published an ‘experimental’ dataset on regional innovation levels in the EU derived from the Second Community Innovation Survey. This dataset, part of the European Innovation Scoreboard, also contains a range of regional labour market indicators. In this paper, we report an exploratory analysis of this new dataset using a relatively simple modelling approach. Specifically, we explore the determinants of regional innovation, focussing on the impact of the labour market on regions’ capacity to absorb external knowledge. The notion of absorptive capacity has been widely used in the economics and strategic management literature to capture ‘the ability of an enterprise to value, assimilate and apply new knowledge’ (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990). Other recent studies have emphasised the multidimensional nature of absorptive capacity (ACAP) and its potential value in integrating literatures on organisational learning and resource and capability-based perspectives (Zahra and George 2002). The concept of ACAP has been found to have particular value in studies of the relationship between knowledge acquisition and different dimensions of organisational performance.Footnote 1
 A natural extension of enterprise-level ACAP is to consider absorptive capacity at national or regional level, a theme most strongly associated with the literature on international technology transfer (e.g., Keller 1996).Footnote 2 As Narula (2004) emphasises, however, national or regional ACAP (RACAP) is influenced by more than the ACAP of individual enterprises, reflecting also the capability of other knowledge creating or mediating organisations in the region, and the extent of association between organisations (e.g., Cooke and Morgan 1998). We focus here on testing how the labour market characteristics of European regions shape RACAP, and regions’ ability to assimilate knowledge from public and externally conducted R&D. We also aim to distinguish empirically between two alternative views of the relationship between ACAP and regions’ level of development. In particular, we aim to establish whether labour market aspects of RACAP are more important for innovation in prosperous or lagging regions. It may be, for example, that because of structural disadvantages associated with sectoral mix, or a predominance of small firms, less favoured regions (LFRs) find it more difficult to appropriate spillovers from R&D because of their limited RACAP (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose 2001). Or, because they are further behind the international technology frontier, it may actually be easier for LFRs to absorb new technologies than more prosperous regions whose level of technological development is already nearer to the technological frontier (e.g., Verspagen 1991; Narula 2004).",51

Its establishment brings about concomitant costs and benefits, which have been extensively analysed by the theory of Optimum Currency Areas (OCA) (see e.g. Tavlas 1993, 1994; Mélitz 1996; Pelagidis 1996; Bayoumi and Eichengreen 1996; Lafrance and St-Amant 1999). Concerning the benefits, the OCA theory identifies a number of advantages which are obtained from a single currency: elimination of transactions costs from currency conversion and hedging, transparency of prices and a higher credibility of economic policies. The OCA approach has concentrated, however, on the cost side of the cost–benefit analysis. According to this theory, the main cost of joining a monetary union is the abandonment of exchange rate and monetary policies as adjustment instruments in response to shocks. However, this cost depends on two conditions: a) the probability of suffering asymmetric shocks and; b) the existence of other adjustment mechanisms. The OCA theory has showed that the loss of exchange rate and monetary policies through the introduction of a single currency narrows the scope of governments to address adverse asymmetric shocks (see e.g. Bayoumi and Eichengreen 1993; Carporale 1993). Thus, in a monetary union the focus shifts towards another adjustment instrument as alternative to these policies: real wage flexibility. As Fleming (1971) indicates “If prices and wages were both entirely flexible, the need for relative exchange rate adjustments within the union would not arise”. Therefore, wage flexibility should increase in countries and regions that made up EMU in order to minimize their potential costs. Wage flexibility can substitute for the exchange rate in order to offset an adverse asymmetric shock through lower labour cost. This adjustment instrument contributes to the relative price decrease required to restore the competitive position of the economy; moreover, it brings output and employment back to equilibrium. Some authors have dealt with wage flexibility in Europe using econometric techniques (see e.g. Abraham and Van Rompuy 1995; Abraham et al. 2000). Furthermore, several researchers have analysed this variable in Spain (see e.g. Jimeno and Bentolila 1998; Bajo et al. 1999). The former evidence points to a limited wage flexibility in both cases. Previous studies estimate, as a test for wage flexibility, a wage equation supposing a parametric relationship among real wages and the explanatory variables (parametric approach). Nevertheless, more recent econometric theory challenges this view. The new approach—nonparametric and semiparametric methods (see e.g. Hardle and Linton 1994; Hardle et al. 1999)—allows more flexibility in the functional relationship among variables. The main objective of this paper is to analyse wage flexibility in the Spanish regions by means of nonparametric and semiparametric techniques. Additionally, the possible EMU effects on wage flexibility are investigated. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the data set employed. Section 3 shows a nonparametric approach about the flexibility of wages at regional level in Spain. Section 4 extends the approach of Section 3 to regression analysis using semiparametric techniques. Section 5 analyses whether EMU will increase real wage flexibility. Finally, the main conclusions are presented in Section 6.",19

On the one hand, there are serious shortages of certain kinds of economic resources. On the other hand, there are several objectives that need to be met for the welfare of the region. Problems arise because of the limited resources available to achieve the desired objectives. For example, these regions have shortages of economic resources such as capital stock, energy, water and land and this hampers the pursuit of objectives such as increasing economic growth, job creation for different categories of labour, and overcoming high income distribution inequalities. Thus, limited economic resources, and the attainment of multiple, and sometimes conflicting objectives must be considered as important parameters in the economic planning process. To this end, the best results can be achieved if a procedure is used that allows planners to achieve their range of objectives with limited resources. A number of procedures have been developed for the purposes of regional economic planning. These different procedures have their own distinctive characteristics. Hence, by themselves or in combination, these procedures can be tailored to a particular application. For example, several SAM models have been used for impact analysis or planning purposes in terms of income distribution, employment, etc. in developing countries such as Brazil, Cyprus, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey and South Africa (Pyatt and Round 1985; Cohen 1989; Thissen and Lofgren 1998 and Khan 1999). A considerable number of econometric models have been presented by authors such as Loh (1993), Arnade and Vasavada (1995), and Jarmin (1999). In addition, a few LP models have been applied to problems of regional economic development planning (Williams 1981). Although all of the above models have their own distinctive characteristics, it seems that they are not particularly successful in solving the problems faced in a particular region or country. For instance, a social accounting model allows a planner to study in detail the impact of any decision-making on other indices. In an economic and social planning process, several conflicting objectives may have to be considered but there are no specific criteria for a trade-off between them. Moreover, using a SAM model analysis rarely leads to a unique optimum solution. And although an econometric model is more stable compared with others, it has some drawbacks such as yielding non-optimum solutions, ignoring the limitations faced by the region, and generally being too integrated to provide a specific solution. Finally, an LP model leads to an optimum level for its objective function, but needs predetermined coefficients without which its application would inevitably at a regional or national level be limited. Moreover, there is a substantial literature in terms of applications of the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and its linkage with SAM to urban and regional analysis (e.g., Seventer and Gibson 2000, and Zhai and Wang 2002). Furthermore, there is some evidence of cases where a regional or national I–O model has been used in conjunction with an LP model, such as Rose et al. (1997), Ochitwa (1984) and Bennett et al. (1999). In general, these linkages are aimed at achieving better results concerning regional or national requirements in the real world. Although CGE, particularly when linked with SAM models, has its own individual strengths such as relative stability and capability for detailed analysis, it is still incapable of incorporating some regional requirements such as limitations on the level of resources and the need to find optimum solutions. In addition, the linkage of I–O with LP has some advantages, particular its capability in providing optimum solutions by considering resources limitations and conflicting objectives in detail. However, there some regional requirements, such as income distribution considerations and differences in the education level of the labour force, to which I–O is incapable of responding. Thus, it appears that the integrated SAM with LP would have a distinct advantage compared with other modelling approaches. However, the authors could not find any evidence of previous instances where a SAM had been linked to LP, so bringing greater capability to the integrated model. This paper represents a modest first step in the direction of integrating a SAM with a LP model as a procedure for impact analysis and planning in a region. The results of the model should help the regional authorities in two main ways. First, it should be useful for managing the supply side of the regional economy, e.g., in issuing licenses for new institutions or awarding loan facilities and so on. Secondly, it can affect the demand side directly, through government expenditure, or, indirectly, through motivating factors that affect regional exports. Therefore, it is possible to direct the economy towards an optimum and desired equilibrium situation. The paper consists of five sections. The next section is devoted to the social accounting model in broad terms. The third section first introduces the equation system of the SAM before proceeding to present the linear programming method that has been adopted. In the fourth section an empirical version of the model is considered for Golestan Province in Iran and is used to demonstrate the model’s policy analysis features. In the final section conclusions are drawn.",5

This legislation strengthened the fiscal decentralization process introducing important changes in the distribution of resources and responsibilities among the different levels of government. At the end of the 1990s, this scheme of transfers was caught in the middle of a deep fiscal crisis and associated slowdown in the growth of the Colombian economy. Notwithstanding the fiscal decentralization process, Colombian regional income disparities increased during the same period. The departmental sigma convergence in the real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 0.34 in 1980 to 0.48 in 2000. This increase was especially significant during the 1990s. At the beginning of this decade, the deviation of the logarithm of the real per capita GDP was 0.37, reaching 0.5 in 1997.Footnote 1
 The latest studies about fiscal decentralization in Colombia focused on its macroeconomic implications, especially on its impact on the increasing public deficit.Footnote 2 There is little analysis about the influence of fiscal decentralization on regional income inequalities, one exception being the work of Baron and Meisel (2003). Although these authors argue that the decentralization process increased regional income disparities in Colombia during the 1990s, they do not formally test the relationship between these two variables. Since Colombia experienced profound structural reforms during the last decade, it is difficult to determine to what extent the fiscal decentralization process is responsible for the increase in regional income disparities.Footnote 3 Hence, the purpose of this paper is to clarify the link between fiscal decentralization and regional income imbalances in Colombia. Using panel data estimation, we test the relationship between these two variables controlling for the effect of other possible explanatory variables such as trade liberalization and production agglomeration. This study contributes some new advances in the empirical analysis of fiscal decentralization. First, we introduce a panel data approach that offers greater flexibility in accommodating the dynamics of adjustment involved in this policy. Secondly, we explore the spatial pattern in our panel data set using two spatial tests that have not been used in previous work. Thirdly, the fact that we use a single country experience rather than a cross-country analysis allows us to estimate the effects of fiscal decentralization more objectively than in the previous research, which ignored cultural, historical, and institutional variation. Finally, the linkage established in this paper is robust to the variables used to measure decentralization. We show that the Colombian fiscal decentralization process increased regional income disparities during the last decade. The allocation of a major portion of the new local resources to current spending (e.g., wages and salaries), instead of capital or infrastructure investments, seems to explain this result. In addition, we identify that the redistributive component in the national transfers was seriously limited during this period. Finally, the decentralization policy has been implemented without adequate incentives from the national to the subnational levels to promote efficient use. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review about the theoretical link between fiscal decentralization and regional income disparities, as well as the empirical research in this area. Section 3 includes an overview of the 1990s Colombian fiscal decentralization policy. Section 4 presents the econometric model and Section 5 contains the analysis of the estimation’s results. Finally, Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.",38

Hoen,Jan Oosterhaven,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In both trade theory and location theory comparative advantage is defined in simplified theoretical terms within their own contexts. Thus, depending on the model used different answers will be provided for such questions as “which regions and countries have what types of comparative advantages” (Ten Raa and Mohnen 2001), while correspondingly different answers will be given to the question of the most desirable policy response. In trade theory this is most evident since comparative advantage there is mostly defined as the difference in relative prices in a non-existent, autarkic world. Balassa (1965, p. 116) summarized the problem as follows: “Comparative advantages appear to be the outcome of a number of factors, some measurable, others not, some easily pinned down, others less so. One wonders, therefore, whether more could not be gained if, instead of enunciating general principles and trying to apply these to explain actual trade flows, one took the observed pattern of trade as a point of departure.” He therefore proposed to measure the ‘revealed’ comparative advantage of certain countries for certain exporting commodities by means of what has become known as the Balassa Index or the index of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA). In spatial economics, exactly the same mathematical measure, there known as the Location Quotient (LQ), is used to measure the ‘revealed’ locational advantages of certain regions to attract and develop certain industries (Isard et al. 1960). The two concepts are closely related, not only mathematically, but also from an economic point of view. A regional or national specialization in the production of certain goods measured by the LQ will inevitably lead to export specialization, measured by the RCA, and vice versa.Footnote 1
 In international trade research the measurement of revealed comparative advantage has led to considerable debate, concentrating on the issue of “which index has the best theoretical properties” (see Vollrath 1991, for an overview). Kunimoto (1977) provided a cornerstone to that debate by proposing only the use of indices that could be interpreted as measures of ‘actual-to-expected’ trade, where ‘expected’ needs to be defined in the absence of the type of comparative advantage being studied. Citing difficulties in interpreting and comparing RCAs from different studies, Hinloopen and Van Marrewijk (2001) attempt to derive its distribution and properties empirically. They barely succeed, because among other things, “the distribution of the RCA differs considerably over countries” (op. cit. p. 3). Knowing the formal statistical distribution of the RCA would be helpful for interpreting and comparing RCA outcomes. Therefore, the search for its distribution should not be abandoned easily. Our research, however, leads to the conclusion that deriving the distribution of the RCA—and mutatis mutandis that of the LQ—is an impossible task. The main problem concerns the sensitivity of the distribution of the RCA and the LQ with regard to changes that should have none or only little effect on its distribution. For example, the distribution is shown to depend on the number and size of the industries and countries used in the analysis, while the mean of the RCA is unstable and cannot be given an economic interpretation, thus making it futile to try to derive the statistical distribution of the RCA. To obtain an index with more attractive theoretical and numerical properties, we propose an alternative, additive RCA, with a stable mean, which is better suited for further use, since it appears to have a more stable distribution than that of the standard, multiplicative index. In Section 2 we will discuss the properties of the traditional, multiplicative RCA and LQ, and in Section 3 we present the alternative, additive RCA and LQ, and a regional export specialization coefficient, the aggregate RCA, which is derived from it and may serve as an alternative measure of intra-industry trade. In our conclusion we suggest the use of the related spatial concentration coefficient when inter-sectoral comparisons of export or production specialization are at issue. Throughout the article we refer to the standard multiplicative RCA as the MRCA, and we use ARCA to indicate our additive alternative.",102

The EU will actually have to face a substantial widening of economic disparities as well as a modification of the relative spatial distribution of wealth. This geo-economic challenge can be illustrated with the following figures. First, as highlighted in the European Commission (2004) and the European Commission (2003), the enlargement will induce an increase of about 30% of the total European area and an increase of more than 25% of the population, whereas at the same time, GDP will increase by only 5% in purchasing power standards (PPS). Second, a new group of States will emerge in the enlarged Union: those with income of less than 40% of the EU average. The center of gravity of cohesion policy will also shift to Eastern Europe. Finally, regional inequalities will substantially increase as the ratio between the richest and the poorest region was about one is to five for EU15 in 2000, while it will be of one is to nine in EU25 and one is to 13 in EU27. Moreover, the enlargement process will seriously complicate the implementation of the future European regional policy in 2004 and then in 2007. It will be necessary not only to contribute to the development of the regions most in need in the new Member States but also to continue providing assistance for the enduring difficulties in the presently lagging behind regions in EU15. Several propositions have been made to the European Commission to give an answer to these new problems. However, it may seem surprising that the spatial dimension of the distribution of regional disparities in the enlarged EU has been neglected. Trade between regions or countries, technology and knowledge diffusion, and more generally local externalities and spillovers involve spatially dependent regions or countries. Conley and Ligon (2002) develop an empirical approach that explicitly allows for interdependence among countries, and they underline the importance of cross-country spillovers in explaining growth using an international data set. In addition, Ertur and Koch (2005) develop a theoretical framework which includes technological interdependence in a spatially augmented Solow model. Spatial dependence or autocorrelation can be defined as the coincidence of value similarity with locational similarity (Anselin 2001). Therefore, there is positive spatial autocorrelation when high or low values of a random variable tend to cluster in space, and there is negative spatial autocorrelation when geographical areas tend to be surrounded by neighbors with very dissimilar values. Another spatial effect that is of interest in this framework is spatial heterogeneity, which means that economic variables are not stable across space and that polarization or stratification patterns may be relevant under the form of spatial regimes: a cluster of poor regions contrasting with a cluster of rich regions. Spatial interactions between regions can be evaluated using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), which is a set of techniques aimed at describing and visualizing spatial distributions, at identifying atypical localizations or spatial outliers, at detecting patterns of spatial association, clusters or hot spots, and at suggesting spatial regimes or other forms of spatial heterogeneity (Haining 1990; Bailey and Gatrell 1995; Anselin 1998a,b). These methods provide measures of global and local spatial autocorrelation. Rey and Montouri (1999) apply these spatial tools to US State data on per capita income throughout the period 1929–1994, and Ying Long (2000) analyzes growth rates of production in the Chinese provinces since the late seventies using ESDA. They all find strong evidence in favor of spatial autocorrelation. Armstrong (1995), López-Bazo et al. (1999, 2004) and Le Gallo and Ertur (2003) also apply these spatial tools to European regional data on per capita GDP and growth rates and reach analogous conclusions. However, their concern is not the European enlargement process, hence, the samples used are limited at best to the 12 first acceding countries and the different time periods studied end at best in 1996. Hence, they do not take into account new Central and Eastern European member States and candidate countries. In this paper, using an extended EU27 sample of 258 European regions including regions from acceding and candidate European countries over the period 1995–2000, we find strong evidence in favor of both global and local spatial autocorrelation for per regional capita GDP in the enlarged EU. Furthermore, we also show that accession of Central and Eastern European countries disturbs the previous North–South polarization pattern of the EU. The geographical dynamics of EU15 was indeed dominated by an increasing clustering of population and wealth in a central area delimited by North Yorkshire (UK), Franche-Comté (France), and Hamburg (Germany), known as the core. In the enlargement context, this previous North/South polarization pattern is replaced by a new North–West/East pattern in EU27. Therefore, in our opinion, the geographic localization and spatial environment of each region have indeed to be taken into account when analyzing economic disparities at a regional scale and also for the implementation of efficient regional policies. In the next Section, the economic and social cohesion policies implemented by the European Commission are presented, and some new orientations made in the context of the enlargement process are discussed. In Section 3, data and the spatial weight matrix used in the ESDA are briefly presented. The results for global and local spatial autocorrelation for the distribution of the levels of regional log per capita GDP are presented and compared in Section 4 for the 1995–2000 period using two samples: 203 regions for EU15 and 258 regions for EU27. Results for average growth rates for the same samples are then presented in Section 5. Some implications for regional development and cohesion policies are finally suggested in the conclusion.",74

Within this literature lies, in many cases, the implicit assumption that a diverse regional economy will enjoy a stable employment growth rate, with the diversity acting to shield the regional economy from fluctuations in the market for its products. Support for this hypothesis is mixed, with several studies including Kort (1981), Brewer and Moomaw (1985) and Malizia and Ke (1993) finding that increased industrial diversification is associated with reduced regional instability. Other researchers such as Jackson (1984) have found only limited support for this relationship, while Attaran (1986) concluded that instability is not related to regional industrial diversity. Wagner and Deller (1998) consider that the principal causes of the empirical inconsistency include the use of highly aggregated data sets, theoretically poor measures of diversity and overly simplistic statistical methods. Malizia and Ke (1993) note that previous research has used data from different units of geography ranging from metropolitan areas, states and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic areas and suggest that only functional economic units should be used in the analysis. Furthermore, there has been considerable debate about the most appropriate measure of regional diversification, with a plethora of measures being suggested. These have ranged from measures that assume diversity implies equal shares of activity in all sectors of the economy, the portfolio measure of diversification to measures based on input–output systems as proposed by Siegel et al. (1995) and Wagner and Deller (1998). Another limitation of much of the empirical work has been that it has relied on the use of inappropriate statistical techniques, with much of the early empirical work being confined to the use of bivariate techniques. Malizia and Ke (1993) note that such an approach will provide biased estimates of the effect of diversity on regional instability; for this reason, appropriate control variables need to be incorporated in the analysis. In addition, the statistical techniques that are used must be appropriate for the data sets being studied, and developments in the field of spatial data analysis suggest that techniques that take account of spatial dependence in the residual of estimated equations must be used. These techniques can also be used to explore the role of geographic location on regional performance. Studies that have used multivariate techniques to study the cross-regional variation in employment instability include Smith and Gibson (1988), Wundt (1992), Malizia and Ke (1993) and, more recently, Izreali and Murphy (2003). Smith and Gibson (1988), using the log share measure of diversity, concluded that stable industries are more important for regional instability than is industrial diversification. Wundt (1992) was concerned with the relationship between industrial diversity and regional economic instability over the business cycle and concluded that diversification acted to reduce regional instability, with the portfolio measure providing more accurate results. Malizia and Ke (1993) incorporated a similar methodology to Smith and Gibson (1988) and, using the entropy measure of diversity, concluded that more diversity leads to lower unemployment rates and less employment instability. Izreali and Murphy (2003) were concerned with the effect of industrial diversity on state unemployment and income and conducted a study of US states using a pooled rather than a cross-sectional database. Using the Herfindahl index of industrial diversification, Izreali and Murphy (2003) found a strong link between industrial diversification and reduced unemployment, while the link between diversification and per capita income was found to be much weaker. These authors also considered the role of spatial spillovers in their analysis but appear more concerned with problems associated with spatially autocorrelated disturbances than with the role of spatial interaction in their model. This current work can be seen as an attempt to clarify the underlying causes of regional instability, particularly the role of industrial diversification. In the light of the limitations of much of the previous research in this area, this paper can be seen as extending the literature in three directions. Firstly, this study applies a cross-sectional regression approach to a new data set, the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Queensland, which comprise sparsely settled rural regions and densely settled urban areas. Thus the results from this analysis will be applicable to a wider range of regions than those from studies based on metropolitan areas only. Secondly, these regions more closely correspond to functional economic units than larger geographic units such as state economies which have been used in much of the previous analysis. Finally, the study applies spatial econometric techniques; these techniques seem more appropriate when using geographically related data and allow the exploration of the role of regional spillover effects in determining regional instability. The following section develops the empirical model which is used to explore the diversity–instability relationship, while Sect. 3 provides an outline of the spatial data techniques used in this study. Section 4 presents the results derived from the estimation of our model of regional instability, with a brief conclusion provided in Sect. 5.",31

Henry,Mohamed Hilal,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A critical issue facing regions with rapidly growing urban centers is how to anticipate the impacts of growth of the urban complex on proximate rural areas. Recent empirical evidence suggests that urban to rural spread effects are present in regions of France, the US, and Denmark (Henry et al. 1997, 1999; Schmitt and Henry 2000). Urban population and employment growth affects rural places in different ways depending on the size of the urban core and fringe and their patterns of change. But these approaches have considered employment as homogeneous and have not examined how urban growth might affect export and service employment in proximate rural areas. The purpose of this paper is to examine how patterns of urban spatial expansion influences rural export and services employment, and population change in rural areas of functional economic regions. Works by Henderson et al. (1995) and others, e.g., Glaeser et al. (1992) or Combes (2000) to estimate the impacts of spatial externalities on urban growth, provide a useful taxonomy of spatial externalities and is suggestive of how they might influence growth within functional economic regions, both the urban complex and rural hinterland. Static externalities are of two types. First, information spillovers and labor pooling between establishments in the same industry comprise localization economies. Second, urbanization economies are associated with urban size where benefits of specialization and division of labor increase with urban size. In addition, dynamic externalities provide cost-saving benefits to a firm from learning by doing either between establishments in the same industry (MAR type) or from a building up of knowledge across industries in a more diverse (larger) urban place (Jacobs type) (Henderson et al. 1995). We describe next how urban spatial externalities might affect rural areas in the context of traditional models of regional development. The direction of causality in the “jobs follow people or people follow jobs?” literature (Steinnes and Fisher 1974) was addressed by Carlino and Mills (1987) by constructing location equations as a two-equation simultaneous system. Underlying wage and land price structural equations are not specified since variation in amenities across space is assumed to be capitalized into local wages and rents (see Roback 1982). Amenity variables in the two-equation system reflect these wage and rent effects across space. As suggested by Henry et al. (1997), to incorporate the interplay of employment and population changes into the spatial development process within a region, urban growth and size influences on development in proximate rural areas are assumed to follow the monocentric tradition, with some contemporary twists. First, consider a set of functional economic regions (FERs), each with an urban core, urban fringe (suburbs and edge cities), and a rural hinterland. The spatial extent of the region is limited by commuting costs from the urban core and fringe to proximate rural villages. Second, population and two kinds of economic activities, export and services, may locate in each of the three subareas of the region. Households require trade and service goods within a shopping trip distance that is shorter than the distance they are willing to commute to employment opportunities. Accordingly, the demand for service goods comes primarily from households within the subarea where the service establishment is located. Service employment depends on the size of the local population. Third, demand for the export commodity comes from outside the functional economic region so its level is exogenous. However, the marginal cost of producing the export commodity is influenced by spatial externalities within the functional economic region. Establishments located in functional economic regions with higher densities of employment in the export industries and of population may have lower costs. Examples of agglomeration economies that reduce production costs in urban areas compared to rural areas are: deeper labor markets or labor pooling that provides lower transactions and labor costs in urban areas, lower input costs from supplying industries as these industries achieve scale economies, and spillovers of knowledge that are more likely in urban areas (p. 265 in Kilkenny 1998). However, rising urban land rent within FERs with high population and export employment density plays a dispersive force. As urban land rents increase with proximity to the urban center and increased competition for fixed urban land resources, these added costs may offset other reductions in production costs from spatial agglomeration economies. Rising housing costs push households away from their job location until increasing commuting cost offsets the land rent rise (Fujita 1989; Goffette-Nagot 1999), causing population dispersion within functional economic region as well as between functional economic regions (Tabucchi 1998). If land rents in the urban center are high enough (relative to rural areas) to offset cost savings from urban agglomeration economies, export sector firms and households (and associated service firms) seek new locations in the urban fringe or rural hinterland as export demand expands. Negative spatial externalities, like congestion costs, can also induce urban spillovers or spread from the urban core to the fringe and rural hinterlands. Moreover, with improvements in transportation, rural villages become more attractive to residents who commute to jobs in the urban core or fringe. In all cases, the impact of spatial externalities on rural villages can be expected to decay with distance from the urban center. Variations in amenity levels across rural places also shape the attractiveness of rural places as residential sites and as sites for export and service employment. The general theoretical framework that captures the strategic interactions of these agents—including the effects from spatial externalities—is summarized in Brueckner’s (2003) resource flow model. Paraphrasing Anselin (2002, p. 250), this framework posits an agent’s objective functions, U(y

i
, s

i
, x

i
) where y

i
 is the agent’s decision variable (where to locate within the functional economic region in our case), s

i
 is a resource stock available to agent i (for example, the labor force pool of interest to a business firm or residential amenities that appeal to household agents), and x

i
 is a vector of agent characteristics (for example, type of firm). Spatial lag models arise because the resource, s

i
, available to agent i depends on the decisions of other (proximate) agents. Here, s

i
=H(y

i
, y

, x

i
) where y
−i
 are the decisions by all agents other than i (in our case, summing over other agent decisions yields employment or population densities in proximate areas). Substituting for s

i
 in the agent’s objective function yields a spatial lag model, for example, as shown in the spatial cross-regressive model developed below. In sum, there are three agents (firms in export and in population services and households) seeking sites in one of three subareas in each functional economic region (urban core, fringe, and rural hinterland). Two hypotheses focused on employment and population change in rural villages are suggested by the potential behavior of the three agents. First, size and growth of employment opportunities in urban areas proximate to the rural village are hypothesized to affect the desirability of rural places as a residential site and, thus, positively affect rural population and rural service employment growth. Second, export employment in rural hinterland areas is positively related to spatial agglomeration economies that will increase with size and growth of the urban core and fringe in the functional economic region. In the next Section, we offer a new version of the Boarnet (1994) and Henry et al. (1997) models, which captures the interplay of the three agents as they decide whether to expand in rural parts of the functional economic regions. In Section 3, data needed to estimate the model and econometric issues are presented. Empirical results for the selected French regions (eastern France) are examined and discussed in Section 4. A summary of findings and rural policy implications are provided in the conclusive section (Section 5).",22

Pereira,Jorge M. Andraz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper we focus on the regional impact of public investment in transportation infrastructures in Portugal with the goal of identifying its effects on the concentration of economic activity. The backwardness of the Portuguese economy relative to its European Union (EU) partners led to the establishment in 1989 of the EU structural programs for Portugal. The cornerstone of these programs is the development of a modern transportation infrastructure to improve accessibility among regions and to external markets. These programs aim both at promoting convergence of the country to EU standards of living and at reducing domestic regional asymmetries. There is now strong evidence that public investment in transportation infrastructures have been a powerful instrument to promote long-term growth in Portugal and in bringing the country up to EU standards [see Pereira and Andraz (2005)]. Despite this evidence, the question of the impact of these infrastructures at the regional level and the relation between the regional and the aggregate effects remains unanswered. This is a critical issue though, because the relevance of the aggregate effects does not provide any information as to the regional incidence of these effects. Significant positive aggregate effects could be associated with balanced positive effects across regions or could mask uneven regional gains. In fact, our central question is to determine whether aggregate growth has been accomplished in a manner that is regionally balanced or rather has been accomplished at the cost of increased regional asymmetries. This paper is in the confluence of the literature on the regional effects of public infrastructures and the literature on the relevance of regional spillovers [see Pereira and Roca-Sagales (2003) for a detailed discussion of the relevant literature]. One possible explanation for the inconclusive nature of the literature on the regional effects of public infrastructures is that it ignores spillover effects [see, for example, Boarnet (1998) and Mikelbank and Jackson (2000)]. Indeed, it could be argued that spillovers are an integral part of the regional impact of public infrastructures [see, for example, Haugwout (1989) and (2002)]. The positive regional effects of public infrastructures can be induced by public infrastructures installed in the region itself. Public infrastructures in other regions, however, could induce better accessibility of a region to the rest of the country as well. This leads us to the concept of spillover effects—i.e., the idea that a region may benefit from public infrastructures installed elsewhere. In this paper, we follow the approach developed in Pereira (2000, 2001), Pereira and Roca-Sagales (2003) and Pereira and Andraz (2005). We estimate separate vector autoregressive (VAR) models for the aggregate economy and for each of the five regions in the country, relating private output, employment and investment, and public investment.Footnote 1 This approach highlights the relevance of dynamic feedbacks among the variables as well as the possible endogeneity of public investment. Furthermore, it allows us to identify the regional effects of public investment in a framework that is consistent with the evaluation of the aggregate effects and the process allows us to identify the importance of regional spillovers.",35
40.0,4.0,The Annals of Regional Science,12 July 2006,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-005-0030-x,Locational disadvantage of the hub,December 2006,Takanori Ago,Ikumo Isono,Takatoshi Tabuchi,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"There is no doubt that more than two regions interact in trade and migration in the real world. There are several attempts to analyze multiple regions in the recent literature on new economic geography, such as Krugman (1993a), Krugman and Elizondo (1996), Furusawa and Konishi (2002), Behrens et al. (2003), Monfort and van Ypersele (2003), Anas (2004), and Tabuchi et al. (2005). For the sake of mathematical tractability, however, geographical space in these studies is symmetric, and analysis is usually confined to find symmetry breaking and agglomeration sustain thresholds. Under symmetric location of regions, there is no room for locational advantage and disadvantage among regions. In this paper, we tackle the analysis of asymmetric equilibria under asymmetric location of regions. Specifically, we consider an asymmetric network economy, where a central region is linked to two axisymmetrically located peripheral regions as in Krugman (1993b). Under this setting, one may expect that the central region has locational advantages of the hub, accruing from accessibility for firms to large market demand and for consumers to large supply of diverse goods. However, as pointed out by Venables and Limão (2002), the central region may have locational disadvantages. Fierce competition between firms reduces the profits in the central region. As a result, firms may leave the central region for the peripheries to avoid competition and seek local monopoly. Reduction in the profits leads to the decrease in the wages, which may lower the utility level of workers (even if there are more varieties with low prices for consumers). What is worse, the exodus of firms may exert a negative externality to consumers who are not working in the firms because prices would go up. In general, whether the central region is locationally advantageous or not depends on a trade-off between two opposing forces. The centripetal forces are superior market access for firms and product diversity for consumers: firms can save shipping costs to markets, while consumers can enjoy a large array of varieties in the central region. The centrifugal force is excessive price competition between firms. Investigation of these forces is the primary reason for considering asymmetric location of regions. According to the core–periphery models typified by Krugman (1991), the spatial configuration of economic activities is dispersed for sufficiently large transport costs. In the case of two regions, the intensity of price competition does not differ because two regions should be symmetric in a dispersed equilibrium. In the case of asymmetric location of three regions, it must be that it is intensified in the central region at the trade openings, while it is softer in the peripheries. Some firms would therefore relocate to the peripheries to avoid fierce price competition, thus shrinking the manufacturing share in the central region. In other words, full dispersion does not minimize price competition. Examination of the spatial equilibrium distribution is the secondary reason for considering the asymmetric location of regions. In this paper, we study the impacts of falling transport costs and the effects of locational differences on the size and welfare of regions. To depict the long-run evolutionary process of regional development, we start from the position of autarky with an even distribution of economic activities. The decrease in the transport costs would enable firms to trade between regions, which alters equilibrium prices, wages, and profits, and generates migration of firms together with workers. We utilize two representative core–periphery models of economic geography under monopolistically competitive and perfectly competitive markets: Krugman (1991), and Ottaviano et al. (2002), hereafter OTT. The Krugman model assumes a CES utility function with iceberg transport costs, while the OTT model assumes a quadratic utility function with linear transport costs. It has been shown in the literature that both models with two regions yield very similar results in terms of distributions of manufacturing activities: dispersion for large transport costs and agglomeration for small transport costs. In the case of asymmetric location of three regions, one may conjecture the following evolutionary process. When the transport costs are prohibitively large, each region is in autarky with an equal share of manufacturing activities in either model. In accordance with the decrease in transport costs, the central region would steadily gain manufacturing share from the peripheries. When the transport costs fall down sufficiently, all the manufacturing activities would agglomerate in the central region. This scenario is confirmed numerically in the Krugman model.Footnote 1
 However, this is not true in the OTT model. It will be shown that the outcome is totally opposite in the initial stages following the opening up of markets to interregional trade. In the OTT model, because the number of varieties suddenly increases in the central region owing to imports from other regions, price competition intensifies leading to a decrease in the central region’s profits. The OTT model is therefore in agreement with international trade models of Brander and Krugman (1983), Anderson et al. (1995), and Clarke and Collie (2003). The two models differ in welfare change. In the Krugman model, everyone gains from the decrease in transport costs, which is augmented by free migration to the central region. However, the reverse is true in the OTT model, where firms lose from trade. These losses are aggravated by the freeing up of migration from the central region. These findings comprise the main result of this paper: the Krugman model forms a striking contrast to the OTT model. When the transport costs continuously decrease over time, we can obtain an evolutionary path of stable equilibrium distributions of manufacturing activities. We completely characterize the stable equilibrium paths in the OTT model, by making the most use of its analytical tractability. It will be shown that despite the apparent locational advantages in the central region, it may not experience growth and may become totally empty in the end. This is because economic activities in the center will relocate to the peripheries to avoid intense price competition and because there exists the lock-in effect stemming from increasing returns to scale in the regional level. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The general setting of three regions is described in the next section. The Krugman model is analyzed when transport costs are too high to trade between regions, and numerical simulations of stable equilibrium paths are conducted in Section 3. In Section 4, the OTT model is fully analyzed, disappearance of the central region is shown by examining stable equilibrium paths, and empirical relevance is stated. The opposite outcomes in the two models are investigated in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.",54

The Sistema Nacional de Coordinación Fiscal (SNCF, the National System of Fiscal Coordination) established in 1980 increased the amount of nonconditional transfers (participaciones federales) to states and municipalities. Subsequently, the Constitutional Reform of Article 115 in 1983 transferred fiscal functions and responsibilities to municipal governments. It remains a topic of discussion whether the SNCF has increased the degree of financial dependence of Mexican subnational governments. One would expect the Constitutional Reform to reduce the degree of financial dependence once new sources of a municipality’s own revenues become available. In fact, one of the explicit objectives of the Constitutional Reform was to reduce financial dependence. In addition to changes in fiscal institutions at the national level, the institutional frameworks faced by municipalities within their states have changed. These additional forces could also affect the degree of financial dependence. Particularly interesting is the case of Mexican Northern border municipalities whose economic, demographic, and migratory dynamics contrast with the rest of Mexico. This study investigates whether the institutional fiscal setting at the state level together with location (municipalities sharing a common border with the US) impact the financial dependence of local governments. We expect, with higher than average inflows of capital and labor, that there will be a higher demand for public services and infrastructure in border municipalities. An argument based on fiscal effort suggests that local governments would exploit their fiscal capacity to the maximum, lessening their financial dependence relative to nonborder localities. However, border municipalities may be more financially dependent on central authorities simply due to the high demand for public services in their jurisdiction and their inability to obtain sufficient funding. Concerning the effects of federal institutional changes, Ibarra Salazar et al. (2001) find that after 1980 the degree of financial dependence of Mexican municipalities is significantly higher than the years preceding the SNCF. For the northern border municipalities in particular, Ordóñez Barba (1995) finds that the Constitutional Reform did exert positive effects on financial autonomy, though not uniformly. In fact, the benefits seem to be higher for municipalities with a relatively high stage of urbanization, having a population over 250,000 people. Additional studies on the public finances of Mexican northern border municipalities include Zepeda Miramontes (1992), Cabello and Ortiz (1998), and Ibarra Salazar (2003) who recently documented that northern state governments show less dependence than other Mexican states. Studies have hitherto ignored the effects that regional characteristics and different institutional settings may have on municipal public finance. This study puts forward such an institutional approach, incorporating regional aspects of the US–Mexican border area to analyze these effects on financial dependence. Because of the economic dynamics and demographics of the area, and pressure from migration, border municipalities face a higher demand for public services compared to nonborder localities. The main hypothesis of this study is precisely based on this fact. The constraints border municipalities face when responding to such an environment are then twofold: the fiscal intergovernmental agreement signed in 1980 and the distribution scheme to transfer federal funds that ignores border-related characteristics. Given such a scenario, local governments in northern border municipalities necessarily exploit their own limited resources in the face of heavy demand for infrastructure and public service. Pursuing this reasoning, we would thus expect that the degree of border municipalities’ dependence to be lower than that of nonborder municipalities. To test this hypothesis, we estimate different econometric models of financial dependence using a data set of the 300 more representative Mexican municipalities as defined by Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática (INEGI) for the year 2000. Each model controls for economic (municipality level-GDP per capita) and fiscal (amount of federal nonconditional transfers and concentration of fiscal revenues in a given municipality) measures together with dummy variables that take into account geographic (sharing the border with the US) and institutional (state idiosyncrasies) differences. This study offers four potential contributions that are presented as testable assumptions or hypotheses here. First, it presents empirical evidence at the local level of regional features that quantitatively affect financial dependence. Second, it quantifies the role of the states in introducing systematic (regulatory or due to the state’s economic orientation) components or effects on the financial dependence of municipalities. Third, it provides a novel approach, based on classic statistical theory, to handle municipal public finances that receive shocks at the national level through the institutional framework and at the local level thorough migration and capital flows. We provide evidence that these fluctuations are much higher than the ones affecting the nation as a whole. Fourth, the paper provides insights and policy implications on a public finance issue, which is not exclusive to Mexican localities. The plan of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the recent economic background of border municipalities. Section 3 provides the empirical methodology and the various models to be estimated, while Section 4 contains the major results of the paper. Section 5 summarizes the work and presents the policy implications.",7

This paper examines the theoretical justifications for these “integrated tariffs”. They are characterized by the following basic features: 
 A fixed fee that does not depend on the actual travel length; A given validity period of the travel document; The possibility of interchanging means of transport, e.g., tram, bus, underground train, etc. A basic justification for integrated tariffs pertains to reducing the transaction costs involved in selling tickets, embarking passengers, providing price information, etc. These motivations have been pointed out in a stream of literature dealing with travelcards and the likes (for reviews, see White [11], Carbajo [3], and Gilbert and Jalilian [7]). If motivations based on transaction costs were the most relevant ones, then, the spreading of new technologies (e.g., contactless cards) should pave the way to resort to prices more strictly tailored to the travel length, the quality and comfort of transport, etc., while customer’s payments should become more variable and more clearly linked to the specific characteristics of their consumption. In this paper, however, other reasons for resorting to integrated tariffs will be considered by examining the applicability of modern price discrimination theory to the local collective transport fares. While models of two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing have been suggested with reference to travelcards (for reviews, see Carbajo [3], Gilbert and Jalilian [6], and FitzRoy and Smith [5]), the focus was on providing explanations for quantity discounts given to users who make many trips, while no explanation was put forth for the resort to flat fares with a limited time validity (e.g., hourly tickets) for small consumers. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a basic model of urban transport demand is presented, and integrated tariffs are motivated according to the large numbers approach suggested by Armstrong [1]. In Section 3, a nonlinear pricing model is used to explain the resort to binding time constraints for consumers with low demand. In Section 4, the role of network and spatial characteristics in motivating the resort to integrated tariffs is considered. Some conclusions follow in Section 5.",8

Bessler,Stephen W. Fuller,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers are important transportation arteries for moving export-destined grain from the US Midwest to lower Mississippi River ports. In addition, the rivers annually carry significant amounts of fertilizer, coal, and petroleum products. In 2002, cargo weighing about 127 million tons was transported on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers (USACE/WCSC 2004). Central to navigation on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers are 37 locks and dams that maintain a 9-ft channel for barge transportation. This aging lock and dam system, primarily built in the 1930s, has generated concern about the future navigational efficiency of these transport arteries. The greatest concern centers on lock capacity in the lower portions of these rivers where comparatively high traffic congestion generates extended delays for barges/tows. Grain producers argue that the lock delay on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers unfavorably influences barge rates on these transport arteries and consequently the competitiveness of US grain in the international market (Rich 2001). On average, the estimated operating costs of a towboat and associated tow of barges operating on the upper Mississippi River range from \$400 to \$500 per hour (USACE/IWR 2000). Therefore, as tow/vessel delay at selected locks increase, the cost of barging grain on these waterways is expected to correspondingly increase. Furthermore, when barges are demanded for transporting grain from the north-central US to lower Mississippi river ports, they cannot be promptly dispatched to the geographic location of demand due to lock congestion, thus a higher barge rate would also be generated. The argument accordingly goes, the greater the lock delay that a tow experiences on the upper Mississippi or Illinois Rivers, the higher the barge operator’s cost and ultimately the higher the barge rate. As the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers are important transport arteries for much of the US grain and soybean exports, lock congestion on these rivers is of concern to agricultural interests. In 1989, the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) initiated a feasibility study to determine whether the expansion of selected locks in the lower reaches of the upper Mississippi and Illinois was economically justified. Controversies arose regarding the methodology and assumptions employed in the economic analysis of this study. In 2000, the National Academy of Science reviewed this study and criticized the Corps for failing to incorporate non-structural alternatives such as scheduling or transferable permits for reducing lock congestion (NAS 2001). Knowledge of the effects of lock delay on barge rates is clearly central to carrying out meaningful research into the benefits of extending lock capacity. The purpose of this study is to identify and measure the impact of lock delay on grain barge rates. The focus of the analysis is lock delay on segments of the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and grain barge rates that link sections of these rivers to lower Mississippi River ports. Analyses are carried out after a recent suggestion by (Swanson and Granger 1997) to model contemporaneous innovation covariance in multivariate time-series models using directed acyclic graphs. This paper includes a background section that offers perspective of the current lock and dam system and the congestion on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. This is followed by a brief literature review and a description of the methodology used to carry out the study objectives. A description of data used in the analyses is presented. Finally, results are offered and then a summary and a conclusion are provided.",4

Many mechanisms can explain why individuals do not entirely capture the benefits from their education. For example, a high level of average human capital may favor the diffusion of knowledge among workers, as in Lucas (1988), or make it profitable to invest in new technologies, as in Acemoglu (1996, 1997), or even generate effects that go even beyond the domain of economics.
Footnote 1
 Even though there are good theoretical reasons to argue in favor of schooling externalities, cross-country evidence on human capital and growth has proved to be surprisingly mixed (see, for example, Mankiw et al. 1992; Bils and Klenow 2000). More recently, the literature has followed Lucas’ (1988) suggestion that the ideal field for empirical research on human capital externalities should be local labor markets (LLMs). Rauch (1993), Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), Moretti (2004), Ciccone and Peri (2006) have estimated Mincerian wage-equations augmented with an average human capital term at the level of US State or metropolitan area (MA). But again, overall results are inconclusive: while Rauch (1993) and Moretti (2004) find evidence for substantial social returns to education, Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) and Ciccone and Peri (2006) claim that such returns are negligible. While the impact of local human capital on individual wages has been examined in detail for the US, there has not been much empirical work for other countries. With regard to EU countries, the lack of empirical work is quite surprising.
Footnote 2 The idea that individuals do not entirely capture the benefits from their own education is used to argue that governments should subsidize schooling. Thus, measuring schooling externalities should be a concern especially in the EU, where education is mostly financed with public money. According to the OECD (2003), in 2000 the proportion of publicly financed expenditure on education was equal to 68.2 percent in the US. This compared with corresponding figures equal to 81.1% for Germany, 92.1% for France, and 90.9% for Italy.
Footnote 3,
Footnote 4
 This paper tries to shed some light on the role of social returns to education by studying the impact of local human capital on wages for a sample of Italian workers. Focusing on Italy, allows us to adopt a definition of LLM that is considered to be accurate according to international standards: see OECD (2002).
Footnote 5 In this paper, a LLM is defined as “a territorial unit resulting from the organization of social and economic relations in that its boundaries do not reflect geographical particularities or historical events.” (see ISTAT 1997).
Footnote 6 LLMs are computed in terms of commuting conditions and span the entire national territory.
Footnote 7
 Turning to the results, the paper shows that there is an important correlation between local human capital and average wages after controlling for individual characteristics (such as individual human capital, work experience, sex, and family status). Estimated social returns to education range from 2 to 3%, whereas the private returns amount roughly to 6–7%. However, there are many potentially confounding factors that may introduce a spurious correlation between local average education and earnings. To find some support about causality running from local human capital to wages, the paper performs a number of robustness checks. It shows that: (1) the estimated social returns are unlikely to be driven by spatially correlated omitted variables (Ciccone 2002); (2) they survive to the introduction of individual- and territorial-level controls; (3) they are not due to imperfect substitutability across workers (Ciccone and Peri 2006) or, (4) to selective migration of talented workers across LLMs (Charlot and Duranton 2004); (5) they survive when both local human capital and individual human capital are treated as endogenous variables and instrumented (Moretti 2004). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset. Section 3 presents the empirical evidence, and Section 4 concludes. The Appendix provides a simple model that justifies theoretically the empirical approach followed here.",19

Stough,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Innovation drives economic growth and universities play an enhanced role in knowledge production and innovation (Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Litan et al. 2007a; Mitchell 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2006). Scientific knowledge becomes increasingly important for innovation and new business development as technologies have grown more sophisticated and emerging industries (i.e., biotechnology and nanotechnology) have become more high-tech. While private firms accounted for more than 70 % of the R&D 100 (R&D Magazine’s annual list of the most significant, newly introduced research and development advances in multiple disciplines) in 1975, academia became responsible for more than 70 % of the top 100 innovations by 2006 (Mitchell 2010). Universities have become more important players in the process of invention and innovation in recent decades. In parallel, the traditional mission of universities including teaching and research has gradually changed with new perspectives on the role of the university in the system of knowledge production and has expanded in order to take over a “third mission” namely commercial activities including patenting, licensing and company formation (Baldini 2006; Owen-Smith and Powell 2003; Rasmussen et al. 2006). Universities are now expected not only to sustain or to support economic growth but also to generate economic growth through producing new knowledge, human capital, licensing innovations and creating new companies. In recent years, commercialization of knowledge has come to be seen as an important stimulant of economic growth (Agrawal 2001; Bok 2003; Etzkowitz 1990 and 2002, Litan et al. 2007b; Viale and Etzkowitz 2010), particularly for improving the development capabilities and economic performance of regions (Goldstein and Renault 2004; Duch et al. 2011; Shane 2004). The above-mentioned developments have led to the emergence of a new phenomenon called “entrepreneurial universities” (Baldini 2006; Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Jacob et al. 2003; Powers 2004; Smilor et al. 1993) and “academic entrepreneurship” (Bercovitz and Feldmann 2008; Meyer 2003; Shane 2004; Wright et al. 2007). An “entrepreneurial university” can be viewed as “a university that has developed a comprehensive internal system for the commercialization and commodification of its knowledge” (Jacob et al. 2003: 1556). The transformation of universities toward a more entrepreneurial restructuring has led to new types of relations and governance systems such as the “Triple Helix” model of university-industry-government relations (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1996; Etzkowitz et al. 2000). Today, this model of university-industry-government relations plays a variety of roles in different combinations in the process of knowledge commercialization. The acceptance of knowledge commercialization as a “third mission” can be viewed as an “academic revolution” that has had enormous impacts on economic development. Academic knowledge commercialization first came onto the economic development agenda in the United States in the 1980s and later spread to European countries in the 1990s. The American model of knowledge commercialization is based on an entrepreneurial university model, engaged in technology transfer through patents and new firm formation (Etzkowitz 2002). The Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 has been a milestone in the adoption of commercialization of knowledge in the United States. Following the passage of Bayh-Dole Act, U.S. universities increased their efforts in technology transfer, licensing and investments in new firms. In the following 20 years, the number of universities engaged in technology licensing increased eightfold, and the volume of university patents increased fourfold (Mowery and Shane 2002). The number of universities that created technology licensing and transfer offices increased from 20 in 1980 to 200 in 1990, and by 2000, nearly every research university had one technology transfer office (Colyvas et al. 2002). From 1980 until 2000, 3376 academic spinoff companies were established (Pressman 2002). Given the relatively large number of faculty, staff and students at academic institutions in the United States, this number of spinoffs can be viewed as quite small. However, as mentioned also by Shane (2004), university spinoffs are rare entities; nonetheless, they are quite important. According to the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), from 1980 to 1999, American university spinoffs generated $33.5 billion in economic value added. In the same period, these spinoffs generated 280,000 jobs, at an average of 83 jobs per spinoff. According to Cohen (2000), this rate of job creation shows that the average university spinoff creates more jobs than the average small business founded in the United States. However, the Bayh-Dole Act has not been the only factor for the increased commercialization of academic research (Kortum and Lerner 1999; Mowery et al. 2001; Sampat 2006). Increasing quantity and complexity of scientific research; increasing demand for scientific research from the society; increasing competition among the scientists; and the use of commercialization activities including patents and start-ups as criteria for ranking universities have also contributed to the change in academic culture (Kumar 2010). As a result of the Bayh-Dole Act and the above-mentioned other factors, contribution to economic growth has become the “third mission” of the American universities including commercial activities like patenting, licensing and company formation besides teaching and research (Baldini 2006). This transformation has been followed in many other countries. The U.S. Bayh-Dole Act has become a benchmark model for knowledge commercialization. Knowledge commercialization has been recognized as the “third mission” of universities in various European countries as well (Charles and Howells 1992; van Geenhuizen 2010; Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003; Howell and McKinlay 1999; Muscio and Geuna 2008; PriceWaterhouseCooper 2007). This rather new role started to grow in Europe in the early 1980s (Charles and Howells 1992; Howell and McKinlay 1999). Commercialization of knowledge first started in the UK in the early 1980s (Wright et al. 2002) and then spread to the continent first in the Netherlands and following then to other northern European countries and more recently to southern European countries like France and Italy (Muscio and Geuna 2008). In the 1990s, technology commercialization efforts accelerated in many European countries. A decrease in public research funding at universities, a public debate about the role that universities have to play in society and a Bayh-Dole type of Act adopted by many countries, played an important role in this process (Wright et al. 2007). In the UK, with the establishment of university technology transfer offices (Wright et al. 2002), and in Sweden with major changes in research policy and the “university teachers’ exemption” that gave intellectual property rights (IPRs) to researchers, university technology commercialization activities accelerated (Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003; Kitagawa and Wigren 2010). Therefore, following the change in American universities in the 1980s, the universities in Europe have also changed dramatically since the mid-1990s. Commercialization of university knowledge involves economic utilization of intellectual property (Rasmussen et al. 2006). In order to facilitate and speed-up the knowledge transfer from university research to industry, most developed countries, for example, the U.S., Germany, Japan, have adopted regulations giving intellectual property rights (IPRs) to the universities. However, a few developed countries, like Sweden, Finland and Italy, have decided to give the IPRs to researchers instead of universities (Bengtsson et al. 2009; OECD 2003; Wright et al. 2007). Therefore, there are two different governance systems: university-governed and researcher-governed-systems of knowledge commercialization (Bengtsson et al. 2009). However, in Sweden and Finland, the discussions are going on regarding replace the researcher-governed-system with a Bayh-Dole type university-governance system (Siegel et al. 2007; Wright et al. 2007), as there is some evidence that the American system is more effective in facilitating the commercialization of knowledge than, for example, the Swedish system (Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003). Universities predominantly have used two governance structures: the technology transfer office (TTO) structure where knowledge is commercialized through licensing to the market and the entrepreneurial structure where a new venture is formed (Bengtsson et al. 2009). Through these structures, universities have become more involved with their wider surrounding regions in recent decades by offering new programmes and by building closer links with business (Boucher et al. 2003; Bramwell and Wolfe 2008; Duch et al. 2011; Goldstein and Renault 2004; Hudson 2006; Lazzaretti and Tavoletti 2005). As an attractor, educator and retainer of students, and shaping them into knowledge-based graduates for firms in the region (Boucher et al. 2003; Bramwell and Wolfe 2008), universities have affected the local labor market and contributed to the stock of tacit knowledge to provide formal and informal technical support. They have also contributed to regional economic development, on the one hand, by creating new firms, and on the other hand by influencing the region in which they are located by knowledge spillover mechanisms to fuel the development of the regional entrepreneurial culture. Therefore, the presence of a university and its engagement with commercial activities has played a key role in regional economic development. However, in an increasingly dynamic and global economy, the institutional infrastructure has remained inefficient at moving university innovations to the marketplace and society. Therefore, the efficiency of the commercialization system has been questioned in many countries, and alternative mechanisms, relevant initiatives and policies have been sought in order to facilitate and foster knowledge commercialization (Bercovitz and Feldmann 2008; Litan et al. 2007b; Mitchell 2010; PriceWaterhouseCooper 2007). While a “hot” debate about how to facilitate knowledge commercialization is going on, commercial activities have also met criticism and concern among academics. Some have argued that commercialization activities may be a threat to traditional academic freedom and basic research (Behrens and Gray 2001, 2004; Niller 2001), and others have drawn attention to conflicts of values and interests (Bird et al. 1993; van Dierdonck and Debackere 1988, 1988; Kumar2010; Siegel et al. 2007) further, several scholars have strongly articulated the risks of a market-oriented approach while emphasizing ethical concerns (Deem 2001, 2010; Rubins2007; Slaughter and Rhoades 2004, 1998). They have argued the implications of “academic capitalism” (Rubins 2007; Slaughter and Rhoades 2004) and a shift from “public good knowledge/learning regime” to an “academic capitalist knowledge/learning regime” (Slaughter and Rhoades 2004: 28–29). Therefore, knowledge commercialization has “protagonists” as well as “antagonists” (Kumar 2010). Against this background, this paper investigates the phenomenon of “bridging knowledge to commercialization” on the basis of a comprehensive overview of the literature and the ongoing debate in academic and policy circle. The paper considers commercialization of knowledge as a complex and a multi-faceted phenomenon, and therefore, aims to highlight “the good”, “the bad” and “the challenging” in commercialization of knowledge from a taxonomic perspective. The paper first examines emerging concepts in bridging knowledge to commercialization and describes a conceptual framework on the basis of a typology of methaphores for knowledge. This part focuses especially on different conceptual approaches including “knowledge valorization” and “knowledge commercialization” argued by European and American scholars and clarifies the differences between the concepts. Next, Part 3 highlights “the good” in bridging knowledge to commercialization while focusing on societal benefits and the spatial implications of commercialization of knowledge from a regional development perspective. Part 4 addresses “the bad” in commercialization of knowledge in terms of value conflicts and differences in culture and perspectives. This part examines conflicts of values, conflicts of interest and conflicts in the commercialization of knowledge, thus it examines the cultural and ethical implications. The last part describes the critical framework conditions fostering the commercialization of knowledge and proposes a research agenda while underlining “the challenging” for academia, industry and government.",27

Miller,Zoltan J. Acs,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The demand for practical and productive output from US higher education dates back to the founding of the first colleges in North America. Innovative educational, political, and philanthropic leaders realized earlier visions of a higher education sector connected to local and regional concerns through the funding and building of great research universities after the Civil War (Carlsson et al. 2007). Since World War II and especially in recent decades, universities have used an organization based model for commercializing knowledge. A regional and national landscape full of technology transfer programs, triple-helixes, science parks, spin-offs, and corporate and venture partnerships has become the norm. Many research universities perpetually struggle to become innovation and entrepreneurship leaders and though a few have seemingly ‘perfected’ the process, their fortune is not easily replicated. In an entrepreneurial age, researchers and policy makers must view the campus and its knowledge commercialization from a broader perspective and return to the local roots of America’s great universities (Audretsch 2007). Today, regional and national leaders demand that universities turn their knowledge into economic gain (Etzkowitz 2008; Crow 2008). The expectations of policy makers and the public at large were not nearly as lofty just over 100 years ago when less than 4 Americans attended college and much of the public mistrusted colleges and universities alike (Veysey 1965; Thelin 2004; Kamenetz 2010). The purpose of this paper is to use interpretive analysis to exam and interpret past and recent developments in knowledge commercialization and provide researchers, policy makers, and university leaders an alternative framework, based on historical precedent and current economic realities, for considering commercialization of knowledge in the entrepreneurial age. The next section explores the higher education models imported from abroad and the growth of these models in the US Next an exploration of the ways in which these models were reformed, evolved and hyrbridized in the US by various local and regional leaders. These actions and the entrance of the federal government would lead to the development of Clark Kerr’s modern multiversity. Kerr’s multiversity will be used to understand our contemporary landscape full of triple-helixes, technology transfer programs, science parks, spin-offs, and corporate partnerships, many of which have become the model of choice for university and regional leaders. While organizations and systems are in place, the effectiveness of most universities is unclear, though the demand for more productive output continues (Bercovitz and Feldmann 2006). The disconnect between the standard organization centric commercialization model in use and the entrepreneurial age will be discussed in the following section. Finally, some recommendations based on past successes of the sector in providing value and some other innovative entrepreneurial activities available to universities charged with supporting economic development regionally. The move from an organization centric model to something more appropriate will likely follow past eras of change and innovation in higher education.",8

Comparing EU and US faculty views of university involvement in regional economic development and commercialization,April 2013,Harvey Goldstein,Edward M. Bergman,Gunther Maier,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A key challenge facing the EU lies in improving the ability to convert knowledge into commercial ventures that yield economic benefit. While the United States has been able to nurture and extract considerable economic value from the intangible assets represented by its scientists, much attention is now being paid to launch appropriate efforts that would bring science and industry closer together in Europe, particularly prospects for reaping the latent as well as tacit knowledge locked away in university scientific systems and practices. This does not imply a direct and unreflective importation of institutional practices that successfully unlocked such assets in the US economy. Such a strategy would be difficult and risky to pursue in Europe, since the two systems of university education differ in quite fundamental ways (Herbst 2004). But there is much to be gained by additional direct comparisons between the two systems to detect better the options open to each. University reform in Europe is now underway for many reasons, only some of which directly address advancing academic entrepreneurship in EU universities. The sheer expansion of the EU to nearly 30 countries calls for much greater standardization of study programs, recognition of equivalent degrees, mobility of faculty and students, and uniform practices that have benefitted the US higher education system for many decades. At the same time, major changes in governance are underway, with national university systems granting greater autonomy and budgetary discretion, and movement from regulation towards performance-based management practices. This decentralization of authority and policy-making, in turn, is shifting the centre of gravity of oversight away from ministries and parliaments towards external bodies, for example, EU-wide accreditation groups, and involving new stakeholder groups such as local and regional governments, and business associations in the governance of institutions of higher education. Europe’s steady “endogenization of universities” into its social and economic life may be expected to increase simultaneously the number and variety of stakeholders and the demands placed upon universities. Extension of the EU universities’ mission implies engagement in areas that were once typically a responsibility of other institutions. Traditional divisions of labour relegated teaching exclusively to the universities, while knowledge transfer functions and a responsibility for basic research were shared with academies of science and national research bodies. Most universities remained quite apart from the deliberate application of knowledge which was conducted within ministries and departments or by business, although individual faculty might occasionally exercise their “professor’s privilege” in transferring their specific research findings to the market. At present, universities are quickly being drawn into all these functions at different rates and mixturesFootnote 1, often to permit joint and more cost-effective progress towards economic and social objectives.Footnote 2 Nations, regions, and their constituent communities demand ever more assistance with tasks of strengthening the knowledge economy, restructuring basic institutions, assimilating new populations, and embedding the elements of modern societies within the constantly evolving European Union. While the US university system is often considered a benchmark for certain goals of EU higher education, that expansive literature will not be reviewed here, nor will we evaluate the many studies that examine the transfer of knowledge outputs (publications, patents, citations, etc.) from US universities of various types and characteristicFootnote 3. Europe’s self-declared research universities (LERU 2006) have advanced a US-oriented line of argument in favour of expanded funding and greater autonomy for selected universities, arguing further that Europe would also benefit from greater diversity in the types of missions universities might pursue. Based on capacities and circumstances, some might presumably seek to attain the status of world-class research universities specializing in basic “Bohr quadrant” research, while others are better suited to helping meet industry and regional needs by pursuing “Edison quadrant” research, although both might also venture selectively into the “Pasteur quadrant” as well (Stokes 1997). The League of European Research Universities (LERU) builds the case for more favourable treatment of existing universities generally, and basic research universities in particular, which can be seen as an effort to temper the European Union’s strong policy orientation towards far more commercialization and academic entrepreneurialism. A number of scholars have documented the ‘entrepreneurial turn’ of universities in the United States and in many other countries (Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003; Kenney and Goe 2004; Goldstein 2010a). While academic entrepreneurship presents a number of different faces, we refer specifically to commercialization of knowledge production and transfer within the academy as having already achieved in the United States a ‘taken-for-granted’ status in terms of institutionalization of procedures and of norms (Colyvas and Powell 2006; Stuart and Ding 2006). Yet casual evidence that comes from discussions with colleagues working at a variety of research universities suggests that serious concerns by various stakeholders within the academy about the efficiency, effectiveness, and ethics of commercialization of knowledge still remain. Moreover, debates within university faculty membership organizations reveal this face of academic entrepreneurship may be less ‘taken-for-granted’ than its adherents imagine (Goldstein 2010b). In this paper we address three related research questions concerning the attitudes of university faculty in the United States and in Europe towards their universities taking active roles in the promotion of regional economic development and knowledge commercialization. First, we ask whether faculty make a distinction between their universities taking active roles in the (1) promotion of economic development and the (2) commercialization of knowledge generated inside the university. The former has many of the attributes of a ‘public good’ and can be viewed as part of the mission of universities to contribute to the general welfare of their regions and to the health of civil society. The latter, on the other hand, comes for many with the ‘baggage’ of knowledge for profit, conflicts of interest, and a turn against the Mertonian norm of ‘open science’ (Merton 1957). We posit that faculty do indeed make this distinction. The second question is what factors explain the variation in faculty attitudes towards university involvement in economic development and commercialization more generally? The literature is eclectic on this. We include a variety of (i) individual faculty characteristics, including scholarly discipline, (ii) institutional (university) characteristics, and (iii) regional economic conditions as explanatory variables. In particular, we are interested in identifying if regional economic conditions matter, controlling for individual, disciplinary, and institutional factors. We hypothesize that regions undergoing industry restructuring or in greater chronic economic distress should be positively related to favourable attitudes towards universities engaging in regional economic development, but not necessarily to attitudes towards knowledge commercialization. Third, we ask whether there are important differences between the attitudes of faculty in US universities and those in European universities. We posit that although US universities have provided early and well-known examples of academic entrepreneurship, faculty in the EU, driven by a perceived stronger need for ‘catch-up’ in global competitiveness, are more tolerant of universities extending their missions to include engagement in regional economic development and particularly in knowledge commercialization. Following a review of the literature in Sect. 2, we describe in Sect. 3 the data and methods used in this study, the results of the analyses in Sect. 4, and a discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the results in Sect. 5 along with concluding comments.",19

50.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,05 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-012-0506-4,Education and the location of work: a continued economic role for central cities?,April 2013,William Sander,William A. Testa,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many studies have examined the appeal of the central city as a place to live for educated (often young and unmarried) professionals (e.g., Brueckner et al. 1999; Florida 2008; Glaeser et al. 2001; Sander 2005; Sander and Testa 2009) while other studies have featured the attractiveness of suburbs, especially for more affluent families with children (e.g., Bajari and Kahn 2005; Cullen and Levitt 1999; Margo 1992; Wheaton 1977). Although the amenities that more affluent and educated households might value tend to be available in denser environments such as central cities, less affluent households benefit from city life as well, for example, through easy access to public transportation (Glaeser et al. 2008). These studies follow an older literature that focused on the effect of commuting costs on household and job location (Alonso 1964; Mills 1967; Muth 1969). Later work suggested that firms would attempt to locate near (suburban) worker-households to reduce commuting costs and wage offers (Moses 1962). Otherwise, they would need to compensate workers with higher wages for longer commuting times. Over time within metropolitan areas, firms with significant labor costs would tend to move toward (equilibrium) locations where commuting times and wages for similar workers would be equalized. In other instances, firms and employment zones may only be able to sustain higher wages in remote locations if they are compensated by higher productivity, such as from agglomeration economies, or other site-specific factors (Timothy and Wheaton 2001; Fu and Ross 2013). In this vein, central cities can be characterized as a preferred job location for educated and skilled workers. In a related study, Glaeser and Kahn (2001) examine employment decentralization across metropolitan areas. They find wide variation. They explain much of the cross-metropolitan area differences by industry composition. Metropolitan areas that are concentrated in service-oriented industries like banking are less decentralized than those that feature more production-oriented industries. Further, even after accounting for the dominant influence of work force residential location, industries with more highly skilled workers (and a greater reliance on computers) such as banking tend to be more centralized because of the perceived production advantages from locating close to similar businesses (“idea intensiveness”), especially in central business districts (CBDs). Although metropolitan employment patterns are now characterized by a polycentric network of employment subcenters, central cities often maintain a prominent role. Central cities and their central business districts typically remain the largest employment subcenter (Anderson and Bogart 2001; Anas et al. 1998). One of the reasons for this is that there are production advantages for some industries in cities. That is, certain skill-related business functions and processes that tend to employ highly educated workers favor centrality and density. These include higher education, professional and technical services, specialized medical services, and other services that require face-to-face service delivery between the provider and customer. In part, a city’s personal transportation services allow customers to reach the provider’s central location from a broad surrounding market area. In other instances, the high density of a city location is beneficial to business functions that require extensive and frequent face-to-face communication among workers or inter-firm transactions among specialized business service firms. The latter can include administrative and headquarters operations, for example, that purchase specialized business services for a far-flung network of operating facilities (Ono 2003). So, too, creative ideas, marketable technologies, and emerging businesses requiring specialized business and financial services may also be effectively spawned in central cities. Carlino et al. (2006) find that patent intensity (the per capita invention rate) is positively related to employment density. In this study, we examine the city versus suburban location of jobs that are occupied by educated workers, taking into account their household location. That is, we test whether there are production advantages that attract highly educated workers to (working) in cities, taking into account residential preferences. We provide new evidence on the effect of higher education on working in specific central cities. Further, we provide new evidence on variations in the effect of various levels of higher education (bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, professional degree, and Ph.D.) on working in central cities. Related studies often only adjust for having at least a bachelor’s degree (e.g., Glaeser and Kahn 2001). In brief, we test the hypothesis that cities are good places to work for highly educated workers apart from whether they are good places to live for such workers. Following Glaeser and Kahn (2001), we find that jobs that employ more educated workers tend to be concentrated in central cities, although there is substantial variation by metropolitan area. This is the case with and without adjustments for household location. We further show that positive education effects on working in cities are partly a result of more educated suburban residents commuting to cities for work. The results hold for amenity-rich cities like San Francisco and New York City as well as more depressed cities like Detroit and St. Louis. More generally, large cities seemingly provide production advantages for firms that employ highly educated workers apart from the consumption advantages and disadvantages of living in them. We also show that the least educated workers are also more likely to work in central cities mostly because they live in cities. This is an important research topic for several reasons. First, the location of jobs has received less attention relative to studies on the location of households (Glaeser and Kahn 2001). Further, many central cities continue to struggle to find new and sustainable roles within metropolitan economies. Policy often focuses on promoting the residential choice of highly skilled households, with the idea that this will promote economic revival (Florida 2006). To be sure, some cities have been successful in attracting educated households. In addition to boosting the local tax base, such success may be highly desirable to the extent that employers tend to invest in locations with ready access to workers (Glaeser and Kahn 2001). However, some have argued that it is mistaken to neglect the roles and processes by which central cities nurture work activity (Storper and Scott 2009). New and continued roles for the central city as a skilled workplace, independent of its new residential role, should be considered. Our paper is organized as follows. The first section discusses the data that are used to estimate where workers work. The second section presents the empirical models that are estimated. The empirical results are arrayed in the third section. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the results.",3

According to Girouard and Blöndal (2001), the in house prices have a significant positive impact on private consumption, have an important effect on private residential investment and can be useful indicators of demand pressures in the economy. On the other hand, the thrust of the economic decision-making and the planning process has shifted from macro- to microlevel. For that reasons, there is a growing demand from the policy planners and from private companies for accurate local-area estimates of average transaction price of houses. Due to the lack of these statistics, proper monitoring of the real estate market and its impact on the economy, and as well as formulating, implementing and evaluating of regional economic policies, are likely to suffer. So, this application intends to show that it is possible to provide reliable estimates of average transaction price of houses by square metre for small geographical areas (domains), using data collected from a longitudinal survey conducted by the Portuguese Statistical Office. This national survey, the “Transaction House Prices Survey” (THPS), is a quarterly survey providing individual house prices for the effective transactions in a sample. However, real time-series data from the THPS only allow the production of reliable direct estimates for the average transaction price of houses at national level and for broad geographical regions called NUTSII. In fact, the THPS sample sizes are very small or even zero in many other domains of interest (NUTSIII or municipalities).Footnote 1 For these unplanned domains with small sample sizes, direct estimators are either not feasible or provide unacceptably large coefficients of variation. Indeed, the use of small area estimation techniques is an obvious solution to this problem. Small area estimation techniques are gaining popularity worldwide because there is a growing demand for obtaining precise estimates in domains where the size of the sample is small or even zero. These domains are often called small areas, and they usually correspond to small geographic areas, such as municipalities or other administrative divisions. In general, sample sizes are defined in order to provide reliable estimates for the country or for large regions. However, statistical methods used to estimate parameters for these large domains can rarely be used in small domains because traditional design-based estimators lead to unacceptable large coefficient of variation or even they cannot be calculated because the lack of sample in some unplanned domains of interest. In this case, the estimation problem is solved by indirect estimation. A particular type of indirect estimators frequently used in this context is the model-based estimators, which borrow information from related small areas or past time periods, apart from that given by auxiliary variables. The main idea of model-based estimators is to use explicit or implicit models that connect the different domains by means of auxiliary information available from previous studies or obtained from different sources, in order to increase the effective sample size and thus accuracy. Depending on whether this information is available for every unit or only for the domains of interest, models will be formulated at unit or area level, respectively. Ghosh and Rao (1994), Pfeffermann (2002), Rao (2003) and Jiang and Lahiri (2006) give an account of different model-based techniques to accomplish small area estimation tasks. One of the most popular techniques is based on explicit linear mixed models (LMM) that provides a link to a related small area through the use of supplementary data. The empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) approach, using Henderson’s method (Henderson 1975), is the most widely used technique for estimating small area parameters of interest. In this approach, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of the small area is first produced using the general theory of Henderson (1975), and then, the unknown variance components are estimated by a standard method (e.g., ANOVA, maximum likelihood, restricted maximum likelihood). The resultant BLUP with estimated variance components is known as an EBLUP of the true small area parameter of interest. Readers interested in learning more about small area estimation techniques and its applications are referred to Rao (2003) and the papers cited therein. This paper deals with small area estimators under the following area-level linear mixed models via EBLUP estimation: the Fay–Herriot model, a spatial model, a temporal model and a spatio-temporal model. All these models make use of explicit linking models based on random area-specific effects that take into account the between-area variation beyond that is explained by auxiliary variables included in the fixed part of the model. The most well-known model is due to Fay and Herriot (1979). The Fay–Herriot model is used to improve the efficiency of the direct estimators using cross-sectional data. Furthermore, this model is the basic model when auxiliary data at the unit level are not available or there are confidentiality reasons preventing their use, and then only aggregated data at the small area level can be used. Although the Fay–Herriot model borrows strength from other small areas through a linear relationship between the target parameter of interest and some auxiliary variables, it assumes independent random area-specific effects. However, in many applications, small areas boundaries are arbitrary and there appears to be no good reason why geographically close units from different areas should not be correlated. So, it should be reasonable to assume correlated random area effects among neighbour small areas (Cressie 1991; Salvati 2004; Petrucci and Salvati 2006). This idea was considered by Salvati (2004) who developed a model with spatially correlated random area-specific effects following a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) process, in order to borrow information from other small areas. Both models mentioned above only use cross-sectional data at a given point in time. However, longitudinal surveys are increasingly used presently. Thus, it might also be useful to use time-series and cross-sectional models to take advantage of data at other time points in order to strengthen the estimators. Rao and Yu (1994) gave a simple way of borrowing information cross-sectionally and over time by introducing a model containing both contemporary random effects and time-varying effects following a first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] process. Recently, it was proposed a spatio-temporal linear mixed model involving spatially correlated and temporally autocorrelated random effects (Pereira 2009; SAMPLE Project 2010). This model takes advantage of both the possible spatial similarities among small areas and the expected time-series relationships of the data in order to improve the efficiency of the small area estimators. The aim of this paper is to provide viable ways of estimating regional house prices in disaggregated administrative areas with small sample sizes, using statistical tools that are simple and reliable at the same time. This is particularly important in the real world when we need to estimate a large number of parameters in a limited time. In the application that we present, we use real data from the THPS and the “Bank Evaluation of House Prices Survey” (BEHPS), which are longitudinal surveys conducted by the Portuguese Statistical Office. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some design and model-based estimators for small areas. The real application is detailed in Sect. 3, where we describe the data, present the exploratory analysis and show the results of the estimation of house prices. Finally, some concluding remarks are made in Sect. 4.",2

In the late 1990s, a group at the University of Queensland began a program of research using GIS tools to integrate data on voting patterns at elections in Australia with the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of local area populations (Davis and Stimson 1998; Stimson et al. 2006, 2007; Shyy et al. 2007; Stimson and Shyy 2009). Their interest was in mapping the spatial patterns of voter support for political parties, exploring the ecological correlations between spatial variations in voter support for a political party and the characteristics of local areas, and developing typologies of socio-political landscapes across Australia’s major cities and its non-metropolitan regions. That research effort culminated in the development of a GIS-enabled e-research facility (Liao et al. 2009)Footnote 1 enabling anyone to access on-line integrated spatial databases relating to: levels of voter support for political parties at federal elections in Australia at the spatially disaggregated level of scale of local polling booths, and variables derived from census data on the demographic and socio-economic characteristic of populations living in local polling booth catchments. Those data may be interrogated to: visualise the spatial patterns of voter support for political parties at a local area level of scale integrate those voting data with the demographic and socio-economic data derived from the census for local areas conduct on-line statistical and spatial modelling to investigate the ecological relationships between those local voting data and local census data variables, and to develop typologies of voter support for political parties, which are akin to socio-political landscapes. Aanalysis of voting data can be undertaken across the nation as a whole, for a specific State or Territory, for a specific Electoral Division, or for a specific metropolitan region. This paper provides an overview of how that e-research facility can be used to interrogate the data bases on voter support for political parties at the 2007 federal election with small area demographic and socio-economic data from the 2006 census.",3
50.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,07 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-012-0514-4,Does immigration induce “native flight” from public schools?,April 2013,Christer Gerdes,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In their study, Betts and Fairlie (2003) coined the expression “native flight,” denoting the tendency of native-born US-Americans to abandon public schools for private alternatives following an increase in immigration shares in their home communities. That study was the first to focus on the impact of immigration on school choice, thereby extending the literature that so far mainly had focused on the interplay of minority groups and school choice, such as the share of Afro-Americans or Hispanics; see for example Fairlie and Resch (2002). The present study aims to study if there is evidence of “native flight” in a somewhat different setting. For more than a century, in Denmark privately operated schools have provided a real alternative to regular public schools. According to recent figures from the Ministry of Education, about 13 % of children in the age group 5–16 attended privately operated schools in Denmark. Noteworthy is that these so called “free schools” are recognized and entitled to “government financing regardless of the ideological, religious, political or ethnic motivation behind their establishment,” see Danish Ministry of Education (2008a). In practice, this means that free schools receive predetermined amounts of tax money for every pupil they enroll. Stated differently, while in most Western countries access to other educational forms than regular public schools has been restricted to certain (well-off) families, in Denmark the option of choosing among different educational forms has been an option for larger parts of its population for a long period of time. Such coexistence of public and privately operated school alternatives under the roof of a tax-funded educational system provides a solid base for a study on “native flight.” In particular, this follows from that large-scale immigration has been a rather recent incident in Denmark, which facilitates to study how parents consider privately operated schools as their preferred choice when confronted with the prospect of having their children to associate with peers of immigrant background. There are several reasons motivating this study. First, the issue of “native flight” relates to studies that aim to evaluate the impact of free choice on educational outcomes.Footnote 1 Most studies concerned with the consequences of school choice are addressing educational outcomes, not least to examine the scope for efficiency gains arising from competition between schools. However, when looking at educational achievements of pupils in different schools, it is important to resolve the mechanisms that underlie decisions on school choice per se. In particular, if there would be an increased tendency of abandoning public schools following an influx of pupils with a different ethnic background, this would question one underlying assumption made by advocates of free school choice, namely that parents are primarily concerned with educational standards.Footnote 2 By addressing the native flight issue within a voucher-based educational system (explained more in detail in the next section), this study relates to a large literature on the effectiveness of school vouchers for educational outcomes; see for example, Ladd (2002) and references given there.Footnote 3 Another factor to motivate this study regards the aspect of integration of immigrant groups into the host country by means of its educational system. Not the least, education will precondition their propensity to assimilate and integrate into the labor market. See for example, Clark and Lindley (2009) for a recent study on the impact of pre-labor market assimilation in the UK. In their study, Betts and Fairlie look at the changes in private school attendance rates within 132 metropolitan areas using US Census data for the years 1980 and 1990.Footnote 4 The present study has a similar approach in the way it looks at changes occurring over time across regions. One advantage with the present study is that all years in the period 1992–2004 can be studied, rather than only 2 years. In addition, the influx of pupils with immigrant background to different areas has to some extent been determined by exogenous events, as will be discussed in subsequent sections. This allows for an analysis well suited for examining the interplay of school choice and immigration.Footnote 5 One drawback of this study in comparison with the one by Betts and Fairlie (2003) is that the aggregated data used here do not allow for the control of individual-level characteristics, such as parents’ education and household income. As to its empirical approach, this study is also comparable to Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) in that it focuses on municipalities as “proxies for educational markets” (p. 1486).Footnote 6
 The main results from the present study point in the same direction as the Betts and Fairlie (2003) study, revealing an increase in the number of native pupils enrolled in non-public schools following an influx of immigrants. What can explain such positive correlations between immigration shares and private school attendance rates in Denmark? Betts and Fairlie (2003) put forward arguments that relate to rational behavior, as well as “irrational preferences.” The previous point builds on the view that teachers may have to focus more on children who require special attention, so that overall educational standards might fall as more immigrant children enter the class.Footnote 7 A similar argument would be that more school resources have to be directed toward immigrant groups. Also, a school’s ethnic composition might work as an indicator for school quality. In case there would be more objective information on school quality, the importance of ethnic diversity might receive less weight, as argued by Tedin and Weiher (2004). This suggests that one policy implication would be to provide better information on the education standards of schools, as well as providing schools with a more heterogeneous student population with additional means to hire more and specially trained teachers. Also, in the evaluation of schools there should be an ambition to net out the impact of peer effects, as otherwise schools could engage in cream-skimming pupils with favorable social background rather than providing better education quality.Footnote 8
 The paper unfolds as follows. In the next Sect. 1 discuss some aspects regarding the Danish school system, especially the institutional setup of its free school system. This is followed by a theoretic discussion on measuring private school attendance rate on the aggregated level, as well as some descriptives on school choice. Section 4 presents the data and the outcomes from regression estimations. Section 5 concludes.",15

Almost 250 years later, the discussion continues. Robert Lucas noted, “Once you start thinking about economic growth, it’s hard to think about anything else”. By all means, in this paper, I want to examine the contributions of cities. I will try to show that simply calling them the “engines of growth” or places where “creative people” go is not adequate. Cities exist because they facilitate the formation of supply chains, including the human supply chains that spawn ideas. But to do all this, cities must be allowed to form propitious spatial arrangements. Economist Landsburg (2007) framed the growth question this way: Modern humans first emerged about 100,000 years ago. For the next 99,800 years or so, nothing happened. Well, not quite nothing. There were wars, political intrigue, the invention or agriculture – but none of that stuff had much effect on the quality of people’s lives. Almost everyone lived on the modern equivalent of $ 400 to $ 600 a year, just above the subsistence level. True there were always aristocracies who lived far better, but numerically, they were quite insignificant \(\ldots \)
 And (in 2011): Just five generations ago, the average American worked 60 hours a week, took no vacations, and earned less than the modern-day equivalent of $ 6,000 a year, He or she rarely traveled more than a few miles from home, had no central heat or running water, and died at age 50. How did all this happen? Do we have big answers to big questions? Nasr (2011) rightly called the discussion The Grand Pursuit, a topic that has preoccupied many smart people for many years. Ferguson (2011) recently boiled it down to his famous “six killer apps”. They are as follows: Competition—political (between states) as well as economic Science—a way of studying and learning Property rights—the rule of law Medicine—the science that made health and life possible The consumer society—the source of demand The work ethic—a moral and cultural framework Is anything missing? I will argue that it is the role of cities—and how they become congenial to creativity and entrepreneurial discovery; how their evolving forms support networks that facilitate supply chains—including the less formal but essential and complex supply chains that prompt and nurture good ideas. It is important to emphasize “evolving” because where there are complex arrangements, error-correction opportunities are essential.",8

D. Hewings,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The impact of an aging population on the economy is one of the key issues in most developed countries. In particular, the dependency ratioFootnote 1 of the US is expected to rise rapidly until the mid-2030s. Table 1 shows that the ratio in the US is projected to increase from 19 % in 2004 to 33 % in 2035 and then level off at around 33 %. The growth of the dependency ratio is projected to peak in 2025 and then it slows down (Fig. 1). This change of trend reflects the impact of “baby boomers,” born in the post-World War II period (1946–1964), who will be approaching retirement age sequentially over the next two decades; the oldest baby boomers turn 60 in the late 2000s and the youngest turn 60 in the late 2020s. The state of IllinoisFootnote 2 also shows similar trends except that the dependency ratio of Illinois is anticipated to be lower than the national ratio (see Table 1). Growth of the dependency ratio for the U.S An aging population could cause negative effects on the economy, including a decrease in per-capita output and economic welfare, mainly due to declines in the labor force supply and savings rate: The dissaving of the older populations should increasingly offset the saving of the younger generations during the aging era. Therefore, it becomes important to forecast the impacts of an aging population on the economy and to assess the policy options that governments might have to adopt to address the challenge. A two-sector overlapping generation (OLG) model is developed to capture the impact of population aging on Illinois and to compare the effectiveness of government policy within an endogenous growth perspective. The endogenous growth model has attempted to endogenize the underlying source of sustained growth. In the case of a two-sector endogenous growth model, the production of human capital is supposed to be relatively intensive in human capital. Consequently, each individual’s education activity plays a key role in economic growth. For example, in the Uzawa (1965) model, there is no physical capital involved in the production of human capital, while in the Lucas (1988) model, the total factor productivity in the final goods sector depends on the average level of human capital in an economy. Sadahiro and Shimasawa (2002) developed the OLG model based on two-sector endogenous growth theory in order to project the effects of population aging on the economy. They endogenized the individual’s choice in human capital investment at the workplace and found out that endogenously determined investment in human capital offsets significantly the negative effects of an aging population. However, they did not apply their model to an actual population structure; they also paid little attention to the role of government policy. Ludwig et al. (2007) extended the Sadahiro and Shimasawa (2002) paper with different formations of human capital accumulation and two of these will be addressed in the present paper. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the model description and the numerical algorithm. In Sect. 3, the computational results of the baseline model are presented, comparing the outcomes with a one-sector OLG model that does not take endogenous growth of human capital into consideration (this kind of model will be referred to as an “exogenous model” later). In Sect. 4, the government’s policy to address the negative effects of an aging population on the regional economy will be simulated. The final section will draw conclusion and briefly discuss further research opportunities.",10

New economic geography (NEG) models use a combination of increasing returns, transport costs, and factor mobility to describe the formation and persistence of agglomerations as an endogenous process rather than a result of pure first nature differentials. They recognize the optimizing behavior of economic agents as the rationale behind regional patterns of population and industrial density. The classical model has been proposed by Krugman (1991) and was canonized in Fujita et al. (1999). Since then, it has been varied and extended in many different ways.Footnote 1
 Another empirical regularity is profound employment and/or unemployment differentials between regions, even if those regions are in close proximity and face a comparable institutional setting. It seems natural to expect that both regional patterns are driven by the same or at least closely related forces. For example, Südekum (2005) shows that, evaluated at the NUTS-2 level, densely populated European regions tend to have lower unemployment rates than peripheral ones. In recent years, economic theorists have tried to incorporate imperfect labor markets into the NEG framework to learn more about the connection between agglomeration forces and labor market differentials.Footnote 2 There have been two main ways to attain that goal. One strand of the literature concentrates on industrial clustering while not allowing for interregional labor mobility. This assumption is appropriate if migration is considered being negligible.Footnote 3 When explicitly including unemployment,Footnote 4 the result is a negative relationship between industrial agglomeration and the local unemployment rate (see Francis 2003). As a drawback, these models cannot account for endogenous regional differentials in population densities. The second class of models allows for regional migration. One example is the model by Südekum (2005), who introduces efficiency wages to an analytically solvable agglomeration model. This results in a stable wage curve relation that is even intensified by migration.Footnote 5 Another approach is by Epifani and Gancia (2005), who model regional unemployment by introducing search frictions to a dynamic NEG framework. In both cases, the equilibrium outcome is again higher unemployment in the periphery.Footnote 6
 Yet, the empirical pattern just mentioned does not necessarily hold for more disaggregated data in a national context. For example, Table 1 presents in its first column the standardized coefficients of a regression of regional unemployment rates on log population densities for the largest European countries plus the United States and Japan in 2005.Footnote 7 It shows unemployment rates to be significantly higher in densely populated areas in West Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Footnote 8 The correlation is also positive but not significant at the 5 %—level for Spain and Japan, where the number of territorial units is smaller. This pattern is not new to the economic literature. The formal analysis of higher unemployment in urban compared to rural areas at least goes back to the work of Harris and Todaro (1970). It is also the decisive feature of the “spatial mismatch” literature, which emerged to explain high unemployment in the cores of US cities (see Gobillon et al. 2003, for an overview). The goal of this article is to show how such a pattern can result as an equilibrium outcome in a NEG model. The paper introduces job search frictions into a geographical general equilibrium framework.Footnote 9 Firms seeking new workers have to bear certain costs until a vacancy can be filled. These costs are linked to the local wage level by assuming that some additional workers are needed to carry out the searching. In the model, regional wage effects created by the well-known agglomeration and dispersion forces affect expected returns in the bargaining process, thus having feedback effects on wage formation and leading to unemployment differentials. It is shown that job search costs can result in both lower or higher unemployment in agglomerations. When transport costs are high, demand is mainly local and fierce competition in a core region drives down nominal wages thus bringing them closer to replacement benefits and increasing unemployment. This is only a long-run equilibrium as long as transport costs are not too high, which would lead to complete dispersion of economic activity. When transport costs are low, strong supply and demand linkages in the core induce a nominal wage advantage and thus a lower unemployment rate. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the basic model. Section 3 states the short-run equilibrium conditions for the multi-region case. Section 4 shows some illustrative simulations in a two-region model, performs a sensitivity analysis, and discusses the results. Section 5 concludes.",7

Until the late 1970s, based on heavy-industry-oriented development strategy and the consideration of national security, most manufacturing enterprises are designed to locate dispersedly across regions. This mandatory fragmentation of domestic market leads to remarkable similarities in regions’ economic structure. Since 1980s, policymakers shifted their attention to the promotion of high-tech industries, aiming to upgrade traditional manufacturing and rejuvenate export by making full use science and high technology. In 1988, the State Council of China officially approved “Torch Program” as a national guideline for accelerating the development of high-tech industries. Following central government’s plan, local governments are committed to develop high-tech industries through various approaches such as high-tech-oriented export policies, subsides to high-tech-related activities and establishment of high-tech industrial bases. In addition to these promotion policies, local protectionism also plays an important role in the geographic distribution of industries. Recent studies on China’s manufacturing in the post-reform period have provided evidence of the negative impact of local protectionism on regional concentration of industries (Li et al. 2003; Bai et al. 2004; Lu and Tao 2009; Ge 2009). China’s reform on central planned economy has led to both administrative and fiscal decentralization (Zheng 2007; Golley 2002). This, in turn, gives local governments not only more authorities but also more incentives to pursuit more tax revenues by protecting local manufacturing (Poncet 2003). This paper focuses exclusively on China’s high-tech industries, which have obtained great concerns and supports from both central and local governments in recent decades, and attempts to address two related empirical issues. First, we calculate the dissimilarity indices to investigate trends and changes in high-tech industrial specialization and regional concentration during the period 1996–2005. We find both specialization and concentration increase significantly at nation level. In particular, we find a widening gap of industrial structure between coastal and inland regions, while the whole high-tech industry sector becomes increasingly concentrated in coastal regions. The second issue addressed in this paper concerns the role of various economic policies in the distribution of high-tech industries across regions. Using a dynamic panel approach, we are able to evaluate the dynamic impact of economic policies on specialization and concentration while controlling for other driving forces proposed by theories (e.g., knowledge resources and transport costs). In addition, we choose system Generalized Method of Moments method (system GMM), which allows us to solve the endogeneity of lagged variables and to obtain unbiased and consistent estimation results. The estimation result indicates that the implementation of high-tech-oriented export policy and subsidy for science and high technology activities have positive effects, whereas local governments’ protection for local high-tech industries decreases the degrees of specialization and concentration. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we briefly review the literature on the determinants of specialization and regional concentration of industries from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. In Sect. 3, we describe the measures and data applied in this paper. Then, we investigate the degrees of industrial specialization and regional concentration of high-tech industries. In Sect. 4, using a dynamic panel approach, we empirically examine the impact of economic policies on specialization by controlling for other driving forces proposed by theories. The conclusion and some policy suggestions are proposed in Sect. 5.",21

Braid,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many authors, starting with Hotelling (1929), consider the equilibrium locations of two or more firms (or stores) on a uniformly populated unit interval that can be interpreted as a roadway segment, when firms sell a single product that is homogeneous except for location, and each consumer has a completely inelastic demand for the product. In the basic case of this paper, I assume that consumers are spread uniformly along two intersecting roadways, out to a finite distance along each of the four roadway segments radiating from the central intersection. Furthermore, I assume that there are a total of five stores: One store is at the central intersection, and one store is on each radial segment. Hotelling (1929) was the first spatial model to assume (in modern terminology) a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, with locations chosen in the long run (the first stage), and price competition in the short run (the second stage). Subsequent models usually assume this too, but different papers have different types of price competition in the price subgame. Hotelling (1929) assumed two firms (spatial duopoly), and he also assumed mill pricing, which means that all consumers who go to a firm pay the same price, and that consumers bear transportation (travel) costs. Hotelling and many subsequent papers assume that an endogenous mill price is chosen by each firm and that there is a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium in mill prices. Mill pricing is probably the most important type of spatial pricing, both in the real world and also in the literature (but other types of spatial pricing are also important). Mill pricing applies to retail stores since each store sets a price that applies to all consumers, and consumers bear the costs of traveling to stores and transporting goods home. Mill pricing can also be important when firms produce varieties that are differentiated in a product characteristics space. There are problems with the existence of a price equilibrium (and consequently also a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium) when transportation costs are linear in distance, including the two-firm model of Hotelling (1929) and the multi-firm model of Economides (1993).Footnote 1
 In order to avoid these problems, d’Aspremont et al. (1979) assume that transportation costs are proportional to distance squared.Footnote 2 They assume that firms are constrained to locate on the unit interval [0, 1], over which consumers are spread, and show that the equilibrium locations are maximally differentiated at (0, 1). Subsequent work with an “unconstrained model” (Anderson et al. 1992, pp. 298–299; Lambertini (1994); Lambertini (1997); Tabuchi and Thisse (1995)) shows that if firms are allowed to locate outside of [\(0, 1\)], then the equilibrium locations are (\(-0.25, 1.25\)). The equilibrium and socially optimal locations of firms can be compared. In models where each consumer has a completely inelastic demand, the socially optimal locations of firms are those that minimize total transportation costs. With constrained or unconstrained firm locations (as defined above), the equilibrium locations are much more decentralized than the socially optimal locations, which are well known (since Hotelling 1929) and are easily shown to be (0.25, 0.75). The model can be extended from two to three firms along a unit interval. The equilibrium locations are (1/8, 1/2, 7/8), as described briefly by (Neven (1987), p. 426). This is also equivalent to one of the results in DeGraba (1987). These locations are somewhat more decentralized than the socially optimal locations, which are well known to be (1/6, 1/2, 5/6). In the basic model in my paper, I assume that there is a central intersection and that n finite roadway segments, each of length 1, radiate outward from the center. There is one store at the central intersection, and one store on each radial segment. I assume that transportation costs are proportional to distance squared. If \(n = 2\), then my model is equivalent to a case described in Neven (1987), and reasonably similar to the main case in DeGraba (1987), so that (once the unit interval is transformed to an interval of length 2, with 0 as the central location) the firm on each of the two radial segments locates (in equilibrium) at distance 3/4 from the center, which is greater than the socially optimal distance from the center, which is 2/3. Of particular interest is the case in which \(n = 4\) (four radial roadway segments), corresponding to the real-world situation in which a small urban area might have residents spread out along two intersecting main roadways for some finite distance. Braid (1989) considered many firms distributed over two intersecting infinite roadways, with linear transportation costs, and showed that there is no subgame-perfect set of equilibrium locations.Footnote 3 In this paper, I assume intersecting finite roadways and transportation costs that are proportional to distance squared, and I derive an explicit subgame-perfect set of equilibrium locations. I show that the store on each radial segment is closer to the central intersection (at distance 5/9) than the socially optimal distance (which is 2/3). Results are also derived for \(n = 3\) and for \({n}>4\). Sections 2–4 derive the results stated above. Section 2 describes basic assumptions and presents the very simple derivation of the socially optimal locations. Section 3 derives the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium mill prices for given locations, and Sect. 4 then derives the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium locations. Section 5 considers a variation of the model in which local and national firms sell a differentiated product in different cities. Section 6 varies the analysis by assuming that there is spatial price discrimination and a Nash equilibrium in delivered price schedules. In this case, the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium locations of firms on intersecting roadways are the same as the socially optimal locations. Section 7 considers a more complicated system of intersecting roadways. Section 8 considers more than one firm on each roadway segment. In both sections, the equilibrium locations of peripheral firms are closer to the center than is socially optimal. Section 9 mentions other possible variations and extensions of the model.",7
50.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,15 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-012-0517-1,Foreign labor and regional labor markets: aggregate and disaggregate impact on growth and wages in Danish regions,June 2013,Torben Dall Schmidt,Peter Sandholt Jensen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the period from 1997 to 2006, employment of foreign labor in Denmark increased from 3.6 % of total employment to around 6 %. As a consequence, Danish regions have experienced substantial increases in the employment of foreign labor.Footnote 1 We focus on the case of Denmark for a number of reasons. Firstly, as recently pointed out by Malchow-Møller et al. (2011a:p.8), Denmark is “one of the European countries that has experienced the strongest relative increase in the employment of immigrants.” Secondly, the case of Denmark allows us to analyze the impact of foreign labor on regional labor markets even if this group is not dominant in regional labor forces. Thirdly, recent panel evidence for European countries in Angrist and Kugler (2003) suggests that institutions may matter and that the effect of foreign labor is larger in countries with “rigid” institutions. In that respect, Denmark is a small homogeneous country with flexible labor market institutions and relatively low hire and fire costs known as a “Flexicurity system”; see, e.g., Albæk et al. (2002) or Schmidt (2008a) for details. We study the impact of foreign workers on (1) total regional employment growth allowing us to study the consequences for native labor and (2) real wage growth in the context of Danish regions. Theory suggests (e.g., Card 2001, 2007; Wagner 2009; D’Amuri et al. 2010) that increased immigration inflows could have positive growth effects for total employment. The effect depends on how employment opportunities of native workers are affected by the increase in foreign workers. The theoretical arguments rely on substitution and scale effects. As more foreign workers enter a region, their wages are driven down leading firms to substitute foreign labor for native labor for a given level of output.Footnote 2 This effect is referred to as the substitution effect. Foreign labor may, therefore, crowd out native labor one for one leading to a zero growth effect on regional employment. Fong and Lim (1982) note that when native and foreign labors are close substitutes, the former will experience reduced job opportunities. Wagner (2009) observes that under certain assumptions, the increased inflows of foreign labor lead to lower costs of production, and given a negative elasticity of product demand, firms will expand production. This in turn will lead to a higher demand for native labor, which is referred to as the scale effect.
 Scale effects may also arise from alternative mechanisms that increase productivity without lowering wages. First, Felbermayr et al. (2010) present evidence for a positive causal effect of immigration on GDP per capita as, for example a result of higher or complementary human capital among new foreign workers. New foreign workers may contribute to higher productivity in this way. In line with this Malchow-Møller et al. (2011b) demonstrate that Danish firms hiring foreign experts become more productive. Second, for the case of German regions, Niebuhr (2010:p.582) concludes that “cultural diversity might indeed matter for innovation activity.” Third, Audretsch et al. (2010) present evidence that the diversity of people is more conducive to entrepreneurship. Since inflows of foreign labor lead to more cultural diversity, the scale effect could arise from these two latter channels conducive to productivity. Finally, Fong and Lim (1982) point to a fourth theoretical mechanism behind the scale effect. They argue that inflows of foreign workers relieve sectoral labor shortages, which would otherwise slow down economic growth. Thus, a number of different mechanisms render the possibility that foreign labor crowd in native labor. Previous literature has produced inconclusive evidence on the employment and wage effects of foreign labor on natives. Moreover, these results suggest everything from a negative to a positive effect for both employment and wages. Good summaries of results can be found in Longhi et al. (2006) for the case of employment effects and in Longhi et al. (2005) for the case of wage effects. For the case of employment effects, Longhi et al. (2006) analyze 9 studies with a total of 165 estimated effects using meta-analysis. The consensus estimate obtained by Longhi et al. (2006) is small and negative. More recent studies such as D’Amuri et al. (2010) and Carrasco et al. (2008) reach the conclusion that there is no detectable negative effect. For the case of wage effects, Longhi et al. (2005) carry out a meta-study of 18 studies with a total of 348 estimates of the effect. The 18 studies include the classic paper of Borjas (2003) which suggested negative wage effects. Still, Longhi et al. (2005) show that the estimates cluster around zero. This is related to the native migration response to immigration leading to small wage effects in Borjas (2006b). Further, the more recent studies such as D’Amuri et al. (2010) and Carrasco et al. (2008) suggest very little econometric evidence of a negative effect on wages. This paper contributes on two general issues to the previous literature. A first issue is the extent to which the effect of foreign labor on wages crucially depends on labor market institutions. In a flexible labor market, increased use of foreign labor would usually be expected to lower wages (e.g., De New and Zimmermann 1994; Pischke and Velling 1997; Friedberg 2001; Ottaviano and Peri 2005, 2006, 2008). The extent to which there is a negative effect on wage growth also depends on the degree to which native and foreign labor are substitutes (Fong and Lim 1982; Wagner 2009). Previous contributions have studied this for a number of countries, while we offer evidence for Denmark representing a small homogenous labor market of 2.8 million employed persons in 2006 with a spatially uniform set of regulations within the context of a “Flexicurity system”. In D’Amuri et al. (2010), it is conjectured that moving from Germany to a more flexible system may be important for the impact of foreign labor. Germany is perceived as a less flexible labor market relative to Denmark; see, e.g., Schmidt (2008a) or OECD (2004). This conjecture is here examined based on a flexible labor market system in Denmark. Also, the analysis is taken to a regional level, which is rarely seen in the literature with one exception being Carrasco et al. (2008). A second issue is the origins of substitution and scale effects with respect to qualitative aspects of labor and sector specific regional variation. The importance of skill levels may unfold differently across regions; see Gries et al. (2011). Similarly, educational attainment and training may matter for regional development and unemployment making an inflow of specific skills potentially important; see Mollick and Mora (2012) or Nistor (2009).Footnote 3 In the context of foreign labor, skill levels (Borjas 2006a, b; Borjas et al. 2008) and sector-specific elasticities of product demand (Wagner 2009) may be important for the growth effect of foreign labor. One possibility is of course that the effect of foreign labor is neutral, for example, when foreigners become employed in low-skill jobs that native workers are unwilling to perform (Fong and Lim 1982) and at the same time foreign labor relieve sector-specific labor shortages leading to a scale effect that improve employment conditions for native workers. In this situation, the degree of substitutability between foreign and native labor is nearly zero. This could also be interpreted in the context of dual labor markets (Doeringer and Piore 1971; Vietorisz and Harrison 1973). We, therefore, also consider the effects of foreign labor in different sectors, by skill levels and by foreign background. To quantify the impact of an inflow of foreign labor on regional employment growth and regional wage growth, we offer a panel study using data from 15 Danish counties covering the period from 1997 to 2006. The regional variation is substantial as the smallest region has 19,169 employed persons in 2006, while the largest has 370,787 employed persons in the same year. The mean level for the regions was 183,115 employed persons. We also present results based on a data set of 270 muni-cipalities to study long-term impacts. The municipal variation is unsurprisingly larger than the regional variation. The smallest municipality had 878 employed persons, whereas the largest municipality had 331,746 in 2006. The mean level for municipalities was 24,883 employed persons. Thus, we focus on considerably smaller regional labor markets than Carrasco et al. (2008). Further, the importance of spatial dependence for the results is discussed and spatial lags are included in the analysis of the municipal data. We focus on employment and wages by location of workplace. The Danish data allow us to divide regional employment into three subcategories: (1) native employment, (2) employment of persons with a WesternFootnote 4 background and (3) employment of persons with a non-Western background. The sum of (2) and (3) is what we refer to as foreign labor. While origin may capture a general form of labor market skills and competences, we also consider specific occupational types of foreign labor reflecting labor market skills more directly. Furthermore, results are also provided for eight different sectors. The analysis will, therefore, allow for regional heterogeneity in backgrounds of foreign labor, skill levels and sector of employment. A potential problem arises from spatial sorting, leading foreign workers to seek employment where overall job growth is high. The IV estimator allows us to identify the causal effect of foreign labor. We, therefore, implement both an OLS and an IV estimator. The choice of instrument is based on the hypothesis that social networks matter for the job search and matching of foreign workers, see Schmidt and Jensen (2012). Higher initial shares of foreign employment would indicate a stronger presence of networks of foreign labor, which would attract more foreign labor through strong networks. Unlike many studies, we utilize a set of different instruments allowing for varying degrees of persistence. Our baseline instrument is the regional share of foreign labor in employment in 1997, which is an approach similar to previous contributions in the literature. Given some degree of persistence of regional economic shocks, we also use the 1985, 1990 and 1995 distributions of populations as alternative instruments. The point estimates for general regional employment suggest that the scale effect dominates the substitution effect, that is, an increased inflow of foreign labor brings more jobs to native labor in a given region. Once we divide foreign labor into Western and non-Western backgrounds, our evidence suggests a dominance of the scale effect for Western labor. It does, however, become difficult to estimate the effects for Western labor precisely when using IV. The IV estimates suggest that increased inflows of both Western and non-Western labor do not have a significant effect on wages. Thus, we find little evidence of an effect on regional wage growth. This may be interpreted in the context of sluggish wages in Denmark (Risager 1992). The OLS results indicate scale effects for three occupational types, while the IV results do not. Using occupation as a measure of skill, this lends mixed support to the importance of skill (Borjas 2006a, b; Borjas et al. 2008), which is interpreted in the context of specific characteristics of the Danish labor market system. Results for eight sectors suggest important scale effects in construction and private services. The most pronounced scale effects are seen in transport services and construction, while there are also indications of scale effects in retail and wholesale trade and financial services. Assuming different elasticities of product demand over sectors, the findings also support the different sectoral effects of foreign labor (Wagner 2009). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief overview of recent trends in regional employment of foreign labor in Danish regional labor markets, while Sect. 3 sets out the empirical strategy. In Sect. 4, we report the results. In Sect. 5, we conclude and put the results into a broader perspective with respect to institutional prerequisites and the importance of underlying dynamics concerning background, skill level and sector.",4

While the directions of the ensuing research have been numerous to put it mildly, one branch focuses on the spatial setting and, within that, on spatial price discrimination (McAfee et al. 1992; Reitzes and Levy 1995; Gupta et al. 1997; Rothschild et al. 2000; Rothschild et al. 2007; Heywood et al. 2001; Monaco et al. 2004). We add to this branch by introducing for the first time a two-stage entry game into a previous model in which firms locate in anticipation of subsequent merger. The canonical model of two merging firms and one excluded rival yields dramatically different implications following this introduction. Simultaneous entry in spatial price discrimination generates the first-best outcome of symmetric locations along a line segment (Lederer and Hurter 1986). In typical models with inelastic demand, unanticipated mergers that follow location choices have no consequence on welfare (Reitzes and Levy 1995). As the original location choices are efficient, the merger increases profit but causes no inefficiency as the profit simply represents a transfer from consumer surplus. Far more interesting has been the study of firms that anticipate prior to their location choice that a subsequent merger may occur. Two adjacent firms that are potential merger partners after location move toward each other as each maximizes the sum of its own profit without merger and its share of the additional profit associated with the (perhaps probabilistic) merger (Gupta et al. 1997). As long as this profit is greater than what each adjacent firm would receive without merger, these locations in anticipation of merger represent the equilibrium and deviate from first best. Thus, in models of spatial price discrimination, the anticipated possibility of merger after location generates welfare inefficiency whenever such mergers are profitable to both firms (Gupta et al. 1997; Rothschild et al. 2000; Heywood et al. 2001 and Monaco et al. 2004). We emphasize that this conclusion of inefficiency resulting from merger assumes the absence of relocation following merger (Posada and Straume 2004), the absence of cost efficiencies associated with merger (Farrell and Shapiro 1990), and assumes that all firms locate simultaneously.Footnote 1 In what follows we reconsider the canonical model of spatial price discrimination with three firms, two that merge and one that is an excluded rival. Indeed, we follow Rothschild et al. (2000) in all particulars other than that we allow for a simple two- or three-stage entry of the firms prior to the possibility of merger. This modification is worthy of investigation as sequential location without any possibility of merger generates inefficient locations in spatial price discrimination. The early movers use their timing advantage to gain a disproportionate market share eliminating the symmetric locations associated with simultaneous location (Prescott and Visscher 1977, Gupta 1992). At issue in our paper is how this timing advantage interacts with the known tendency of adjacent firms to move toward each other in anticipation of merger. While both merger and sequential entry on their own generate deviations from first best locations, the welfare implication of the combination has not been previously examined. It stands as an interesting application of the second best to investigate whether the possibility of merger continues to harm welfare in a model of sequential location.Footnote 2
 We consider all four timing possibilities associated with two potential merger participants and one excluded rival in a two-stage location game. The excluded rival can be the lone leader or the lone follower. The excluded rival can be one of a pair of leaders or a pair of followers. Among the interesting results, we show that when the excluded rival locates first, it can exploit the need of the other two firms to be adjacent in order to merge. This allows it to capture an even larger market share than would a leader without the possibility of merger and generates even lower welfare. Yet, with the exception of this case, the possibility of merger can actually increase welfare, and in one of the timings, it can only increase welfare. The general pattern we show is that as the strategic entry advantage of the excluded firm declines, the range of welfare enhancing mergers increases. We also show that these results carry over to a three-stage location game. Thus, the result from the simultaneous entry case that merger possibility reduces welfare certainly does not carry over to a sequential entry model that is otherwise identical. We emphasize that spatial models have proven especially useful in capturing aspects of competition in horizontally differentiated markets as emphasized by Tirole (1988). Specifically, they provide a general method for examining markets in which either actual location or an ordered product characteristic differentiates output.Footnote 3 Among the more popular spatial models is that of spatial price discrimination in which the price a firm is able to charge depends upon how “close” it is to its rivals. Thisse and Vives (1988) show that such pricing is the preferred alternative when firms are able to adopt it, and Greenhut (1981) identifies it as “nearly ubiquitous” among products that have substantial freight costs. Thus, our inquiry into the combination of sequential entry, often considered more realistic, and merger in the context of spatial price discrimination maintains salience as well as being a sensible extension of the existing literature. In what follows the next section establishes our model setting. We then present the four timings and examine the set of profitable mergers for each of the timings. Within each set, we identify the consequences on welfare relative to our benchmark cases without the possibility of merger. This allows us to emphasize the importance of the strategic position of the excluded rival. We next present the results for a three-stage sequential entry model in which each firm locates in its own stage. This presentation continues to emphasize both that mergers can increase welfare and the role of the timing advantage of the excluded rival. A final section concludes and suggests directions for future research.",6

Marcouiller,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of natural amenities in promoting development and population change has been addressed in a large body of literature, including Graves’s (1979) equilibrium theory, Roback’s (1982) general equilibrium formulation of household and firm locations, rural demographers’ turnaround migration (e.g., Brown et al. 1997), life cycle studies (e.g., Clark and Hunter 1992), rural development (e.g., Deller et al. 2001), and others. However, some empirical studies find little significance of natural amenities in influencing regional demographic change (c.f., Kim et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2002). These conflicting findings are argued to be due both to the empirical complexity of measuring amenities and to the partial approach used in isolating causal relationships (Chi and Marcouiller 2011; Robbins et al. 2009; Rupasingha and Goetz 2004; Thompson et al. 2006). The conflicting findings are further argued to be due to the existence of spatial heterogeneity in the migration effects of natural amenities, that is, the migration effects of natural amenities vary spatially (Partridge et al. 2008a). The effects vary spatially because local areas are likely to exhibit spatial variation in their growth mechanisms, areal characteristics, resource endowments, and temporal contexts. Although spatial heterogeneity in migration effects of natural amenities has been addressed in existing literature, the spatial heterogeneity along the urban–rural continuum has not been studied empirically. It is important to address the spatial heterogeneity along the urban–rural continuum because natural amenities are regional-type specific; studying the variation along the urban–rural continuum provides development and resource policy implications specific to regional context. In this article, we examine spatial heterogeneity of natural amenity impacts on migration across urban, suburban, peri-/exurban, and rural regions. Indeed, it would seem logical to think that natural amenities have differing effects in attracting migrants to urban and rural areas because of characteristics specific to regional type. Urban areas are rich in job opportunities, shopping centers, entertainment centers, healthcare facilities, and other attractants, while rural areas lack economic diversity and are more highly endowed with natural amenities (Isserman 2001). Migrants come to urban areas likely for the attracting factors of cities rather than for natural amenities. Natural amenities in rural areas attract migrants, but natural amenities alone are not enough to do so; other factors such as a healthcare facilities and transportation infrastructure could affect migration decisions. We assert that natural amenities have differing effects on migration to urban and rural areas due to a variety of characteristics unique to each regional type. Thus, the focus of the work reported here is to examine and compare migration effects of natural amenities along the urban–rural continuum. We define five types of areas representative of urban to rural status and then examine the differing migration effects of natural amenities in each type of area. This article is organized into six additional sections. Following this introduction, we review the literature on migration effects of natural amenities and spatial heterogeneity and discuss the potential variations in these effects along the urban–rural continuum. We then introduce data, urban–rural classification, and methods. The subsequent results section examines and compares migration effects of natural amenities in the five regional types while controlling for spatial dependence, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, transportation accessibility, and land use and development. Finally, we close with a summary and discussion section.",41

Roberts,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Hillside development is common in Southern Appalachia because the scenic hillside properties of the region are attractive places to live (Cho et al. 2009). Additionally, a lack of zoning and building regulation in the region has fostered hillside development (MPC 2009). This development poses challenges to maintaining sustainable growth because it is associated with a high risk of erosion, landslides, and degradation of water quality (Olshansky 2007). As Knox County, Tennessee, has experienced controversy with regards to hillside development and its regulation, in 2008 the Metropolitan Planning Commission (MPC) of the City of Knoxville and Knox County was commissioned to create The Joint City–County Taskforce on Ridge, Slope, and Hillside Development and Protection (hereafter referred to as “the Taskforce”) to assess the long-term impact of development on the ridge tops, steep slopes, and hillsides of the area and propose a hillside and ridgetop protection plan (hereafter referred to as “the plan”). Land uses (USGS 2001) being considered for preservation by The Joint City–County Taskforce on Ridge, Slope, and Hillside Development and Protection in Knox County, Tennessee (Tennessee Spatial Data Server 2011) The areas under consideration for protection contain different types of land uses and are widely distributed throughout the county (see Fig. 1). They are also highly visible throughout the county and contain 60 % of the county’s forested area (MPC 2009). The taskforce is focused on protecting the ridge lines and hillsides by altering existing or creating new development policies, including revising zoning laws, imposing limits on development in new areas, increasing density requirements in new housing developments, placing restrictions on building height, changing rules on hill side grading, and planning possible reforestation and restoration efforts (MPC 2009). When the proposed plan was established by the Taskforce, the main considerations were protecting esthetics and property values and achieving long-term improvement of air and water quality (MPC 2009). While the Taskforce intended to account for all of these benefits, thus far they have primarily focused on improving long-term air and water quality; quantitative measures of protecting aesthetics and property values have not been explicitly considered in the plan. While the plan makes efforts to estimate the costs of infrastructure for stormwater control, pollution control, and erosion control, it only mentions the effects on viewsheds as a “concern for many citizens” (MPC 2009) without quantifying those effects. The goal of this research, therefore, is to contribute to the process of screening high priority target areas from among all areas (hereafter referred to as “the planned area”) under consideration in the current Taskforce plan by estimating visual amenity values for residents of the planned area and their spatial and temporal variations. The areas with consistently high visual amenity values over two separate housing-market environments (i.e., economic boom and recession) are considered high priority areas because the consistent premiums of visual amenity values support stable housing prices regardless of real estate market conditions. To achieve the goal, three steps were taken: (1) spatial hedonic models were estimated using repeat sales in two separate periods (i.e., an economic boom and a recession), (2) the coefficients for the visual amenity variables were used to map marginal implicit prices of those variables to visually highlight the spatial variation between the two periods, and (3) areas with consistently high visual amenity values across both periods within the planned area were identified as high priority target areas for use by the Taskforce in revising its plan. A spatial hedonic model has been proven effective in previous research at estimating the amenity values of landscapes and environmental services from multiple sites and assessing the effectiveness and implications of conservation policies (i.e., Palmquist and Danielson 1989; Geoghegan et al. 1997; Bastian et al. 2002; Tse 2002; Palmquist and Smith 2002; Newburn et al. 2006; Lewis et al. 2009). For example, Newburn et al. (2006) used the hedonic method to assess the effects of conservation projects on development in different urban areas. They found that conserving areas with high environmental amenities was valuable to the communities but did not curb development on the urban fringe. Advances in spatial econometrics and geographic information systems (GIS) have fostered hedonic studies focusing on the spatial dynamics of environmental landscape attributes on property values (e.g., Geoghegan et al. 1997; Acharya and Bennett 2001; Geoghegan 2002; Irwin 2002; Cho et al. 2006, 2007; Conway et al. 2010; Sander et al. 2010). A common finding in these studies is that green spaces of different types increase the values of nearby residential properties to different degrees. A few studies have also considered how amenity values vary over time in hedonic models (e.g., Lee and Linneman 1998; Riddel 2001; Smith et al. 2002; Cho et al. 2011a). Collectively, these studies illustrate that the marginal value added to house prices by open space can fluctuate over time. In total, these studies show how open space has a positive effect on the prices of surrounding homes but also how those values can fluctuate over time, depending on subsequent development, policy changes, or changes in the economy. Notwithstanding the sparse research considering the spatial or temporal dynamics of amenity values using hedonic studies, surprisingly few studies have considered both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the amenity values provided by environmental landscapes such as hillsides and ridgetops. Cho et al. (2009) conducted one of the rare evaluations of spatial and temporal variation in the effects of open space on residential home values. Geographic variation in the marginal effects of proximity to open space was analyzed using locally weighted regression in a hedonic housing-price framework. While Cho et al. (2009) highlighted the need to consider the dynamics of spatial and temporal dimensions, four issues remain: (1) their choice of two periods (1989–1991 and 1999–2001) was random, (2) the locally weighted regression admittedly failed to adequately address the spatial autocorrelation in the data, and (3) the implications drawn from the analysis are not directly applicable to real policy adoption. Some of the issues in Cho et al. (2009) are addressed in Cho et al. (2011a, b) where amenity values for environmental landscape attributes are shown to decrease during the recession compared to the real estate boom. Cho et al. (2011a, b) used two temporally significant time periods, a real estate boom and a recession, to represent differing market conditions and two separate hedonic models for repeat sales of the same houses in two different time periods. Extending Cho et al. (2009, 2011a, b), our study considers (i) a modified version of locally weighted regression that corrects for spatial autocorrelation, (ii) the spatial and temporal analysis to identify high priority target areas for the plan currently pending consideration by the Knox County Commission, and (iii) two separate hedonic models for repeat sales of the same houses in two different time periods that represent a real estate boom and a recession. While this repeat sales hedonic model reduces the number of observations, it should perform more efficiently and eliminate more bias than the prior methods because it better eliminates the effects of outlying observations and better estimates changes in housing attribute values (Case et al. 1991; Clapp and Giaccotto 1998; Hansen 2009).",10

Multiregional input–output (MRIO) analysis may be one of the primary models for incorporating regional interdependencies into an input–output framework. In Chenery-Moses-type MRIO model, the intra-regional coefficient matrices are located along the main diagonal, while another cross-regional trade matrix functions to incorporate the cross-regional effects (Hewings and Jensen 1987; Oosterhaven and Polenske 2009). It is said that MRIO models have an advantage over Isard-type interregional (IRIO) models, as they are able to use data that are more available (Polenske and Hewings 2004).Footnote 1 Despite the simplification in the MRIO models, however, collecting real data of cross-regional trades is very costly. Thus, preceding papers with nonsurvey approaches employed location quotients (LQ) as the primary reference to cross-regional trades (see e.g., Isserman 1977). With this approach, the domestic outflows and inflows (cross-regional trades) are estimated independent of the other figures such as the regional control totals, final demand, and imports and exports in the multiregional table. While LQ techniques are convenient to use, they also have some limitations; these techniques inevitably eliminate cross-hauling in cross-regional trades.Footnote 2 Without cross-hauling, as suggested by many articles such as Roginson and Miller (1988), there is the risk of underestimating the regional propagation effect. Consistent cross-regional trades can be estimated using given regional input–output tables. If we set the estimates on all the regional figures (including regional imports and exports) besides net regional trades, we can restrict to some extent the degrees of freedom in cross-regional trades estimation, as done in the commodity balance (CB) approach. In such cases, biproportional matrix reconciliation techniques using reference regional trades can be applied (see e.g., Lahr 2004; Canning and Wang 2005). However, the estimate will not include cross-hauling unless the reference domestic trades include cross-hauling. One-way method is to apply gravity trade flow models (Olson 1972) that permit cross-hauling. Regression-type gravity models (e.g., Begg 1985) have been applied and have shown to produce results by and large close to the survey data (Riddington et al. 2006). Kronenberg (2010) estimated biregional trades using the Leontief-Strout-type exact solution nonsurvey method that allows cross-hauling, which was then discussed in Flegg and Tohmo (2011). Meanwhile, there are requests that the given multiregional transactions be disaggregated into smaller regions, such as in the case of Japan, rather than obtaining all cross-regional trades among the given regions. In other words, our objective in the study is to decompose one of the regions of a given cross-hauled MRIO table into two to obtain a more detailed MRIO table while maintaining the given structure of regional transactions. In such a context, however, the approaches mentioned above could spoil the original measured transactions. Thus, we consider an approach that requires less involvement. We partition the regional outflows into disaggregated regions where the inflows are determined accordingly. Further, for reallocating outflows, we use the gravity ratios. For our empirical study, we use the biregional table of Aichi prefecture and the rest of Japan, 2005, and apply the calculation in order to disaggregate Aichi into Nagoya and the rest of Aichi, thus producing a three-region multiregional table. For evaluating multiregional transactions, we call on the gravity ratios that rule the outflow split between regions, in addition to meeting the entire commodity balance; the gravity ratios can be obtained from the market sizes and the distances between regions with the aid of the gravity parameters, which we estimate using the reference nine-region multiregional table of Japan. This method hence allows to partition a cross-hauled biregional table into three or more parts in an arbitrary manner, while being consistent with the original regional transactions. We proceed to use this three-region table for the analysis of industrial waste and landfill, which are attributed to the exogenous consumption boost in Nagoya. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce models with and without cross-hauling for partitioning biregional input–output models. Section 3 describes the estimation of gravity parameters of regional trades using survey data, along with the population-weighted distances across the regions. In Sect. 4, we introduce data on regional industrial waste generation and perform a multiregional analysis with and without cross-hauling. Section 5 concludes the paper.",8

I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our Nation. I believe it practically inexhaustible. It abounds all over the western country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has scarcely commenced.

I intend to point them to the gold and silver that waits for them in the West.

Assessing post-enlargement emigration intentions of Latvia’s Russian speaking minority,August 2013,Artjoms Ivlevs,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Following the 2004 EU enlargement, the UK, Ireland and Sweden opened their labour markets to the new EU Member States. This has resulted in considerable relocation of labour, with the UK alone attracting more than one million workers (UKBA 2011). Arguably, the fall in migration costs has benefitted the most economically and socially disadvantaged citizens of the new EU Member States. Often they belong to ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities. The size of such minorities in the enlarged Europe is non-negligible—for example, 9 % of the populations of the new EU Member States are ethnic minorities.Footnote 1
 Are the ethnic minorities more likely to emigrate from the new EU Member States? If yes, for what reasons? Who are the potential minority and majority migrants? To answer these questions, I focus on Latvia which is a particularly suitable example for studying emigration of minorities. First, Latvia has the highest share of ethnic minorities in the EU (41 %). Second, it is one of the poorest EU States where emigration pressure remains high.Footnote 2 At the same time, the liberalisation of the Western European labour markets resulted in a sharp fall in migration costs, representing a natural experiment for studying emigration of all population groups, including the minorities. Emigration of minorities has received relatively little attention in the empirical literature. One of the reasons is the difficulty to quantify the phenomenon, as both receiving and sending countries generally ignore the ethnicity of their migrants (Docquier and Rapoport 2003). In this paper, I use an emigration intentions survey which provides information on the ethnic origin, native language and citizenship of the respondents. The survey was commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia and conducted in December 2005.Footnote 3 The fact that the survey was conducted a relatively short time after free movement of labour was introduced carries an additional advantage—it allows to capture some of the initial post-enlargement emigration potential of both ethnic minority and majority. The key finding of the paper is that the Russian speaking minority is more likely to emigrate than the Latvian speaking majority. It could be explained by several factors: first, the finding supports the conjecture of Hughes (2005) that the strict linguistic and citizenship legislation, potentially disadvantaging the Russian speakers on the Latvian labour market, would be an incentive for emigration of minorities after the liberalisation of the EU labour markets; second, the minorities could be more likely to emigrate because of the ‘migration capital’—specific values and attitudes towards migration—accumulated in their families; and third, the desire to emigrate could be driven by dissatisfaction with the minority education reforms implemented in Latvia after it became an independent state. I also provide important evidence that for the minority, higher levels of education are associated with a higher probability of emigration. This points to the minority brain drain and is consistent with the theoretical framework of Docquier and Rapoport (2003) where the majority government is able to impose an ‘ethnic tax’ on the skilled minority—for example, bias the allocation of public jobs, education subsidies or other publicly provided goods. Docquier and Rapoport show that if migration costs are sufficiently low, the skilled minority individuals will emigrate. This paper draws on a survey of emigration intentions. Although emigration plans and subsequent emigration behaviour may differ, van Dalen and Henkens (2008) find that intentions are good predictors of future emigration. They also show that the forces that trigger emigration intentions are the same forces that make people actually move. The findings of van Dalen and Henkens support the assumption of Burda et al. (1998) that intentions are a monotonic function of the variables which motivate migration and justify the use of emigration intentions data to determine the profile of future migrants (see, e.g., Papapanagos and Sanfey 2001; Liebig and Sousa-Poza 2004; Epstein and Gang 2006; Uebelmesser 2006; Drinkwater and Ingram 2009). In addition, data on emigration intentions have advantages relative to host country data on immigrants for studying the emigration potential and the characteristics of migrants from a particular country. Intentions data are representative of the sending country population; host country data are based on immigrant populations which are likely to be biased relative to sending country population (for example, when host country immigration policies are designed to attract skilled workers, see van Dalen and Henkens (2008) and Liebig and Sousa-Poza (2004)). The findings of this paper are likely to carry over to many Central and Eastern European countries which have recently joined or aspire to join the EU in the future. One prominent example, which has attracted much public attention, is Roma emigration from Romania and Bulgaria (BBC 2010). The Roma are, arguably, the most disadvantaged group in Central and Eastern Europe. There are, however, other minority groups which may be involved in less explicit conflicts or be subject to policies which the minorities perceive as disadvantaging. There is no reason to expect that these minorities, and in many cases the most skilled individuals among them, will not try to escape the “conflict” or “discomfort” territory, especially given the advantages of the increasingly liberalised EU labour markets. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the origins and the current situation of the Latvia’s Russian speaking minority. Section 3 discusses possible reasons why Russian speakers would be more likely to emigrate than their ethnic majority counterparts. Section 4 presents data, methodology and empirical results. Conclusions follow.",22

Mane,Brigitte S. Waldorf,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the United States, economic mobility and success are very much a part of the American Dream but may be almost unachievable for some segments of the immigrant population. The trajectory from poor newcomer to millionaire is not the norm. Instead, all too often immigrants in the United States find themselves marginalized in the labor force. While highly educated immigrants may fare better than those with little human capital, they often face barriers resulting from imperfect transferability of human capital across international boundaries. As a result, they may be constrained to jobs for which they are overeducated and earn lower wages than comparable native workers. There is ample empirical evidence of the gap between immigrant and native earnings. In general, the literature suggests that the earnings gap can be attributed to human capital acquired in the immigrant’s home country being poorly transferable into the labor market in the receiving country (Friedberg 2000; Ekberg et al. 2010). Moreover, the literature suggests that while immigrants—upon arrival in the host country—earn less than natives do, ultimately the wage levels converge (Borjas 1994; Stewart and Hyclak 1984). Less attention has been paid to understanding the factors influencing earnings gaps between immigrants from different sending countries. Building upon previously explored theories, this paper seeks to rectify this oversight by analyzing wage gaps between old and new immigrant groups, where old immigrant groups are defined as those having long established migration linkages with the receiving country. Examples of old immigrant groups are the Italian and Irish immigrants in the United States. Examples of new immigrant groups are immigrants from Eastern European countries whose pre-WW II migration links with the United States lay dormant for two generations but whose emigration to the United States started anew following the opening of their borders two decades ago. The empirical portion of the study compares the US labor market success of Albanian immigrants—an example of a new immigrant group—and Italian immigrants who, unlike the Albanians, can rely on established network channels that can facilitate adjustment and entry into the labor market.Footnote 1 Four specific questions will be addressed. First, what factors influence immigrants’ economic success in the United States? Prime attention will be devoted to the influence of human capital acquired in the sending country and the level of assimilation to US society where assimilation is seen as a human capital enriching process. Second, how do Albanian immigrants fare in comparison with Italians? Third, do the pay-offs of immigrants’ investment in human capital at home differ between Albanians and Italians? Finally, do Albanians—upon arrival in the United States—accumulate human capital faster than Italians? While both Albanian and Italian newcomers may experience mismatches between their education and occupations, and thus earn low wages, the problem may be particularly severe for Albanians as international transferability of educational credentials from the by-and-large unknown Albania is expected to be low. On the other hand, human capital investment in the form of assimilation may be more beneficial for Albanians than for Italians since Italians can rely on the assistance of a large Italian network and may choose to invest less heavily in assimilation. In the empirical analysis, we estimate wage regressions utilizing pooled data from the 2000 US Census 5 % sample, and the 2001–2007 American Community Survey (ACS) 3 % sample. The remainder of this paper is organized in four sections. Following this introductory section, the second section provides a conceptualization of earnings gaps between old and new immigrant groups. The third section provides salient background information and context for migration from Albania and Italy to the United States.

The purpose of the paper is to investigate whether remittance inflows facilitate or impede manufacturing growth. The empirical analyses provide robust evidence, which suggests that remittance receipts accelerate manufacturing growth. Remittances flowing into the developing world amounted to US$31 billion in 1990. By 2004, it increased fivefold to US$161 billion (World Bank 2008). This is a substantial amount relative to the size of the recipient economies and other external inflows. Indeed, by 2004, remittance inflows are twice the official development assistance granted to developing countries and about 70 % of foreign direct investment obtained by these countries (World Bank 2008). Whereas some studies (e.g., Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2011; Bugamelli and Paternò 2011; Aggarwal et al. 2011; Fajnzylber and Lopez 2008; Osili 2007) have been undertaken to ascertain the impact of remittances on the destination countries, the picture is not yet clear; for instance, it is unclear whether remittance inflows induce or impede manufacturing growth. This is an important gap in our understanding of the economic consequences of remittance inflows. In his seminar article, Arthur Lewis (1954, p. 155) emphasis that a rapid increase in productive capacity particularly of the manufacturing sector is “the central fact of economic development.” Indeed, the episodes of industrialization with the corresponding ascend of the manufacturing sector are at the heart of the economic expansion of the past two centuries (Maddison 2008; Sachs 2005; Collier 2007). In relation to the sluggish growth of most African countries, (Wells and Thirlwall (2003), p. 89) observe that “one of the strong factors reflecting Africa’s economic backwardness is the low level of industrial development.” In a recent survey, Johnson et al. (2010) conclude that there is virtually no non-oil-exporting economy, which see sustained economic growth without a sound manufacturing base. These studies imply that an important avenue to understanding the long-run implications of the rising levels of remittances is how remittance inflows impact on the growth of the manufacturing sector. Surprisingly, there is no direct investigation into the possible impact of remittances on manufacturing growth. Existing studies infer the relationship between remittances and manufacturing growth by examining the link between remittances and the real exchange rate (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2004; Acosta et al. 2009; Lartey et al. 2008). The main finding of these studies is that the inflow of remittances is associated with real exchange rate appreciation. They conclude that “workers’ remittances have the potential to inflict economic costs on the [manufacturing] sector of receiving countries” (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2004, p. 1407). The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the remittance-induced real exchange rate appreciation undermines the competitive position of the remittance-receiving countries with dire consequences for manufacturing growth (Rodrik 2008; Williamson 2009). This paper contributes to the literature by directly examining the relationship between remittances and manufacturing growth. The contention is that, important as it is, the reported remittance-induced real exchange rate appreciation is not a summary statistics of the effect of remittances on manufacturing growth. There are several mechanisms through which remittances may impact on manufacturing growth; for instance, Fajnzylber and Lopez (2008) show that remittance receipts reduce absolute poverty, inequality, and improve human capital indicators—indicators that are well-established determinants of growth. Moreover, the extra demand occasioned by remittance inflows (Adams 2006) and the associated multiplier effects (Lucas 2005) are major sources of economic stimulus even for the manufacturing sector. Similarly, studies show that remittance inflows are positively associated with financial development (Aggarwal et al. 2011) and domestic investment (Dzansi 2011). The paper uses the 3-digit level manufacturing data on a sample of 40 remittance-dependent economies over the period from 1990 to 2004. In the first set of regressions, country- and industry-specific characteristics as well as year dummies are controlled for to minimize the potential bias introduced by omitted variables. In the second set of regressions, the economic conditions of the host (remittance source) countries are employed as instruments to generate exogenous variations in remittance inflows. The empirical results suggest that remittance inflows accelerate manufacturing growth. This evidence is robust to country-, year-, and industry-specific characteristics and a number of estimators. The results suggest that even if the real exchange rate mechanism is at play, it is overshadowed by the other mechanisms through which remittances impact on the manufacturing sector. Section 2 briefly reviews some of the main channels through which remittances may impact on manufacturing growth. Section 3 provides an overview of the econometric approaches and the data used in the empirical analyses. Section 4 presents and discusses the results, and the last section covers the concluding remarks.",20

The EU document Regional Policy Contributing to Smart Growth in Europe (EC 2010) has been a first official move in this direction. The general idea is to move away from a “one-size-fits-all” policy approach to innovation like the thematically/regionally neutral and generic R&D incentives. Instead, innovation behaviors specific to each single area have to be identified so that ad hoc and targeted innovation policies can be devised. To achieve this goal, without incurring the unrealistic situation of having one policy action for each European region, a sound taxonomy on innovative European regions is required. For this reason, a number of taxonomies of innovative regions have been proposed with the aim of identifying similarities among regions in terms of their knowledge bases. However, the large majority of the existing taxonomies are based merely on the intensity of locally produced knowledge. Very recently, OECD has proposed a taxonomy, which once again groups European regions according to their intensity of knowledge, identifying the knowledge regions, the industrial production zones, and the non-S&T-driven regions (OECD 2010). On a similar vein, Tödling and Trippl (2005) conceptually identified three types of regions, that is, peripheral regions, old industrial regions, and metropolitan regions, on the basis of their knowledge intensity, industrial specialization, and settlement structure. By focusing on the characteristics of research activities and processes, Varga et al. (2010) group regions according to their research productivity in Edison-type research, that is, research focused on new products with novel economic applications and on market-oriented innovation that is associated with agglomeration economies benefits, and in Pasteur-type research, that is, science-oriented research, governed by the specific norms, rules, and incentives of the modern scientific practice that, instead, is associated with (scientific) networking behavior. For different reasons, the results achieved with the above-mentioned taxonomies are not totally satisfactory and leave space for further reflections. In particular, all previous taxonomies are mostly based on knowledge production only, and therefore unable to grasp important aspects of the way in which innovation processes take place, from the exploitation of knowledge spillovers, to the use of informal, non-codified knowledge, and to the development of learning by doing and by using. These aspects are in general ignored since the taxonomies mentioned are based on a specific conceptual approach that equates knowledge to innovation, as in all recent theories on regional knowledge-based growth. Whatever the scientific paradigm behind these theories, for example, economic geography theories, evolutionary theory of innovation, neo-Schumpeterian theories on local development, and evolutionary geography, they share one important feature which represents the limitation of current scientific knowledge on local knowledge and innovation processes. All these theories focus on one particular phase of the innovation process, often interpreted as the crucial one, and which is either knowledge creation, innovation creation, knowledge diffusion, or innovation diffusion. Some theories even interpret knowledge and innovation as overlapping processes, taking for granted that whether knowledge is created locally, this inevitably leads to innovation, or if innovation takes place, it is only due to local knowledge availability. A similar short-circuit is assumed between knowledge/innovation and performance, with a productivity increase expected in all cases in which a creative effort, a learning process, an interactive, and cooperative atmosphere characterize the local economy. Secondly, the existing taxonomies lack a link with the territorial conditions behind the modes of innovation and which enable the identification of the endogenous local elements associated with a region’s innovation pattern. An exception in the existing taxonomies based on the knowledge production come from the work developed for the DG Enterprise and Industry (namely the different editions of the Regional Innovation Scoreboard; Hollanders et al. 2009), which proposes a taxonomy of European regions that makes use also of innovation regional data. This is definitively a novelty as it is, in fact, one of the first attempt to empirically distinguish knowledge from innovation and to depart from the knowledge–innovation equivalence, a conceptual ambiguity clearly manifest in taxonomies using knowledge indicators such as R&D or patent intensity as proxy for innovation outputs. However, the methodologies implemented in this kind of exercise merge together indicators as diverse as innovation performance, knowledge inputs like R&D, knowledge output, like patent activities, sectoral structure, presence of spatial innovation enablers, employment indicators, with no a priori on the conceptual links among the variables used, and, ultimately, lack strong territorial roots. It is our impression that the complexity and diversity of regional modes of innovation requires a shift away from typologies based on the intensity of knowledge production alone, lacking any linkage to the local conditions that enable specific innovation processes to take place. It is especially on these local elements that regional policies can act to create and reinforce regional innovation processes; on the identification of the specific innovation processes that each region has developed lies the difficulty of moving from innovation policies, which are typically sectoral policies, to regional innovation policies. For this reason, a sound taxonomy should interpret the different combinations of context (local) conditions and modes of performing the different phases (from knowledge creation/acquisition to innovation) of the innovation process, that is, it should highlight the different territorial patterns of innovation. This paper intends to contribute to this end by proposing a taxonomy of innovative regions based on a new conceptual framework in which to read innovation potentials at regional level, and by highlighting different possible territorial patterns of innovation defined as specific combinations of context conditions and different modes of developing the various phases of the innovation process (Sect. 2). On the basis of a rich dataset for 262 NUTS2 regions of the 27 EU Member Countries, the regional taxonomy is defined by means of a cluster analysis on the intensity of both knowledge and innovation, thereby superseding the trivial idea that knowledge equates to innovation. The groups of regions are depicted on the basis of the territorial conditions behind the different modes of innovation thanks to a rich database (Sect. 3) and an appropriate choice of variables (Sect. 4). Interesting results emerge and they highlight a variety even more fragmented than conceptually envisaged (Sect. 5). Some concluding remarks are finally presented (Sect. 6).",69

Since innovation is significantly related to existing knowledge, understanding the mechanisms of knowledge communication in space is essential for understanding the geography of economic growth. When knowledge flows (e.g., spillovers facilitated by informal relations, learning in research collaborations or knowledge transfers mediated by market transactions) are dominantly local, economic growth will most probably be highly uneven in space. Alternatively, globally flying knowledge may contribute to the spreading of economic growth (Fujita and Thisse 2002). Most of the research in this field has focused on the role of spatial proximity in innovation. The early papers (Jaffe 1989; Jaffe et al. 1993; Anselin et al. 1997) evidenced that knowledge flows between firms and private and public R&D laboratories are to a large extent localized geographically. Later on, several studies applying similar research methods in different countries supported this finding (Ghinamo 2012). It became clear soon that besides pure knowledge spillovers, local labor markets (Breschi and Lissoni 2009), entrepreneurship (Zucker et al. 1998) or formalized research collaborations(Miguélez and Moreno 2012) contribute importantly to the localized communication of knowledge. Though the proximity of industry-specific (specialized) knowledge could also be important, empirical findings suggest that the diversity of the local knowledge base is associated most frequently with regional growth (Glaeser et al. 1991; Feldman and Audretsch 1999). Deeper analysis reveals that not a simple diversity of industries but their technological relatedness is what nurtures innovation (Frenken et al. 2007). Subsequent research clarifies that spatial proximity is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for knowledge flows to occur (Boschma 2005). Instead, other forms of proximities (such as cognitive, social, institutional or organizational proximities) are the crucial prerequisites of knowledge communication. Geographical proximity of actors in innovation may enhance the flow of knowledge but only if at least one of the other proximities are also in effect. Physically, proximate location provides only the opportunities for frequent interactions. These interactions might become instrumental for the speedy flow of both tacit and codified knowledge as well as for the development of trust or the establishment of common codes of communication (Koschatzky 2000). Ponds et al. (2009) show empirically that spatial proximity helps bridging institutional distances between business, academia and government. Thus, knowledge flows between different types of organizations tend to be localized. On the other hand, knowledge communication could also occur over larger physical distances among actors sharing similar institutional features. Compared to the high intensity of research on localized knowledge interactions, scientific inquiry on the mechanisms and regional impacts of global knowledge flows is still a relatively less developed and novel phenomenon. Spatial econometric studies brought the first empirical evidence on the existence of interregional knowledge transfers and their positive role in regional innovation (Anselin et al. 1997; Varga 1998). Recent efforts in the literature focus on studying various mechanisms of interregional knowledge flows ranging from professional labor mobility (Maier et al. 2007; Schiller and Diez 2008; Miguélez et al. 2009), research collaboration (Maggioni and Uberti 2011) and co-inventorship (Breschi and Lenzi 2011; Broekel et al. 2010) to the operation of multinational companies (Cantwell and Iammarino 2003). Network analysis (NA) is an especially promising tool for the study of interregional knowledge flows. Different measures of network structure such as network size, centrality of actors or density of interactions appear particularly powerful for understanding the geography of knowledge production. Much of the scientific inquiry in interregional knowledge interactions applying NA techniques grows out from the spatial econometrics tradition. Researchers realize that weights matrices routinely used in spatial econometrics to represent relations in space can also be applied to characterize relative positions in interregional knowledge networks (Maggioni and Uberti 2011). It is shown in this literature that the number of interregional partners in research or invention and their levels of knowledge (measured by, e.g., R&D expenditures or publication stock) are indeed influential factors in regional knowledge production (Maggioni et al. 2007, Hoekman et al. 2009; Ponds et al. 2009, 2010; Varga et al. 2013). Thus, the literature suggests that the larger the number of interregional partners is and the higher their knowledge levels are, the more effective a region becomes in knowledge generation. This is an important finding, but related to it at least two further issues arise. First, it can be argued that some substitutability might exist between network size and the level of knowledge in the network. A small network with a limited number of highly knowledgeable partners might be as valuable for a region as a large network with partners possessing diverse knowledge levels. While separate estimations of the impacts of the size and knowledge variables do not account for such a relationship in an econometric model, a comprehensive approach aggregating different network features into one combined measure could potentially be sensitive to such substitutability. Second, some additional characteristics of knowledge networks not yet considered in the geography literature (but accounted for in non-spatial studies) might also turn out to be influential in research productivity. In this paper, we intend to make a step further in the state of art of the research addressing the relationship between interregional knowledge flows and regional knowledge creation. We structure the problem by directing attention to the quality of a particular interregional network for a particular region. This quality is reflected by the contribution of knowledge accessed in the network to the production of new knowledge inside the region. In order to make the problem empirically tractable, we quantify certain features of interregional networks that could be instrumental for regional knowledge production additional to what have already been accounted for in the spatial literature (i.e., number of partners and their knowledge levels).Building on these measures and continuing the research line in Varga and Parag (2009), we then develop a novel comprehensive index to account for the quality of a region’s global knowledge network. The higher this index value gets, the larger the amount of knowledge potentially accessed from the network will be. We also provide a test on the hypothesized positive relationship between interregional knowledge network quality and regional research productivity. In pursuit of this, we investigate two interregional networks: EU Framework Program collaborations and European co-patenting, both considered at the level of EU NUTS2 regions. The two networks refer to two types of new knowledge generation processes: the production of new scientific knowledge measured by publications and the production of new technological knowledge measured by patent applications. Our paper is structured as follows. The second section introduces the concept of ego network quality, followed by the section describing the analytical model and the data used in the empirical analysis. The fifth section presents the results on how the quality of a region’s interregional network affects the productivity of research in the creation of publications and patents at the regional level. The last section summarizes our findings and highlights potential further research directions.",64

Bosma,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The tendency of firms and workers to agglomerate their activities in space showed to be persistent throughout the history. Theoretical and empirical studies in spatial economics have shown that agglomeration economies may be the most important source of this uneven distribution of economic activities and economic growth across cities and regions. Looking at the arguments behind this modern urbanization view, we find two relatively new approaches. One is based on the theory of agglomeration economies with increasing returns and easy access to knowledge (Krugman 2009), and a second is based on the idea that (larger) cities are strong because they are the physical concentration of skilled knowledge workers (Glaeser and Maré 2001). Both approaches lead to the hypothesis of expected higher labour productivity. This is confirmed in much empirical research. In Europe, the largest urban areas, more in particular in the axis of London-Randstad-Paris-Frankfurt-Milan, contribute much more to their national GDPs than could be expected by looking at their population sizes (Ciccone 2002). The same conclusion has been made by Ciccone and Hall (1996) for the USA. The empirical works on agglomeration economies are characterized by a large diversity of approaches. In Rosenthal and Strange (2004), there is a brief review of papers focusing on urbanization economies (being advantages of cities applying to every firm or consumer). Noticeable is that most of the early (pre-1990’s) works on agglomeration simply used the cities’ population as a measure of agglomeration. These studies assume that the population elasticity of productivity is constant. Rosenthal and Strange (2004) conclude that this literature has found relatively consistent evidence: doubling the population of a city increases productivity by 3–8 %. Since Glaeser et al. (1992), it has become more apt to analyse growth variables using employment in cities, suggesting a relationship between agglomeration and economic growth, coining the possibility that urban increasing returns are working in a dynamic, rather than static, context. Sector-specific localization economies, stemming from input–output relations and transport cost savings of firms, human capital externalities and knowledge spillovers, are generally offset against the earlier customary measured general urbanization economies (Henderson 2003). A large literature builds on this conceptualization of agglomeration economies, reflected in three recent overview and meta-studies (Melo et al. 2009; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009; De Groot et al. 2009). These studies show that the relation agglomeration-growth is ambiguous and indecisive on either specialization or diversity being facilitated by (sheer) urbanization as context. The ambiguity is fuelled by measurement issues and heterogeneity in terms of scale of time and space, aggregation, growth definitions, and the functional form of the models applied. Based on an overview of historical and current conceptualizations of knowledge, knowledge diffusion and innovation in cities, several scholars plea for conceptual and methodological renewal and rigour in research in order to address this current impasse in economic agglomeration studies (Van Oort and Lambooy 2012). Only recently, various conceptualizations of distance and proximity empirically address the heterogeneity in actors and processes involved and capture the role of cities in this. It is argued that research should more and explicitly focus on both the transfer mechanisms of knowledge diffusion, like spin-offs, research collaborations and social networks, and on the contexts that facilitate the acquaintance and diffusion of knowledge by individual firms. New methodological views appear needed here as well, in particular modelling techniques that link appropriate levels of analysis, from the firm to regional contexts and agglomeration circumstances (Van Oort et al. 2012). The first goal of this paper is to take a step towards incorporating appropriate context and transfer mechanism issues in spatial externalities and productivity–agglomeration debate. Consistent with recent literature, we argue that mechanisms embedded in entrepreneurship and innovation processes constitute a relevant additional explanation for observed regional and national variation in economic agglomeration and performance (Acs and Armington 2004; Acs and Varga 2005; Aghion et al. 2009; Fritsch and Mueller 2008; Acs et al. 2010; Bosma et al. 2011). We argue that the nexus around invention, innovation and high-quality entrepreneurship can be related to urbanization effects. The second goal of the paper is to contribute to the recent policy discussion on place-based or place-neutral development strategies in the European Union. This debate is highlighted in the context of a series of recent major policy reports: the place-neutral policies in the 2009 World Bank report (World Bank 2009) and the European place-based development strategies in Barca (2009) and Barca et al. (2012). Place-neutral strategies rely on the agglomerative forces of the largest cities and metropolitan regions to attract talent and growth potential. Place-based development strategists claim that the polycentric nature of a set of smaller- and medium-sized cities in Europe, each with their own peculiar characteristics and specializing in the activities to which they are best suited, creates fruitful urban variety, which enhances optimal economic development. This implies that medium-sized city regions have not declined in importance compared to larger urban ones, which has been indicated in monitoring publications by the OECD (2009, 2011), but there is until now little empirical support by explanations based in entrepreneurship, innovation and productivity. A related place-based regional policy dimension relevant for the European Union concerns objective-1 regions that have been supported in cohesion policy. Recent research shows that this distinction is important for productivity and productivity growth (Dogaru et al. 2011; Marrocu et al. 2012). This paper will, therefore, additionally test the relationship between productivity, innovation and entrepreneurship in distinctive large, medium-sized and small urban regions, as well as in objective-1 versus non-objective-1 regions simultaneously, and conclude on the place-based policy implications suggested in the recent discourse. In order to reach the two research goals, this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce a synopsis of both relevant theories on agglomeration, entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as of the current place-based development strategies aimed for by the European Union. We argue that including regional innovation and entrepreneurship indicators captures additional localized externalities next to urbanization economies. In Sect. 3, we present a model that formalizes this in a testable framework for 111 regions in 14 countries in Europe. In the empirical analysis, we use data at the individual level from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) in 2001–2006, comprising information of entrepreneurship for over 350,000 working age adults, and are we able to discern quality aspects of the entrepreneur. We make a distinction between early-stage entrepreneurs’ growth expectation and their innovative orientation. Patent activity is used to capture potential innovation based on new inventions. These data and the estimation approach applied are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents the results of 2SLS models in which regional productivity is explained by agglomeration economies, entrepreneurship and innovation indicators. We also introduce spatial regime analyses that distinguish the relationship between productivity and explanatory variables in objective-1 and non-objective-1 regions simultaneously, as well as in large, medium-sized and small urban regions in Europe. This explicitly tests for the suggested implications of place-based development trajectories that may be useful for policies on the local level instead of on the aggregate level. We present conclusions and a policy discussion in Sect. 6.",32

This paper focuses on inter-firm job switching as a source of the productivity advantages of spatial employment density. Inferring productivity advantages of density from analyses of inter-firm job switching depends on two sets of relationships. The first is the relationship between job switching and productivity, and the second is the effect of density on job switching. We focus in this paper on the latter relationship and examine the effect that spatial employment density of a region has on the rate at which workers move between employers. There are strong theoretical arguments in favor of that inter-firm labor mobility is a conduit for the productivity advantages of density. Mobility of labor is associated with two micro-foundations for agglomeration economies: learning and matching (Duranton and Puga 2004). It stimulates learning by being a vehicle for diffusion of knowledge and ideas (Almeida and Kogut 1999; Agrawal et al. 2006). Knowledge, experiences, and competencies are embodied in people, and movements of employees between firms bring about knowledge diffusion and learning which stimulate faster knowledge accumulation (cf. Glaeser 1999; Feldman 1999; Glaeser and Maré 2001). Inter-firm job switching of workers is also a means to efficient labor market matching processes. Models of labor markets typically emphasize that the quality of matches are uncertain ex ante and must be experienced to be evaluated (Farber 1994). Topel and Ward (1992) show that the typical path to a stable employer–employee relation is indeed characterized by frequent job switching. Efficient labor market matching should thus be associated with job switching (cf. Finney and Kohlhase 2008). These arguments suggest that inter-firm job switching of workers is a mechanism through which learning and matching effects materialize. Despite inter-firm job switching being a likely conduit for the density–productivity relationship, there are few systematic analyses of how density and job switching are related. Previous studies are few in numbers and provide a mixed picture. Finney and Kohlhase (2008) study new job starts among a sample of young men in US urban areas and find that the probability of changing job is higher in denser regions. Bleakly and Lin (2007) analyze the rate at which workers change occupation or industry using data from US cities and investigate the effect of population density. They find in contrast that occupation and industry switching is on average lower in denser regions. Yet, higher rates of occupational and industrial switching are observed for a subsample of younger workers. The authors argue that the observed pattern is consistent with the impact density has on search costs. It is cheaper and takes less time to find a quality match in denser areas with thicker labor markets. Workers are thus more likely to search for new jobs and they do so early in their careers to maximize their work life income. This paper adds to the limited set of studies on density and job switching. We employ detailed longitudinal-matched employer–employee data for Sweden and identify pure inter-firm job switching among employees, where a change of job is measured as a change of employer. A job change is thus always associated with movement between different firms. From the perspective of inter-firm knowledge flows, this type of job switching is a more relevant phenomenon.Footnote 2 Furthermore, job switching may be associated with different levels of geographical mobility, i.e., it may be intra- or inter-regional. Our data allow us to capture the rate at which workers switch employers between firms in the same region, and we link this type of ‘internal mobility’ to the ‘internal geography’ of regions, i.e., density. A key issue in identifying the effect that density has on job switching is selection. In our empirical context, selection effects arise from the possibility of non-random spatial sorting of workers on worker characteristics associated with their mobility. Dense regions may attract inherently mobile workers, so that higher mobility in dense regions reflects this sorting effect rather than an effect of density on the mobility of workers. To deal with this, we estimate the influence density has on the probability that a worker switch employer, while conditioning on an ample set of worker and employer characteristics that may influence worker mobility, such as age, education, tenure, sector affiliation, productivity, and firm size. We also conduct separate estimations for workers of different age, with different levels of education and in manufacturing and services sectors, respectively. Two measures of density are employed. The first is a standard measure of employment per square kilometer (Ciccone and Hall 1996). The second is a more refined measure of density, which accounts for the quality of transportation infrastructure through an accessibility measure with travel time distance decay. Such a measure is directly related to choice contexts for spatial interaction (Weibull 1976, 1980). Our main finding is that density indeed spurs the rate of inter-firm job switching of workers. Both measures of density—i.e., employment per square kilometer and internal accessibility—have positive and significant influence on the probability of switching job. The influence is yet small. Our overall estimates suggest that a doubling of density—measured by the number of workers per square kilometer—yields 0.2 % points increase in the probability of job switching for a randomly chosen worker. The effect is considerably larger when looking at job switching within a region. A doubling of density increases the probability of intra-regional job switching by 0.7 % points. While the effect of a doubling of density is limited, the actual differences in density across the regions in our data amount to a factor over 40. Our results are robust and hold for both young and old workers, for workers with different levels of educational attainment as well as for workers in manufacturing and services sectors, respectively. Yet, the effect of spatial employment density per square kilometer is substantially larger for better educated workers. We also show that in denser regions, intra-regional job switching as a fraction of total job switching (intra- plus interregional) is significantly higher. About 80 % of all inter-firm job switching is intra-regional. Hence, the likelihood that job switching is intra-regional is significantly higher if employees operate in denser regions, and differences in the rates of intra-regional inter-firm job switching across regions amount to factor four. We conclude that density indeed spurs inter-firm job switching, thus illustrating that inter-firm job switching is not only a theoretically plausible conduit for the productivity advantages of density, but also an empirically relevant mechanism. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 discusses how dense environments spur inter–firm job switching by reducing transaction costs, and how such mobility is related to matching and learning. Section 3 presents the data and give a brief description of the basic patterns of inter-firm labor mobility in Sweden as a whole and in different regions. The effect of density on mobility is assessed in Sect. 4 which presents our methodology as well as the results. Section 5 concludes.",16

For the “New Urbanist,” multi-purpose trails provide the potential for bicycle commuting; help alleviate noise, pollution, and congestion, and, of course, expand the means for green transportation and a community’s walkability. From a real estate perspective, trails, like many other amenities, can have significant spillover effects on residential property values when these properties are located within reasonable distances to the trails. But while an increasing number of studies in recent years explored the impacts of amenities onto residential property values, only very few studies are specifically devoted to trails. Developed by Lancaster (1966) and Rosen (1974), the hedonic pricing model is the standard approach used to estimate the marginal implicit prices of individually selected housing characteristics. Housing price, based on people’s willingness to pay for these intrinsic characteristics, is modeled as a function of a set of utility-bearing intrinsic properties that constitute it. However, the fact that home-buying decisions are not solely based on structural features of the real estate (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms), but are also influenced by community (e.g., school district), neighborhood (e.g., median household income), environmental (e.g., traffic noise, air pollution), and locational (e.g., access to public transportation, distance to CBD, public parks) attributes, led to the development of a vast body of the literature over time to account for this array of additional factors that influence house prices. In addition to accounting for the contribution of non-structure related factors, this paper specifically focuses on the impact of the multi-purpose Little Miami Scenic Trail on neighboring house prices. Even though the literature is somewhat inconclusive about the impacts of trails on house prices (Mogush et al. 2005), we find that the Little Miami Scenic Trail does have a positive impact on residential property values within close proximity, when using street network distances. We prefer street network distances between the residential properties and the closest trail entrance over the often used straight-line distances because potential bicyclists and pedestrians are most likely to travel along the street network to access the trail via the closest trail entrance. In addition to the standard parameter estimation process, we use our hedonic model results to predict the market values for all residential properties around these trail entrances. While numerous studies do account for spatial dependence between locations when estimating the hedonic model parameters and when using these results to predicting real estate prices (Gelfand et al. 2004; Valente et al. 2005), many results presented in the relevant literature are somewhat restrictive as they have been derived using small data samples. Even though the use of a sparse spatial weight matrix tremendously decreases the computational complexity of spatial econometric models (see LeSage and Pace 2009), many studies nevertheless give preference to explicitly modeling the decay in spatial correlations between locations through use of various functional forms (see Cressie 1993). Until recently, these processes were rather restrictive in that they were applicable only to relatively small data sets. To overcome the data-limiting factor, we apply the “modified” spatial predictive process as proposed by Banerjee et al. (2008) and as extended by Finley et al. (2009). Reducing the number of observations to a significantly smaller number of representative locations, we can overcome the computational challenge of our large data set during the estimation procedure. Through interpolation techniques, estimated parameters can be predicted from the representative smaller sample back to our large data set. After the parameter estimation, we apply the same predictive process to create a contour map consisting of predicted house prices around the trail entrances. To assess the quality of this estimation procedure, we will compare them with the results from more traditional specifications in the spatial econometric literature. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the relevant and still sparse literature on trails and greenbelts and their impacts on house prices within the hedonic framework. Section 3 presents the study area and the data set and Sect. 4 discusses in greater detail the Spatial Process as well as other widely used alternative methods for handling hedonic pricing models with georeferenced data sets. In Sect. 5, we discuss and compare all model results from our four empirical hedonic specifications. Finally, in Sect. 6, we present the contour map of predicted property values around the trail entrances.",19

Winters,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Researchers, policymakers, and the general public are all interested in differences in the quality of life across areas. Quality of life differences affect individual welfare and have been found to be an important driver of metropolitan population growth (Rappaport 2007, 2009). A number of popular publications have emerged that rank the quality of life across cities and states based on their observable characteristics. Following Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982), economists and other researchers have ranked the quality of life across areas based on compensating differentials in labor, housing, and consumption markets.Footnote 1 In other words, the existence of a spatial equilibrium necessitates that workers accept lower “real wages” to live in nicer areas. Computing real wages requires estimating cost of living differences across areas, and doing so is one of the biggest challenges faced by quality of life researchers. Differences in the cost of living across areas are mostly attributable to differences in the cost of housing (Beeson and Eberts 1989), but are also at least partially attributable to differences in the prices of non-housing goods (Gabriel et al. 2003). There are two main issues in computing cost of living differences. The first is that good information on non-housing prices is not readily available for all areas. Researchers usually deal with this by either ignoring non-housing prices altogether (e.g., Roback 1982; Blomquist et al. 1988) or by inferring non-housing prices from housing prices when non-housing prices are not available (e.g., Shapiro 2006; Albouy 2008).Footnote 2
 The second major issue in computing cost of living differences is whether housing prices should be measured by rental payments, estimated homeowner user costs based on housing values, or both (Winters 2009). Most studies assume that the true user cost of housing can be accurately measured by both housing rents and housing values and, therefore, measure housing prices using a weighted average of rental payments and homeowner values, with greater weight given to homeowner values.Footnote 3 However, the recent housing bubble has caused rents and homeowner values to diverge considerably (Verbrugge 2008; Garner and Verbrugge 2009). Even absent a housing bubble, the ratio of housing values to rents is likely to differ across areas because of different expectations about the future growth of rents (Clark 1995; Davis et al. 2008). Rental payments reflect the actual current user cost of housing for a specific period of time. However, a house is an asset that yields a stream of future benefits to its owner. The value of a house is equal to the expected net present value of the future benefit stream it generates. Areas where rents are expected to grow more quickly over time should have a higher ratio of current values to current rents because the expected increase in future rental payments is capitalized into current housing values. Therefore, measuring the current user cost of housing using house values may be inappropriate for estimating the cost of living. Because of this, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures housing prices solely by rents and not values in computing the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Winters (2009) also suggests that the relationship between wages and prices across metropolitan areas is consistent with the spatial equilibrium hypothesis when housing prices are measured by rents, but not when housing prices are measured by housing values. Furthermore, Banzhaf and Farooque (2012) find that local public amenities and income levels are more highly correlated with rents than owner values. Using a framework similar to Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982), this paper computes quality of life estimates across metropolitan areas of the US for the year 2007. The preferred estimates compute housing prices using quality-adjusted rents because rents reflect the current user cost of housing, but housing values are based on the future stream of benefits provided by the house. For comparison, we also compute quality of life estimates for which housing prices are measured solely by housing values. The two measures of quality of life are very highly correlated, but value-based estimates are considerably more dispersed across areas than the rent-based estimates. That is, the value-based estimates report a higher implicit value of amenities in high amenity areas than do the rent-based estimates. This is likely due in large part to the dramatic growth in housing values prior to 2007. However, we also estimate quality of life values for 2000 and find that a similar relationship holds in that year, though to a much lesser extent. Value-based estimates are notably more dispersed than rent-based estimates. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents the theoretical framework based on the seminal work of Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982). The third section discusses the empirical approach and data used in this study. A fourth section presents the results for the quality of life estimates. A fifth section examines the effect of quality of life on changes in rents and housing values from 2000 to 2007. A final section concludes.",12

Globalization, technological advances, and economies of agglomeration have generated strong growth in many urban centers. Whether this growth in the core will create new opportunities in the periphery or draw resources from the periphery, however, is not clear a priori, and the relative strength of positive and negative spillovers of urban development is a long-standing and contested issue in regional and development economics. Myrdal (1957), explaining development in a third-world context, suggested that growth in core economies would tend to produce “backwash” effects in the periphery, drawing labor and capital out of the periphery. Hirschman (1958) argued that backwash effects would fade over time as the positive effects of development in the core “spread” across space, generating new opportunities in the hinterland. The core–periphery framework has been applied in a developed nation context for analysis of spread and backwash effects between large urban centers and their surrounding peripheries (Richardson 1976; Gaile 1980; Hughes and Holland 1994; Henry et al. 1999; Partridge et al. 2007). Core–periphery models in the developed nation context are spatial models that draw on the insights of central place theory to understand the spatial organization of economic activity around large urban centers. Richardson (1976, 1979) extended the static central place concepts underlying the core–periphery models to explore the dynamic spread and backwash spillover implications of investments in “growth poles”, suggesting that very long time horizons are needed to evaluate the extent of spread and backwash effects. Richardson also suggested that spread and backwash effects could occur simultaneously. Interest in the spatial dimensions of core–periphery growth was sidelined by the emergence of the New Economic Geography in the early 1990s. With the maturation of the New Economic Geography models, there is a re-emergence of central place theory (Mulligan et al. 2012) and new interest in core–periphery economic interdependence (Hibbard et al. 2011; Dabson et al. 2012) and the spatial evolution of urban systems. The impact of urban core growth on the periphery in developed economies has been explored at various geographic scales over the past several decades. Some studies have analyzed core–periphery economic relationships in particular cores and their surrounding peripheries (Henry et al. 1999; Hughes and Holland 1994). Others have taken advantage of new GIS capabilities and examined population and employment patterns in large urban systems across the U.S. and Canada (Partridge et al. 2007, 2008). There has been no research to date, however, that has looked in depth at a single core–periphery regional system to see whether changing core–periphery economic relationships over a long time period suggests the dominance of spread effects or backwash effects. We believe this study of the changes in core–periphery economic interdependence in the Portland, Oregon, regionFootnote 1 between 1982 and 2006 represents the first attempt to examine long-term changes in commuting and core–periphery trade spillover patterns for evidence of the relative strength of spread effects and backwash effects.",8

Further, there exists a negative link between regional unemployment and wages, as discussed by the wage curve literature following Blanchflower and Oswald (1994). Several theoretical models exist to explain, how a wage curve might arise. However, such models usually rely on exogenous disparities to explain the location of regions on the wage curve. Further, the stability of the wage curve in these models often relies on the assumption labor immobility (Blien 2003). We therefore combine efficiency wages with endogenous agglomeration through New Economic Geography arguments to motivate, how a wage curve endogenously arises and why it is stable in the presence of migration. Further, we discuss how labor market frictions affect regional disparities. Figure 1 highlights the disparities of regional unemployment rates and wages in German planing regions. Whereas the unemployment rate was 2.6 % in Ingolstadt, it amounted to up to 16.3 % in Mecklenburgische Seenplatte in 2008. Similar patterns hold true for other countries as well. Empirical studies such as Blanchard and Katz (1992), Decressin and Fatás (1995), and Overman and Puga (2002) further show that such disparities between regional unemployment rates are persistent. Disparities in regional unemployment rates are closely linked to disparities in regional wages: In regions where the unemployment rate is comparatively low, wages are comparatively high. This is known as the wage curve and visible in Fig. 1. Following the seminal work of Blanchflower and Oswald (1994), an extensive literature has emerged, providing evidence in favor of the wage curve for a huge number of countries.Footnote 1 Results by Eckey et al. (2008) further show that this relationship holds true when using real wages instead of nominal wages.
 There already exist several theoretical models to explain the wage curve relationship. For example, Campbell and Orszag (1998) use efficiency wages or Sato (2000) uses search theory as a motivation for the wage curve. A survey of such theoretical approaches is presented by Blien (2003). Blien (2003) further argues that the “most promising” approach to motivate the wage curve is the efficiency wage framework. He argues that wage bargaining models might be equally suitable when unions bargain on the local or firm level. Here, however, efficiency wages are applied instead so that the models results also hold true for countries where bargaining takes place on the sectoral or national level. Empirical evidence confirms that efficiency wages are at work, as highlighted by a recent meta-analysis by Peach and Stanley (2009). A drawback of most theoretical models of the wage curve relationship is that they rely on exogenous disparities between the regions. Further, the stability of the relationship usually crucially relies on labor immobility (Blien 2003) or disparities in the endowment of amenities. For example, the wage curve relationship in the seminal paper by Blanchard and Katz (1992) can only persist because people in regions at the lower tail of the wage curve are compensated for the poorer labor market conditions by local amenities.Footnote 2 Without those amenities, people from regions at the lower tail of the wage curve would migrate to regions at the upper tail, which would result in an adjustment process such that regional disparities disappear and the wage curve collapses into a point. The idea of this paper therefore is to use the arguments of the New Economic Geography to explain how disparities between regional economies endogenously arise and to combine these with the arguments from the efficiency wage literature to show, why this is associated with a wage curve relationship. Our basic argument is that, due to love for variety, monopolistic competition, increasing returns to scale and transport costs, firms in agglomerated regions are able to pay higher wages. Therefore, the incentive to shirk is lower for employees in agglomerations which results in a lower unemployment rate in the agglomeration compared to the periphery. Hence, lower wages in the periphery are associated with higher peripheral unemployment since wage setting frictions are more binding there. Further, we show that the regional unemployment disparities increase in the level of wage setting frictions.",8

For instance, entry (or the threat of entry) of new firms is thought to force down prices, eliminating excess profits. Entry can also stimulate innovation, increasing productivity and product quality. And new and young firms have been shown to be important job contributors. Most previous entry studies (Dunne et al. 1988; Audretsch and Fritsch 1994; Keeble and Walker 1994; Love 1996) have used aggregated start-ups and in-migration together or focused on manufacturing firms. The entry dynamics of retail firms are investigated by Pakes and Ericson (1998), Ilmakunnas and Topi (1999) and Daunfeldt et al. (2006), but the latter is the only study (as far as we know) that (also) examines the entry of wholesale firms. This is surprising since, as the manufacturing sector shrinks, it is increasingly important to study entry more broadly. Wholesale firms are also important in their roles as intermediaries between goods-producers and consumer-targeted businesses (Kask et al. 2002). Daunfeldt et al. (2006) found that large local markets attracted the entry of Swedish wholesale firms during 1990–1996; but that study could not distinguish between new start-ups and in-migration of firms. Heflebower (1957, 364) points out the problem of ignoring entry by firms established elsewhere and in assuming that they have no advantages as entrants. From the perspective of a municipality or a region, it might not matter whether a new firm in the local market is a new start-up or is the result of in-migration of an already established firm. In fact, the latter could be preferable, as it is more likely to be larger and providing more jobs. Using a data set covering 13,471 Swedish limited liability wholesale firms during the period 2000–2004, we examine the effects of both start-ups and in-migration into local markets. Our results indicate that expected profits are fairly unimportant for both start-ups and in-migration of firms, supporting results from other industries (Geroski 1995). The presence of a university more than doubled the expected number of new entrants, but had no statistically significant effect on the expected number of in-migrating firms. A 5-percentage-point increase in the share of adults with a post-secondary education increases the expected number of new start-ups by 20 % and the expected number of in-migrating firms by 9 %. Municipalities with large harbors, international airports or large railroad classification yards nearly triples the expected number of start-ups and increases the expected number of in-migrating firms with 53 %. Finally, high local tax rates decrease both start-ups and in-migration, with a 1-percentage-point rise in local taxes decreasing the expected number of start-ups by 10 % and that of in-migrating firms by 9 %. The next section presents our hypotheses regarding what might affect new start-ups and in-migration of firms, followed by data in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, our empirical method and descriptive statistics are presented, while our results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes and draws conclusions.",9

Point in case is the OS description of the incorrect evaluation of the impact of the transport system in the Netherlands, with ‘gross’ multipliers and ‘gross’ output being used simultaneously, hence upward biasing its impact by double counting. We agree with OS that these professional malpractices should be avoided but disagree on their proposal on theoretical grounds. In point of fact, OS proposal is conceptually faulty and the supporting theorems are incorrect, as simple, non-curiosum counterexamples testify. Chronologically, the essence of the scientific debate can be followed in De Mesnard (2002, 2007a, b), Dietzenbacher (2005), and Oosterhaven (2004, 2007). We share De Mesnard’s concern that OS ‘net’ multipliers are empirically unstable since they depend upon the magnitude of the exogenous shock; hence, they are hardly usable in rigorous quantitative analysis. Due to their instability, De Mesnard (2002, 2007a) concludes that they can only be used for the evaluation of small changes since then induced errors will also be small. Dietzenbacher (2005), in turn, tries to rationalise the discussion, suggesting an interesting reinterpretation of the OS proposal as a set of parameters for the identification of strategic sectors. He also asserts that OS ‘net’ multipliers are as plausible as any other multipliers, conditional to the question they want to address. We disagree with Dietzenbacher’s view of the problem regarding their reasonability. To give support to our alternative view, we will delve deeper into the conceptual root of the OS definitions. We shall argue that the definitions are ill founded for the claimed purpose and, in fact, they hardly belong to the category of multipliers since they have no natural interpretation in term of cause-effect, neither in economics nor in mathematics, and they do not capture economy-wide interaction effects. The implication is that OS ‘net’ multipliers cannot—should not—be used as predictors. Additionally, the purported supporting theorems of OS will be proved to be erroneous in enunciation and demonstration. Since ‘net’ multipliers are being used in empirical analysis (e.g. Márquez 2011) and there are even attempts to extend them (e.g. Temurshoev and Oosterhaven 2010), we believe it is of paramount relevance to discuss and explicate their inner conceptual difficulties. The paper follows this organisation. Sections 2 and 3 are the core sections. In Sect. 2, we elaborate some of the needed technical details and facts on standard multiplier analysis and, in their light, we recap OS proposal. Section 3 presents and discusses the main analytical results and economic counterarguments to OS. Section 4 briefly examines possible alternatives, if any. Section 5 concludes.",6

Smith,John Wackes,Tony E. Smith,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Many consumers use alternative financial service providers (AFSPs)—check cashing outlets, payday lenders, pawnshops, rent-to-own stores, auto title lenders, and money transmitters—to conduct some of their financial transactions. While AFSPs are typically found in commercial districts in low- and moderate-income urban neighborhoods, they are increasingly locating in suburban areas where low-wage workers are employed.Footnote 1 Many patrons of AFSPs lack a checking account (unbanked) or have one but, for various reasons, rarely use the services at their financial institution (underbanked). Estimates show that “in 2005, the unbanked and underbanked bought $3 trillion of goods and services with cash and money orders.”Footnote 2 In addition to providing convenient hours for cashing checks, AFSPs offer other services and products, such as short-term payday loans, wire transfers, transit fare passes pre-paid telephone cards, bill paying, and lottery tickets.Footnote 3 However, the fees for these services tend to be higher than those charged at mainstream financial institutions. The high fees, in turn, limit the asset-creating capability of those who frequent AFSPs. Since the services of AFSPs can be rather costly, why do consumers continue to patronize them? A 2004 Fannie Mae Foundation (FMF) study investigated the hypothesis that AFSPs serve the financial needs of patrons by filling a void created by the absence of traditional financial institutions.Footnote 4 This hypothesis, known as the spatial void hypothesis,Footnote 5 was examined in the FMF study by concentrating on check cashing outlets, payday lenders, and pawnshops in eight locations across the country. The FMF study also analyzed whether AFSPs were disproportionately located in minority and low-income neighborhoods. Given the approach taken in the FMF study, the results cast doubt on the spatial void hypothesis in the areas studied. A study by Tony E. Smith, Marvin M. Smith, and John Wackes (SS&W) also tested the spatial void hypothesis by focusing on four counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Footnote 6 In addition to employing techniques used in the FMF study, the SS&W study developed “alternative statistical methods that [were] shown to yield sharper tests of the spatial void hypothesis.”Footnote 7 In contrast with the FMF study, the SS&W study found support for the spatial void hypothesis in the counties investigated. When two different approaches to examining an issue attain opposing viewpoints, it is instructive to further investigate their efficacy. Thus, given the divergent views reached by the different methods used in the FMF and SS&W studies with respect to the spatial void hypothesis, this study provides additional information to evaluate the relative usefulness of the two approaches. Since the SS&W study used selected counties in only one state, this study contrasts the two approaches by testing the applicability of the SS&W findings to other geographical areas by applying SS&W’s alternative methodology to examine the spatial void hypothesis in selected counties in New Jersey and Delaware.Footnote 8

The early literature of New Economic Geography (NEG) (e.g., a seminal paper by Krugman 1991) shows that the increasing return to scale (IRS) industry (manufacturing sector) disperses equally in two symmetric regions when interregional trade costs are high, while it agglomerates in one region when trade costs are low. However, including urban costs in Krugman’s model, the above result is complemented by a redispersion process for low trade costs after the agglomeration process for intermediate trade costs, as shown in Helpman (1998), Tabuchi (1998), Murata and Thisse (2005), Suedekum (2006). The real world is not evenly dispersed. Empirically, (Glaeser and Kohlhase (2004), pp. 218–220) show that population is increasingly centralized in a few metropolitan regions in the US, while people are increasingly decentralized within those regions. This becomes possible due to the automobile and other forms of rapid transit. (Mills and Hamilton (1994), pp. 21–30) have reported that the development of rapid transit greatly decreased the commuting costs during the last century. A similar phenomenon was observed in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, where dense and enormous mass transit networks enable cities to serve large metropolitan populations. Thus, it is important to examine the impact of decreasing (rather than fixed) intraregional commuting costs as well as interregional trade costs on economic activity. Such an objective has been the focus of some previous studies. For example, (Tabuchi and Thisse (2006), Sect. 2) and Murata and Thisse (2005) find that the location pattern of the manufacturing sector depends on the relative sizes of the transportation and commuting costs. Specifically, they show that a dispersed economy emerges when intraregional commuting costs are relatively large, while an agglomerated economy emerges when interregional trade costs are relatively large. However, in their case, with one industry, only two extreme patterns are found.Footnote 1 Furthermore, they cannot answer the following question: What kind of industries constitute the large (or small) cities in a modern society in which both interregional trade costs and intraregional commuting costs are low? Policy makers in small local cities are interested in this issue to attract specific industries to their regions. To answer this question, we theoretically explore the case of multiple industries. There are many ways to differentiate industries, and we consider two kinds of asymmetry between industries. The first lies in trade costs. The Weberian location theory (Weber 1929) states that firms having different trade costs of products usually exhibit different location patterns if the transport costs of raw materials are negligible. While trade cost is the most important factor in NEG studies,Footnote 2 models with asymmetric trade costs among industries have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. This is partly due to its analytical complexity. Indeed, previous studies by Amiti (1998) and Tabuchi and Thisse (2006) are limited to cases of two industries. Furthermore, in Tabuchi and Thisse (2006), the trade costs in one industry must be fixed to zero to obtain some analytical results. Extending the model of Tabuchi and Thisse (2006),Takatsuka and Zeng (2009) examine a case of three industries. However, they assume fixed commuting costs and focus on the dispersion process derived from falling trade costs. In contrast to these existing studies, we focus on the analysis of location patterns with an arbitrary number of industries in a modern society when trade costs and commuting costs are both low. The second asymmetry examined here is the degree of intra-industry competition, measured by the number of firms. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing NEG studies that explore the relationship between intra-industry competition (firm number) and firm location. Needless to say, the competition among firms located near each other is extensively studied in the field of spatial competition (e.g., Hotelling 1929; d’Aspremont et al. 1979), and a similar effect to spatial competition is also considered in existing NEG models. It is noteworthy that, different from spatial competition, intra-industry competition refers to the overall (nonspatial) intensity of competition in an industry. Recently, Combes and Duranton (2006) and Alsleben (2005) have analyzed the effects of intra-industry competition on firm location by use of duopolistic and/or oligopolistic models with endogenous knowledge spillovers. In their models, the product markets are perfectly integrated, while the labor markets are completely segmented (workers are immobile across regions) in order to focus on the costs and benefits of labor poaching. They show that firms in an industry with weaker intra-industry competition tend to co-locate, since the incentive to poach strategic workers in other firms is stronger. However, they did not clarify how the degree of intra-industry competition affects firm location when product markets are not perfectly integrated and workers are mobile between regions, which is a typical issue in NEG studies. Such an intra-industry competition effect is not examined either in Tabuchi and Thisse (2006) or in Takatsuka and Zeng (2009) because the former assumes intersectoral labor mobility and the latter assumes an identical firm number for all industries. Our results, which are surprisingly simple and economically reasonable, reveal some distinct rules in industrial location. First, at most, one industry disperses, while others agglomerate in a region according to their ratios of relative trade costs to firm numbers. Industries of high (resp. low) ratios compose the larger (resp. smaller) region. The result generates the following corollaries. On the one hand, if the trade costs are the same for goods in all industries, industries are separately located according to their degrees of intra-industry competition. Specifically, industries with stronger (resp. weaker) competition constitute a smaller (resp. larger) region. Intuitively, a strong intra-industry competition reduces profit. Thus, the incentive to increase their profit by locating in the big market is weaker for industries with stronger competition. On the other hand, if the degree of intra-industry competition is the same for all industries, industries are separately located according to their trade costs. Specifically, industries with higher (resp. lower) trade costs compose a larger (resp. smaller) region. This is quite intuitive, since industries with higher trade costs can save more trade costs by locating their activities in the bigger market, which is consistent with the classical Weberian location theory. We emphasize that this result is correct if commuting costs as well as trade costs are sufficiently small.Footnote 3
 The second result is that the population differential between the two regions depends on the relative commuting cost. Specifically, the population differential is larger when the commuting costs are relatively lower. It is noteworthy that this result can only be derived in a framework of multiple industries because only full dispersion and full agglomeration are possible in the case of one industry and the population ratio there trivially becomes either one or infinity. While our model assumes two regions and many industries, Anas and Xiong (2003) analyze a model with two symmetric industries, one intermediate service sector and many cities. They show that a lower cost of trading manufactures (resp. services) favors a system of specialized (resp. diversified) cities. However, their symmetric setting necessarily generates symmetric cities. In other words, their model does not answer the question of the kinds of industries constituting the large (or small) cities. Furthermore, they assume that the equilibrium city size is achieved when the utility level of a city resident is maximized by competitive city developers, as in Henderson (1988). Therefore, their mechanism of determining city size is quite different from our model, in which the atomistic behavior of workers is stressed, as it is in NEG studies. Meanwhile, Zeng (2006) shows a separating process for multiple industries, which are differentiated by the production costs rather than the trade costs and the number of firm. Furthermore, the dispersion force in Zeng (2006) is obtained from the agricultural sector, while the dispersion force of this paper is the urban costs. Thus, our results complement the redispersion pattern obtained by Zeng (2006). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The NEG model of multiple industries is established in Sect. 2, and some effects determining utility differentials in the model are clarified. Possible location patterns in the model are then analytically examined in Sect. 3. Numerical simulations are shown in Sect. 4 to complement the previous analytical results. Finally, Sect. 5 is the conclusion.",3

With the help of theoretical reasoning and empirical testing, scholars have examined aspects of knowledge provision and use, like institutional changes and learning processes of universities (Etzkowitz 2004; Srinivas and Viljamaa 2008), different kinds of knowledge interaction and transfer channels (Schartinger et al. 2001, 2002; D’Este and Patel 2007; Fritsch et al. 2007; Jensen et al. 2007) or regional economic implications of collaborations (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas 2008; Drucker and Goldstein 2007; Kauffeld-Monz and Fritsch 2008; Varga 2009; Uyarra 2010). Growing expectations in universities as engines of regional innovativeness have entailed the mushrooming of new institutions and policies for strengthening university–industry–government linkages and their outcomes (Bozeman 2000; Boucher et al. 2003; Debackere and Veugelers 2005; D’Este and Patel 2007; Wright et al. 2008; Geuna and Muscio 2009). Universities are now counted on as active contributors to the regional innovation system and economic development (Godin and Gingras 2000; Bercovitz and Feldman 2006; Benneworth and Arbo 2007; Srinivas and Viljamaa 2008; Caniëls and van den Bosch 2011). They shift towards the ‘entrepreneurial university’ that does not only contribute to regional but also to national and international innovation (Etzkowitz 2004; Bramwell and Wolfe 2008; Goldstein 2010) by translating academic research into commercial outputs in terms of a ‘third mission’ besides scientific research and teaching (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). For adequately analysing universities’ functions in knowledge transfer, we suggest to develop theoretical concepts together with empirical tools measuring them. In contrast to a focus on regional impact that marks many recent studies (Boucher et al. 2003; Gunasekara 2006; Drucker and Goldstein 2007; Uyarra 2010; Caniëls and van den Bosch 2011), we employ an extended geographical view considering universities’ functions as being shaped by regional, national and international orientations. In doing so, we can draw on a number of reviews on universities and their geographical context written in the last decade, which have analysed institutional, social or political factors embedding or disembedding universities, eventually influencing the development of their region of location (Bercovitz and Feldman 2006; Drucker and Goldstein 2007; Power and Malmberg 2008; Caniëls and van den Bosch 2011). Taking into account the various, at times contradictory mechanisms via which universities are linked to regional economic processes (Uyarra 2010), and the debate on whether and under which conditions universities actually contribute to regional innovation (Power and Malmberg 2008), we aim at achieving a more comprehensive understanding of relevant mechanisms: We suggest that universities’ integration into scale-crossing collaboration systems contributes to regional innovation. In order to more clearly disentangle universities’ functions in knowledge transfer from a geographical perspective, we further suggest better matching theoretical conceptualization and empirical measurement. Analysing universities’ functions in knowledge transfer confronts us with the complex interplay of a university’s self-determined or superimposed role, its potential or expected input to regional innovativeness, and characteristics of the surrounding economy that shape absorptive capacities of regional players. This seems to make it virtually impossible to include all of this into a concise account of universities’ regional relationships of knowledge-intensive collaboration. The intricate question of how the ‘region’ of a university can be unequivocally distinguished must be answered. Based on this, we need to find out why there are quite a few cases where the knowledge flows from the university to regional partners fall short of expectations (Bramwell and Wolfe 2008; Fromhold-Eisebith 1992, 2006). We suggest that this has to do with: unrealistic assumptions about what a university can contribute to innovation-oriented regional development through knowledge transfer because knowledge flows are usually not confined to geographical borders and may only show effects after decades, as well as inappropriate theoretical or empirical approaches applied to capturing relevant systems of relationships and their geographies. In our paper we will show that knowledge transfer has a local-regional, national and international dimension, calling for further advancement of theory and empirics in order to better understand and capture factors that shape universities’ impact on regional development. Two main objectives provide the guideline of argumentation: first, we review which roles and functions have been devoted to universities, drawing on relevant concepts (Sect. 2). From these debates, a set of qualities is derived that should mark a university’s integration into collaborative linkages in order to make them effective, including scale-crossing geographical aspects. Second, we discuss various empirical approaches that have been applied to assessing a university’s integration into systems of relationships, revealing methodological achievements and shortcomings (Sect. 3). Based on that, we consider how a university’s knowledge transfer can adequately be investigated by matching theory and empirics or by further developing and tailoring theoretical and empirical approaches (Sect. 4). We wrap up with some suggestions on how future research may benefit from our results (Sect. 5).",39

Wahl,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Clustering and agglomeration can be observed worldwide on different geographical levels. The explanation of the regional economic structure and the existence of clusters is a central concern of regional economics and economic geography. About 4/5ths of the world’s domestic product are generated in three geographical centres (NAFTA, EU and East Asia). However, there are still some significant economic disparities in many countries and regions: in Spain, the economic activity is concentrated around Madrid, Barcelona and the Navarra region. Between Tel Aviv and Haifa one can identify the so-called Silicon Wodi. In Germany, there is an East–West division, whereas in Italy, the division is North–South. There are also sector differentiations. Computer and software productions are located in Silicon Valley, and the Italian fashion industry is concentrated in the Po valley. Obviously, location advantages are relevant in determining where the firm chooses its allocation of production. These include factor prices, access to customers, regulations with respect to trade, capital flows, institutional stability, economic risk and preferences. The literature in regional economics has developed a fundamental interest in the spatial allocation of resources, the role of its agglomeration in specific regions or countries and its role for stability.Footnote 1 In particular, welfare aspects of regional capital agglomeration (Pflüger and Südekum 2008), the location decisions of firms and the economics of the induction of a clustering process have been subjected to thorough investigation stressing, among other things, the importance of spatial economies of scale and scope (Pontes 2005; Pontes and Parr 2005). The purposes of this paper is to incorporate portfolio theory and two-moment decision-making into the theoretical model of a representative firm facing multiple risk of real net returns from investment in different regions. Portfolio theory can be extended to regional economics when a portfolio and invested real assets are analogous to a country. Risk in regional economy stems from uncertain cost of location and the business cycle. For example, the euro crisis loosens trade union influence on wages especially in countries and regions in the periphery of the euro zone. Officials at the European Union, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, want to decentralize nations’ bargaining systems, allowing firms to set wages directly through negotiations with their workers. In fact, regional cost of location and business cycle are more volatile than on a national or union scale. The portfolio theory can deal with risk associated with changes in capital investment in regional economy. To illustrate the relationship between diversification and capital investment from the portfolio theory, suppose there are two regions. The expected net return of investment in region 1 (region 2) is 7 % (12 %); risk is (measured by standard deviation) 9 % in region 1 (8 % in region 2). The investment share is the choice variable of the firm. When the correlation coefficient between both regions is 0.5, investment shares of 60 and 40 % will lead to expected net returns of 10 % and risk of 7.3 %. In brief, portfolio theory puts an emphasis on risk, diversification, correlation and risk preferences. The portfolio theory indicates that diversification can reduce risk in net returns. In other words, the negative or positive relationship between regional diversity of capital investment relies on correlation of uncertain cost of location, the business cycle between regions and the degree of risk aversion of the representative firm. Many countries have spatial differences in production and productivity, mostly because of economic distance between lagging and leading areas. However, all countries seek unity by lowering the barriers of internal divisions. For instance, the EU’s economic and social cohesion policy is implemented by structural funds to support regions of low economic development. An interesting question that has been discussed in the context of the regional policy (in the European Union, for example) is whether or not globalization will promote regional mobility of capital in order to achieve economic efficiency and stability (see, e.g., Baldwin and Wyplosz 2012). Our study demonstrates that if economic integration within a country (or union) leads to a greater degree of correlation between local cost conditions, then—under some conditions—regional investment decision induces regional distribution of capital to be more concentrated than diverse. Agglomeration forces, e.g. market size force and economies of scale, favour regional concentration, whereas dispersion forces, e.g. local forces of competition, favour regional dispersion of economic activity and location. Economic risks of regional returns on investments are also in the realm of regional and spatial economics. Optimal regional allocation of scarce resources and optimum decisions on the location of firms’ economic activities are affected by a risk diversification force. That is, risk-averse investors and firms are attracted to regions which have higher expected net returns on investment and lower return risk. The correlation of stochastic regional returns is also important, as it measures the risk diversification potential of regional economic activities of firms. Hence, one can relate regional risk diversification to economic integration. Furthermore, portfolio theory can be tested empirically (see, for example, Chiang 2009; Schmidt and Broll 2009). Our paper concentrates on the interaction between the regional allocation of investments and the regional policy approach of harmonization, i.e., less uneven regional economic development. In a two-region country, we study the optimal regional share of investment of a risk-averse firm. Regional policy affects the firm’s decision-making process. We show that a higher correlation of risky regional business costs causes a disincentive to diversify. As a result, agglomeration of capital to one region may occur although the regional policy approach focuses on the dispersion of capital across regions. In order to identify economic risk diversification on regional capital allocation, we need a deeper insight into the structure of risk preferences. To this end, we follow Meyer (1987) to characterize the firm’s risk aversion by a utility function that includes expected incomes and income risks. The two-moment decision framework reveals that the magnitude of the elasticity of risk aversion with respect to risk parameters determines whether or not the correlation of regional costs and business cycle works either as a regional agglomeration or a regional dispersion force. Note that our decision model of regional allocation of capital under uncertainty is not in conflict with maximizing expected utility but has notably useful properties (Meyer 1987; Levy 1989; Eichner and Wagener 2003, 2011). We develop a model to demonstrate our claim that whether or not a higher similarity of risky regional business costs and business cycle will make capital allocation regionally more dispersed than concentrated depends crucially upon the firm’s risk aversion elasticity. Multiple stochastic differences (in business cycle and the cost of locations) across regions are a basic element of our study. Differences in economic development across regions can be explained by differences in productivity, business environment, industrial policy, trade policy, regulations, fiscal and tax policies and most noteably differences in labour markets, geography and institutions. Acemoglu et al. (2002) offer a thorough discussion of institutions and geography. The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines a model of a firm’s regional capital allocation under risk aversion and facing multiple risks. Since the firm does not know ex ante the ex post realization of the net return of investment, it exposes itself to investment uncertainty. We derive a symmetry result of regional investments which we use as a benchmark. In Sect. 3, we discuss our main result: the impact of risk and risk preferences upon the regional asymmetry of regional capital investment flows. In Sect. 4, we discuss the relevance of our result for reality. One type of spatial econometric model is considered for spatial dependence. If the regional policy decision is made prior to the investment decision, regional policy can have strategic effects under plausible assumptions on the preference of the firm. Section 5 concludes.",3
51.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,08 June 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-013-0568-y,Local urban growth controls and regional economic growth,December 2013,Boaz Nandwa,Laudo M. Ogura,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In fast-growing regions in the U.S., local jurisdictions have adopted land use regulations to restrict population growth and/or urban sprawl. These measures, known as urban growth controls (UGC), attempt to prevent future problems in the city like congestion in the use of infrastructure or government services, pollution, and loss of open space. Examples of control measures include urban growth boundaries, urban service boundaries, building permit restrictions, development fees, impact fees, large-lot zoning, and infrastructure or construction requirements (Brueckner 1999, and Glaeser et al. 2006a).Footnote 1
 Since UGCs improve the expectations on future living conditions in the city and restrain housing supply growth in the region, land and housing prices tend to increase in controlled places (Fischel 1990 provides empirical evidence; Brueckner 1999 discusses theoretical models; Green et al. 2005 shows that regulations reduces housing supply elasticity). With limited and expensive land available, housing development and population growth have been diverted to uncontrolled places (Levine 1999; Mayer and Sommerville, 2000). As a result, there have been increased commuting flows of workers from uncontrolled to controlled cities (Ogura 2005, 2010). If there are enough uncontrolled areas where new workers can find housing, regional production might not be significantly affected, except for the inefficiencies in commuting patterns (Sasaki 1998; Ogura 2005). However, as land use regulations can become widespread in some regions due to strategic behavior of local governments (Brueckner 1998), businesses might start to divert production to other regions where there is greater labor supply growth.Footnote 2 Long-run effects of growth controls on production might be stronger because young educated workers (who are often needed for business expansion) are more mobile than older workers (who are already settled economically and socially in the region).Footnote 3
Glaeser et al. (2006a) report on complaints from business leaders in the Boston area about the difficulty to attract and retain young educated workers due to housing restrictions. Kelley and Rabin (2006) report on a similar problem in Santa Barbara-CA. Related effects of UGC on regional economies have been studied by recent works. Glaeser et al. (2006b) find a negative impact of housing regulations on population growth, but positive effects on per capita income growth and on housing prices across U.S. metropolitan areas for the 1980–2000 period. Saks (2008) shows that employment growth in U.S. metropolitan areas was negatively affected by restrictive land use regulations during 1980–2002. Vermeulen and Van Ommeren (2009) find the same result for the Dutch Randstad area during 1973–2002. Considering the negative effects of local UGC on employment, Glaeser et al. (2006a) and Glaeser (2007) suggest that regional coordination or inclusionary housing programs are needed to allow businesses to continue expanding. In fact, Nelson and Peterman (2000) show that regional growth management in mid-sized metropolitan regions seems to have helped increase their shares of personal income in the U.S. during the 1972–1992 period. In this paper, we analyze how adoption of UGC by local governments affects regional production. While each city adopts controls for its own benefit, agglomeration externalities can lead to inefficient outcomes. Following the existing economic literature, we assumed that local controls are imposed to benefit landowners (see Brueckner 1999, for a survey of the literature). In the so-called “amenity-creation” models, land rents increase in controlled cities because UGC lessen negative population growth effects like congestion, pollution, and loss of open space (Brueckner 1990; Engle et al. 1992). On the other hand, land “supply-restriction” models predict that UGCs cause a region-wide increase in rents as mobile households bid up in an attempt to avoid moving to fringe areas of uncontrolled cities (Brueckner 1995; Helsley and Strange 1995; Brueckner and Lai 1996). To simplify, we assume open regional economies (i.e., UGC cause negligible diversion of households to other cities in the same region), so that land rents are increased only through the amenity-creation effect. The open economy assumption allows us to focus on production effects caused by population diversion across regions, ignoring the distortions from the reallocation of population across places in the region.Footnote 4 In our basic model, suburban jurisdictions are exclusively residential and the adoption of UGC restrict the growth of the regional labor supply because population growth is diverted to other regions. Hence, because production depends on the labor supply, UGC hinders production growth in the region. While slower growth might be desirable to avoid congestion effects, we find that local adoption of controls is stricter than optimal when each local government neglects the loss of agglomeration economies that hurts other jurisdictions in the region.Footnote 5 This result is reverted only if there are strong negative externalities from population growth that can affect the entire region (rather than only the cities that are growing). Because excessive housing regulation forces production to move away from controlled areas, other regions and countries might be affected. Moreover, distorted production location could prevent productivity gains from agglomeration in industries that are more sensitive to inelastic labor supply. To achieve optimal production growth, regional coordination or planning becomes desirable,Footnote 6 but it might be politically easier to stimulate population growth in some places in the region to offset the excessive restriction in controlled cities (for instance, Massachusetts’ Chapters 40R and 40S provide state grants to cities that allow greater housing development). However, this alternative can lead to other types of inefficiencies because it distorts the distribution of population across cities and requires taxation to fund transfers (which typically causes other distortions in the economy). The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we analyze the efficiency of local UGC in a model with strong agglomeration economies in production, showing that planning or coordination is desirable at the regional level. Then, we discuss whether this need still holds when some jurisdictions refrain from controlling population. Last, we discuss the case with diminishing marginal returns in production, when local adoption of controls can be more efficient than under partial coordination among jurisdictions. Concluding remarks follow.",1

Cebula,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The operation of major league baseball teams is a very complex enterprise involving the marketing of a diverse multi-dimensional entertainment commodity (Scully 1989; Baade and Tiehen 1990; Quirk and Fort 1992; Zimbalist 1992; Burger and Walters 2003; Denaux et al. 2011; Demiralp et al. 2012).Footnote 1 At the uppermost tier of major league baseball are the franchise teams playing games principally in either the National League or the American League.Footnote 2 Team performance, especially winning percentage, plays a key role in attendance at major league baseball games. Marketing policies/actions at the major league level involve myriad forms of de facto services and commodities, especially the playing of major league baseball games (predominantly in the form of regular season games but also extensively in the form of post-season games, beginning with play-off games to Division Championships and culminating in the “World Series”), which generates revenues not only through ticket sales, television revenue, and radio revenue but also through concession sales (soft drinks, beer, hot dogs, popcorn, candy) on the one hand and a diverse variety of merchandising, indeed often expensive merchandising (such as the sale of shirts of star players, uniforms, baseballs, team baseball caps, bats, pennant flags, and the like). Another level of professional baseball is the multi-tiered system of minor league teams, a mechanism within which the screening of players with potential for major league baseball participation occurs and through which the development of players with talent occurs such that at least some portion of minor league players are “called up” to a major league baseball team for a chance to gain a spot on the major league baseball roster. Playing in the minor league in theory helps players to develop their skills. Arguably, minor league play exposes players to a combination of playing experience and physical conditioning, as well as coaching and guidance; indeed, players can learn from other players. In addition, those actively playing in minor league games have the opportunity to learn to cope with adversity such as “distractions” from hecklers and noisy crowds. In combination, these various experiences from playing in the minor leagues can enhance players’ abilities to potentially succeed in the major league. As Gitter and Rhoads (2010, p. 614) observe, “... minor league baseball teams serve mostly as player development grounds for their Major League Baseball affiliate...” Similarly, Cebula and Belton (1996, p. 151) characterize minor league teams as venues “... where prospective major leaguers are trained and guided into...maturity, and given the playing experience, teamwork skills and knowledge necessary to...play ball in the major leagues.” Indeed, Gitter and Rhoads (2010, p. 614) argue that since “... player development often takes precedence over winning at the minor league level... minor league attendance trends are generally ignored.” According to Siegfried and Eisenberg (1980), minor league baseball attendance is not dependent on the quality of a team’s play on the field. Indeed, certain studies (including Siegfried and Eisenberg 1980; Cebula and Belton 1996; and Gifis and Sommers 2006) argue that minor league baseball attendance is driven largely by marketing and promotions. However, recent studies such as those by Gitter and Rhoads (2010) and Anthony et al. (2011) challenge this perspective to some degree, finding evidence that on-field baseball performance by the home team can in fact influence game attendance. The purpose of the present empirical study is to contribute to this evolving literature by identifying key economic, marketing/promotion, team performance, and other determinants of game attendance at minor league baseball games, after controlling for game scheduling considerations such as the day of the week and the month of the baseball season. To ensure greater comparability of data between teams and hence greater dependability and relevance of the results, this study focuses upon a single grouping of teams, the Carolina League. The Carolina League consists of eight teams serving eight metropolitan areas: Lynchburg City, VA; Winston-Salem, NC; Wilmington, DE; Salem City, VA; Myrtle Beach, SC; Prince William County, VA; Lenoir City, NC; and Frederick County, MD. The analysis investigates an unbalanced panel data set for the five-year period 2007-2011.",4

Central-local fiscal relations have evolved over time in two distinct phases since 1978: the transitional phase of 1980–1993 and the post-1994 phase (Jin et al. 2005). During the 1980s and early 1990s, China initiated a series of decentralisation reforms aimed at promoting local economic growth by providing more incentives to local governments (Zhang 2006). The highly centralised fiscal system stemming from the Soviet Socialism pattern was replaced by the “Fiscal Revenue Share System” (cai zheng bao gan zhi) in 1980, in which the central and provincial governments each began to ‘eat in separate kitchens’. Under that system, the fiscal contracts were established from the top down, that is, the central-provincial revenue-sharing contract was established by the national government, the provincial-prefecture relation was established by the provincial government and so on (Shen et al. 2006). The local government was allowed to retain some revenue if there was a surplus after remitting revenues of a fixed sum to the central government. Thus, the local government had a strong incentive to collect revenue and also promote the development of the local economy and so expand its tax base. Evidence suggests that this decentralisation made a significant contribution to the subsequent rapid economic growth (see, e.g., Lin and Liu 2000), with an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.9 % from 1980 to 1993. However, there were side-effects of the contract system. One of these effects was that the local government could contribute fewer fiscal resources to the central government in order to achieve a higher local economic growth rate by giving local enterprises more incentives such as tax exemptions at the expense of central government revenues (Qiao et al. 2008). Thus, the ratio of central to total revenue declined dramatically from 40.5% in 1984 to 28 % in 1993, while local expenditure grew quickly with the share of local expenditure in total increasing from 45 % in 1981 to 72 % in 1993 while government revenue as a share of GDP decreased dramatically from 25.5 % in 1980 to 12.3 % in 1993. On the other hand, inter-regional gaps in per capita GDP were considerably reduced, with the coefficient of variation of provincial per capita GDP dropping from 1.7 in the early 1980s to 1.4 in 1993, reflecting the fact that the poor regions grew more quickly than the rich regions during the first phase of decentralization from 1978 to 1993. The main trends in the division of revenue and expenditure between the central and regional governments are captured in Fig. 1. In order to curb the revenue decline and provide more resources to the government (especially to the central government), the “Tax Assignment System” (fen shui zhi) was introduced in 1994. Under this system, a Value-Added Tax (VAT) was initiated, with the revenue shared between the central and provincial governments, which replaced the previous fixed-remittance scheme in the Fiscal Revenue Share System. The VAT became the most important source of revenue, which alone accounted for about 42 % of total government revenue in 1994 (Ma 1997). Along with the change in revenue division, the central government tightened its fiscal control by establishing its own revenue collection body, the National Tax Service, in all provinces to collect both central and shared taxes. Evolution of government expenditure and revenue. “LRS” is the local government share of total revenue (%), “LES” is the local government share in total expenditure (%), and “TRS” is the ratio of total revenue to GDP (%). Source China Statistical Year Book (NSB, various issues) The transition to the Tax Assignment System had significant effects on the fiscal landscape in China. The central government’s revenue share in the total jumped from 22 % in 1993 to 56 % in 1994 and then stabilized at about 50 % by 2009. The decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio was also halted in 1996; it was reversed and increased steadily from 10.5 % in 1996 to 20.1 % in 2009. As is clear from Fig. 2, national GDP continued to grow quickly, with an average growth rate of 10 % per year from 1994 to 2009 although there were considerable fluctuations in the growth rate. Moreover, regional disparities, which had been declining steadily until 1994, stabilised and then worsened slightly after that year although there was a further decrease since the mid-2000s. It is clear from this brief review that there is no simple relationship between fiscal decentralisation and growth on the one hand and between decentralisation and regional disparities in China on the other. This is consistent with the international literature which reports extensive tests of these relationships. The relationship between decentralisation and growth has been most extensively investigated; representative papers include Martinez-Vazquez and McNab (2003), Cantarero and Gonzalez (2009), Rodriguez-Pose and Kroijer (2009), Rodriguez-Pose et al. (2009) and Hammond and Tosun (2011), the conclusions from which are decidedly mixed. More recently, literature has also analysed the distributional effects of fiscal decentralisation and, again, the results are mixed; recent papers include Canaleta et al. (2004), Ezcurra and Pascual (2008), Lessmann (2009), Kim et al. (2003), Bonet (2006), Calamai (2009) and Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra (2010). Growth and disparities. “cv” is the coefficients of variation of GDP per capita across the provinces; “Growth” is the real GDP growth rate (% pa). Source China Statistical Year Book (NSB, various issues) Research using Chinese data is more limited. On the decentralisation-growth relationship, Zhang and Zou (1998, 2001) find a consistently negative effect while Lin and Liu (2000), Jin et al. (2005), Feltenstein and Iwata (2005), Ding (2007) and Qiao et al. (2008) all find positive effects of the fiscal decentralization on growth. It is surprising that there is little work on the effects of decentralisation on regional disparities, given that regional disparities have been a key policy concern for the central government for the whole history of the People’s Republic of China. Only one paper is available which explicitly tests the effects of fiscal decentralisation on both growth and inequality, viz., the paper by Qiao et al. (2008) which finds that decentralisation benefits growth but has adverse effects on equality, although it should be noted that equality in this paper means equality in the provincial distribution of fiscal resources, not equality of income or per capita output across provinces which are common measures of inter-regional disparities. Our paper aims to help fill this gap by setting up and solving a small theoretical model to investigate the effects of fiscal decentralisation on regional disparities as well as on aggregate variables. The model is a simple two-region one based on the common distinction in China between the coast and the interior and in which there is inter-regional migration in the long run, although it is restricted in a way which captures the household registration or hukou system in China. Moreover, we include various other aspects of the Chinese tax and expenditure system. The model is linearised and solved numerically, based on calibration using Chinese data. The issues of the effects of decentralisation are then addressed by shocking the model in various ways to mimic possible decentralisation policies. We examine the effects on output, income and welfare at the aggregate level and on disparities in these measures as well as on the most common measure of decentralisation: the ratio of regional to aggregate government expenditure. In addition to our main aim of analysing the aggregate and regional effects of changes in decentralisation, we can also throw light on a variety of issues raised by the empirical literature such as: (i) whether, at the aggregate level, output and welfare always move in the same direction after a decentralisation shock; this would seem to be a minimal requirement for the use of output as a measure of welfare or efficiency in the empirical literature; (ii) whether aggregate measures and disparities tend to move in the same or opposite directions following a decentralisation shock and whether this depends on the way in which the regional governments spend the resources shifted from the national government; and (iii) whether the commonly used measure of decentralisation (the ratio of regional to national government expenditure) is a useful measure of the extent of decentralisation. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we develop the model after which we set out the simulations in Sect. 3. The results are reported in Sect. 4 with conclusions presented in Sect. 5.",6

The basic ingredient of directional delivery constraints models is that firms or consumers cannot move “freely” in any direction. Cancian et al. (1995) assume the extreme case where the movement in one direction is impossible. In this model, the firms simultaneously choose locations while the price is fixed. Nilssen (1997), Lai (2001) and Sun (2012) consider sequential locations of firms when the cost of moving to the left is different from the cost of moving to the right in a linear city model. Again, the prices are exogenously fixed. Kharbach (2009) and Colombo (2009) consider the case of endogenous prices and inelastic demand; Colombo (2011) considers a location-then-price and a location-then-quantity model in a linear city model with extreme directional constraints and elastic demand, whereas Andree (2011) allows for differentiated products. In a recent article published in this journal (Sun 2010), the author analyses spatial Cournot competition (“location-then-quantity” model) in a circular city with an extreme directional delivery constraint: the firms can only deliver their product in one direction. Sun (2010) shows that when the firms deliver the product in the same direction, only maximal dispersion may arise in equilibrium. As suggested by the author (p. 284), a needed extension of this setup regards the possibility of asymmetric and non-extreme transportation costs in different directions. The aim of this article is to extend the analysis of Sun (2010) to the case of non-extreme directional constraints: the firms can deliver their products in both directions, but sustaining different transportation costs (asymmetric transportation costs).Footnote 1 We show that in the case of the circular city model, the maximal dispersion result proposed by Sun (2010) holds whatever is the difference between the transportation costs in the two directions. Moreover, we show that the equilibrium location always minimizes the total transportation costs. In this sense, the argument suggested by (Pal (1998), p. 52) can be generalized to the case of asymmetric transportation costs. Further, we extend the literature on directional constraints by developing the analysis of asymmetric transportation costs also in the case of a linear city model. In this case, the firms pay different transportation costs depending on whether they move to the right or to the left. We show that in equilibrium, the two firms always agglomerate. However, differently from the circular city model, the equilibrium location is shown to depend on the difference between the transportation costs in the two directions: central agglomeration arises in equilibrium only if the transportation costs in the two directions are equal. On the other hand, the more is costly to move to the right (resp. left), the more the equilibrium location of the two firms is expected to be distorted to the right (resp. left). This result extends and characterizes previous findings in the location-then-quantity model within the Hotelling framework without directional constraints (Hamilton et al. 1989) or with extreme directional constraints (Colombo 2011). Directional constraints can be used to describe several situations. For example, imagine the following situation. There is a city with a high concentration of offices and many residential villages dislocated all around the city. At 8 am, moving from the villages to the city is likely to be difficult and costly in terms of time due to traffic congestion, as all people living in the residential villages leave their home to reach the working place in the city, while moving in the other direction (i.e., from the city to the villages) is much easier. At 5.30 pm, at the end of the working day, the opposite holds, as people leave the working place to go home, and so the traffic congestion occurs from the city to the villages. Other examples are the following. First, consider the circular city. Suppose all consumers locate at the inner side of the circular market and all traffic follows the right-hand rule. When firms ship their products to consumers, it is cheaper for a clockwise trip than for an anticlockwise one, because the latter engages many left turns.Footnote 2 Similarly, consider the linear market, and suppose that the road connecting all locations is sloped instead than flat: in this case, moving from the downhill location to the uphill location is more costly than the reverse trip.Footnote 3

Despite the accumulation of knowledge, there is an unexplored issue: variable distribution of consumers. In the research about spatial competition, the spatial distribution of consumers is exogenously fixed throughout the analysis. The distribution could vary, however, after firms determined their locations. Typically, firms attract some consumers to their locations for the following circumstances.Footnote 1
 Mobile workers Suppose that some of the consumers are employed by the firms, and their commuting costs are not negligible. In this case, they would love to live at or near the employing firms. If a firm changes its location from town A to town B, the purchasing power at town A shrinks, while that at town B increases. Therefore, the population (mass of demand) increases at the firms’ locations. Due to the multiplier effect, such job creation is important for the local economy. For example, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation announced in March 2010 that their production operation would be moved from California to Mississippi, which means 2,000 new jobs should be created in Mississippi. Haley Barbour, the governor of Mississippi, welcomed the decision, whereas strong opposition occurred in California. Demand-creating effect Even if consumers are immobile, demand at firms’ locations could expand. For example, when a brewery is developed at Milwaukee (Munich, Sapporo), people there may drink more because the firm works as an advertising instrument. Awareness of the products Spatial competition can be regarded as a product design problem of competing firms over a characteristic space. If firms advertised their product, some consumers would become aware of the product’s merits. As a result, the posterior mass of consumers at each firm’s characteristic is enhanced. Shopping externalities, comparison or one-stop shopping Suppose that there are other goods that are outside of the model. For instance, we analyze a fish market in the model and a meat market is behind the model. If consumers buy both the fish and the meat, the locations where both goods are available have a great advantage for consumers who want to do comparison shopping or one-stop shopping to minimize their shopping costs. Hence, consumers prefer such locations, and the population there grows faster than at other locations.Footnote 2
 Given these reasons why consumers are attracted to firms’ locations, the objective of the paper is to develop a model of spatial competition that deals with such a variable distribution of consumers according to firms’ locations.Footnote 3 For expository convenience, let the term “mobile consumers” denotes those who change their locations after firms choose their locations. Specifically, we assume that a constant population (mass) of mobile consumers always clings to the firms. Our analysis is based on spatial Cournot competition that was developed by Hamilton et al. (1989) and Anderson and Neven (1991),Footnote 4 in which oligopolistic firms choose their locations simultaneously in the first stage, and they decide their supply amount simultaneously for (immobile) consumers that are distributed over the space. On the one hand, both studies show that the firms agglomerate in the center of a linear space in equilibrium. On the other hand, Pal (1998) changed the form of the space into a circular city and showed that two firms are located as far away from each other as possible on the circumference (e.g., at 12 a.m. and at 6 a.m.). In sum, the results depend greatly on the form of the space, linear, or circular. The introduction of mobile consumers induces additional agglomeration and dispersion forces. If a firm chooses a location near a rival, there is a positive effect in the sense that the profits would increase due to lower transport costs for the mobile consumers at the rival (agglomeration force). Meanwhile, the approaching firm should reduce the profits earned from her own mobile consumers because the rival firm could invade her mobile consumers (dispersion force). Depending on the trade-off, location equilibria are determined. As a result, we find that agglomerated equilibrium is achieved even in a circular city when the transport cost is sufficiently low, whereas dispersed equilibrium is present even in a linear city when the transport cost is high. This is in sharp contrast to the familiar results mentioned above (Hamilton et al. 1989; Anderson and Neven 1991; Pal 1998).Footnote 5
 When it comes to mobile consumers, the new economic geography (henceforth, NEG) launched by Krugman (1991) has dealt with a similar issue: how economic activities distribute over distinct cities using general equilibrium models with scale economies in production and imperfect competition (specifically, monopolistic competition).Footnote 6 The findings of the NEG models and ours are somewhat similar. For instance, lower transport cost tends to lead to agglomerated equilibrium (core-periphery structure). Nevertheless, in monopolistic competition of the NEG, each firm has only a negligible impact on the economy, which does not match our awareness of the issues. Picard and Tabuchi (2010) developed a general equilibrium model à la NEG over a circular and continuous space. In their model, the flat earth equilibrium (uniform distribution of firms) is unstable in a wide class of transport costs. In other words, the NEG structure puts more stress on the agglomeration force (e.g., forward and backward linkages) than does our partial equilibrium in an oligopoly. In our model, agglomeration is not so robust. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the two-stage location-quantity game is presented. In Sect. 3, the quantity choices are analyzed. In Sect. 4, the location equilibrium is established. Section 5 is devoted to welfare analysis. Section  6 deals with some extensions of our model. Section 7 summarizes the results.",1

The strategic objectiveFootnote 1 of the reform was to create strong NUTS2 regions (voivodeships, województwa), that could become partners for other European regions (Kaczmarek 2005). The administrative change included the replacement of 49 small voivodeshipsFootnote 2 and their regional governments with 16 NUTS2 units with new regional authorities. NUTS4 / LAU1Footnote 3 districts (powiat), the level of administration which had existed prior to 1975, were reintroduced to play the role of intermediary government between the NUTS5 / LAU2 municipality level (gmina) and NUTS2 voivodeship level. This decentralisation institutional reform was made to strengthen bottom-up governance and to weaken the role of central government in resolving everyday social problems (Kulesza 1993 and 2002). After this reform, NUTS5 level authorities, the local ones, are expected to be financially independent units and responsible for running a sustainable development policy, which consists therefore of attracting new funds (i.e. from public grants, investors, taxes) and spending it on community service (i.e. infrastructure, education, health care) and development investments. NUTS2 authorities, the regional ones, are responsible i.e. for supporting regional economy, creating entrepreneurship and innovative milieu and provision of public goods and services on regional scale, which are always located in some of NUTS5 units. NUTS2 investments and actions are to solve over local issues, within their regional policy or postulated by local NUTS4 and NUTS5 units. Also, spatial and sectoral distribution of NUTS2 funds follows the revealed by local units development problems. The assumption of the reform was that new voivodeships, with a stronger financial and organisational capacity, would stimulate weaker local authorities within their respective operating areas. The reform and financial support from EU funds were supposed to be a remedy to the country’s spatial diversity. The first perceptible effect of the reform was the change in the spatial relations between the self-government authorities. Primarily, both the geographical and the institutional distance between municipalities and voivodeship capitals increased. Much research has been carried out with respect to the functioning and effectiveness of the provision of public goods by local and regional self-governments (e.g. Keating 1995; Newton 1982). Usually, however, studies focus on the concerns of ongoing administration in the existing institutional settings. Ten years after the reform, the collected data enable the analysis of institutional changes alone, and the determination whether the new administrative structure is more effective than the former one in terms of promoting sustainable development. The Polish reform focused on reducing public expenditure and improving public service delivery (Manning and Parison 2003). The reform assumed that a diffusion mechanism would occur—stronger regions would enhance weaker regions. The decentralisation was to be reinforced by the policy of investing in the “drivers”—the richest cities, which were to push forward the development of weaker areas. The implementation of those mechanisms was strictly related with the public sector, its tasks, competencies, capabilities, budget, etc. The establishment of a hierarchical self-government formed the basis for those processes, where functions were assigned to each level, individual or overlapping in terms of their scope, but not in terms of the territory covered. A question arises whether the established institutions, which form the framework for the functioning of local governments, were designed in such a way as to improve the effectiveness of the provision of public goods and the transmission of policy that promotes socioeconomic development. Institutional rent is an important concept in the study, and it is understood as the proximity of regional authorities with significant competence. In particular, this refers to a financial power of NUTS2 authorities. The administrative reform has deprived many voivodeship capitals of their status and thus has increased the distance between a substantial part of municipalities and regional centres. Due to the institutional transition which changed the relative location of municipalities, many of them became peripheral. This applies mostly to weaker local governments, which were adjoined to a stronger core. The objective of the study is to determine to what extent the detrimental change, i.e. the increased average geographical distance between municipalities and voivodeship capitals, became a discriminating factor in the developmental regional policy implemented by local governments. The thread of the argument was based on the hypotheses that geographical distance weakens the top-down transmission of the socioeconomic development policy, and that peripherally located local governments are weaker than those centrally located. Consequently, the spatial effective range of regional centres, i.e. voivodeship capitals, is insufficient. Therefore, the local government reform has enhanced the significance of the institutional rent to local development, which leads to a stronger diversification at the regional level.",11

If the agglomeration phenomenon has been well documented, its fairness is generally not addressed. Also, Martin (2000) found that, in economic geography, one should devote more attention to this trade-off between efficiency and equity. As Bairoch (1997) explains, throughout the nineteenth century, transportation costs have decreased by a factor of ten, and at the very same time, inequalities between countries have emerged: the standard deviation of GDP per capita in Europe has been multiplied by 7.5. A very detailed analysis of this phenomenon is given by Lafourcade and Thisse (2011) showing that reduction in trade costs is one of the causes of these inequalities. In this paper, using a framework that distinguishes between interregional and intraregional transportation costs, we study the agglomeration effects from a normative point of view. This allows to study the effects of transport policies on the spatial equilibrium and its efficiency and regional inequality aspects. Different analytical models (Krugman 1980; Helpman and Krugman 1985; Krugman 1991) have progressively built the basic theory to understand the relation between interregional trade costs and industrial location. These basic models have two points in common: first, they all find that the reduction in interregional transportation costs will increase inequalities between regions. Second, they all use the same assumption: they consider regions as dots, without spatial dimension, and so do neglect intraregional transportation costs (see Behrens and Thisse 2007). The intraregional transportation costs are important, and an entire field of economics has been developed to address the spatial dimension in cities: urban economics. Many contributions have been made, but most of them were neglected by interregional trade economists. The first attempt to unify this field was the paper of Tabuchi (1998), in which the author proposes a synthesis of Alonso (1964) and Krugman (1991). Other papers have contributed to the linkage of these two growing fields. We can think of the paper by Puga (1999), where he observes that, with congestion costs, the “tomahawk curve” of Krugman (1991) becomes a bell-shaped curve. Nonetheless, these contributions have not yet addressed an important scale: “the region.” As observed by Behrens and Thisse (2007), these contributions have gone from the interregional scale to the urban scale, skipping the region. We help to fill this gap, making a difference between interregional and intraregional infrastructures. Such a distinction has already been made by several authors. Martin and Rogers (1995) use this distinction to analyze FDIs (Foreign Direct Investments) in developing countries. Using the Helpman and Krugman’s (1985) setup, they observe that an improvement of the international infrastructure will motivate firms to move to developed countries, whereas an improvement of the regional infrastructure in the periphery will lead to a transfer of firms from the developed country to the developing one. These results are extended to transport infrastructures by Martin (1999) and Baldwin et al. (2003) in an endogenous growth model and even to a three region model. In all these cases, they focus on comparative statics to understand the effects of an improvement of different kinds of infrastructures on the distribution of activities and on growth. This distinction between interregional and intraregional transportation costs can be found in other papers that use Krugman’s (1991) model. Without being exhaustive, we signal the papers of Crozet and Koenig-Soubeyran (2004), Brülhart et al. (2004) or Behrens et al. (2006). In this paper, we use the footloose capital model of Helpman and Krugman’s (1985). This choice can be justified in two ways. The first one concerns the hypotheses of the model. Contrary to Krugman (1991), in the Helpman and Krugman model, it is supposed that workers are immobile, and capital is mobile. This assumption is, in our opinion, more credible when we investigate the case of regions/countries that do not share a common language: a situation more characteristic for Europe than the United States. The second reason is a practical one. One of the main advantages of the Helpman and Krugman model is that it can be solved analytically, whereas this is not the case for Krugman (1991). These analytical results are highly useful for comparative statics, welfare analysis or recommendations for regional policies. Few contributions have focused on the normative point of view in economic geography. Among these contributions, Martin (1998, 1999, 2000) analyzes the equity issues that are associated with regional policies. He observes that the improvement of regional infrastructures raises the welfare of individuals in both regions, but the level reached remains suboptimal. Martin uses an endogenous growth model where the higher number of firms in the core generates relatively more growth that cannot be fully corrected by regional policies. Martin is not the only one to address normative issues. Charlot et al. (2006) devote a full paper on the comparison of welfare measures to analyze the effects of agglomeration on welfare. However, they use the Krugman (1991) model, and they exclude the distinction between interregional and intraregional transportation costs. Fratesi (2008) also analyzes the way regional structural differences affect the trade-off between equity and efficiency in a two-country four-region model, but his contribution primarily studies the effects on growth. In this paper, we use the footlose capital Krugman–Helpman model to derive two types of results. First, we confirm the traditional result that the spatial concentration of industrial activity in the center is too high compared to the first best optimum. This is not a new finding but we show how this relates to the relative magnitude of intraregional and interregional transport costs. More precisely, we show that the traditional result holds when intraregional transport costs are higher in the periphery than in the core, and interregional costs are higher than intraregional costs. Our second contribution is to show what policies can make the equilibrium Pareto optimal. The optimum can be reached in three different ways: taxing the use of the interregional infrastructure; taxing the use of the intraregional infrastructure in the center or subsidizing the use of the intraregional infrastructure in the periphery. Note that subsidizing the intraregional infrastructure in the periphery does not mean building a road. Indeed, the creation of the infrastructure is costly, while a subsidy is in principle a mere transfer of resources that corrects incentives and is not consuming real resources (except for the transaction costs). Note also that a lumpsum federal subsidy to the periphery is also not sufficient to correct the equilibrium as this subsidy will have only an income effect and only a second-order effect on the relative price of goods produced in the center and the periphery. Finally, we illustrate our model with a numerical example in which we show the order of magnitude of taxes and subsidies necessary to reach an optimum. This paper has three sections. In the first section, we add intraregional transportation costs to an existing model of intraregional trade (Helpman and Krugman 1985). In the second section, we adopt a more normative point of view. We check the efficiency of the spatial equilibrium and show what type of interregional and intraregional transport policies can correct the equilibrium. In a third section, we illustrate the model with an numerical example for African countries. Detailed mathematical proofs of the propositions are relegated to the appendixes.",1

Initially, relative income per capita between Eastern and Western Europe diverged, but roughly from 1999 onwards, this pattern was reversed and Eastern Europe started to catch up with its Western counterpart. Moreover, when analyzing the performance inside Eastern Europe, a similar pattern emerges. The countries closer to the West (Border) initially experienced faster growth than those situated further from the West (Hinterland), but from the end of the 1990s, this was also reversed. East/West and Hinterland/Border GDP per capita ratios A similar pattern can be observed when the attention is focused on industrial output. Hinterland (East) initially suffered a continuous relative deindustrialization, followed by a remarkable recovery from the beginning of the new century (see Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, the stylized facts exhibit both an East-West and a Border-Hinterland U-shaped pattern in terms of (real) GDP per capita and industrial output.
 East/West industrial output ratio Hinterland/Border industrial output ratio The literature has typically explained these U-shaped patterns by relying on technological arguments or on the misallocation of factors of production. Boldrin and Canova (2003), for example, suggest that the technological obsolescence led to an initial period of intense unemployment and reallocations after trade was liberalized. Blanchard (1996) and Blanchard and Kremer (1997) link the initial slump to microeconomic “disorganization”: the collapse of the state sector was precipitated by traditional input suppliers, who found attractive opportunities outside the state sector and broke the established productive chains. Cociuba (2006) and Keller (1997) also stress the role played by technology adoption to account for the GDP trajectories of Eastern European countries. The existing literature thus puts the emphasis on the intensity of reallocations that were needed to adapt to a superior Western technology, followed by a remarkable catch-up process that was conditioned by redistributive public policies. While we do not claim these explanations are erroneous in any way, in this paper, we deliberately disregard issues of technological backwardness or sectorial misallocations. Instead, we propose an economic geography model where trade liberalization is the only driving force. This is based on our belief that the trade reorientation toward the West and the initial deterioration of the market for exports were crucial initial conditions for the transition (see, among others, Campos and Coricelli 2002; Christoffersen and Doyle 1998; De Melo et al. 2001 or Tondl and Vuksic 2003). Our focus is on the evolution of the Eastern European economies right after the collapse of the socialist experiment. Besides, we hope the insights derived from our experiment could be relevant to analyze other trade liberalization processes in different countries. Since it can be argued that, prior to the transition period, all Central and Eastern European countries shared similar technological and institutional conditions; we claim that the disparate evolutions of Border and Hinterland may have something to do with the relative proximity to the EU market. That is the reason why we emphasize the causal determinants related to geography and trade openness. We develop a model with 2 blocks (West and East) and three regions (one region in the West, and a Border and Hinterland in the East). As is usually the case in the Economic Geography literature, our model assumes that agriculture is perfectly competitive, industry is monopolistically competitive and workers are perfectly mobile between sectors. Trade in industrial goods is subject to transport costs, which are higher between Hinterland and West than between Border and West. As in Krugman and Venables (1995) and Puga (1999), industrial firms use intermediate goods, which gives rise to forward and backward linkages. The relative size of the endowments of labor and land in our model match the actual shares in our three regions. For simplicity and to make our results as sharp as possible, we assume that West and East exhibit identical technologies. This simple setup, which abstracts from technological differences, is sufficient to account for the main stylized facts. The focus of our analysis is the pattern of convergence in terms of GDP and industrialization (between East and West; Hinterland and Border) produced by the trade liberalization during the transition period. Our model can be viewed as a generalization of Krugman and Venables (1995) and Puga (1999). They showed how in a two-block model the earlier stages of trade liberalization could bring about lower real wages and deindustrialization in disfavored markets. Our paper differentiates from Puga (1999) in that we allow for internal trade costs within the East, making the setup non-equidistant. In that way, Border and Hinterland become asymmetric in terms of their distance to the West. For that reason, we must rely on numerical simulations. This modification is not substantial from a purely theoretical point of view and so our paper should be considered only an empirical application of Puga (1999), with a slight structural modification. A similar exercise was undertaken by Bosker et al. (2010), with the qualification that they did not focus on the historical experience of transition, but they tried to shed light on the future impact (and only within the West) of the recent EU enlargement. Our paper is a contribution to this literature. Our simulation results explain very well the actual relative evolution of the different regions described above. First, during the time following the trade liberalization, these results are as follows. Trade liberalization should initially lead to divergence in GDP per capita, both between West and East and between Border and Hinterland. The good performance of the West can be explained by a Home Market effect. As trade costs drop, the relative profitability varies in favor of the largest market. This same phenomenon leads to the relative initial deindustrialization of the East in favor of the West. Furthermore, the results show that there should be an initial divergence between Border and Hinterland in favor of the former location. This is the case because the proximity to the West involves a crucial access to the bulk of consumption goods and intermediate inputs. Second, the results show that during the final stages of East-West trade liberalization, a convergence in GDP per capita should appear, both between Border and Hinterland and between East and West. On the one hand, this is the case because when international trade costs are sufficiently low, proximity to large markets is no longer a basic determinant of firms’ location. On the other hand, the previous agglomeration in the West led to (relatively) lower wages in the Border and even more so in the Hinterland. This is now crucial for the recovery of a substantial manufacturing basis by the Border and to a larger extent by the Hinterland. We also present a series of industry-level stylized facts to give additional support to our hypothesis that NEG forces were at work during the aforementioned regional convergence pattern. When we break down our output data by industry, we observe, as trade freeness increases, that sectors with significant scale economies and/or high value-to-weight ratios follow an inverted U-shape pattern in their geographical output concentration. The spatial concentration patterns of these sectors are strongly affected by economic geography forces, i.e., increasing returns to scale and transport costs. In contrast, sectors where scale economies are less relevant and value-to-weight ratios are lower follow a monotonic concentration pattern. The latter is more consistent with theories of comparative advantage. We argue that these stylized facts seem to be more consistent with a NEG approach and less so with the conventional technological-obsolescence plus catch-up approach. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 mentions some additional related literature. Section 3 defines the three regions and further describes the main policy changes, justifying the adoption of the assumptions underlying our policy experiment. Section 4 briefly describes the stylized facts we aim to reproduce. Our modeling framework is introduced in Sect. 5, though it will be more extensively presented in the “Appendix”; we also discuss in Sect. 5 our numerical experiments studying the effects of trade liberalization. Section 6 shows some microeconomic stylized facts. Section 7 concludes.",2

Paul Elhorst,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Inflation is one of the central issues in macroeconomics and a major concern in many countries. Over the period 1987–2001, inflation rates in Turkey ranged from 6.6 % in the province of Nevsehir in 1992 to 122.3 % in the province of Giresun in 1997. Important advances have emerged in the theoretical modeling of inflation dynamics. Originally, Phillips (1958) found a negative relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. This paper was based on empirical generalizations and initially did not have a theoretical foundation; theories that fit the data were developed only afterwards (Phelps 1967; Friedman 1968). By contrast, the new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) states that wage and price setting decisions can be derived from an optimization problem in which forward-looking agents set their price optimally, subject to a constraint on the frequency of price adjustments (Taylor 1980; Calvo 1983). Aggregating over individual behavior then leads to a relationship comparable to the traditional Phillips curve. Due to the general failure of the new Keynesian Phillips curve to explain inflation dynamics empirically, this model has been further extended to include lags of inflation to account for backward-looking behavior. A theoretical foundation of this model, today known as the hybrid NKPC, has been developed by Gali and Gertler (1999). It should be stressed that the precise specification of the Phillips curve may have important implications from a central bank perspective. According to Jondeau and Le Bihan (2005), a fully credible central bank can engineer a disinflation at no cost in terms of output if inflation is a forward-looking phenomenon, whereas lowering steady-state inflation requires a recession in the context of the traditional, backward-looking Phillips curve. The contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold. First, we estimate a hybrid NKPC for Turkey using regional data observed at the NUTS 3 level (67 provinces) over the period 1987–2001. Just like many previous studies, Turkish economists have investigated the validity of the Phillips curve hypothesis in Turkey at the country level (Avşar and Gür 2004; Önder 2004, 2009; Kuştepeli 2005; Yazgan and Yilmazkuday 2005). However, almost nobody has investigated the existence of a Phillips curve from a regional perspective, neither for Turkey nor for any other country in the world. Two notable exceptions are Vaona (2007) and Berk and Swank (2007). Understanding inflation dynamics at the regional level, especially in Turkey, is important since regional integration is one of the requirements imposed on Turkey in the accession process to the European Union. This requirement is understandable since GDP per capita in 2006 in the western part of Turkey was two to four times as high as in the eastern part of Turkey (European Commission 2010), and different studies found a positive cross-sectional relationship between inflation and inequality, among which Crowe (2006). 
Vaona (2007) specifies three reasons why a regional approach of inflation dynamics is beneficial, of which some of them are taken from previous studies. Firstly, most studies are based on time-series variation of a single country over time only. By considering different regions over time, the parameter estimates will also be based on cross-sectional variability. Considering different countries over time is an alternative way to add cross-sectional variability. This explains the popularity of the panel data approach followed in studies of, among others, DiNardo and Moore (1999), Karanassou et al. (2003), Vaona (2007), Berk and Swank (2007), Russell (2007), and Bjørnstad and Nymoen (2008). Secondly, by redistributing demand between regions, it is possible to minimize the long-run national unemployment rate. Thirdly, and related to the second point, persistence in macroeconomic time series could be the result of aggregation, as a result of which moving from a very aggregate level to the meso-level can offer a way to empirically test this claim. Vaona (2007), who estimates a hybrid Phillips curve for 81 Italian provinces over the period 1986–1998, finds that regional inflation rates in Italy range between 0 and 8 % and that forward-looking behavior is more important than backward looking behavior. 
Berk and Swank (2007) also estimates a hybrid Phillips curve, one for countries located in the European Union and one for states in the US. They investigate whether regional inflation differentials in a monetary union are a cause for concern. If regional inflation differentials would be due to rigidities in wage and price formation in certain regions, thereby thwarting rather than effectuating price-level convergence, monetary policy aimed at controlling the average rate of inflation may be suboptimal for individual regions. In contrast to Vaona (2007), Berk and Swark find that that backward- and forward-looking behavior in the EU are almost nearly important and that backward-looking behavior in the US is even more important. The second contribution of this paper is the attention for spatial dependence among the observations. If economic activity in one region increases and causes an upward pressure on prices, firms may hire labor and consumers and may buy commodities from neighboring regions, as a result of which, prices in these neighboring regions may also increase. Similarly, if inflation goes up elsewhere, forward-looking agents may expect prices in their own region to increase too. Both Berk and Swank (2007) and Vaona (2007) recognize that spatial dependence might be a problem. Berk and Swank (2007) point out that panel unit root tests should be used accounting for cross-sectional dependence, since different regions in a monetary union may be hit by correlated shocks. In addition, the Phillips curve should be estimated allowing the disturbances to be correlated across regions. Vaona (2007) tests whether the variables are spatially autocorrelated using Moran’s I test statistic. Since these tests cannot be rejected, he spatially filters the variables in his model using the eigenfunction decomposition approach of Getis and Griffith (2002). Next, the Phillips curve is estimated using these spatially filtered variables. The problem of the first study is that it tests for spatial interaction effects among the error terms, but not for spatial interaction effects among the dependent variable and the independent variables. LeSage and Pace (2009, pp. 155–158) stress that the cost of ignoring spatial dependence in the dependent variable and/or in the independent variables is relatively high since the econometrics literature has pointed out that if one or more relevant explanatory variable are omitted from a regression equation, the estimator of the coefficients for the remaining variables is biased and inconsistent. In contrast, ignoring spatial dependence in the disturbances, if present, will only cause a loss of efficiency. The problem of the second study is that it separates inflation dynamics over time from inflation dynamics over space, while it is more likely that these two types of dynamics are interdependent; structural changes in one region may have spatial spillover effects on other regions, and these spillover effects may have immediate or future feedback effects on the region that instigated these changes. Both problems indicate that modeling of spatial interactions in a hybrid Phillips curve presents many methodological challenges for which we will apply advanced spatial econometric techniques. Important issues such as estimation methods, test procedures for spatial interaction effects, spatial non-stationarity, regional and time-period fixed effects, and direct and indirect effects estimates will be addressed together with the discussion of our empirical results. The remainder of this paper is set up as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the different Phillips curve models that have been developed and discusses some of the main issues put forward in previous studies. In Sect. 3, we discuss and analyze our data set. In Sect. 4, we present the results of our empirical analysis dovetailed with our spatial econometric approach to test for and to model spatial dependence, and discuss some policy implications. In Sect. 5, we summarize our main findings and draw conclusions.",14

Heikkila,Michael C. Y. Lin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recent theoretic and empirical work on the role of institutions in the development has emphasized the importance of land titling and other formal institutional mechanisms for ensuring property rights claims. This paper challenges this approach, arguing that it overlooks a fundamental constraint on the supply side of the market. Because everyone lives somewhere, and because the supply of land is fixed, allocation of land to formal markets simultaneously and unavoidably creates a dual condition of informality. Acute problems arise in many developing countries when the ability of the formal sector to accommodate the resident population is small relative to the whole, thereby creating a large informal sector which—almost by definition—lies outside the purview of formal institutions. These conditions are all too common in contemporary urban spaces. In Manila, Ballesteros (2010) reports that 37 % of the total population is residing in slums in 2010. According to UN-HABITAT (2003), Manila’s “Slums are now scattered... usually along rivers, near garbage dumps, along railroad tracks, under bridges, and beside industrial establishments.” (p. 215) The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (2002) advises us that, “slum dwellers... comprise more than 55 % of the city’s population of 11.9 million.” (p. 5), and this corroborates a similar percentage reported for Nairobi.Footnote 1
 This paper argues that the key to addressing this problem is the absorptive capacity of the formal sector. Merely creating formal property rights is not sufficient and may in fact be counterproductive if the absorptive capacity is small relative to the population. This shifts the policy focus to one of designing land use regulations that have suitable absorptive capacities. In what follows we introduce a simple generic model of a land market in a city characterized by a sharp duality in terms of economic wealth. As a reference point, the model is framed initially in terms of a single unified formal market for land with all households participating, rich and poor alike. Next, minimum lot size land use restrictions are imposed based on circumstances suitable to the wealthier households, and those restrictions make it untenable for some poor households to remain within the formal sector. The analysis uncovers three distinct types of outcomes that are delineated on the basis of relative incomes and land rents. In the first case, a subset of the poor households remains in the formal sector after the imposition of land use controls. There is no welfare impact on rich households in this case as land rents remain unchanged, whereas poor households who do remain in the formal sector suffer a welfare loss because they are compelled to consume more land than they would otherwise prefer. But even these households are better off than their disenfranchised brethren whose only recourse to the imposition of minimum lot size restrictions is to reside in the informal sector. In the second case, all of the poor households are disenfranchised, and so, only wealthy households remain in the formal sector as land rents fall to a lower equilibrium value. Rich households actually experience a welfare gain here because they are in effect subsidized by the resultant lower land rents. The third case is a hybrid of the two, where a subset of poor households is just able to return to the formal sector, but only after land rents have fallen. The analytical framework developed here enables one to calculate the welfare gains and losses for each type of household in these three distinct cases. An important but discouraging finding is that the welfare gain of wealthy households is higher in more polarized settings. The reason for this is that as more poor households find themselves in the informal sector, aggregate demand for land in the formal sector diminishes and this leads to an effective rent subsidy to those residing within the formal sector. The model presented here is not intended as a complete explanation of how informal housing settlements arise. In particular, we do not delve into the political economy of informal settlements. As Henderson (2009) notes, land use regulations within jurisdictions may be used by those communities as a means of limiting population size or excluding certain subgroups. Likewise, our model does not attempt to incorporate the provision of urban services, which is also an important facet of informal settlements in developing countries. In Feler and Henderson (2011), for example, withholding water provision from informal settlements is a means by which exclusionary policies can be effected. Although we acknowledge the importance of these political economy considerations, we take a different approach. By doing so, we are able to demonstrate that informality can arise even in the absence of an overt exclusionary motivation. In our model, the informal sector arises as a by-product of land use regulations within the formal sector. This is a phenomenon recognized by Henderson (2009, p. 29) who observes that “If regulations are set excessively, people operate outside the formal housing market—instead operating in the informal housing market.” Our paper provides a plausible explanation for how this can occur. By modeling the crowding out effect of restrictive land use regulations explicitly, we are able to assess the welfare gains and losses for each household type. Ultimately, such welfare impacts are surely the primary motivators for a political economy of exclusion or limitation. The paper begins the next section by placing this work in the context of two distinct strands of the literature. One is the urban economics literature, primarily in a US context, that examines the efficiency and welfare implications of minimum lot size restrictions and other forms of urban land use regulations. The other is the broader development literature that explores the causal dynamics of informal housing and land markets. As explained below, the third section of this paper combines elements of both by introducing a formal neoclassical model of an urban land market that includes an informal sector. This enables us to model explicitly the interactive effects between the formal and informal sectors. We then generate these interactive effects by introducing minimum lot size restrictions based on the preferences of the wealthier (and presumably, more politically influential) households. As explained above, three distinct cases emerge, and these are explored empirically in the fourth section using notional data that enable us to get a handle on the magnitudes involved. A concluding section reconsiders the significance of our findings and points to promising avenues for further research. We conclude that extending the realm of land use titles and other forms of property rights, while perhaps worthwhile, is not a panacea. Instead, the results of our paper suggest that greater focus should be placed on ensuring that land use regulations provide sufficient absorptive capacity to accommodate all urban dwellers, rich and poor alike. The informal sector is not a problem in and of itself; it is an expression of failures within the formal sector.",7

Javier Casado-Izaga,Hamid Hamoudi,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"A mixed oligopoly is a market structure in which public firms compete against private firms. It is a common market structure in many sectors and in many developed and developing countries. For example, it can be found in airlines, railways, electricity utilities, postal services, education and health care. In these markets, as in others supplied only by private firms, the locations of the competitors play a crucial role for understanding their performance. The locations of two private firms competing in a linear city have been extensively analyzed since the seminal paper by Hotelling (1929), who finds that under linear transportation costs, both firms have incentives to locate in the center of the city. Later d’Aspremont et al. (1979) show that when transportation costs are linear, there is no price equilibrium when firms are located very close together. They explain that this problem does not exist when transportation costs are quadratic, but then firms locate at the endpoints of the city.Footnote 1 Another branch of this literature focuses on location decisions in mixed markets, e. g., Cremer et al. (1991), Matsushima and Matsumura (2003, 2006), Inoue et al. (2009) and Bárcena-Ruiz and Casado-Izaga (2012). The analyses conducted in the papers cited above share one common feature: firms are free to locate anywhere in the city. However, there are many circumstances in which firms’ locations are restricted to certain places in the market.Footnote 2 For example, in modern cities, municipal councils may reserve land exclusively for public amenities (such as sports centers, schools, or hospitals) or may design industrial estates where both public and private firms are allowed to locate. Thus, zoning becomes a central instrument for regulators to design the use of city land and to alter competition between firms. One feature of spatial competition models is their versatility.Footnote 3 As a consequence, zoning regulation can be interpreted as the regulator constraining the range of characteristics that products may have. Thus, restrictions on firms locating in certain places of cities may be interpreted as a ban on producing certain types of product. For example, in many developed countries, the selling of alcohol is forbidden in residential areas to safeguard residents against negative externalities such as noise and delinquency (see Carpenter 2007). Moreover, public and private firms may have different restrictions on the activities that they can perform. For example, the government reserves tasks such as checking for any violations of the law, protecting lives and property, directing traffic and escorting loads, and conducting initial investigations of crimes for police officers. Private security personnel may undertake only some of these tasks. The literature analyzing restrictions on the location of firms has focused on zoning regulation when firms are privately owned.Footnote 4 This literature has considered various scenarios. First, Lai and Tsai (2004) consider that firms are not allowed to locate on the left border of a linear city, assuming that they compete with uniform prices. They show that zoning regulations affect the location of firms and improve welfare.Footnote 5 Second, Chen and Lai (2008) consider a symmetric central zoning area in a Cournot duopoly spatial location model and find that zoning may improve welfare.Footnote 6 Finally, Hamoudi and Risueño (2012) analyze the effect of zoning assuming Bertrand competition in a duopolistic circular market where consumers and firms are placed in different zones of the city. The regulator considers a weighted welfare function that attaches different weights to the consumer and producer surpluses. They show that the optimal size of the commercial area depends on the weights given to the consumer and producer surpluses. It should be noted that the literature on zoning and firms’ locations has focused on private firms but has neglected the fact that public and private firms may compete in the product market. Moreover, the analyses in the aforementioned papers assume that firms are not allowed to locate in a given area of the city (e.g., the area around one of the borders), but the regulator only chooses the optimal size of that zone. However, they do not study what zoning area leads to firms being placed optimally when there are no restrictions of any sort on their location. In this paper, we analyze zoning regulation in a mixed duopoly where one firm is publicly owned and the other is private. This issue is important since a mixed duopoly may give rise to significantly different results from a private one. Firms sell their products in a linear market. As in Hamoudi and Risueño (2012), we consider that the objective function of the regulator is a weighted welfare function. In this regard, White (2002, p. 489) argues that “while the standard, equally weighted welfare function may be desirable for normative reasons, based on utilitarianism or fairness doctrines [as in Harsanyi (1995)], it may be restrictive for purposes of predicting the behavior of actual public firms and the resulting market outcomes”. White (2002) considers a weighted welfare function to analyze how the public firm responds to different objective functions, and how this impacts on the industry as a whole. In this paper, we follow this approach, considering that the objective function of the regulator is the weighted sum of social surplus and the profit of the public firm. In our model, when firms can locate freely, they locate symmetrically around the middle of the market. When their locations are decided by a regulator, we find that if the weight given to the profit of the private firm is either zero or high enough, the locations chosen by the firms are the same as those chosen by the regulator. Thus, there is no need to set restrictions on the locations of the firms since they are optimal. However, for all other possible weightings, the regulator prefers the public firm to be placed closer to the middle of the market and the private firm further away. Thus, the locations chosen by the firms do not coincide with those set by the regulator. We show in the paper that by simply restricting the location of the private firm so that it must be inside a zone around the right-hand border of the city, both firms locate optimally. There is no need also to restrict the location of the public firm. Given the restriction placed on the private firm, it locates optimally. As a result, the public firm also locates optimally. Thus, both the private and the public firms may locate in the zone close to the right-hand border of the city, while only the public firm may locate elsewhere in the city. It should be noted that in the case of a private duopoly, the regulator needs to restrict the location of the two private firms to obtain optimal locations.Footnote 7
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 analyzes the case in which firms’ locations are decided by their owners and they are not restricted by the regulator. Section 4 studies optimal locations from the regulator’s point of view. Section 5 studies optimal zoning, and Section 6 draws conclusions.",11

Tinoco-Zermeño,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The analysis of economic growth and its determinants began to receive attention since the works published by Solow (1956, 1957). The author develops a growth model to understand the role of physical capital accumulation. His main finding was to demonstrate that technological innovation was the main factor explaining economic progress. Due to several criticisms to the exogenous technological progress in Solow’s growth model, in the 1980s and early 1990s, Lucas (1988) and Romer (1990) argued that both human capital in Research and Development (R&D) and the stock of knowledge determined the technological and economic progress. The revival of the growth theory has been nurtured by an increasing number of empirical studies that focus on the convergence or divergence among countries, as in Barro (1991) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991). However, we should emphasize that (a) despite the new advances in the growth theory, the inclusion of technological innovation in international empirical studies is scarce and (b) regional empirical studies still need to consider explicitly the spatial dimension. In relation to the latter, Arbia (2006) argues that the lack of the spatial interaction in regional studies could lead us to inconsistent results. Several international studies have gone in the right direction, but they do not include the technological innovation in economic growth analysis. The Mexican economic growth has been disappointing in the last years. For instance, the real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a moderate rate of 4.3 % between 1960 and 2005. However, we can distinguish two growth periods. Between 1960 and 1981 and under the “inward-looking” economic policies, the real GDP grew at 6.5 % on average per year, while between 1981 and 2005 at 2.1 % on average. The low rates have motivated several studies in the area of regional economic growth in Mexico. For instance, Esquivel (1999) concluded that between 1940 and 1995, the rate of convergence among Mexican states was 1.2 %. The author argues that the rate is explained by a low elasticity of the domestic migration with respect to income differentials and regional divergence in human capital formation. Díaz-Bautista (2003) estimated the economic convergence among Mexican states for the period of 1970–2000 and concludes that the education level is statistically significant, with the exception of human capital in R&D. In another study, Ocegueda Hernández (2007) analyzed the effect of trade opening on regional economic growth; he found out evidence of heterogeneous effects favoring the spatial inequality of income. Those studies helped in selecting various determinants of regional economic growth in Mexico. But the analysis of regional economic growth still needs the explicit inclusion of the spatial dimension and the role of technological innovation. In this context, we aim to analyze the technological innovation effects on regional economic growth in Mexico. To properly develop this analysis, we apply spatial data analysis (SDA) as proposed by Anselin (2006). This methodology consists of three stages: spatial exploratory analysis, visualization and spatial modeling using spatial econometrics. It helps to explicitly incorporate spatial interaction in regional economic analysis, particularly in the last stage where innovation effects are disentangled in direct, indirect (diffusion) and total effects. It is worth noticing new findings in this topic are limited in Mexico, for instance, Valdivia (2007) uses spatial econometrics to analyze the process of absolute convergence among Mexican municipalities, but his contribution lack the role of technological innovation. In this paper, we want to address the following questions: What is the pattern of spatial interaction among Mexican states with regard to technological innovation? What is the pattern of spatial interaction with regard to regional economic growth in Mexico? Is technological innovation relevant to promote regional economic growth in Mexico?

Ayşen Hiç Gencer,William P. Anderson,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Today, most of the international trade is between developed countries (DCs), termed as intra-North trade, and some between developing and/or less developed countries (LDCs), termed as intra-South trade, and about less than one-third between DCs and LDCs, also known as North–South trade. For instance, in 1997, the total international merchandise trade was $5.3 trillion, and the exports of commercial services were $1.3 trillion. Of the total merchandise trade, more than 50 % was intra-North; about 15 % was intra-South; and only about 35 % was North-South, that is, between countries that have different factor endowments (Helpman 1998). In 2007, the total international merchandise trade increased to $14 trillion, of which 40 % was between North American and European countries; 30 % was between Southern and Central American, Asian, Middle Eastern, African and former Soviet countries; and North–South trade decreased to 30 % (WTO, 2008). However, according to the classical Heckscher–Ohlin–Vanek (HOV) theory (Chacholiades 1978), most of the trade should be between capital-rich North and the labor-rich South. Thus, there is a large volume of intra-industry trade, or trade overlap, which the HOV model fails to account for (Trefler 1995). Two lines of research attempted to explain this discrepancy in the trade data. One line of research went about modifying the HOV model and enriching it with additional parameters, such as productivity, technological differences, presence of multiple cones of specialization (Bowen et al. 1987; Leamer 1987). Another line of research discarded the assumptions of the HOV model such as homogeneous products and constant returns to scale and moved in the direction of explaining the intra-industry trade in terms of economies of scale, product differentiation and consequent specialization. This latter class of models is termed the new economic geography (NEG) theory. According to the NEG models (Krugman 1979; Helpman 1981; Helpman and Krugman 1985, 1995), there are sectors that differ in their scale economies, production techniques and market structures. Scale economies drive countries to specialize in different brands, which enhances international trade and helps to explain the large trade volumes between similarly endowed countries with high-income and high technology levels. The monopolistic competition theory based on Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) and NEG models developed by Krugman (1979) rely on the concept of consumers’ love of variety as a means of creating competition in a model with an increasing returns to scale production function. In this framework, goods are functionally identical and belong to the same category, but still consumers differentiate among them because they love variety. The stronger the consumers’ love of variety is, the more varieties of a good they would like to buy. All consumers are assumed to be identical with homothetic preferences, and the model works with a representative consumer. Krugman’s model, therefore, assumes horizontal differentiation (Flam and Helpman 1987): Consumers want to maximize utility by minimizing transportation costs and therefore prefer to buy goods from the nearest producer. However, in fact, consumers are not identical and they do not have homothetic preferences. They differ in their income levels, in their tastes for quality and/or for capacity of goods, in their brand preferences and in many other factors that affect their purchasing decisions. As a result, these factors bring about the demand for differentiated goods in a single industry. The path-breaking study, which considers the role of the demand side in trade theory, is proposed by Linder (1961). He assumes that demand is non-homothetic and dependent on income and consumers with similar income levels have similar demand patterns. Assuming two countries with two different income distribution functions, firms in each country first respond to the demands of their domestic consumers. As a result, the variety of goods produced in one country is not identical to the variety of goods produced in the other country. When trade is allowed, these goods are exchanged, resulting in intra-industry trade. A more elaborate study is proposed by Markusen (1986) who uses Linder’s concept of consumers’ non-homothetic preferences based on income differences in order to explain not only intra-industry trade between East and West, i.e., countries with similar factor endowments, but also North–South trade, i.e., countries with different factor endowments. To this end, he develops a model with a homogeneous good on the one hand and differentiated manufactured goods on the other hand. This model allows him to predict the volume of intra-industry versus inter-industry trade. 
Flam and Helpman (1987) develop a model in order to explain North–South trade using vertical differentiation in response to Krugman’s (1979) framework of horizontal differentiation. North develops high-quality products, and South produces low-quality goods and they trade with each other. The technology in the North progresses faster so that new higher-quality products are introduced and lower-quality goods are abandoned, whose production is taken up by the South. 
Choi et al. (2009) extend Flam and Helpman’s model (1987) to the case of multiple differentiated goods and multiple countries with different technologies. They test their model on income and import price distributions for 26 countries and find positive correlations between income and import price distributions. Non-homothetic preferences in international trade theory are also analyzed by Stokey (1988), Matsuyama (2000), Föllmi and Zweimüller (2002), Philippidis and Hubbard (2003) and Hallak (2006). Concurrent with the development of our model, a number of researchers studied the effects of income inequality on international trade. Mitra and Trindade (2005) first develop a model where the supply side is identical and show that countries gain from trade even when only the income distributions of the countries are different. In other words, trade can result due to specialization in consumption, not in production. A second model they develop shows that if producers are differentiated in a monopolistically competitive sense, both inter-industry trade and intra-industry trade can occur. Similarly, Bohman and Nilsson (2006) study income-dependent consumption patterns and indicate that consumers shift from necessity to luxury goods as their income increases. They develop a model that describes the effect of income distribution on consumption and empirically test for the effect of income distribution using a gravity model augmented by income inequalities in each country represented by the Gini coefficient. They find that countries with higher dispersion of income export more necessities, such as food and clothing. In an extension of the latter study, Nilsson (2007) builds a market structure derived from discrete choice theory similar to Johansson and Lars (1994) and this time takes transportation costs into account. In order to empirically test the model, she uses three different measures of income inequality, namely the Gini coefficient, the Theil index and the rich/poor ratio. She finds that income inequality increases the demand for product diversity, as well as imports. 
Fukushima (2009) builds a two-country two-sector trade model with a homogeneously produced necessity good on the one hand and Dixit–Stiglitz type monopolistically competitive luxury goods on the other hand. He finds that the variety of goods produced is larger under trade. The aim of this paper is to develop a partial equilibrium model in which intra-industry trade arises as a result of utility maximization of consumers and profit maximization of firms. Whether trade occurs or not, and if it occurs whether it is unilateral or bilateral, is determined by consumption choices on the demand side, as well as game theoretical choices on the supply side. On the demand side, a single good is considered under a vertical differentiation framework. In this framework, firms produce the same good at different quality and price combinations and consumers decide from which firm to buy according to the level of their disposable income. Prices and quality levels of goods are linked together such that the higher the quality of a good, the higher its price. The population has an income distribution; the rich buy the good with higher quality and price, the poor buy the good with lower quality and price, and the extremely poor do not consume the good at all. On the supply side, factor endowments and production technologies are the same in all countries such that HOV-type trade does not occur. Firms’ revenue depends on price as well as their market share, and production costs are higher for higher-quality goods. Firms maximize their profits by determining the quality level and the price of the good they produce. Under free trade conditions, firms have to make the additional decision of whether to export to the foreign country or not, while trying to anticipate whether firms in the foreign country will choose to export or not, which is solved by a standard two-by-two game. If the two countries are not identical, either due to a difference in population or due to a difference in average income, vertical differentiation results in one country specializing in the production of lower quality, lower price good and the other country specializing in the production of higher quality, higher price good, which gives rise to intra-industry trade. Using this model, we examine how intra-industry trade volume changes as a function of population and average income in each country as well as transportation costs. Even though the average income in each country may be different, the income distribution function is assumed to be the same. In other words, we do not examine the effects of income inequality. In Sect. 2, we build the theoretical basis for the model. In Sects. 3 and 4, we solve the model for autarky case and two-country international trade case, respectively. In Sect. 5, we analyze the predictions of the model with respect to differences in partner countries’ average per capita income and population, as well as the effects of transportation costs.",2

This specialization process, increasingly less interindustrial, needed explanations based on not traditional factors, such as scale economies, product differentiation, imperfect markets and consumer preference for variety, not taken into account by the classical theory of perfect competition (Vona 1991). Intraindustrial trade is defined as being that of similar goods classified under the same industry. Within this definition, a distinction is made between horizontal or pure intraindustrial trade and vertical trade. The differentiation is horizontal when the products traded differ in secondary characteristics while sharing a same production function, whereas it is vertical or quality differentiation, when the products exchanged are classified in the same category but can use a different set of factors implying several production functions. The growth of intraindustrial trade was found not only in market-oriented economies but even in the planned economies of the soviet bloc countries belonging to COMECON. Although, these flows were of less relevance than in the liberal economies (Pelzman 1978). The orthodox explanation of international trade based on David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantages had prevailed until that time. The classic framework focused on differences in the relative costs. Ricardo explained the commerce and specialization patterns by stressing on technological differences whereas the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) approach proposed endowment differences to be the center of attention. However, stringent conditions were imposed: perfect competition, similarity of production functions and consumer preferences, immobility of production factors and constant returns to scale among others. According to the HO model, the trade scenario foreseen was characterized by growing trade of complementary goods produced by the most advantaged country and did not make possible the existence of intraindustrial trade of similar goods classified in the same industry. The classic theories had to be reconsidered since the exchange of similar goods not only existed but was found to be increasing among developed countries involved in integration processes. A new and suitable conceptual framework arose from the incorporation of Chamberlain monopoly competition model of Dixit and Stiglitz in 1977. The possibility of exploiting scale economies and the ideas of preference similarity of Linder and Drèze in 1961 supporting differentiation product strategies (Krugman 1979, 1980, 1981) provided a successful explanation of the intraindustry trade phenomenon. 
Helpman and Krugman (1985) have succeeded in combining old and new theories in an integrated model that reflected much better specialization possibilities in modern economies. This model allowed predicting trade patterns, both inter- and intraindustrial which had two important implications: Firstly, the connection between interindustrial pattern and differences in factorial endowment remained while intraindustrial specialization was associated with scale economies and product differentiation. The second implication is related to the costs and benefits coming from the liberalization of trade. Structural adjustment caused by the transfer of production resources in open market economies will involve greater or lesser costs depending on time required to find a new equilibrium. The classic trade theory pointed to gains from improvement in consumer prices, while the reassignment in production could have negative impact on owners of the factors employed in the least competitive sectors which have to move to sectors with growing exports. However, this redeployment could not be so traumatic if the specialization patterns were intraindustrial. Trading varieties of the same products, not complements but perfect substitute products, would suppose a smoother adjustment in face of an opening up of trade. “According to the traditional explanation, the reallocation of resources from import-competing to export industries would improve productive efficiency and result in a redistribution of incomes from the former to the latter. Different conclusions are reached for the case of intraindustry specialization...It would further appear that difficulties of adjustment to freer trade have been generally overestimated” (Balassa 1966, p. 472). Likewise, it is possible to conclude that insignificance intraindustrial flow could reflect a special adjustment difficulty in integration processes, as the precursors of smooth adjustment hypothesis assert (Brülhart and Elliott 2002). The smooth adjustment hypothesis (SAH) argues that intraindustrial specialization and relocation intrasector entail less traumatic negative consequences. 
Krugman (1981) formulated an intraindustrial trade model which provides with veracity this hypothesis and recognized as higher-growth intraindustry flows and similar endowment among partners as greater liberalization gains and lesser adjustment costs. Following Krugman’s work, many investigations have proved the causal relationship between intraindustrial trade and lesser adjustment costs (Campbell 1989; Hamilton and Kniest 1991; Brülhart 1994, 1999, 2000; Haynes et al. 2000; Blanes 2002; Brülhart and Elliott 1998, 2002). Thus, the new models showed the coexistence of both specialization patterns, inter- and intraindustrial and identify their causes: endowment differences give rise to interindustrial trade whereas a greater similarity is a determinant of greater intraindustrial flows. However, some empirical studies found contradictory results: a positive relationship between intraindustrial trade and differences endowment (Crespo and Fontoura 2001; Martín and Orts 2002), and other authors discovered an ambiguous relationship between economies of scale and intraindustry trade (Krugman 1980; Storper et al. 2002). These questions can be explained by new theoretical advances which included quality differentiation or vertical product differentiation in the intraindustrial exchanges (Falvey 1981; Falvey and Kierzkowski 1987; Flam and Helpman 1987). These products can be elaborated by different technologies and different factorial composition; and actually this kind of exchange has notably increased in Europe (Fontagné and Freudenberg 1997). The aim of this paper is to quantify the intraindustrial trade in a Mediterranean region involved in a process of economic integration, the European Union, and to analyze its two-way exchanges with the 32 countries that compose our sample. The object of this investigation is Andalusia, region classified as NUTSII by European Community, situated in the south of Iberian Peninsula, some 87,000 \(\hbox {km}^{2}\), in area, much greater than Belgium, for example, and more than eight million inhabitants and therefore, an important European and peripheral region to be considered. The tendency of Andalusia has been diverging since accession of Spain to the European Union, imports and exports have taken different directions. Imports, especially intermediate imports, have shown a very dynamic behavior, whereas exports have been affected by a notable decline in consonance with decreasing industrial regional production. This unfavorable balance reflects underlining Andalusian dependence relative to others regions (Rivera and Robles 2010). For these reasons, Andalusian region has been object of Regional and Cohesion European Policy which promote actions in regions with special economic integration problems. Andalusia does not exceed the 75 % of the European average per capita income, and it is classified as a Convergence Objective region. EU regional policy is one of the most important European policies and destination of one-third of the multiannual budget, 80 % of that is allocated to Convergence Objective regions. The present study contributes throwing light about the evolution of special regions involved in an integration process, finding out more from the effects on regions with convergence difficulties. The paper interest is focused on the relationship between the pattern trade based on traditional specialization according to comparative advantages, and a deteriorated manufacturing external trade, more affected by the imports competition. The intraindustry trade analysis (ITA) has continuously evolved since the first studies about the formation of the European Economic Community. Although, Greenaway and Milner (1987) pointed to tackle unresolved issues would be worthwhile. Exploration of intermediate cases in modeling theories and the trade in parts and components like a proportion of intraindustry trade should be studied. Likewise, measurements which resolve categorical aggregation biases should be found and new “case studies” examining industry specific factors carried out. Finally, on policy issues, the new researches must advance about the implications of the effective protection in a setting of intraindustry trade. On this last matter, this paper aims for being not only an empirical study of documentary and explanatory nature, but an investigation about the implications of the liberalization trade and deregulation and adjustment in regions involved in integration processes. Defending that regional consideration must be added to the international view to assess the globalization process accurately. The paper is organized as follows: in the first section, intraindustrial commerce measure is introduced, and its limitations followed by the index decomposition in section two. In the third and fourth sections, the intraindustrial trade Grubel–Lloyd Indexes of Andalusian region are estimated and the results are presented and deeply described. Regional intraindustrial exchanges are classified according to horizontal or vertical differentiation and latter by high- or low-quality nature with each country in the sample, reflecting the relative specialization. In the fifth section, an explanatory econometric model is proposed in order to find factors which affect intraindustrial trade development. Firstly, the proper model is selected based on logarithmic transformation and explanatory variables are defined based on previous investigations which measurements are presented and described. The results show how each variable influences on regional intraindustrial trade and then are confronted with hypothetical theories. Finally, the conclusions and main findings are summarized in the sixth section.",3

Although recent work has offered important insights into tax interaction in income, property, excise, and sales taxes, few studies have addressed other tax issues in spatial interaction analysis. The literature is scarce with respect to less obvious potential sources of spatial tax dependence, such as welfare programs and tax relief.Footnote 1
 After the seminal work of Besley and Case (1995), several studies investigated yardstick competition as a relevant source of tax mimicking. Bourdignon et al. (2003) argue that electoral rules, such as term limits and coalition sizes, should be used to identify yardstick voting. Similarly, Bartolini and Santolini (2012) analyse fiscal interaction in Italian municipalities and postulate that not only election years but also pre-election years should be considered in comprehending yardstick competition. In contrast, Edmark and Ågren (2008) recognise that the mechanisms of tax competition and yardstick competition are not mutually exclusive. The authors explore tax reforms in Swedish municipalities to investigate the source of tax interaction and test both structures simultaneously for local taxes in Swedish municipalities. In this paper, we test for yardstick competition in tax relief on food in Brazil using approaches similar to those of Bartolini and Santolini (2012) and Edmark and Ågren (2008). Local governments in Brazil do not have the autonomy to create their own tax base and tax rates, which in turn may impose constraints on instruments that can be used to achieve a local objective. Nevertheless, we explore an institutional arrangement that allows lower levels of government to set special tax treatments for food goods in a so-called basic basket food (BBF). Because tax relief on food should focus on the poorer segment of the population and because poor individuals are less mobile than rich individuals, we do not focus on tax base competition, as in Brown and Oates (1987), but consider imperfect mobility of labour supply, as in Wildasin (2011). In particular, we investigate strategic interaction by state governments in pro-poor tax policies in Brazil. First, we consider that Brazilian states can include essential goods in a BBF list and can cut value-added tax (VAT) rates on these selected goods. The reasons for instituting such a tax policy could include both mitigation of the regressive characteristics of commodity taxation on food items and the career concerns of politicians because poor voters could constitute a major coalition group. Next, to identify a possible cause of strategic tax interaction, we explore the fact that a constitutional amendment allows the states to set up a Fund Against Poverty (FAP), which is partially financed by VAT rate increases on cigarettes and gas. Assuming that states do not compete for poor inhabitants and that the poor tend to be less mobile, we argue that any difference in the degree of tax mimicking pre- and post-FAP establishment years is evidence of yardstick competition. Specifically, we argue that this new fiscal tool allows states to choose between VAT relief (tax cuts) on food and redistribution via the fund, and a potential reaction should be politically oriented to attract the support of the poor. Our sample is based on VAT rates in 26 Brazilian states for 17 goods that were the most frequent components of the state’s BBF from 1992 to 2007. The results suggest two main findings. First, we identify positive and significant coefficients for tax mimicking in VAT food relief. Second, the degree of spatial tax interaction became stronger after 2001 following the establishment of the FAP. This result suggests that FAP resources can be viewed as complementary pro-poor policies rather than either a fiscal equalisation (substitute policy) or possible slackness in the constraint of redistributive policies. This behaviour is in agreement with the finding that the VAT is higher on food accounts in states with a higher percentage of poor inhabitants. Additionally, we find evidence that the tax interaction between states is stronger in pre-election and election years, and the evidence favours political cycles. Our main findings are qualitatively consistent with three different dependent variables and two estimation methods. These results suggest that yardstick competition should be considered when investigating the interactions between taxes among Brazilian states. The next section discusses the institutional background and tax legislation in Brazil, and Sect. 3 describes the analytical framework. Section 4 outlines the methodological strategy and describes the dynamics of the econometric approach and the data. Section 5 presents and discusses the results, and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",3

Belasen,Chifeng Dai,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Hurricanes regularly make landfall in the USA. The destructive power of hurricanes can wipe out thousands of lives and cause billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and private property losses, as seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and more recently Hurricane Sandy. The forced migration prompted by hurricanes also creates the potential for an area to lose its human capital. This loss of physical and human capital in a region can have significant short-term and possibly long-term effects on regional economic growth. In addition to their damage to physical and human capital, hurricanes also disrupt regional economic activity due to temporary lack of utility service, employee absenteeism, supply chain interruption, etc. Understanding the effects of hurricanes on a regional economy is critical to mitigate and recover the cost caused by hurricane damage. Policymakers and local businesses could make projections of the potential impacts before actual disasters occur for mitigation strategies and develop better recovery plans (Ewing et al. 2009). Most existing studies of hurricanes and other natural disasters have been conducted in the framework of a singular event study. For example, Guimaraes et al. (1993) study the deviation that Hurricane Hugo caused South Carolina to take from its general trend of economic growth using a with-and-without comparison of the economy. West and Lenze (1994) present a general framework to estimate the regional economic impact of natural disasters using primary and secondary data and apply their research to the problem of estimating the impact of Hurricane Andrew on the economy of Florida. Using time-series econometric models, Ewing and Kruse (2001) study the effect of Hurricane Bertha on unemployment in Wilmington, NC; Ewing et al. (2005) analyze the effect of Hurricane Bret on unemployment in Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as a subsequent study on Tornadoes in Oklahoma City (Ewing et al. 2009). Xiao (2011) and Xiao and Feser (2013) use time-series analysis under a quasi-experimental pairwise matching design to examine local economic impacts of the 1993 Midwest flood. Ewing and Kruse (2002) were among the first to examine a series of hurricanes within a singular framework, namely five hurricanes that struck Wilmington, NC, during the late 1990s. They made use of a time series analysis to look at the effects of each of five hurricanes, both individually and collectively, on the unemployment rate of Wilmington, North Carolina. However, studies of multiple disaster events over large geographic areas are rare. 
Rose et al. (1997) estimate both the direct and indirect regional economic losses from earthquake-damaged electric utility lifelines using specially designed input–output and linear programming models. Extending the previous study, Rose and Liao (2005) examine how damages from disasters are muted by the inherent and adaptive resilience of individual businesses and of regional markets. They advance the computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis to reflect resilience and to provide a more accurate estimate of impacts by disasters. On the other hand, using survey methodology, Kapucu (2008) and Kim and Kang (2010) show that it can be difficult at times for governments to convey the seriousness of the impending disaster and that household preparedness depends on the individual household’s access to communication resources. Furthermore, Cho et al. (2001) integrate transportation network and regional economic models to estimate the economic loss due to earthquake impacts on transportation and industrial capacity. These studies provide important insights on how a particular hurricane or a series of hurricanes affect a particular local economy. However, in general, the effects of hurricanes vary depending on the severity and the timing of the storm and the characteristics of the local economy. Consequently, the insights obtained through an analysis of one hurricane or multiple hurricanes on one local economy may not be useful in generalizing to a different hurricane or a different local economy. Moreover, some of these studies fail to account for other macroeconomic changes that coincide with the dates of their natural disasters and therefore could end up with biased estimates of the actual impact of the disasters. In addition, many of these studies (e.g., Rose et al. 1997; Rose and Liao 2005; and Cho et al. 2001) use hypothetical, stylized natural disasters and therefore consider only limited aspects of the complex set of events that actually occur during a natural disaster. This research contributes to the literature by examining changes in localized taxable sales revenues caused by the devastating effects of a series of hurricanes that actually struck Florida between 1992 and 2006. We pay particular attention to specific timing effects in terms of both the paths taken by these hurricanes and the duration of the economic impacts brought on by them, while controlling for external macroeconomic events to isolate the average impact of hurricanes on revenues. We also specifically address local geography to assess the hurricanes as they weaken while moving inland. The current study is closely related to Belasen and Polachek (2008); Belasen and Polachek (2009) who use the generalized difference in difference (GDD) technique to examine a series of hurricanes that hit the state of Florida to identify potential exogenous shocks in the labor market using quarterly data. Belasen and Polachek (2009) found that across a two-year duration, wages tended to rise while employment tended to fall in hurricane-stricken counties relative to unaffected counties. Most hurricanes that strike the USA occur in the Gulf States and the southeastern states. Florida is a member of both subsets of states, and more hurricanes hit Florida than any other US state. In the 15-year period between 1992 and 2006, a total of 18 hurricanes struck Florida, and none of Florida’s 67 counties have escaped the effects of these hurricanes. Five of the six most damaging Atlantic hurricanes of all time have struck Florida over the course of this time period along with a number of relatively weak hurricanes as well as providing a fairly comprehensive sampling of various strength hurricanes. Since each of these 18 hurricanes in our study varies in the exact timing, strength, path, and the degree of damage and therefore can be analyzed independently or collectively, they fit into multiple random experimental groups (counties that have been hit by a hurricane in a given month) as well as multiple control groups (counties that have not been hit by a hurricane). By comparing those counties that have been hit to the other counties that were not across multiple hurricanes and time periods, we are able to investigate how the impact of a hurricane differs by both the characteristics of the hurricane and the characteristics of the local economy. Moreover, the estimation techniques address the concern of any macroeconomic changes that coincide with the timelines of the hurricanes by accounting for statewide trends in the data. In this way, we can better isolate the outcome of a hurricane as well as quantify its economic impact over time. Furthermore, hurricanes that strike a specific county directly can also have an impact on the economies of neighboring counties. Thus, similar to Belasen and Polachek (2008); Belasen and Polachek (2009) we study the spillover effects of hurricanes on neighboring counties as well. In contrast to the studies based on hypothetical natural disasters (e.g., Rose et al. 1997; Rose and Liao 2005; and Cho et al. 2001), our analysis is based on the total effect of actual hurricanes on county-level taxable sales. While our analysis does not explicitly address the effect of a specific hurricane-caused event (e.g., electricity interruption, transportation network damage, or recovery activities), it captures the total effect of the set of complex events that occur during and after hurricanes. Finally, while we are unable to discern a pure hurricane effect separate from recovery efforts, by identifying impacts at multiple subsequent time periods, we can identify the scope of the recovery relative to the initial impact. Our analysis focuses on the impact of hurricanes on county-level taxable sales revenue, ranging from the sales of groceries, automobiles, hotel rooms, utilities telephone services, to banking services. Taxable sales are not only key indicators of economic conditions but also important tax bases for state and local governments. Since most states and local governments base their budgets on their revenue forecasts, strong and viable tax revenue estimates are vital to regional economies recovering from disasters. Understanding the effect of hurricanes on taxable sales helps local policymakers and fiscal analysts make better revenue projection and better expenditure decisions to facilitate the recovery process. And for Florida, in particular, as a state without an income tax, the stability of taxable sales revenue is of upmost importance for long-term budget plans. In addition, knowledge about hurricane-related costs also helps local businesses create better economic plans before and after hurricanes. Hurricanes can have very different effects on different sectors of a local economy. In view of the fact that tourism is a mainstay of Florida’s economy, it is also interesting to study how hurricanes affect Florida’s tourism industries. Therefore, in addition to the overall sales of all categories subject to Florida sales and use taxes, we examine the taxable sales of two tourism-related industries, i.e., the taxable sales of restaurants and the taxable sales of bars and taverns.Footnote 1
 The current study complements Belasen and Polachek (2008); Belasen and Polachek (2009) by analyzing the impact of the same group of hurricanes on taxable sales revenues across a similar period of time. For states that do not collect state and local income tax, such as Florida, sales and usage taxes are the main sources of revenues for state and local governments. Therefore, taxable sales data are better indicators of state and local tax revenues for such states than employment and wages. Furthermore, we make use of monthly county-level sales data in our analysis, which allows us to better distinguish short-term and long-term effects of hurricanes. For example, we find that when a weaker hurricane directly hits a county, taxable sales revenues relative to unaffected counties will immediately decline by more than 7 % on average in that month; however, revenues may begin to rebound in the month that follows. On the other hand, revenues will show no significant change if that quarter is examined as a whole. Meanwhile, stronger hurricanes will have persistent destructive effects that may lead to a 20 % or greater decline in taxable revenues over that same time frame. Finally, in contrast to Belasen and Polachek (2009), by tracking the paths of hurricanes, we find that the impact of hurricanes on local economies depends on the physical locations of the local economies, particularly in relation to the entry and exit points of the hurricanes.",8

Is there an interaction between the two processes that is associated to growth? On the one hand, there is a considerable body of literature examining the relationship between inequality and economic growth and which adopts a range of theoretical and econometric approaches and methodologies. Some of these studies report a positive impact of inequality on growth; others find a negative effect. These mixed outcomes are usually explained by the fact that the impact of inequality on growth is channelled in different ways and is dependent on several factors, above all, the time horizon, the initial level of income (as a proxy for development) and its distribution. However, when analysing linkages between inequality and growth, “spatial differences in the operation of economic incentives, agglomeration economies, social capital, and the degree and type of social interaction” (Fallah and Partridge 2007, p. 377) are also important, but are not usually considered when analysing the effects of inequality on growth at country level. On the other hand, there is another line in the literature that focuses on the relationship between the geographical agglomeration of economic activity and economic growth. The results here are also controversial pointing to different effects of agglomeration at the country level depending on the stage of development reached by that country. However, the literature fails to acknowledge the fact that these effects are likely to depend on socio-economic factors such as income distribution. Moreover, as dynamic processes, it seems relevant to consider not only the levels of inequality and agglomeration, but also the changes they undergo (i.e., their within-country evolution) and how these two processes interact with each other. In this paper, we set different specifications and consider different measures of agglomeration at the country level (specifically, urbanisation and urban concentration rates) to contemplate not only the effects of given levels of inequality and agglomeration, but also the impact of increasing inequality and agglomeration on economic growth. We analyse results based on different country characteristics, i.e., the level of development (measured by per capita income as in previous studies) and the level of income distribution. This paper is organised as follows: first, the effects of income inequality on economic growth are reviewed (Sect. 1.1). We then focus on the effects of urbanisation (as a proxy for agglomeration at country level) on economic growth (Sect. 1.2) and review the interaction between urbanisation and income inequality (Sect. 1.3). We finish the section by examining the current policy debate (Sect. 1.4). Section 2 describes the empirical model followed (Sect. 2.1) and analyses the data (Sect. 2.2). Section 3 presents the estimation technique and results of the effects of levels, as well as of changes, of inequality and agglomeration on economic growth. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes. The modern study of the relation between income inequality and economic growth dates back to Simon Kuznets, whose inverted-U hypothesis (1955) postulates that income inequality tends to increase at the early stages of development and then falls once a certain average income is attained. The implication is that economic growth in poor countries is likely to be associated with increasing inequality, at least in the short term and medium term. In fact, classical economic theories suggest a positive inequality–growth relationship (Galor 2009). However, in the second half of the twentieth century, the economic performance of several countries seems to indicate that low initial levels of inequality result in higher and more sustained long-run growth (Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Persson and Tabellini 1994; Clarke 1995; Perotti 1996; Temple 1999; Chen 2003; Easterly 2007).Footnote 2 Along these lines, various transmission channels have been identified via which income distribution might influence economic growth, mainly operating through education (human capital accumulation), investment (physical capital accumulation) and fertility.Footnote 3
 Since 1996, given greater data availability (thanks to Deininger and Squire 1996), various studies have analysed the effects of inequality on growth using panel, instead of cross-country, data. Panel data sets can be more puzzling but also more enriching; their analysis facilitates the differentiation of short- and long-run effects and allows us to control for time-invariant omitted variables. Focusing on how the change in inequality within a given country is related to economic growth within that country, we can measure short-run effects. Results in this line indicate that “in the short term and medium term, an increase in a country’s level of income inequality has a significant positive relationship with subsequent economic growth” (Forbes 2000). The effect of inequality on growth then seems to depend on the time horizon considered and initial countries’ conditions.Footnote 4 The effect varies depending on their level of development (Partridge 1997; Barro 2000); when the Gini coefficient is allowed to interact with the level of GDP (in log scale), inequality is negatively correlated with growth in low-income countries—per capita GDP below $2,070 (1985 US dollars)—but positively correlated with growth in high-income countries (Barro 2000). However, the effect also varies depending on the initial level of inequality (Chen 2003); the effect of inequality is positive when initial inequality is low and negative when initial inequality is high. In fact, the level of inequality that maximises growth corresponds to a Gini coefficient of 0.37, the average level for East Asia and West Europe in 1970. The contrasting predictions of the theory, and the diverse results of the empirical evidence, are reconciled to some extent by Galor and Moav (2004). In early stages of development, when physical capital accumulation is the prime engine for growth, inequality enhances the process of development by channelling resources towards individuals whose marginal propensity to save is higher, allowing for higher levels of investment. In later stages of development, however, when human capital accumulation becomes the prime engine for growth—and in the presence of credit constrains—higher inequality leads to a lower spread of education among individuals, handicapping the process of development due to diminishing returns of human capital. In this line, the effects of inequality on growth are seen through the lens of capital (either physical or human) accumulation, and the classical perspective and the posterior theoretical developments and evidence do not need to be contradictory. In fact, the classical perspective refers to a process of increasing inequality, while the evidence of the second half of the twentieth century refers to high levels of inequality. And this is congruent with what Chen’s results suggest that growing rates of inequality are likely to have a different impact on growth depending on initial levels. Urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development—via higher economic growth—tend to be parallel processes. Yet, the question remains as to if, and also when, the geographical agglomeration of economic activity fosters subsequent economic growth. In fact, the World Development Report of 2009 highlights that “the concentration of economic production as countries develop is manifest in urbanisation (\(\ldots \)) but the question is whether concentration (and therefore urbanisation) will increase prosperity” (World Bank 2009). Theory and evidence point towards a positive effect of agglomeration on economic growth. As Dupont (2007) notes, “due to localised spillovers, geographical agglomeration fosters growth”. Indeed, the growth-enhancing agglomeration externalities that take place as urban environments flourish have for long been recognised in the literature (Jacobs 1985).Footnote 5 In this line, the degree of urban concentration may be more important than urbanisation per se, i.e., the growth-enhancing effects of urbanisation may become significant for large urban agglomerations but not for small ones, particularly in developing countries.Footnote 6 Several empirical studies report a growth-enhancing effect of urban concentration on countries’ income in the long run (Henderson 2003; Bertinelli and Strobl 2007; Brülhart and Sbergami 2009). This effect is complex and dependent on several factors. On the one hand, as with inequality, the net effect of urbanisation depends on the level of development. The geographical concentration of economic activity favours growth in early stages of development thanks to economies of agglomeration, but hinders it in later stages due, in the main, to diseconomies of congestion (Williamson 1965). Brülhart and Sbergami suggest a critical level of per capita GDP of US $10,000 (in 2006 prices) at which higher rates of urbanisation become detrimental for growth.Footnote 7 Moreover, the growth-enhancing effect of urbanisation also depends on the way urbanisation takes place (Bloom et al. 2008).Footnote 8 On the other hand, and again as it happens with the impact of inequality on growth, it seems reasonable to expect that the impact of urbanisation on growth is dependent not only on income levels but also on their distribution (which has not yet been empirically considered). First, a certain degree of inequality intensifies the growth-enhancing incentives and agglomeration economies of urban areas—in particular due to better labour market matching and specialisation (Fallah and Partridge 2007).Footnote 9 However, as Fallah and Partridge highlight, high inequality also weakens social cohesion. This weakening may hamper agglomeration economies associated with human interaction—knowledge spillovers and human capital complementarities.Footnote 10 Second, crowded megacities divert productive resources to increase the quality of life of its inhabitants and compensate for congestion costs (Henderson 2003), which are related to transport, pollution, crime and also social inequality—as highlighted by the UN (1993). If inequality is excessive, then more resources have to be diverted, which in turn reduce urban efficiency. The same evidence that supports the idea that urbanisation can promote economic growth, at least in the early stages of development, implies that there is a possible trade-off between economic growth and equal distribution of income, at least in spatial terms. As Brülhart and Sbergami argue, poor countries face a dilemma between lower inter-regional inequality and higher economic growth. In fact, the relationship between development and income inequality described by Kuznets is highly related to the processes of urbanisation.Footnote 11 Classical dual economy models of structural change show that inequality is somehow an inevitable outcome of the process of urbanisation that is characteristic of economic development (Lewis 1954; Harris and Todaro 1976; Rauch 1993). Models of the new economic geography (NEG) similarly help explain how economic development is associated with increasing urbanisation and inequality in its early stages. Agglomeration economies are the key element. Both increasing returns in industrial activities and the fact that utility rises with variety lead mobile workers to concentrate in urban areas and, under typical NEG assumptions, to higher industry wages.Footnote 12 Economic growth is thus facilitated by structural change in the economy, which allows it to enjoy the benefits of increasing returns and agglomeration economies. The process of urbanisation brings about this structural change with people and resources being reallocated from agricultural activities towards industrial activities. The process is associated with increasing inequality, with higher incomes paid in urban areas compared to those paid in rural areas. In this sense, both higher inequality and greater urbanisation can enhance the concentration of the production factors necessary for growth, at least in early stages of development. And this concentration itself further strengthens the reallocation of labour from rural to urban areas (Ross 2000). Hence, both inequality and geographical concentration can be considered as indicating, to some extent, capital (both physical and human) accumulation. In later stages of development, however, further urbanisation, especially growth of large agglomerations—urban concentration—is associated with increasing inequality (Behrens and Robert-Nicoud 2011) and, as mentioned before, can also lead to congestion diseconomies outweighing the benefits from agglomeration economies. The World Bank (2009) supports the argument of spatially unbalanced growth; indeed, economic growth is seldom balanced. Economic development is uneven across space and, as such, will lead to geographical disparities in income, especially in developing countries. Moreover, interventions to reduce spatial disparities can be highly inefficient in terms of national growth performance. Therefore, given that inequality, urbanisation and growth go hand in hand, the key element is the relation of forces between the three processes, at least as countries develop. Thus, rather than concluding that inequality is either good or bad for growth, it would seem to be the case that some degree of inequality is “natural” to the process of urbanisation associated with growth. However, it has also been contested that economic growth does not need to depend on increasing urban concentration (Barca et al. 2012). Moreover, increasing levels of urban concentration might not necessarily be associated with economic development. Interactions between economic geography and institutions are critical for development, as Barca et al. emphasise.Footnote 13 In fact, that the process of urbanisation—and the increasing inequality associated with it—can be modified by social and institutional factors has already been considered in the literature; the displacement of people and resources from rural to urban areas can be motivated by “pathological noneconomic factors”, such as war, ethnic conflict and bright lights, rather than by agglomeration economies and higher productivity (Kim 2008). Additionally, the process of urban concentration seems, sooner or later, to lead to significant congestion diseconomies, as noted above. In developed countries, where institutions are relatively good, economic growth can be based on a different urban system.Footnote 14 In fact, as Duranton and Puga (2000) argue, what matters is the efficiency of the overall “system of cities” and “there appears to be a need for both large and diversified cities and smaller and more specialised cities”. Finally, the OECD (2009a, b, c) Report also highlights the idea that growth opportunities are both significant in large urban areas and in smaller more peripheral agglomerations. By considering the processes of geographical agglomeration and inequality, and their interaction, we can, therefore, differentiate development patterns based on the characteristic conditions presented by a country. Urban concentration is expected to enhance economic growth in developing countries, as suggested by the World Bank (2009), and this process is also expected to be associated with increasing inequality, as suggested by the theoretical literature reviewed above. It is to be seen whether and how country’s levels of income and inequality affect these processes. In developed countries, we expect the picture to be different, as suggested by Barca et al.: alternative urban structures, apart from merely increasing urban concentration, may offer greater opportunities for growth.Footnote 15

Reassessing the density–wage relationship using geocoded data,March 2014,Johan P. Larsson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A large literature on the role of agglomeration economies emphasizes the role of cities in stimulating local social interactions, or interactions not mediated by the price mechanism, as a source of productivity gains (e.g., Glaeser 2000). In this paper, I evaluate the magnitude of the neighborhood effect as a source of density externalities\(,\) by drawing on the implications of a feature of one of the micro-foundations of agglomeration economies, namely the observed tendency for human capital spillovers to work in small, confined environments. It is often postulated in the spatial economics literature that the diffusion of knowledge is driven by social interaction and that its transfer is subject to sharp distance decay (Rosenthal and Strange 2001, 2008; Storper and Venables 2004). Since human capital externalities are driven by interaction, the distance decay is sharp since frequency of contacts depreciate with distance. Human capital and its externalities are essential in explaining cross-regional variation in productivity (Gennaioli et al. 2013). To date, most approaches to quantifying agglomeration economies implicitly assume that economic activity is uniformly spread out over rather large areas of land and that there is zero attenuation of the spillovers within these areas. The effect, however, is likely to be very localized. In the literature on social interactions, the neighborhood approach is in fact quite established. For example, Glaeser (2000) suggests that local social interactions are driven by what can be heard, seen, and felt, and hence, the potential of them taking place should depreciate sharply with space. An adjacent sociological literature on interpersonal networks confirm that frequency of contacts depreciate rapidly with distance. For example, close to a majority of frequent contacts in the Toronto area have been shown to live within 1 mile from each other (Wellman 1996). The ambiguity involved in terms of the size of the geographic units under observation presents this problem as a case of a modifiable areal unit problem (Openshaw 1984; Openshaw and Taylor 1979). Following a large body of research in the urban economics literature, the main contribution of this paper is in estimating the relationship between wages and economic density, but with the addition of a “local agglomeration” effect, looking at variation in economic density at various spatial square-grid resolutions— the smallest of which is 0.25-by-0.25 km—at the sub-city level. In the literature on agglomeration externalities, the “agglomeration” is generally defined as a labor market region (LLM), or a metropolitan statistical area. For most micro-foundations, this approach makes perfect sense. When analyzing, e.g., labor market matching (e.g., Helsley and Strange 1990; Strange 2009), the relevant area of observation is the LLM, which by construction should be highly integrated in terms of commuting flows. But when drawing on the wage–density relationship in analyzing capital spillovers, it is not intuitively obvious what the correct level of aggregation should be, other than the fact that it most certainly is smaller than the average region (cf. Rosenthal and Strange 2008). A good measure should proxy the potential for productive interaction in the local arena, but not be so small as to exclude relevant activity. The need for highly disaggregated data when analyzing an effect that dissipates quickly with distance is illustrated by considering the substantial heterogeneity of sub-city economic activity, as is illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure shows square-level employment density in the Stockholm metropolitan labor market area for two different spatial resolutions: the 0.25-by-0.25 km (left) alluded to above, and for 1-by-1 km (right). Private workforce employment density in the Stockholm metropolitan labor market area. The figure depicts 0.25 km-by-0.25 km (left) and 1-by-1 km (right). Only squares with more than 10 workers are included in the figure. The shade of each square indicates the quintile to which it belongs in terms of employment density. The dark shaded gray areas delineate adjacent labor market regions Economic activity is clustered toward the city center and through corridors following the major highways leading to the city. The uneven distributions fit well with, e.g., the model in Glaeser (1999), where learning occurs (at some cost) close to the central business district of a city, surrounded by unpopulated hinterland. Even though Stockholm is a metropolitan area, it is evident that a vast number of employees in the LLM actually work in quite sparsely populated neighborhoods and that within-region heterogeneity of economic activity is substantial. The structure of Stockholm fits well with predictions from bid-rent theory, where rents near the city center are bid up by productive firms (e.g., Alonso 1960). Why would firms want to bear these costs? Koster et al (2013) even document a substantial premium for building height, which the authors explain in part by within-building agglomeration gains. In a case study of Manhattan advertising firms, Arzaghi and Henderson (2008) document large externalities, but also that the effects dissipate incredibly fast: already after 750 m they are gone. Evidently, there is plenty of cheap, and rather unexploited, land area within the local labor market. And, as evidenced by the rents paid, the potential for productive interaction is unevenly spread out across space within cities which, I argue, should be reflected in the aggregation level of the density measure used. If social interactions are a quantifiable source of human capital externalities and hence of agglomeration gains, then their effects may be identified by looking at variation in economic mass at the sub-city level. Empirically, this is performed by modeling an outcome of agglomeration economies (i.e., higher wagesFootnote 1) as an effect of variation in within-neighborhood economic mass (i.e., density). I use three different square sizesFootnote 2 to test the propositions above: 0.25-by-0.25 km (tentatively referred to as “neighborhoods”), 1-by-1 km (“districts”), and 10-by-10 km (“agglomerations”).Footnote 3
 Empirically, the main idea is straightforward: following Rosenthal and Strange (2008), I analyze the relationship between wages and economic density around the individual’s place of work. More specifically, I assess the relationship between individuals’ wages and square-grid economic density, while controlling for region-wide density (representing, e.g., labor market pooling), firm-level characteristics, as well individual observed characteristics and individual unobserved heterogeneity. The procedure is repeated for all three square sizes in order to study the sensitivity of the estimate with respect to spatial resolution. The intuition behind using three measures is twofold: first, it provides a general idea about the spatial scale at which productive non-market interactions occur, and second, substantially different estimates have implications for propositions about the attenuation of human capital externalities. I exploit a unique, geocoded, full-population dataset, tracking all Swedish workers in the private sector between 1991 and 2008. The data have previously been used in aggregated form by Andersson et al. (2012) to look specifically at attenuation using first and second-order neighboring squares. Various confounding factors need to be tackled; these can broadly be sorted into two categories. First, sorting of productive individuals and firms to the same places will bias the estimates in the absence of proper controls. Second, there is an observed tendency for similar industries to co-locate within larger agglomerations (see, e.g., Capello 2002), such as financial districts located at the core of many large metropolitan areas. Such effects are indeed part of why workers in cities are more productive, but they are not density externalities. I deal with the first issue in a number of ways. First, the data informs on a rich set of basic observable control variables on the individual, and firm levels, as outlined in Table 1. Second, the longitudinal structure of the data allows within-transformation of the variables, which will absorb any time-invariant heterogeneity.Footnote 4 I tackle the second issue by controlling for local clustering of similar firms, by including a variable indicating the relative local presence of related industries, in addition to including industry fixed effects. In order to study the sensitivity of the estimate, all square-level coefficients are first estimated without controls for density at the level of the LLM. This exercise allows an assessment of the potential for conventional region density measures to pick up highly disaggregated phenomena, such as knowledge spillovers, in space. If the square-level estimate is positive at first, but then pushed to zero as the control for the LLM is added, then the empirical framework supports measures of LLM density as sufficient proxies for non-market interactions. If the square-level estimate is positive and resilient to controls at the LLM level, then the empirical context is consistent with a sub-city density externality operating at the very local level. The empirical part of this paper is consistent with productivity spillovers internal to neighborhoods, districts, and agglomerations, even when controlling for economic activity at the level of regions. I provide further evidence of the attenuation of human capital spillovers, by observing persistently higher estimates when the unit of analysis is increasingly disaggregated. Further, the movements in the estimates indicate that the neighborhood level picks up only a small fraction of the region-wide effect and is arguably driven quite exclusively by effects that dissipate sharply with space (such as human capital externalities). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the data source, and the variables. Section 3 presents the empirical estimations, as well as various considerations regarding robustness. Section 4 concludes.",27

Golpe,André van Stel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The size distribution of private firms is an important topic for policy makers in modern economies. Economies dominated by large firms require different economic policies compared to economies dominated by small firms (Audretsch et al. 2007). Therefore, it is interesting to make predictions about future developments of size distributions. In his seminal article, Lucas (1978) predicted that the average size of firms would continue to increase with progressive economic development. This would be the case because higher capital per capita ratios raise the opportunity costs of managing a firm (i.e., wages) relative to the marginal managerial rents. This, in turn, would induce ‘marginal’ managers (entrepreneurs) to become employees, thereby increasing average firm size. In the Lucas model, individuals are homogeneous with respect to productivity in paid-employment, but they differ with respect to managerial ability in entrepreneurship (Parker 2004, p. 55). Individuals freely choose between becoming an entrepreneur with an expected return and becoming a wage-worker earning a fixed wage. Entrepreneurs maximize profits which are an increasing function of managerial ability. In the solution of the model, the more able entrepreneurs run the largest firms. Concerning the role of capital in determining the distribution of the workforce between wage workers and entrepreneurs, the latter benefit less from an increase in capital stock than wage workers do (Parker 2004, p. 56).Footnote 1 This will cause ‘marginal’ entrepreneurs (those who are indifferent—in terms of income—between entrepreneurship and paid-employment) to become employees, thereby increasing the wage earners to entrepreneurs ratio. With increasing capital stocks, it is only profitable for the individuals with the highest entrepreneurial ability levels to manage a (large) firm. Their high ability level enables them to reap the fruits of exploiting scale economies to such an extent that the expected return exceeds the wage rate they could receive as an employee. Accordingly, only these individuals will become entrepreneur and average firm size will be higher. As an empirical test of his occupational choice model, Lucas (1978) estimated a regression model where average firm size depends on GNP per capita (a proxy for capital per capita) and a time trend. Using time series data for the USA over the period 1900–1970, Lucas found strong support for a positive relation between average firm size and GNP per capita, consistent with his theoretical model. However, since the publication of Lucas’ paper in 1978, small-scale self-employment rates have increased in many industrialized countries. For instance, for a set of 23 OECD countries, the business ownership rate, defined as the number of owner–managers of unincorporated and incorporated businesses (outside agriculture) as a fraction of total labor force, increased from 0.100 in 1972 to 0.107 in 2008 (Van Stel et al. 2010). The developments for individual countries are in some cases even more spectacular. The business ownership rate of the Netherlands increased from 0.078 in 1984 to 0.120 in 2012 while that of Germany rose from 0.068 to 0.103 over the same period. On the other hand, even though the business ownership rate of the USA rose from 0.082 in 1972 to 0.108 in 1990, it fell back to 0.090 in 2011 (source: Panteia/EIM’s COMPENDIA database, see Van Stel 2005). These developments in self-employment rates raise the question to what extent the main proposition on the role of scale economies in determining firm size is still true in modern times. In this paper, we report two sets of estimates of the main proposition of the Lucas (1978) model of occupational choice. First, we explore the main proposition of the Lucas model by estimating the basic regression model proposed by Lucas using time series data on GDP per capita and the employment to self-employment ratio (a proxy for average firm size) for 23 OECD countries over the period 1972–2008.Footnote 2 Using modern econometric techniques which allow for the presence of structural breaks, we find some support for the Lucas proposition: For 15 out of 23 countries, we find a significantly positive relation between GDP per capita and the employment to self-employment ratio, in the most recent regime. At the same time, the support to the proposition shifts from one period to another in some countries. These initial results suggest that notwithstanding the rise of small-scale self-employment observed in many countries over the last few decades, economies of scale and scope continue to play an important role in many advanced economies. However, one might argue that the use of GDP per capita is too rough a proxy for capturing capital per capita and associated scale economies. In particular, an economy’s development of GDP per capita typically correlates with development of sector structure, which also influences average firm size (De Goey 2004; Wennekers et al. 2010). Therefore, as a robustness test, we also report estimates of an extended model in which the national sectoral composition is included as a control variable, as well as two other determinants of average firm size: agglomeration externalities (capturing external economies of scale) and the strictness of employment protection legislation. By controlling for these variables—compared to Lucas’ empirical specification—GDP per capita is more likely to capture ‘pure’—internal to the firm—scale economies, in line with Lucas’ theoretical hypothesis. In this extended model, we allow for nonlinearity in the relation between per capita income and average firm size. As will be explained in more detail in Sect. 2, the relation tends to flatten over the course of economic development, because of such developments as tertiarization and an increased preference for job autonomy. Therefore, we report estimates of a panel threshold regression model that allows for nonlinearity in the relationship. In particular, we allow the relation to differ for per capita income levels above or below a certain threshold level. By using the methodology for estimating nonlinear regression models for panel data, recently proposed by Candelon et al. (2013), the model allows for an endogenous identification of the threshold at which the system switches from one regime to the other. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to make use of this approach for analyzing firm size dynamics. When estimating this extended model, we still find that economies of scale are an important determinant of average firm size, but that the strength of this relation is somewhat weaker for the high per capita income regime. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the relation between average firm size and economic development. In Sect. 3, we describe the two regression models, including a discussion of the additional determinants employed in the extended model, and the data used to estimate these models. In Sect. 4, we describe the econometric approaches adopted and present the estimation results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",2

Tiebout (1956) argues that many public goods are local rather than pure and that people’s benefits of sharing the cost of public goods will eventually be offset by congestion. As a consequence, under some hypotheses emphasizing free mobility, unlike a pure public goods economy, an efficient equilibrium may exist. Yet, the original Tiebout model is highly restrictive, as it stipulates that consumers live only on dividend income. This paper shows that whenever there is a jurisdiction-specific labor market, there is a Tiebout equilibrium where jurisdictions are formed by consumers with different labor skills, despite anonymous crowding in tastes. Berglas (1976) and McGuire (1991) address this issue, but they fail to provide consistent models where an equilibrium can be shown to exist. In particular, as Luque (2013) demonstrates, Berglas’s (1976) naive integer assumption on population stratification forecloses many different types of heterogeneous populated jurisdictions. Pauly (1970) and Wooders (1978) observe that a differential techniques’ approach is inappropriate when population and locations are considered discrete sets. 
Luque (2013) shows equilibrium existence and core decentralization in an economy that allows for anonymous crowding, different labor skills among workers, and labor complementarities among worker types in the production of private goods. That research does not provide conditions that guarantee the formation of multi-skilled cities. We show that multi-skilled cities develop if workers’ gains from labor complementarities compensate for their utility loss when they do not consume their most preferred local amenities. For this result, we do not need to assume that workers’ utilities depend on identities of other workers that live in their jurisdiction, i.e., “non-anonymous crowding” ; see Conley and Wooders (1997), Allouch et al. (2009), and Ellickson et al. (1999). Nor must we consider negative externalities within a firm, such as poor working conditions and uncongenial co-workers; see Ellickson et al. (2006). The scenario assumes anonymous crowding, so externalities within a community of these types do not enter into consumer preferences. Our goal is to demonstrate that heterogeneous Tiebout communities exist and are optimal in equilibrium. This analysis is important in several respects. First, it refutes Bewley’s (1981, pp. 725, 733) argument against extension of Tiebout’s analysis to include heterogeneous communities. Second, we demonstrate that Tiebout’s theory does not contravene the empirical evidence on heterogeneous communities in places that offer both public goods and employment. Glaeser and Saiz (2004) give empirical support to the idea that cities with skilled workers are growing because cities are becoming more economically productive, not because they are becoming more attractive places to live. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the main elements of Luque (2013) model with its equilibrium existence and core decentralization results. It explains the differences between this approach to prove the theorems of equilibrium existence and core decentralization and previous approaches to equilibrium existence in the local public goods literature. The comparison is also useful to clarify the notion of a price-taking competitive equilibrium for this economy. We believe our review of the different approaches to equilibrium existence in club/local public good economies is novel and useful for pedagogical purposes. Section 3 builds on the model to identify necessary and sufficient conditions that lead to the formation of heterogeneous populated jurisdictions in equilibrium. Section 4 provides a simple example of this type of equilibrium.",3

In rural areas, retail industries in a place may serve as sources of export production in that people from neighboring areas (hinterlands) may travel to the place to purchase from those industries (Shonkwiler and Harris 1993; Mulligan 1984). Retail industries may, thus, serve an important role in the economic growth of rural places (Deller and Harris 1993). Because of this interdependence between a place and its hinterlands, the size of a retail industry in a rural place will depend not only on the characteristics of the place but also on the hinterlands of the place which are in market area of that industry (Berry 1967). Until the development of geographic information system (GIS) tools, analysts have generally used relatively coarse geographic definitions of market areas when compiling data for analysis (e.g., Mushinski and Weiler 2002). Studies have often used Euclidian measures to calculate distance from a location (Rietveld et al. 1999). Those measures ignore the impact of the physical characteristics surrounding a location on getting to that location (Yu et al. 2012). A more appropriate measure of market area might be the time it takes an individual living in hinterlands to drive to a place. In a recent review of central place theory, Mulligan et al. (2012) discuss the advantages in researching economic development afforded by GIS tools. The availability of regional GIS tools allows researchers to extract data for market areas of varying driving time radii around a place and, thus, permit better approximations of a retail industry’s market area. This paper uses GIS tools to define possible market areas (for an industry) associated with different driving time radii around a place. We then test for the driving time which best reflects particular retail industries’ market areas and use the resulting driving time radii to evaluate industry-specific geographic interdependencies and the nature of their export orientation. Our testing results indicate that having better information (in the form of more accurate data extractions) provides greater insight into the geographic market interdependencies between rural places and their neighboring areas. Just as importantly, our analysis indicates that not testing for the distance appropriate for a given analysis might produce misleading results. If the neighboring market area is specified too narrowly, little evidence of market interdependencies is present. For broader market areas, some interdependencies would be missed if one did not test for an industry’s market area. Thus, assuming a given market area (as was done in Mushinski and Weiler 2002) or a market area of a given driving time distance (as was done in Shields and Kures 2006) may not be appropriate and may produce misleading results. While the empirical analyses in two articles share similarities with our empirical strategy, they differ in one important respect: They do not formally test for the distance appropriate for their analysis. Shields and Kures (2006) is similar to our analysis in that they estimate their model for a market area defined by a drive-time radius. They, however, do not formally address the impact of distance on their estimates or test formally for the distance appropriate for their analysis. Rather, they present estimates for one drive-time radius and mention in a footnote that they estimated the model for an alternative radius as well (2006: 264, n. 1). The empirical analysis most similar to our approach is Cho et al. (2011). They estimated a hedonic price model in which they sought to measure the impact of open space on house prices. They were interested in identifying the distance at which open space no longer affected a house’s market price. They obtained measures of the amount of open space within 50 different distances (from 0.1 to 5.0 miles, in 0.1-mile increments) of a house and estimated their price equation 50 times for each distance. This aspect of their approach to evaluating the role played by distance in their model is similar to our approach; we estimate our model for five different distances. They analyzed the role played by distance in their model by incorporating the 50 estimated impacts of open space on house prices into a distance decay analysis. They did not, however, present a formal method for testing when the open spaces no longer have an impact on house prices. Rather, they (admittedly) chose an ad hoc cut-off of 5 %, arguing that when the measured impact fell below 5 % open spaces no longer affect house prices. We extend Shields and Kures (2006) and Cho et al. (2011) by presenting a formal test for identifying the distance appropriate for our analysis. Our regression results suggest that two different types of retail trade industries serve an export function in rural areas. Weak Export Retail industries serve an export function until competitors appear in hinterlands, at which point they no longer serve an export role. Strong Export Retail industries continue to serve an export role after competitors appear in hinterlands. Distinguishing between these two possible roles, retail trade industries may serve in rural areas provide regional economic development agents and local city governments with better information about the potential economic benefits (both in terms of tax revenues and economic growth) of different retail trade industries. The analysis in this paper begins by discussing the relevant literature regarding industry market areas in rural places. We then present our econometric analysis and empirical strategy. That discussion is followed a description of the data used and how data were extracted for market areas of different driving time radii. Regression and hypothesis testing results are then presented, followed by a conclusion.",5

Most studies found a decreasing trend in the 1980s which reversed in the early 1990s (Tsui 2007). A number of studies have explored the driving forces behind the widening disparities since the early 1990s. Aspects that have been covered include the flaws in China’s development strategy (e.g., Fleisher and Chen 1997; Lin and Liu 2005), its policy with respect to foreign direct investments and its biased openness policy (e.g., Lee 1994; Dayal-Gulati and Husain 2000; Fujita and Hu 2001), the efficiency of township and village enterprises (e.g., Chen and Feng 2000; Naughton 2002; Lin and Cai 2003), location factors (Démurger et al. 2002), and local protectionism (e.g., Young 2000; Kanbur and Zhang 2005). Regional differences in labor productivity levels are known to contribute to a widening of income inequality (e.g., Shiu and Heshmati 2006; Tsui 2007). Note that the disparities in regional labor productivities are larger than those for GDP per capita. For example, the ratio between the best and the worst performing region (i.e., Shanghai and Guizhou) in 2006 was \(57/6 = 9.4\) for GDP per capita and \(127/11 = 11.5\) for labor productivity.Footnote 1 The development over time shows increasing disparities for the period 1997–2006. The Gini coefficient, for example, steadily increases from 0.27 to 0.34 and the same applies for other indicators such as Theil’s inequality index and the coefficient of variation. In this paper, we aim at gaining a deeper insight into the regional imbalances in China by analyzing the differences in labor productivity levels in 1997 and their changes between 1997 and 2002.Footnote 2 Our data cover 27 regions (i.e., 23 provinces and four municipalities) and 32 sectors. We adapt a shift-share approach for our purposes. First, for analyzing the disparities in 1997, we develop a transitive approach to avoid the problem that the results for the productivity difference between \(A\)(nhui) and \(B\)(eijing) are different from combining the results for the difference between \(A\)(nhui) and \(C\)(hongqing) and those between \(C\)(hongqing) and \(B\)(eijing). Another adaptation is that the effect caused by differences in sectoral labor productivities between regions is split into two effects. Namely, differences in sectoral value added coefficients (i.e., value added over gross output) and differences in sectoral output per worker ratios. The reason for making this split is that we are interested in differences and changes in the extent to which regions are specialized in activities that capture a large part of the value chain. This is an interesting issue in a country like China and warrants explicit analysis of the value added coefficients. The third effect still takes the differences in sectoral employment shares between regions into account. The adaptations yield a transitive approach. Second, for analyzing the changes over time, we prefer to consider growth rates of labor productivity levels rather than their absolute differences between 1997 and 2002. This requires a multiplicative approach instead of the usual additive approach. Further, an adequate analysis of changes over time requires data (value added and gross output) in constant prices. On the basis of aggregate data for regions \(k\) (i.e., no sectoral detail) in constant prices and national data for sectors \(i\) (i.e., no regional detail) in constant prices, we develop a new method to estimate the data for each sector \(i\) in any region \(k\) in constant prices.Footnote 3
 The paper is organized as follows. The next section develops the transitive shift-share model (which is an additive method to analyze the absolute differences between regions at a certain point in time) and the multiplicative shift-share model (which allows for analyzing growth rates between two points in time). Both models involve three effects. Section 3 describes the data that we have used and develops the method to estimate the volume changes between 1997 and 2002 (i.e., the data in constant prices). The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 4, and a summary and conclusions are given in Sect. 5.",3

This may in turn have important consequences in a longer time perspective, since the availability of human capital typically affects economic development and growth in a region (see e.g. Lucas 1988; Barro and Sala-I-Martin 2004). A larger share of university graduates in a region positively affects the productivity of a plant, suggesting a spill-over effect in the share of the highly educated (see Moretti 2004a). In another study by Moretti (2004b), where he allows for higher levels of unobserved ability in regions with a larger share of university graduates, he finds that an increased share of university graduates have positive effects on salaries for all types of education levels. A larger concentration of human capital to the already-wealthy urban areas of a country will therefore disfavour growth in the more economically depressed regions and may lead to cumulative effects on regional discrepancies in the standard of living (see e.g. Ozgen et al. 2010). As fewer university-educated people choose to stay in rural regions, these places will not only lose human capital but also experience a diminishing tax base and increasing difficulties in the provision of public services. Abel and Deitz (2011) find only a small correlation between the stock and the production of human capital in a region; it is rather the migration patterns that will play a significant role for the regional composition of human capital. Previous research on regional migration and education usually focuses on the correlation between higher education and regional migration and shows that migration rates increase with university education (see e.g. Molho 1987; Hughes and McCormick 1989; Antolin and Bover 1997; Ritsilä and Ovaskainen 2001). Further, studies on location choice indicate that a majority of highly educated individuals tend to choose to live in cities and urban areas (see e.g. Costa and Kahn 2000; Ritsilä and Haapanen 2003; Pekkala 2003). Studies on migration behaviour of recent university graduates point to similar results. Haapanen and Tervo (2012) find when studying university graduates in Finland, there is a higher out-migration of graduates from more peripheral universities compared to graduates from the Helsinki region, suggesting that there is a brain drain of highly educated from the more rural regions. Bjerke (2012) studies Swedish University graduates and finds similar results that declining regions has difficulties to attract graduates. Further, the characteristics of the region of graduation are of importance for the migration decision. Studies on British and Australian graduates confirm this trend, i.e. cities are more attractive compared to rural areas (see e.g. Concoran et al. 2010; Faggian and McCann 2006, 2009). In the Australian case, the retention rates of the cities are higher compared to more rural areas even though wages are higher in the rural areas,Footnote 1 suggesting that the cities are especially attractive for this education group. Since the labour market for the highly educated is usually more specialized, the probability of finding a job that matches their education is usually higher in cities. In cities and more densely populated areas, certain types of public goods and amenities are present at a larger extent compared to rural regions. The purpose of this paper is to study migration and regional sorting of human capital in Sweden by individual grade point average (GPA) and regional economic attributes. Previous related studies have focused primarily on explaining migration by education levels or migration behaviour conditional on a specific level of educational attainment. This study controls for heterogeneity within the group of university graduates by including GPA and treats graduation from higher education and migration as two simultaneous outcome variables that are driven by individual ability. One such indicator of ability is the GPA from compulsory school, which will be used in the analysis below. To be more specific, a large data set comprising individuals born in 1974 and 1976, respectively, is used to examine how individual characteristics affect the probability of having completed a university degree at age 25 and the probability of migrating to another Labour Market Area between the ages 25 and 30. As such, the present paper provides a complement (and a continuation) to a study by Berck et al. (2011) which examines location choices of the same individuals earlier in life. Their results point to the importance of GPA concerning the decision to invest in further education and (re)location decisions when leaving secondary school. Notice that the GPA will catch some of the heterogeneity in productivity between the individuals, but not all. The relationship between GPA and ability will be discussed in the next section. The possible correlation between unobserved heterogeneity affecting graduation and the subsequent migration is considered and tested explicitly in the statistical analysis. In addition to the direct effects of ability on graduation and migration, the present study also examines the interaction effects between the individual’s GPA and regional characteristics. Of particular interest is the question of whether migration contributes to a systematic selection of individuals with higher GPA into regions with higher tax bases. Another contribution compared to previous studies on migration of the highly educated is the richness of data, which enables controlling for parents’ location and education. Further, data on two entire cohorts is used to check the stability of the results. The results indicate a positive significant effect of the individual’s GPA on the migration decision. The regional characteristics are also of importance; individuals located in regions with a higher tax base per capita, a higher share of university-educated people and more densely populated areas have a lower probability of migrating. In the next section, the theoretical framework is presented. The data is described in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the econometric model and hypotheses are outlined. The results and robustness checks are found in Sect. 5, while Sect. 6 concludes the study.",19

Pereira,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the wake of the Great Recession, unemployment persists as a significant problem despite moderate growth in economic activity. This apparent disconnect between economic growth and unemployment is particularly concerning, especially in the context of efforts to formulate policies, at both the national and local levels, to promote economic growth to address labor market concerns. The purpose of this paper was to estimate the relationship between the unemployment rate and economic growth, a relationship defined by Okun’s law, in Virginia metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and the District of Columbia in order to highlight the importance of regional spillovers in determining the local rate of unemployment as well as in reconciling estimates for Okun’s law at the national and sub-national levels. International analyses suggest a weaker relationship between economic growth and unemployment at the sub-national level [see, for example, Apergis and Rezitis (2003), Christopoulos (2004), Villaverde and Maza (2009), Perugini (2009), Kangasharju et al. (2012), Binet and Facchini (2013) and Oberst and Oelgemöller (2013)]. State level estimates of Okun’s law in the U.S. are generally consistent with national estimates, though they tend to show a greater degree of variability [see Blackley (1991), Freeman (2001) and Connaughton and Madsen (2009, 2012)]. Yazgan and Yilmazkuday (2009) find that Okun’s coefficient has been converging through time around geographic clusters of U.S. states which underscores the importance of regional forces in local labor markets. We further examine asymmetries in Okun’s law across the business cycle as well as the importance of regional spillovers during periods of contraction. The stability of Okun’s law through time has been a source of concern [see Weber (1995), Moosa (1997), Silvapulle et al. (2004), Holmes and Silverstone (2006), Knotek (2007), and Ball et al. (2013)]. This concern is particularly apparent in the context of policy efforts to address weak labor market performance since the onset of the Great Recession [see Ball and Koenig (2009) and Owyang and Sekhposyan (2012)] and other jobless recoveries [see Holmes and Silverstone (2006)]. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between unemployment and output growth is stronger during periods of economic contraction [see Cuaresma (2003), Silvapulle et al. (2004), Holmes and Silverstone (2006) and Owyang and Sekhposyan (2012)]. We extend these analyses to assess the degree to which asymmetries in Okun’s law are a feature of local economies and the extent to which the strength of these effects mirrors that for the U.S. In this paper, we estimate a Panel Spatial Durbin Model which accounts for spatial dependency and estimate the importance of regional spillovers in local labor markets. Kuscevic (2012) examine Okun’s law in U.S. MSA by specifying a Panel Spatial Durbin Model, yet without considering possible asymmetries during the Great Recession. Oberst and Oelgemöller (2013) estimate the relationship between output and unemployment in German regions in this framework but focus primarily on within region effects rather than indirect spillover effects. Our primary focus is on evaluating the strength of Okun’s law at the regional level, during the Great Recession and the importance of regional spillovers in local labor markets. We focus our analysis on Virginia MSA and the District of Columbia. A relatively narrow study region is justified by the fact that the strength of regional integration depends, in part, on proximity. Furthermore, the MSA represent a diverse array of economic conditions, including both rural and urban areas, regions dominated by agriculture, heavy industry and high-tech industries, and both large and small regions. These aspects of the study region are in many ways reflective of the diversity present in the U.S. economy and make Virginia MSA an interesting, but not idiosyncratic, case for examining regional spillovers.",10

However, as noted by Anselin in his seminal work on this topic (1988, p. 20) “The determination of the proper specification for the elements for this matrix, \(w_{ij}\), is one of the more difficult and controversial methodological issues in spatial econometrics.” Although this was written some 25 years ago, the underlying problem has not yet been addressed extensively in the literature. The standard procedure that has been adopted in applied spatial econometrics is to use a spatial weights matrix based on either geographical distance between jurisdictions defined as neighbors or if they share a common border or not, even if this does not reflect the underlying theory. Both approaches are somewhat inconsistent with that advocated by Anselin (1988, p. 21), who argued that “in line with a model driven approach to spatial econometrics, the weight matrix should bear a direct relation to a theoretical conceptualization of the structure of dependence, rather than reflecting an ad hoc description of spatial pattern.” Here, we present a method for defining the spatial dependence across jurisdictions when testing or controlling for yardstick competition across jurisdictions. In contrast to many previous approaches, our method is based on the underlying theoretical factors that are held to drive interactions in models of this sort. Theoretical models of strategic interaction between local governments are often empirically implemented using spatial econometric techniques (e.g., Brueckner 2003; Revelli 2005). One challenge for spatial public finance empirics is to discriminate between different theoretical explanations for strategic interactions between local governments, expenditure spillovers (preferences), fiscal competition (constraints), and yardstick competition (expectations) (Manski 1993). The basic concept of expenditure spillover is that public services provided by one local government enter the welfare function of other jurisdictions, as discussed by authors including Case et al. (1993), Revelli (2003), and Lundberg (2006), among many others. Fiscal competition is based on the hypothesis that in the presence of mobile tax bases, the fiscal policy of one local government will influence the budget constraints of other local governments. For example, if an increased local income tax leads to out-migration, this will indirectly affect the budget constraints of other local governments and could give rise to fiscal competition for mobile tax bases. Previous empirical research has focused on tax competition, in which the optimal tax rate in one jurisdiction depends on the tax rate in other jurisdictions (Brett and Pinkse 2000; Brueckner and Saavedra 2001; Hayashi and Boadway 2001; Revelli 2001; Esteller-Moré and Solé-Ollé 2001). Yardstick competition is based on the idea that inhabitants have imperfect information regarding the honesty and/or competence of the local decision makers (local politicians). Therefore, inhabitants in one jurisdiction will use information on local public expenditures and tax rates in other jurisdictions as a yardstick when evaluating the quality and/or efficiency of their own local decision makers (Salmon 1987; Besley and Case 1995; Besley and Smart 2002). In order to empirically discriminate between the different theoretical explanations for strategic interactions between local governments, it is crucial to identify and empirically capture the different mechanisms that are assumed to underpin the interactions in question. For instance, it is reasonable to use information on the road network in a given jurisdiction and its usage by inhabitants of other jurisdictions when testing the hypotheses of spillovers from road expenditures. If jurisdictions \(i\) and \(j\) share a common border and \(i\) spends a large share of its budget on roads, but there are no roads between \(i\) and \(j\), it is less likely that inhabitants of jurisdiction \(j\) will benefit from the road expenditures in jurisdiction \(i\).Footnote 1 Similarly, when testing the hypothesis of yardstick competition, it is reasonable to gather at least some information on the inhabitants’ interest in or knowledge of local public expenditures and tax rates in other jurisdictions. This information could be gathered using a questionnaire or approximated using, for instance, some measure reflecting the coverage of local political issues by local mass media [see for instance Horrigan et al. (2004) and Bruns and Himmler (2011) and references therein]. However, such information is often very time-consuming and/or costly to collect and is therefore not usually available to researchers. Instead, in most of the existing literature, interactions across jurisdictions are evaluated based on geographic criteria such as the distances between the centers of the jurisdictions or the existence of a common border between adjacent jurisdictions. However, these measures do not necessarily reflect political interest (or information) and hence will not be consistent with the tested theoretical model.Footnote 2 The problems associated with this largely arbitrary specification of spatial interdependence in spatial econometric models have been highlighted by Rincke (2010). This paper presents a very simple and intuitive way of defining interactions across jurisdictions when testing or controlling for yardstick competition using spatial econometric tools. In particular, it is shown that the interest of jurisdiction \(i\)’s population in local politics in jurisdiction \( j\), information which is often unknown or not easily collected, can be approximated using a simple function of the relative populations of two jurisdictions, information which is often known or at least relatively easy for the researcher to collect. This definition has two particularly useful properties: (1) it reflects political interest, and (2) it provides exogenous elements for the spatial weights matrix W.Footnote 3
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In order to give some structure to the rest of the discussion, Sect. 2 presents a simple model of yardstick competition based on the works of Besley and Case (1995) and Revelli (2005), along with an empirical specification that can be used to test the hypothesis of yardstick competition. Section 3 provides empirical evidence showing that the interest in local politics among the populations of neighboring jurisdictions can be predicted using the relative population of the two jurisdictions. Finally, Sect. 4 provides some concluding remarks.",5

(1989) and Anderson and Niven (1991), the standard result is that firms agglomerate in the middle of the linear city. As is well known, Gupta et al. (1997) showed how the features of the consumers’ distribution crucially affect such a result—agglomeration turns out to be conditional on the density not being ‘too thin’ around the firms’ equilibrium location. They also enquired about dispersion equilibria in the case of symmetric densities by presenting some examples, all of which use (roughly speaking) U-shaped distributions.Footnote 1
 These results suggest that whether agglomeration or dispersion obtains in equilibrium should depend on how consumers are distributed across markets.Footnote 2 In this paper, we build upon the work by Gupta et al. (1997) to derive a two-equation representation of the standard model: equilibrium locations are arrived at by solving a two-equation system, the unknowns being one firm’s location and the distance between firms. This allows to discuss both necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of locations to be an equilibrium in the duopoly case with a generic density. In particular, this enables us to show that a necessary condition for dispersion to be an equilibrium is that the distribution be not unimodal, while a (convex) U-shaped density will admit a dispersion equilibrium if it is not too asymmetric in the specified sense. Our results are derived under assumptions about parameters which ensure that all markets are served in equilibrium—which, as is well known, amounts to transportation costs being low enough relative to the consumers’ reservation price. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we recall the basic model and characterize its equilibrium locations as the solution to a two-equation system. Section 3 derives nonunimodality as a necessary condition for dispersion to be an equilibrium, as well as sufficient conditions to that effect. In Sect. 4, we discuss a simple example of a dispersion equilibrium when the density is not U-shaped. Section 5 gathers some concluding remarks.",5

Despite obvious differences in their empirical analyses, most of those studies report—if any—a positive tax reaction to neighbors’ tax rates and, implicitly or explicitly, argue that such a response is caused by strategic tax competition attributable to cross-border shopping, smuggling or both. In this paper, we examine taxes on cigarettes and gasoline in the USA and explicitly test for the source of horizontal interdependence. 
Brueckner (2003) describes two sources of strategic interaction among governments, captured in the resource-flow and spillover models, respectively. The former stresses the role of tax base mobility, while the latter points to the possibility of information spilling over among interested voters in different jurisdictions (Salmon 1987). Unfortunately, it is difficult in practice to disentangle one source from the other, as both models make the same empirical prediction, namely that tax rates should be interdependent among sub-central governments. In the case of tax competition, tax base mobility (in our case, through cross-border shopping and/or smuggling) is required; in the case of yardstick competition, it is assumed that voters assess the relative performance of their respective governments and compare it with that of comparable governments when deciding who to cast their vote for. Thus, for this accountability mechanism to work, fiscal information must be readily available to voters and politicians have to have the chance of being reelected. In any case, from a normative point of view, the cause of interdependence is not trivial. While yardstick tax competition improves political accountability; interdependence due to mobility of tax bases generates inefficiently low tax rates and hence the under-provision of public goods and services due to a race-to-the-bottom (Wilson 1986; Zodrow and Mieszkowski 1986).Footnote 1
 As Wilson and Wildasin (2004) conclude, “More work is needed to incorporate reasonable political processes into tax competition models, leading to sharper empirical distinctions between good and bad tax competition” (p. 1088). In our case, this is necessary for the very empirical identification strategy of the source of tax interdependence, since “..., the crucial point about testing yardstick competition theory is not about local tax-setting behavior as such, but in tax setting as linked to the incentives and constraints that are generated by the local electoral system” (Bordignon et al. 2004, p. 332). Thus, our empirical approach is firmly rooted in the US political process at the state level. In order to infer the source/s of tax interdependence, we proceed in line with the seminal papers by Case (1993) and Besley and Case (1995a). First, we distinguish those states run by a governor who is ineligible to run for reelection (because of a term limit) from all other states. We test their differential reaction for cigarette and gasoline taxes for a panel dataset running from 1992 to 2006. In the case of cigarette taxation, we find that only those states with governors who are not lame ducks set their tax rates by taking into account the rates levied by comparable jurisdictions—which, in keeping with the literature, we shall identify from this point on as the geographically contiguous states—while the other states do not react. Specifically, in the case of governors not approaching the end of their tenure, a one-cent increase in the cigarette tax rate of their neighbors implies a contemporaneous cigarette tax increase of around 0.24 cents. In contrast, we cannot reject the absence of a reaction in gasoline taxation, which shows a very high degree of inertia, in particular, today’s tax rate is almost 85 % of yesterday’s rate. These results are confirmed when we expand our analysis of the political process to take into account the impact of the election year (see, for example, Solé-Ollé 2003; Bartolini and Santolini 2012). In particular, independently of their neighbors’ tax policies, we find weak evidence that non-term-limited governors tend to lower cigarette taxation as the election year approaches (Besley and Case 1995b, 2003),Footnote 2 while their reaction to what their neighbors do is certainly greatest as election year approaches. These two additional results—which do not hold for gasoline taxationFootnote 3—reinforce the fact that cigarette tax interdependence is driven by a political process and—in contrast with what the literature has suggested—interdependence is due to yardstick competition. At first sight, it might be striking the fact that electoral incentives through yardstick competition apply to cigarette taxation. The framework developed by List and Sturm (2006) might be helpful to address this result. These authors define what they call “secondary” policy issues, which only affect relatively small groups of people (single-issue voters). The preferences of the electorate are heterogeneous. Then, List and Sturm (2006) show that politicians will design their policies in such a way as to maximize their electoral support; this is more likely the bigger the size of that group and the more competition is expected in the next electoral contest. This would occur despite the skeptical views that argue against the electoral importance of secondary issues for accountability purposes. If single-issue voters are important (i.e., they amount to a relatively large number of votes and the fiercer the next electoral contest is expected to be), politicians should design policies differently depending on whether they can or cannot opt for reelection. If they can, they might distort policies to gain the support of single-issue voters, and if they cannot (e.g., they are lame-duck governors), they will reverse the first-term policies in order to match their preferences (recall there is no a consensus about that issue). This electoral manipulation does not make sense if preferences are homogeneous, that is, regarding a given dimension all the electorate and also the politician share the same preferences. Hence, elections are likely to influence those secondary policy instruments where the electorate is divided. Cigarette and gasoline taxation can be defined as “secondary” policy issues;Footnote 4 however, preferences heterogeneity seems to be strongest in the former case. In fact, as Mankiw (2009) argues, there is a wide consensus among the populace—citing a Wall Street Journal poll of the general public—against using taxes on driving to reduce energy consumption; according to that poll, only 5 % of those polled were in favor of higher taxes. Also according to a public opinion study by AEI (2013; p. 21), the number of people who think gasoline taxes are fair is strictly decreasing (only 7 % consider them “very fair” and 30 % “not at all fair”), while in the case of cigarette taxation, opinions are much more heterogeneous (27 % consider them “very fair” and 21 % “not at all fair”).Footnote 5 Thus, in the case of smoking, it seems there are contrasting preferences: smokers in favor of low cigarette taxes, and the rest in favor of high cigarette taxes. In the case of gasoline taxes, though, according to the evidence presented above, it seems that most people are against high taxes. All in all, one would expect politicians to have more incentives to manipulate cigarette taxation than gasoline taxation. We test List and Sturm’s (2006) empirical predictions, which are confirmed for cigarette taxation. In particular, as long as smokers in a given state are relatively important, lame-duck governors tend to raise taxes to counteract the low level of cigarette taxes set to gain their electoral support in the first term. However, this effect is lower, the greater the margin of victory in the latest electoral contest, as the relatively electoral importance of that group was also lower. For non-term-limited governors, we cannot identify the impact of smokers (as it is defined as a dichotomous variable), but in those states where smokers are important find that taxes are higher the greater the expected margin of victory. Thus, again the margin of electoral victory tends to counteract the incentives to favor single-issue voters. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the section that follows, we provide a summary of the empirical literature on tax interdependence, focusing on yardstick competition and on the analyses carried out for US excise taxation. In section three, we present our empirical analysis, and in section four, we present and discuss our results. Finally, we conclude.",9

Kholodilin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Noise is an important disutility negatively affecting the price of housing, especially when it exceeds certain thresholds. Noise produced by airplanes landing and taking off can be particularly annoying. This is part of the reasoning that led the government of Berlin to undertake the construction of a large new airport at the south-eastern outskirts of Berlin. The relocation of Berlin’s airports has allowed for a radical change in the flight paths that will substantially reduce the noise exposure of the city’s residents. The planning process has been difficult and lengthy due to its utmost importance for the general public. The first plans for a single airport near Berlin evolved shortly after the reunification of Germany. In 1992, three candidate sites (Jüterborg, Sperenberg, and Schönefeld) were investigated. A regional planning procedure was completed in 1994, dismissing Schönefeld in favor of the other two locations.Footnote 1 An expert committee on aircraft noise was formed in 1994 in order to advise the German Aviation Control Agency (Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH, DFS)Footnote 2 on issues of aircraft noise, including the right to propose flight paths. The committee is made up of local residents, the airport company, airlines, and the administrative bodies involved in the planning process.Footnote 3
 Due to political pressure, the dismissal of Schönefeld was revoked in a consensual decision by the partners of the project, i.e., the federal state (Bund) and the states (Länder) of Berlin and Brandenburg. In December 1999, a new regional planning procedure was requested. In the process, various groups were asked to comment and to bring forth complaints. “Rough” noise projections were provided and updated several times. In August 2004, the regional planning office announced its decision in favor of Schönefeld. Right from the beginning, local residents lobbied for a reduction in aircraft noise. In October 2009, in reaction to a court ruling in March 2006, the regional planning office declared a banning of flights during night time (0–5 AM).Footnote 4
 In September 2010, the German Aviation Control Agency DFS presented preliminary flight paths for Berlin-Brandenburg Airport (international airport code BER) to the public, including approximate climb gradients and average utilization of the routes. These differed from the original plans of the regional planning procedure, which led to protests by local residents.Footnote 5 However, the final decision resided with the DFS and the Federal Agency for Flight Control (Bundesaufsichtsamt für Flugsicherung), leaving the expert committee and the Länder parliaments in the role of advisors. In its press release from September 27, 2010, the DFS stressed the requirement that the flight paths should be finalized as closely as possible to the opening date of the airport in order to be able to react to unforeseen developments. Nonetheless, the statement also stressed the short amount of time left until the scheduled opening of the airport on the 3rd of June 2012. Supposedly, the changes that could still be expected at that moment were limited.Footnote 6
 The DFS updated the flight paths in July 2011 and took up some suggestions made by the expert committee. Albeit the new paths were declared preliminary, certainty increased considerably with the scheduled opening date less than one year away. The accompanying press statement was more concise than that of the previous announcement, and its language was more decisive. Final flight paths were published on January 26, 2012, but the changes to those from July 2011 were small. This paper seeks to analyze the development of property prices around BER in 2011 and 2012 following the publication of flight paths in July 2011 and in January 2012. The planning process is characterized mainly by two aspects: its lengthiness that introduced a considerable degree of uncertainty due to the many reversals of previous plans and its heavy media coverage. These two features have consequences for the assessment of the announcement of July 2011: It is reasonable to assume that both home buyers and sellers were aware of the plans and that the degree of uncertainty about the exact location of the flight paths was much lower after September 2010. In this setting, the update of the plans can be seen as an exogenous event. In addition, the influence of local political groups was limited due to the power of decision of the DFS and the Federal Agency for Flight Control. The literature on the noise discounts to housing value is quite extensive. The most recent papers on flight noise, price discounts and expectations are reviewed in Sect. 2. Compared with the existing literature, the contribution of our paper is threefold. Firstly, it concentrates on the BER airport that is still under construction and whose impacts on the value of housing in its neighborhood have never been investigated before. Additionally, most studies on the effects of aircraft noise do not exploit exogenous variation in order to identify the relevant coefficients (recent examples are McMillen 2004; Nelson 2004; Salvi 2007; Cohen and Coughlin 2008; Püschel and Evangelinos 2012). An exception is a recent study by Boes and Nüesch (2011) who examine rents around Zurich airport. Secondly, unlike most other papers, we estimate anticipation effects. Residents can only guess how annoying the resulting flight noise will be since the airport has not been put into operation yet. A better understanding of these expectations might help to reconcile estimates of noise discounts from different cities at different points in time that sometimes vary considerably across studies. The only study that has investigated this issue more closely so far is by Jud and Winkler (2006). Thirdly, in contrast to most of the literature, we approximate the housing value using the offer prices that are published on the Internet by home sellers. In fact, the latter approach has become increasingly popular in Germany, where the data on property transactions are generally insufficient (often only very few characteristics of the houses are reported) and difficult to obtain. The offer data together with additional indicators that depict the characteristics of the location of the property are described in Sect. 3. As the papers reviewed in Sect. 3 show, the transaction prices of housing in Germany are usually lower than the listing prices, but objects with listing prices close to the transaction price sell more quickly on average. A time-on-the-market dummy that characterizes how long a property offered for sale stayed online allows us to capture most of the discrepancy between the listing and transaction prices. Since the observations close to the flight paths were online for a slightly longer period of time, we acknowledge that our results might be biased downward to a small extent. Section 4 provides a detailed description of the BER flight paths planning process and our hypothesis about the formation of expectations of home owners and the general public with respect to future aircraft noise. In Sect. 5, the empirical specification and the econometric methods used are explained. According to our estimates presented in Sect. 6, expectations of future noise substantially and significantly dampen current housing prices. The noise discount amounts to about 10 % of the value of the property located near the flight paths, regardless of the flight attitude. It is as high as 12–13 % when the expected flight altitude is below 1,000 m. These results fall within the range of estimates obtained in similar studies. Thus, the airport should be prepared to face claims from home owners requesting a compensation for the noise as soon as the airport will be put into operation. In fact, only 3 % of the observations in our sample represent the properties that will be affected by the aircraft noise. Moreover, the communities located in the neighborhood of the airport are relatively sparsely populated. Nevertheless, several thousands will be affected. Thus, a careful assessment of the price discounts for aircraft noise undertaken in this paper is not only interesting from a theoretical perspective, but is also a highly relevant empirical exercise.",24

Clusters of invention and innovation, tied to localized knowledge exchange in and among the cities and regions of the USA and Europe, have been extensively documented (Jaffe 1989; Acs et al. 1994; Anselin et al. 1997; Fischer and Varga 2003). Knowledge exchange also occurs in long-distance collaborative webs of social and institutional relationships (Breschi and Lissoni 2003; Autant-Bernard et al. 2007; Knoben 2009; Wilhelmsson 2009; Huber 2012). Aspatial proximity links scientists and engineers in different cities, especially in dynamic technologies such as biotechnology where research collaboration has become crucial for inventive productivity (Gertler and Levitte 2005; Birch 2007; Cooke 2007; Ponds et al. 2007). This article illuminates structural properties of the American city system of coinvention in biotechnology. A central goal is to figure out the nature and strength of local, regional, and national connections. Structure and change in the system are interpreted by comparing relational ties between metropolitan areas with certain idealized patterns from city systems theory and associated empirical findings (Mulligan et al. 2012). The existence of collaborative clusters and networks raises challenges for understanding the new geography of invention. Case studies of particular biotechnology clusters are popular having the advantage of depth, but with limited universality (Coenen et al. 2004; Fontes 2005; Cantner and Graf 2006; Casper 2007; Kenney et al. 2009; Eisingerich et al. 2010). These studies describe regional innovation environments especially prevailing local industrial structures, corporate alliances, availability of skilled professionals, access to research resources such as universities, and private and public funding opportunities. Growing numbers of American cities with active biotechnology inventors justifies a complementary focus on city system properties with an emphasis on network generality. We spotlight biotechnology co-invention because technological advance in the field involves increasing collaboration and the extension of inventor relationships (Feldman 2001; Owen-Smith and Powell 2004; Fontes 2005; Gertler and Levitte 2005; Cooke 2006; Maggioni et al. 2007). Knowledge exchanges in the American city system are uncovered by tracing participants in biotechnology co-patenting networks in 1979 and 2009 and attributing each co-patent to the metropolitan areas where they reside. Lösch (1954) and Christaller’s (1966) central place theories (CPT) simultaneously explain the existence of cities, their diverse functions, spatial configurations, size interrelationships, and interactions. Systems that contain extensive interaction between cities of similar size challenge predictions that exchanges flow up the urban hierarchy. Linkages unconstrained by distance contest idealized processes that drive the development of vertically nested spatial monopolies. Churning in the American city system associated with Manufacturing Belt decline and Sunbelt growth questions the permanent advantages of large cities. Moreover, a surge of information exchange through market and corporate routes has transformed city system connections. Our approach identifies pivotal nodes in the biotechnology city system and the nature and strength of their centrality. As collaboration grew and complexity intensified, new routes of knowledge exchange developed. Investigating associations between city network centrality, size, and patent intensity leads to an estimate of the magnitude of biotechnology patenting needed for agglomeration economies in biotechnology to arise. Finally, the core-periphery configuration of the 2009 biotechnology city system is documented. The core has multiple well-integrated dominant centers tied to each other and a scattered array of peripheral places, which contrasts with two-region idealized frameworks of new economic geography (NEG) (Mulligan et al. 2012). A goal of the analysis is to contrast the cities of the new biotechnology core with the dominant American nodes identified by previous investigations of interurban information exchange (Mitchelson and Wheeler 1994; Esparza and Krmenec 1996a; 2000; Neal 2011a).",23

Rey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The title of this talk could have multiple meanings. If one were to use Open as an adjective, what would follow would be a discussion of the many ways in which our world of regional science has embraced open science, an important offspring of the open source revolution. An alternative meaning would have Open as a verb in which case the talk that follows would be a call to arms for regional scientists to engage with open science and open source. As should be clear in what follows, I hold the second interpretation to be correct and this for two reasons. First, I have personally seen the impact that open source has had on scientific software development, primarily through my experiences with the packages STARS (Rey and Janikas 2006) and PySAL (Rey and Anselin 2010). While software was my point of entry into this open world, the impacts have spread beyond better software development models to influence many aspects of my day-to-day existence as an academic regional scientist. These impacts, which I outline in more detail below, have been profoundly positive. Second, I feel that we, the regional science community, have been largely disengaged from developments in open science. I am excited about the possibilities that a deeper engagement could offer to the future of regional science and want to do all that I can to hasten its development. To do so, I will contrast two worlds of science. The first, and the one we regional scientists currently find ourselves embedded within, is what I will call captured science. While this is our status quo, it is not generally what holds everywhere in the broader scientific community where a second and new type of science is operative. This is what I will call open science. My purpose in this talk is to situate regional science within the paradigm of open science by arguing that our future should be linked to open data, open modeling, open software, open collaboration, and open publication. I will begin by outlining what exactly I mean by captured science, highlighting its key characteristics and pointing to some of the challenges and constraints it poses. Some of these issues may be familiar to many of us, but I think we, as a community, have not had a healthy open discussion about their implications. I then move on to consider the alternative model of open science, what its components are, and how regional science might benefit from migrating to this model and away from the current status quo. I close the talk with some thoughts about the likely future for open regional science.",16

Van der Vlist,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The real estate sector and construction sector make considerable contributions to regional economic development. Because of their strong intersectoral linkages, investment in these sectors is often taken as an important policy tool by the central government or by local government to accelerate growth and create employment (Polenske and Sivitanides 1990). However, rapid growth of these sectors may result in imbalances which could hinder the development of the national or regional economy (Bielsa and Duarte 2011; Yotopoulos and Nugent 1973). Therefore, it is important for policymakers to understand the role they play in the national or regional economy. The real estate sector and construction sector are intimately related with each other (Bielsa and Duarte 2011). Real estate is the operation and management of buildings. Hence, the output of construction sector is the most important input of real estate sector. In China, more than 15 % of the input of the real estate sector was from the construction sector in 2002. Thus, this paper takes them as one sector (the real estate–construction sector, abbreviated as REC). 
Hirschman (1958) suggests that the intersectoral linkages can be used to identify key sectors in the economy. A substantial amount of researches have been conducted to identify key sectors, with special attention to the real estate sector (e.g., Li et al. 2011; Song and Liu 2007; Wang and Liu 2004) and the construction sector (e.g., Bon and Pietroforte 1990; Pietroforte and Gregori 2003; Polenske and Sivitanides 1990; Rameezdeen and Ramachandra 2008; Song et al. 2006). The literature shows that the REC is a key sector in both developing and developed countries. Coulson and Kim (2000) and Green (1997), among others, find that real estate investment is an important determinant of GDP growth. The rapid growth of the REC promotes the development of economy but could also skew the economic structure and lead to disruptions as speculative activities play an important role in the real estate and construction market (Malpezzi and Wachter 2005; Xiao 2010). Bielsa and Duarte (2011) and García Montalvo (2007) analyze the recent disruptions in the Spanish economy caused by the REC. García Montalvo (2007) shows that the REC in 2000 was disproportionately large compared to the rest of the Spanish economy. Based on the 2000 input–output (I–O) table, Bielsa and Duarte (2011) find that with 22.4 % of total value added (17.5 % of the jobs), the Spanish REC in 2000 was substantially larger than the OECD average of 18.6 % (12.4 % of jobs). Their results indicate that Spain is a construction-driven economy which makes it vulnerable to a fall in real estate and construction activity. The sharp rise in unemployment after the global financial crisis and REC meltdown reveals the vulnerability of Spain’s economy. Since 1978, China has experienced a rapid process of urbanization and industrialization (Zhang and Song 2003). Large numbers of people have moved from rural into urban areas leading to investments in residential real estate and commercial real estate (Mak et al. 2012). What’s more, Chinese central government gradually introduced an urban real estate reform program to transform the socialist plan-oriented urban real estate market into a market-oriented one (Zhao and Bourassa 2003). As a consequence, the REC has experienced rapid growth. In 2010, there was 4.05 billion square meters of real estate under construction, including 3.15 billion square meters housing, 0.12 billion square meters offices, 0.45 billion square meters commercial real estate and 0.33 billion square meters for other use. Realized REC investment reached 6.17 trillion yuan in 2011 accounting for 24 % of total investment in China (China Statistics Yearbook 2012). Several researches have been conducted to study the impacts of the REC on the Chinese economy. Liu et al. (2002) show that China’s real estate investment is a major cause of economic growth, both in the short and in the long run. Wu and Zhang (2005) find that the increasing construction sector promotes economic development through its strong intersectoral linkages. However, some researches point out that the rapid growth of the REC is a threat of the balanced development of the Chinese economy, as it is oversized and consumes excessive resources (Chang et al. 2010; Fernandez 2007). The rapid growth of the REC could skew the structure of the Chinese economy. However, little empirical analysis has been done to answer the questions whether the REC is oversized and to what extent its rapid growth might skew the structure of Chinese economy. As regional development is uneven in China (see among others Chen and Groenewold 2011; Gravier-Rymaszewska et al. 2010; Keng 2006), the impact of the REC on the regional economic structure is expected to vary across regions. However, little empirical evidence is available yet. This paper intends to fill in this gap by measuring the economic impacts of the REC on the regional economy at provincial level based on the 2002 and 2007 I–O tables of 30 Chinese provinces. Both the intersectoral linkages and the employment impacts are measured. Detailed analyses of the impacts of a sector, i.e. the REC, on the other sectors of a regional economy are conventionally based on I–O tables. The most common approach is the classical multiplier method (CMM) which measures the importance of a sector by the average of its technical coefficients (Clements and Rossi 1991). The hypothetical extraction method (HEM) is an improvement over the CMM in that it gives a more complete overview of a sector’s importance by presenting the impacts on every other sector by eliminating it from the economic system and capturing the changes in other sectors’ outputs (Guerra and Sancho 2010). Based on the I–O tables which present input–output flows among all sectors, the HEM provides accurate measurement of the impact of one sector on the regional economy by quantifying the direct and indirect input–output flows between the sector and the others. As the REC is connected with all other sectors through purchasing other sectors’ output and selling its output to them (Bielsa and Duarte 2011; Polenske and Sivitanides 1990), the HEM is tailored to the objective of our study. The main finding of this paper is that the Chinese regional economies are strongly dependent on the REC. The weighted average regional employment impact of the REC on in China (22 %) is larger than those in OECD countries, notably the USA (12 %), the UK (10 %), France (12 %), Germany (13 %) and the Netherlands (12 %) (Bielsa and Duarte 2011). It is even larger than in Spain (17.5 %) where the REC is disproportionately large and has brought about a vulnerable national economy. The finding of a disproportionally large REC applies in particular to the Chinese provinces Tianjin, Jilin, Shaanxi and Ningxia where it accounted for more than 40 % of the regional economy and more than 40 % of regional employment in 2007. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology, Sect. 3 presents the data and empirical results, and Sect. 4 discusses and concludes.",21

Theoretical investigation of patent licensing of cost-reducing innovations can be broadly divided into two classes of models: models where the innovator is an outsider and models where the innovator is an insider. Within the first class of papers (outsider innovator), Kamien and Tauman (1986), Katz and Shapiro (1986) and Kamien et al. (1992) argue that the patentee prefers a fixed fee licensing scheme to a mechanism based on royalties when firms compete with quantities,Footnote 1 while Muto (1993) shows that the reverse holds when firms compete with prices. Within the second class of papers (insider innovator), royalty is preferred to fixed fee by the patentee in a homogenous Cournot market (Wang 1998), under Bertrand competition (Wang and Yang 1999) and in a Stackelberg model (Filippini 2005). A quite unexplored field in patent literature is the analysis of patent licensing in the context of spatial competition. Contributions considering this issue are relatively scarce. The first contribution in this direction is Caballero-Sanz et al. (2002), which study the optimal licensing scheme by an outsider innovator. The potential licensees compete with prices within a circular market. The main finding is that royalties yield higher payoff than do a fixed fee regardless of the size of the innovation. Poddar and Sinha (2004) consider both an outsider and an insider patentee, and assume that the firms compete with prices and are located at the endpoints of a linear market. They find that the patentee is better off by licensing through royalties both when it is an insider and when it is an outsider. More recently, Heywood and Ye (2011), in a Bertrand-type game, consider licensing in a Hotelling framework where firms are allowed to spatially price discriminate. They find that, unless the demand is constrained, licensing through royalties yields higher profits to the patentee than licensing through a fixed fee. Finally, Lin et al. (2013) consider the patent licensing decision in a uniform pricing game when firms can endogenously choose their location in the linear Hotelling market. They find that if the patentee is the location leader, the royalty licensing mechanism may be not the best method of licensing: no-licensing can be the best method, whereas fixed fee is always the worst. On the other hand, if the innovator is the follower, royalty is always the best method. All the above-mentioned articles assume that firms compete á la Bertrand. In contrast, this article introduces spatial Cournot competition in a patent licensing model. Spatial Cournot modelling has been widely adopted to analyse public policies issues. For example, Chen and Lai (2008) adopt a Cournot spatial model to analyse the impact of a firms’ location restriction over welfare; Matsumura (2003) investigates the effect of exclusive territories; Matsushima and Matsumura (2003) consider a mixed oligopoly where a public firm competes with private firms; Colombo (2012a) investigates the impact of spatial Cournot competition for antitrust questions. In this article, we consider endogenous locations. It is well known that spatial Cournot competition tends to induce complete agglomeration when the Hotelling linear framework is considered (see for example Hamilton et al. 1989, and Anderson and Neven 1991). Therefore, in the case of endogenous choice of locations by firms, the model will be degenerated to a non-spatial model.Footnote 2 In order to avoid this unappealing feature of the spatial Cournot competition model, we introduce a restriction in the location possibility of firms. In particular, we assume that the two firms cannot be located too close to each other in the space (i.e. a minimum distance requirement is at work). In many real-world situations, if a suburb is already characterized by the presence of a certain number of firms, other firms cannot be located there. This may be motivated by the fact that congestions costs may arise if firms are located too close, or by explicit law requirements. For example, until 2006, all new shops and commercial activities in Italy were imposed to be located at a minimum distance from existing plants (where the minimum distance depended on the sector and on the characteristics of the city or the region involved).Footnote 3

Footnote 4
 Within this set-up, we first compare a fixed fee licensing mechanism with a royalty licensing mechanism for the case of an insider patentee. Then, we shall characterize the optimal two-part licensing mechanism. Two different situations are considered. In the first, the firms engage in spatial discrimination, that is, they sell a different quantity in each point of the space. This approach has been followed by, among the others, Hamilton et al. (1989) and Gupta et al. (1997 and 2004). In the second, the firms adopt a uniform delivered quantity, that is, they sell the same quantity in all points of the market. The uniform delivered quantity case follows from Colombo (2011), where it is shown in a game-theoretical model that when quantity-setting firms first choose whether to discriminate or not and then set quantities, the unique equilibrium consists in all firms selling a uniform quantity to all consumers.Footnote 5
 Our results are as follows. In the spatial discrimination model, the firm owning the innovation always prefers selling the innovation to the rival by adopting a royalty licensing scheme. Even in the more general context of the two-part tariff, the optimal tariff for the innovator consists in a pure royalty mechanism. In contrast, in the uniform delivered quantity model, we show that royalty licensing is not always preferred to fixed fee licensing. Indeed, the spatial distribution of the innovator with respect to the potential licensee plays a key role for the licensing strategy adopted by the innovator. In particular, we show that if the innovator is the follower in the location sub-game and the minimum distance constraint is strong enough, the resulting locational equilibrium is characterized by the innovator locating at the periphery of the city, while the licensee locates in the middle. In this case, fixed fee turns out to be preferred to royalty licensing by the innovator. This result is due to what we call a “locational effect”, which is absent in non-spatial frameworks as well as in symmetric spatial frameworks. Namely, when choosing the licensing strategy, the innovator faces a trade-off. By using a royalty mechanism, the innovator maintains the cost advantage over the licensee and obtains additional revenues from the royalty; by using the fixed fee, the innovator loses its cost advantage, but it increases the total quantity in the industry and extracts the higher profits obtained by the licensee through the fee. When the innovator is located at the periphery of the market and the licensee is located at the centre, the innovator remains disadvantaged even if it maintains the production costs difference by licensing through a royalty. Therefore, due to the locational effect, the profitability of royalty licensing relatively to fixed fee licensing is limited, and the innovator prefers the fixed fee mechanism. This result provides a novel rationale for fixed fee licensing based only on endogenous spatial asymmetry between the innovator and the licensee. In the context of the optimal two-part licensing scheme, a parameter space is found where the fixed fee is positive: again, a condition for this to occur is that the locational disadvantage of the innovator is strong enough. The rest of the article proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the spatial Cournot framework with a minimum distance requirement in order to analyse the optimal licensing mechanism of an insider innovator. In Sect. 3, we derive the optimal choice of the innovator in the case of spatial discrimination, whereas in Sect. 4, we study the case of uniform delivered quantity. In both cases, we consider an endogenous sequential choice of locations by the innovator and the licensee. In Sect. 5, we extend both frameworks to consider the case of a more general two-part licensing scheme. Section 6 concludes. The proofs are in the “Appendix”.",8

In fact, the research in economic geography (Rosenthal and Strange 2003) and regional science has empirically shown that agglomeration has been positively associated with local productivity level, not only in the United States (Ciccone and Hall 1996) but also in Europe (Ciccone 2002). In spite of the positive correlation between agglomeration and productivity, the rhetoric about regional clusters has been widely adopted in policy circles only since the early 1990s. This rhetoric can be viewed as a mixture of Michael Porter’s point of view about what creates competitive advantage for firms and nations, and regional theories on localization advantages and industrial districts. Although one can trace the origin of this rhetoric in Porter’s diamond modelFootnote 1 (originally developed to analyze competitive advantages of nations in international markets) Porter’s idea that “competitive advantage is created and sustained through a highly localized process” (Porter 1990: 19) has determined a refocusing of competitive advantage from nations to regions. Consequently, in line with the deep discussion that has characterized the literature on agglomeration externalities, Porter’s competitiveness concept has also come to be used to examine regional performance. In the course of this change, the argument that competitive advantage results from characteristics about entire industries in their “home region” has evolved into a universal policy therapy that assures sustained growth to any locality or region (Perry 2010a, b). In fact, the Porter-inspired cluster developments (e.g., Porter 1998, 2000) gave policy professionals a rationalization for local intervention and often for building “Silicon Somewhere” (Hospers et al. 2008). Policy-makers in many countries and regions view this validation as advice to combine cluster support with any type of intervention, and Porter’s consultant work, alone or in association with his Monitor Company, has contributed to the wide diffusion of cluster strategies in many European countries (Benneworth et al. 2003; Rosenfeld 2005). In this paper, we use Porter’s definition of clusters as “geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms in related industries, and associated institutions (e.g., universities, standards agencies, and trade associations)” in a particular field that compete but also cooperate (Porter 2000: 15). This concept does not incorporate all the richness that has emerged in the last two decades about clusters (see, for instance, Saxenian 1994; Markusen 1996; Cooke 2002; Martin and Sunley 2003; Brachert et al. 2011). But, even though simplistic, it is sufficiently broad and pragmatic for including the main characteristics of the three “ideal-typical models” of industrial clusters presented by Gordon and McCann (2000: 513).Footnote 2
 The essentially deductive approach of Gordon and McCann (2000) complements the Markusen’s (1996) inductive research about “slippery space.” Both approaches show that clusters reflect not only economic responses to the pattern of available opportunities and complementarities, but also the level of embeddedness and social integration. So, while different in method and focus, both the “ideal-typical models” of the former and the four types of “sticky places” of the latter are difficult to be conceived without understanding the characteristics of the regions (and the concept of region), where the cases studied are embedded. In regional science, there are many concepts of region (Bailly 1998) such as natural region, homogeneous region, historical region, and functional region, but a quick look at the long-run evolution of geography (Freeman 1961) reduces the plurality of concepts to three distinct perspectives. The first view is formal. It considers regions as organic entities, i.e., as natural phenomena representing the territorial expression of long-standing interaction between particular human populations and the lands they occupy. Such a view was dominant before the 1950s and provided the basis for the so-called regional geography (Freeman 1961). The second and more recent view sees regions mainly as a descriptive tool defined according to specific criteria. In this scheme, a particular approach is to identify regions according to their function, thus distinguishing functional regions from the formal regions mentioned above. A functional region is one that displays a certain functional coherence, or a system of interactions when defined against certain criteria. They are often described as nodal regions composed of heterogeneous units and populations (typically a network of towns and dependent smaller communities) often identified, or confined territorially, by the pattern of flows of goods, services, and people (Karlsson 2008a). Both the functional coherence and the system of interactions, keys in the functional region, are significant for delimiting (and distinguishing between) different types of clusters as well as for defining the commonalities where a particular cluster is based on. So, it seems that the functional concept of region is the most appropriate for examining the geographical dimension of clusters, and this is even more evident if the definition of clusters depends on a limited number of characteristics. For instance, if we consider that the crucial characteristic of a cluster is the bulk of advantages that spill out from a common labor market, it is not unrealistic to consider that this cluster will be limited by the same frontiers that confine the (functional) region centered on this labor market. However, real-world clusters are not based on only a particular characteristic, and the broad cluster concept we use in this paper points to another direction. In fact, somewhat intermediary between formal and functional regions is the notion of programming, or administrative regions (Stilwell 1992). This concept provides a more pragmatic view of regions, recognizing the fact that economic and social institutions tend to operate within administrative boundaries. These represent the limits of governance and habitually enclose the structure for strategic decisions and for distributing services. It is in this pragmatic perspective that the term region is used in this paper. Although the admiration for clusters, devoted by policy circles, may not be fully shared by the research community, in which some authors consider the popularity of the cluster policy essentially as a result of the use of techniques of “brand management” rather than as a genuine intellectual discourse (Martin and Sunley 2003; Perry 2010b), an increasing interest in clusters is undeniable as two handbooks on the matter demonstrate (Karlsson 2008a, b). This interest was supported not only on some literature that has highlighted and developed a set of decade-old ideas, but also on the discovery by the new (or endogenous) growth theory (Romer 1986) of how to deal with externalities and increasing returns in economic growth models. The extension of the endogenous growth theory to regional economics (Johansson et al. 2001) as well as the appearance of the new economic geography and its developments (Krugman 1991a, b, 2011; Scott 2004) contributed to giving an additional force to a regional cluster growth policy, which emphasizes agglomeration advantages over alternative modes of industrial organization. While there is evidence that such advantages exist (Rosenthal and Strange 2004), from a regional policy standpoint, a question is mandatory: what is the appropriate policy for enforcing the clustering development and thus promoting regional economic growth?Footnote 3
 The traditional answer corresponds to the classical optimal-policy perspective (Rodriguez-Clare 2007), i.e., to provide a production subsidy to firms generating externalities, with the subsidy adjusted for equalizing the strength of the externality. However, this is a very demanding solution since it is extraordinarily difficult, or even impossible, to compute the exact power of externalities. Given this difficulty, a mitigated version is usually followed: the presence per se of externalities is taken as a good and enough indication to advise public intervention and, accordingly, to support the industries that are likely to produce positive external economies. Another possible answer to the above question is based on Porter’s policy prescriptions.Footnote 4 But, as Woodward and Guimaraes (2009) point out, there are no known cases where regions or countries have explicitly followed these principles, instead of the industrial targeting associated with the classical optimal-policy perspective. This paper deals with the above-mentioned traditional answer and adds to the existent literature in three ways. First, it contributes to a better characterization of dynamic externalities by extending the “advantages of backwardness” approach, formerly developed to explain the catching-up of national economies, to the regional context. Second, the paper presents a new model that relates static and dynamic externalities to the clustering mode of production in the regional context. Third, the paper contributes to giving a more accurate theoretic basis to the regional policy and to helping policy-makers in choosing the right policy for increasing the well-being of depressed regions. This is also noteworthy because although policy measures have frequently been applied to clusters, the literature about cluster policies is controversial, with its conclusions oscillating between superfluous (Maskell and Kebir 2006), negligible (Van der Linde 2003), and playing a crucial role (Brenner and Mühlig 2007). The results of this paper have clear implications in regional development, by guiding policy in choosing the most appropriate strategy for facing some frequent dilemmas, as for instance the one embodied in the following question: must policy be focused on the creation of new clusters in activities that have proven to have large positive external effects elsewhere or, conversely, must policy be focused on developing the traditional activities in the region, which allegedly have shown lower externalities? So, the concept of externality is key in the architecture of the model used. Accordingly, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with the externalities associated with industrial agglomerations. Section 3 considers the existence of dynamic externalities and relates them to both localized learning and the advantages of backwardness. Section 4 uses a model that includes static and dynamic externalities associated with agglomeration in order to draw lessons for guiding clustering policy. Section 5 discusses some results of the model. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",19

Haddad,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Interest by policymakers on regional issues in Lebanon has been recently renewed with the publication of the National Physical Master Plan of the Lebanese Territory (NPMPLT 2005). The NPMPLT has challenged the received wisdom that there is little interest in spatial development planning and spatial development issues in small size countries.Footnote 1 It defined the principles of developments for various regions as well as the basics of the usage of territory for all areas. It also proposed facilities and sites of planned activities, specifying their objectives, dimensions and locations in the tradition of regional development plans elsewhere.Footnote 2 Challenges for the future economic development of the country were identified in different sectors in a context of increasing internal and external obstacles to the Lebanese economy. In a context of growing global integration and increasing international competition, economic sectors and regions were not prepared for facing this new economic environment after a period of internal turbulence. As indicated in the NPMPLT,Footnote 3 competitive sectors were always densely concentrated in the conurbation core of the governorates of Beirut and Mount Lebanon, while peripheral regions were taken out of competition by strong protectionist policies for the agricultural sector. As more liberal policies advance in the country, new challenges emerge to the Lebanese regional economies, which may be also addressed through place-based policies: (i) domestic integration of the periphery to the core, by improvements of the transportation network in the country; (ii) TFP-enhancing policies in the lagging regions, benefitting from lower local costs and geographical advantages; and (iii) sectoral policies related to regional comparative advantages in the global markets. This paper focuses on the first set of place-based policies in response to the challenge of globalization. It looks not only at the domestic integration of the country in the form of better links to the regions’ domestic markets and suppliers, but also to improved links to the world economy.Footnote 4
 Though small, the Lebanese economy is not homogenous internally, presenting variations across sectors and regions (Table 1). Thus, it is expected that the economic impact of economic policies will vary across different governorates (mohaafazaat). In the context of renewed attention to the spatial aspects of economic development, both from a theoretical perspective (Fujita and Krugman 2004) and from a policy perspective (World Bank 2009), there is a growing need for economic and socioeconomic models for bringing new insights into the process of regional planning in the country. In this paper, we introduce the ARZFootnote 5 model, an interregional computable general equilibrium (ICGE) model for Lebanon, in an attempt to bring additional insights to some of the proposals presented in the NPMPLT. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. After this introduction, Sect. 2 gives the motivation for the empirical exercise in the context of competition policies for the country. Section 3 presents the general features of the ARZ model, the ICGE model for Lebanon to be used in the simulations. Section 4 presents the main results of the basic simulation—in which we look at an increase in domestic and international integration of Lebanese regions through reductions in trade costs. Section 5 proceeds with a thorough decomposition of the results of the basic simulation, based on structural sensitivity analysis techniques, which considers the role played by changes in specific trade costs. Concluding remarks follow.",2

Evidence from Sweden,August 2014,Niklas Elert,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"New firm formation and its role in regional economic development has been studied extensively in recent years (cf. van Praag and Versloot 2007; Fritsch and Falck 2007; Andersson and Koster 2011). The theoretical foundation for this interest can be traced back to Schumpeter (1934, 1943). He popularized the term “creative destruction” to describe the transformation that accompanies innovation, in which new, creative firms challenge incumbents, some of which are destroyed or forced to increase productivity by the increased competition (Christensen 2013; Wennekers and Thurik 1999; Fritsch and Mueller 2004; Robinson et al. 2006; Carreira and Teixeira 2010; Baptista and Preto 2011; Andersson et al. 2012; Bos and Stam 2014). Consequently, new firm formation is generally assumed to stimulate economic growth, both nationally and regionally (Wennekers and Thurik 1999; Aghion et al. 2004, 2005; van Stel et al. 2005; Acemoglu et al. 2006, 2007; Aghion and Griffith 2008; Dejardin 2011). This being said, some contributions find that the net effect of new firms on growth may be negative in the short term, before turning positive with a significant impact on growth for as long as 10 years (Acs and Mueller 2008; Fritsch and Mueller 2008; Andersson and Noseleit 2011; Fritsch 2011; Andersson et al. 2012). A lagged positive effect from entry on growth seems to occur at the regional level as well (cf. Johnson 2004; Carree and Thurik 2008; Dejardin 2011), although these results appear somewhat inconclusive (Braunerhjelm 2011). This may in part be due to something (Schumpeter 1934, 1939) himself acknowledged: That the large majority of new firms are not true innovators. Rather they can be seen as a type of “turbulence” (Audretsch and Fritsch 1999; Santarelli and Vivarelli 2002, 2007; Brown et al. 2006; Nightingale and Coad 2014; Henrekson and Sanandaji 2014). Most entrants die young; generally 50 % or less survive the first 5 years (Geroski 1995; OECD 2003; Bartelsman et al. 2005; Delmar and Wennberg 2010), but conditional on survival, new firms can be expected to grow faster than their mature counterparts (Wagner 1994; Haltiwanger et al. 2010). This motivates this study on Swedish data on limited liability firms, where I make a distinction between regular entrants and surviving entrants, defined as firms that survive for at least 2 years post-entry. The distinction makes it possible to assess whether different municipal and industry characteristics are conducive to surviving entrants as compared to all entrants. Sweden usually gets a low rank in international comparisons as regards rates of self-employment, new firm formation and entrepreneurship (Delmar and Davidsson 2000) although the trend seems to have improved in recent years (Braunerhjelm et al. 2013; Amoros and Bosma 2013). Several features of the Swedish policy environment potentially discourage the formation of new firms, notably the high ratio of taxes to GDP, high marginal taxes on labor and capital income earned by entrepreneurs (cf. Andersson and Klepper 2013; Sørensen 2010; Stenkula et al. 2014; Du Rietz et al. 2013, 2014), and strict employee security provisions and wage policies (Davis and Henrekson 1999; Skedinger 2008, 2012). Nonetheless, in a recent study, Andersson and Klepper (2013) do not find any large differences in new firm formation in Sweden compared to Denmark, Brazil and the USA. Results from prior studies examining conditions for entry in Sweden suggest that a broad set of conditions affects the entry decision. For example, Nyström (2008) examines the relationship between the municipal institutional environment and new firm formation, finding that positive attitudes toward private enterprises and right wing political rule has a positive effect on entry, while a large governmental sector has a negative effect. The findings of Daunfeldt et al. (2010) meanwhile suggest that the level of market concentration in the local industry as well as relative purchasing power within the municipality greatly affects entry of Swedish retail firms. Meanwhile, Andersson and Koster (2011) study persistence in start-ups at the regional level, finding that regions with high levels of start-up rates will exhibit stronger persistence. Furthermore, Eliasson and Westlund (2013) test the relationship between self-employment entry and variables connected to demography and education, labor-market status and regional attributes, and find that the same factors influence entry in Swedish urban and rural areas. Both municipal and industrial conditions that may affect regular entry as well as surviving entry are therefore tested in this paper. I performed the analysis using an extensive dataset covering all limited liability firms in Sweden during 2000–2008, and done both at the level of Sweden’s 290 municipalities, and at the level of industries within municipalities (based on the 1-, 3-, and 5-digit NACE classifications). This makes it possible to take both municipal- and industry-specific factors into account and to observe whether effects differ depending on the level of aggregation. I took three sets of entry determinants into account. First, a set of general municipal characteristics, which may be associated with the conducive dimension described by Stenholm et al. (2013), such as the presence of skilled labor force, accessibility of suppliers and customers, and proximity of high-quality universities. Secondly, I followed Nyström (2008) in considering a set of institutional variables of both a formal and informal nature, since institutions are considered as the “rules of the game” and can be expected to impact new firm formation (cf. North 1990). Lastly, a set of variables related more intimately with industrial organization are included, since such variables are important parts of the firm’s immediate ecology (Metcalfe 2009). This paper treats the choice to make entry as a discrete event, which implies the use of count data models. Such models have previously been used extensively to model firm location decisions (see e.g., Guimarães et al. 2003; Brixy and Grotz 2006; Koo and Cho 2011; Manjón-Antolín and Arauzo-Carod 2011; Mota and Brandão 2011), but less so for Swedish data (Daunfeldt et al. 2006, 2010, 2013 are exceptions but they only consider the retail and wholesale sectors of the economy). In a count framework, both positive and zero occurrence are natural outcomes (Hammer and Landau 1981; Lambert 1992; Hall 2004; Karazsia and van Dulmen 2008). Of four count data models considered, the negative binomial regression model consistently best accounted for the features of the data and to have the greatest predictive power. It is therefore used in the estimations in this paper. Results are robust to different specifications and levels of aggregation, suggesting that some municipal and industrial variables have a considerable effect on both regular and surviving entry. A standard deviation (SE) increase in municipal median income increases the expected entry 15–30 %, while a SD increase in the share of population with a 3-year university education increases it by 16–45 %. In addition, SD increases in industry concentration or in minimum efficient scale more than halved expected entry, more industrial liquidity has a clear-cut positive effect. The effects from institutional variables, e.g., taxes, government ideology and the business climate, are low by comparison. This is in line with Stenholm et al. (2013) who found that for the formation of innovative, high-growth new ventures, the regulative environment matters little compared to the conducive dimension, noting in particular the importance of knowledge spillovers and the capital necessary for high-impact entrepreneurship. The results were quite similar regardless of whether regular entry or surviving entry served as dependent variable. One exception was population size, which had a strong influence on entrants overall, but a much weaker effect on entrants that went on to survive for at least 2 years. By contrast, the importance of the level of education appears stronger for surviving entrants than for regular entrants, pointing to the importance of human capital.",12

Braid,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Consider the locations of two sellers on a unit interval [0, 1], assuming that both sellers have the desired product of each consumer. Many authors in the spatial competition literature consider this question, usually with some sort of variable price competition. The Nash equilibrium locations vary from minimum to maximum differentiation. See for example Anderson and de Palma (1988), Anderson and Neven (1991), Braid (2008, 2011), d’Aspremont et al. (1979), de Fraja and Norman (1993), de Palma et al. (1985), Economides (1984, 1986), Gupta (1992), Hamilton et al. (1989), Meza and Tombak (2009), Osborne and Pitchik (1987), Tabuchi and Thisse (1995), and the survey article by Biscaia and Mota (2013).Footnote 1 Of particular interest here, the socially optimal locations are at (0.25, 0.75) in most papers in the literature, and if the prices of the two sellers are fixed and equal, then the Nash equilibrium locations are at (0.50, 0.50) in most papers in the literature. Section 2 states the assumptions of this paper, which is intended to apply to stores or to libraries. Libraries are an example of a public facility. The socially optimal locations of public facilities (those that maximize welfare) have often been studied in economic geography, regional science, and operations research, usually in models that are more complicated geographically than a single interval. For example, see Bigman and ReVelle (1978) and ReVelle (1991). Many authors in both the spatial competition literature and the public facility location literature consider more than two stores or public facilities, but I confine attention to two stores or libraries. Adding more stores or public facilities decreases aggregate travel costs (see for example Massam 1974). I mention the possibility of more than two stores (or libraries) in a couple of places in this paper, including Sect. 10. I assume a unit interval and two stores (or libraries), but I modify the usual analysis by assuming that each consumer has probability w \((0 < w < 1)\) of finding a desired product at each store (or a desired book or information at each library). Intuitively, the socially optimal locations are more centralized than (0.25, 0.75), since consumers in one half of the market must sometimes travel to the store (or library) in the other half. Section 3 considers the socially optimal locations under full information, which are partially centralized if \(0< w < 1\), and completely centralized in the limit that w goes to 0. This is somewhat related to Proposition 2 of Braid (2008), as discussed in Sect. 5 and footnote 7. Section 4 derives the socially optimal locations under costly “visit search,” which is the case of primary interest in this paper. Visit search is considered in Braid (1996), but he has both “main facilities” and “branch facilities,” and his results are very different (see Sect. 10). Costly visit search is applicable if a consumer cannot get precise information over the phone and must visit a store (or library) in person. The consumer sometimes “wastes” a visit to one (or both) stores. The socially optimal locations are more centralized than (0.25, 0.75) for all \(w <\)1 and more centralized than under full information (as in Sect. 3) except in the limits \(w=0\) and \(w=1\). For \(w \le 0.5\), the two stores (or libraries) are optimally located together at the center. Section 5 considers socially optimal locations using a different assumption about product availability than Sects. 2–4. Section 6 shows (not surprisingly) that the Nash equilibrium locations, assuming fixed prices, are (with full information or visit search) simply (0.50, 0.50). These are the same as the socially optimal locations for some parameter values under visit search. Section 7 examines the choice between one combined store (or library) at the center and two separate stores (or libraries) with economies of scale.

In this context, there is reason to believe that there are greater possibilities for industrial growth by using horizontal cooperation networks (HCNs). This concept is based on the potential and synergy of group work, involving rapport, cooperation, and coordination among the participating members, with the aim of collectively increasing competitiveness (Carvalho and Lautindo 2010). By definition, HCNs incorporate a significant number of companies that operate around the same productive activity, as well as related and complementary companies in the same geographical area, with local cultural identity and connections that offer the possibility of articulation, interaction, and cooperation (Hoffmann et al. 2007). Thus, an increase in these factors can produce an increase in the competitiveness of the companies involved and the region where they are located (Gerolamo and Carpinetti 2008; Leask and Parker 2007; Braga 2010). Increased competitiveness achieved through cooperative actions between companies, through the formation of an HCN, is the result of the union of actions aimed at fostering the competitiveness of the companies which constitute the network, reflecting their evolutionary development, both individually and collectively, within the network. An HCN is only well characterized if an intense transfer of technical information occurs between its participants. This type of network has a broader scope of management, including organizations, individuals, their goals, values, and interests (de Sordi et al. 2009; de Carvalho and Tálamo 2010). 
Carvalho and Lautindo (2010) argue that an HCN is a sectoral and geographical grouping of companies where there is the realization of joint cooperation and external economies, generating a gain in efficiency for the actors participating in the network, fostering competitive advantages, and therefore, entry into foreign markets, where these actors might not be able to enter on an individual basis. 
Chennamaneni and Desiraju (2011) make the point that these companies benefit through specialization and concentration in their sector, thereby generating and gaining competitive advantages through inter-company cooperation. Collective efficiency is able to generate the possibility of the inclusion of these companies in foreign markets, and other gains; this process can be summed up as coopetition. Coopetition is based on the concept that it is possible to simultaneously compete and cooperate by generating competitiveness; rival organizations complement each other, enabling mutual cooperation in order to enhance competitive forces. Regarding the issue of inter-company cooperation in an HCN, Tidd et al. (2005) and Verschoore and Balestrin (2008) have pointed out that organizations often cooperate for very specific reasons, such as to reduce investment costs for technological development, to reduce barriers in targeting new markets, to reduce risks in development, to scale-up production, to reduce the time for the processes of innovation and product development, and even to promote group learning. In the cooperative model of network activity, the relationship between the actors is one of partnership. According to Martinelli and Joyal (2003) and Lui et al. (2009), this means sharing a common interest with one or more actors, each one presenting a contribution based on their own particular characteristics. Regarding inter-company competition in an HCN, Porter (2004) points out that the result of the actions of individual companies is generated by the magnitude of the synergistic interplay between businesses, being a determining factor in the development of new processes, products, and technologies. Based on the fusion of the concepts of competition and cooperation, Dagnino and Padula (2002) argue that the process of coopetition is a new concept regarding the inter-dependence between organizations where there is a convergence of goals and interests; this intersection shapes the “coopetitive value of creation”. In terms of the identification of opportunities, the main benefits generated by this pattern of activity are the division of risks and the sharing of opportunities. Studies such as those by Verschoore (2010) and Maia and Maia (2011) list the performance benefits for industrial HCN’s as gains in scale and market power, learning and innovation, a reduction in costs and risks, among others. However, an HCN will only be able to achieve these benefits when it reaches a developmental level that is considered to be mature, where network governance is able to articulate, formulate, and align potentiating strategies regarding the competitiveness of the network. Tools are required to measure the maturity of such networks, in order for organizations to know each other better and to better exploit their potential. Based on these assumptions, research about business networks has been growing in recent years. Consequently, this study provides a systematic review of the literature related to company networks, more specifically the literature focused on HCNs, in an attempt to map the current state of publications. This study also identifies the CSFs and the main variables which comprise them, in order to analyze their coopetitive maturity in terms of cooperation and competitiveness, in other words, coopetition.",12

The motivation for the study from a policy perspective is that the effect of contextual factors potentially can set limits for how successful labour market policy measures can be with regard to increasing the probability of part-time unemployed to get full employment. If contextual factors do affect this possibility, policy-makers need to take into consideration the necessity of regionally adapted labour market policy measures. As from the beginning of the 2000s, part-time unemployment has certainly been reduced in Sweden, but it is still high and as regards fiscal cost about 25 % of the total payments of unemployment benefits represents payments to part-time unemployed. According to the Swedish labour force survey no \(<\)9 % of the female and 4 % of the male labour force is part-time unemployed. These figures motivate research on part-time unemployment, especially on what factors influence transitions out of it. The influences on the probability of transition from part-time unemployment to full employment can be separated into three separate categories: Within-context effects, such as the size of the contextual population, or individual characteristics. Context effects or spatial heterogeneity, arising from individuals being grouped into geographical or administrative contexts, e.g. municipality or other spatial classifications of where the individual lives and works. Neighbourhood effects or spatial spill-over effects such as contexts which are close to each other in geographical space may share common environmental, social, or demographic factors influencing the transition from part-time unemployment to full-time employment. Furthermore, contexts are formed by using geopolitical boundaries which may be unrelated to such transitions; we may hence use spatial smoothing of the distribution of probabilities of exit from part-time unemployment to remove any artifactual variation due to the method of data aggregation. In contrast to other recent studies on transition out of part-time unemployment, our main focus in this study is on the effect of spatial contextual factors, for example how much of the probability to leave part-time unemployment that depends on conditions regarding regional growth, the competition for jobs on the local labour market, etc.Footnote 1 However, instead of using a traditional econometric framework, we will make use of a multilevel approach that enables simultaneous identification of how individual-level and contextual-level variables are related to individual-level outcomes as regards transition from part-time unemployment to full-time employment. Furthermore, the multilevel analysis provides the framework for simultaneously investigating the unexplained contextual effect and contextual-level variables. In other words, here multilevel analysis explicitly takes the context structure into account. In classical regression methods, it is not possible to include contextual indicators along with contextual-level variables since the predictors would become collinear. One possible approach is to perform a two-step analysis with first fitting the model with context indicators, but without the context-level covariates, followed by a context-level regression of the estimated context indicators. But such an approach is only possible with a large sample size in each context. In our sample, however, the number of individuals per context ranges from 10 to 1,442. A two-step analysis is hence not possible since the sample contains only few individuals in some contexts. Multilevel analysis provides, however, a convenient tool to explore the variation of individual-level coefficients across contexts and to estimate coefficients for particular contexts, even for contexts with small sample sizes. The neighbourhood effects are incorporated in the multilevel framework with a multiple-membership approach where the probability of transition to full-time employment for the individuals depends not only on their own context but also on neighbouring contexts. This approach is used in our study to answer its main question: Do contextual factors influence the probability to exit part-time unemployment for a full-time job? The outline of the study is as follows: In Sect. 2, our study starts with a brief discussion on about the causes of transition to part-time employment and part-time unemployment. Section 2 also presents some institutional facts about part-time employment and part-time unemployment in Sweden. This is followed in Sect. 3 by a description of the data used in the study. The model assumptions are discussed in some detail in Sect. 4. The results of the study are presented and analysed in Sect. 5. Finally, conclusions and some final remarks are found in Sect. 6.",2

Industrial specialization (henceforth specialization for short) and regional diversity (diversity) have been among the most widely tested regional characteristics, giving rise to numerous indicators and metrics over time. While empirical evidence has supported the positive impacts of both specialized clusters and diversified cities (Duranton and Puga 2000), studies also frequently exhibit conflicting results, which have made the specialization/diversity debate largely inconclusive in the literature (Shaui 2013; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009; Rosenthal and Strange 2004). One reason for this is that most analyses have so far relied on aggregated data and indicators that do not take into account spatial heterogeneity and variability at the micro-level. Authors have argued that estimations can be significantly influenced by measurement and aggregation issues—indicators of specialization and diversity being sensitive to small variations in the distributions (Renski 2011; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009; Rosenthal and Strange 2004). As a consequence, studies tend to treat clusters as quasi-homogenous and with no internal variability and conceptualize space as discrete rather than continuous. As noted by Rosenthal and Strange, “relatively little of the empirical work on the scope of agglomeration economies has addressed the issues of establishment uniqueness and continuity” (Rosenthal and Strange 2004, p. 5). Defining the actual scale and scope of spatial effects below aggregated areas thus represents an open empirical challenge, with potentially important implications for local development policies (van Soest et al. 2006). Recently, an increasing number of studies have raised the possibility of exploiting spatial micro-data (see Tables 1, 2). While these emerging approaches introduce new explanations for regional dynamics, they also tend to redefine the way researchers use and apply their traditional indicators from a discrete to a continuous conceptualization of spatial relations. This transition has so far been little remarked in the literature. This paper contributes to the methodological literature on spatial indicators by proposing a new approach for dealing with observations at the subregional level (i.e., individuals or firms). We present a general methodology to build local indicators for micro-data sets that are continuous across space and apply it to three widely used indicators in regional sciences: the Herfindahl index (H), the Shannon entropy index (E), and the location quotient (LQ). Building indices based on a continuous space may offer significant contributions to the theoretical debate surrounding the impacts of local economic environments on individual establishments, clusters, or labor markets—topics that are central to establishing micro-economic foundations for regional economic development. It also provides a practical solution to measuring heterogeneity patterns of unique observations (firms, plants, or establishments) across space, while introducing spatial variability in the classical indices. In addition, it also allows testing of the possible effect of the geographical scale on estimated outcomes. Using micro-spatial data, distance (weights) matrices, and matrix calculations, the methodology is applied on 9,839 individual establishments in the Lower St-Lawrence (LSL) region (Quebec, Canada). We provide evidence of the importance of taking advantage of spatial micro-data before analyzing and discussing properties of the index over space using descriptive statistics of the local indices created regarding different scale, or threshold distance values.
 The paper is divided into four sections. In the first section, we present the main weaknesses associated with the use of indicators based on aggregated entities. We then formalize the mathematical construction of the indices, offering a short literature review on the use of specialization and diversity indices in the case where spatial micro-data are used for empirical analysis. The second section presents the general methodology for developing local indicators and exploring the possibility of varying the spatial scale using different distance thresholds. We then provide an empirical illustration of potential applications in regional science, based on the analysis of business establishment data in the LSL (Quebec, Canada). The LSL represents a classical peripheral region where problems related to spatial aggregation can potentially influence the conclusion drawn from analysis using census tracking data, given that this aggregation consists of large geographical delimitations. The fourth section offers a brief discussion about the implication of developing local indicators for further research in regional sciences and economic geography.",16

On the one hand, they enable strategic knowledge flows as partners exchange different pieces of knowledge (know-how, know-why, know-where, know-who, etc.) and co-create new pieces of knowledge. On the other hand, research collaborations might lead to unintentional flows of knowledge arising from just being in the same relational space. Empirical evidence shows that there is an increasing tendency to collaborate in research in the world (Hagedoorn 2002; Wuchty et al. 2007); hence, the volume of these facilitated knowledge flows is increasing. Furthermore, in Europe, the average distance at which these flows can take place is increasing and the share of cross-regional flows is increasing as well (Hoekman et al. 2010). Therefore, generally speaking, European regions are benefiting more and more from inter-regional knowledge flows to breed their economic activity; which might have important consequences in reducing the regional disparities in economic development and increasing cohesion (Baldwin and Forslid 2000; Baldwin et al. 2001). However, the fact that inter-regional collaboration is increasing does not necessarily mean that all regions are equally benefiting from these flows and that flows can occur at any distance. The literature suggests that the local characteristics and endowments of a region (Morrison et al. 2011) or the “milieu” (Quévit 1993) might affect the extent that organizations are engaged in collaboration with external partners. Also, inter-regional ties might depend on each other due to the fact that the contexts of collaboration actions (which might be economic, geographical, social, cultural, psychological following the definition of “social locales” by Pattison and Robins (2002)) might overlap. Hence, the network among regions might be created through more complex local structures than bilateral relationship. Finally, the proximity literature (Boschma 2005) suggests rationales to expect a higher tendency for similar and closer regions to get connected. So far, empirical studies that have focused on explaining the intensity of interaction among regions (Scherngell and Barber 2009; Hoekman et al. 2010; Scherngell and Lata 2013) make use of spatial interaction models. These studies mainly test for the effect of different proximity dimensions. They aggregate the individual behaviour to the regional level by assuming that interaction among two organizations located in two regions is independent of other interactions of the pair. Therein, they base on an understanding where the strength of interaction is positively related to the masses of regions and negatively related to the distance between these masses. The strength of interaction among region pairs is assumed to be independent of each other either from the beginning or once spatial correlations are filtered. In this study, we focus on the inter-regional R&D collaboration network among European regions in the field of biotechnology and attempt to extend this literature in several aspects. First, our aim is not to explain the determinants of the strength of interaction among regions but to explain for the overall network pattern. This means that it searches for the factors that make the observed network realized among finitely many possible connection patterns among regions of interest. For this purpose, we work on a binary representation of the network through an Exponential Random Graph Model (Frank and Strauss 1986; Wasserman and Pattison 1996). Second, we do not only consider the role of proximities in the creation of bilateral ties between regions but also investigate their role in the formation of multiple ties that come into being as a result of tie dependence. Therein, the conception of tie dependence that underlies our work differs from the former work. Tie dependence in our work is considered to be stemming from overlaps among the processes (not necessarily spatial) that lie beneath tie formation and hence goes beyond correlations imposed by the spatial structure. Finally, we study the spatial dimension of the network formation along two axes: the role of geographical proximity on edge formation and on formation of higher order local structures. The manuscript is organized in a classical way. In the next section, a review of the literature will be provided on the determinants of inter-regional collaborations. Since the theoretical foundations of network formation depart mainly from individual behaviour, this section will discuss how individual behaviour may shape inter-regional network. Then, the empirical analysis will be presented by explaining the data set, network representation, the model, the variables, estimation and results. Finally, concluding comments will be provided with ideas on future research directions.",23

R&D collaborations among organizations (Hagedoorn 2002), labor mobility (Almeida and Kogut 1999), and personal acquaintances of inventors (Breschi and Lissoni 2009) drive innovation activities, technological change, and economic performance of organizations and regions. Beyond these iconic channels of knowledge transfer, the structure of knowledge networks can more generally be defined as the set of direct and indirect connections that individuals and organizations use to access knowledge (within and outside the region). Given the economic value associated with the structure of knowledge networks and their striking spatial dimensionFootnote 1, empirical studies of networks have attracted a growing interest in the geography of innovation over the last twenty yearsFootnote 2 (Grabher 2006; Burger et al. 2009a; Maggioni and Uberti 2011; Ter Wal and Boschma 2009). The increased interest in the empirics of knowledge networks can be seen as a response to the traditional metaphorical treatment of networks in economic geography and regional science in general and the study of agglomeration economics in particular (Sunley 2008). Despite over twenty years of research on the benefits of agglomeration, the empirical literature remains inconclusive about the mechanisms and processes that lead to more than proportional regional economic growth. Despite the fact that the micro-foundations (such as knowledge spillovers, labor market pooling, and input sharing) that underlie agglomeration economies have theoretically been specified, agglomeration is often treated as a black box in empirical studies (Burger et al. 2009a; Van Oort and Lambooy 2013). This is exemplified by the fact that most empirical studies on agglomeration economics merely research the relationship between urban or cluster size and regional economic development (see Melo et al. 2009 and De Groot et al. 2009 for meta-analyses of this literature) and do not examine the different channels through which the concentration of economic activities affect regional economic development. The analysis of networks, either formal or informal, can help us to identify these channels and get a glimpse of what is in the black box of agglomeration economies (Burger et al. 2009a), hereby extending the current discourse on agglomeration externalities in which new conceptual and methodological approaches are needed (Van Oort and Lambooy 2013). Over the past years, a large literature has developed in economic geography, regional science, management, and sociology that predominantly address the determinants of knowledge and information transfer, focusing on spinoff firms, labor mobility and R&D collaboration (Boschma and Frenken 2006). One of the main findings of this literature is that firms in agglomerations do not profit automatically from colocation. Instead, knowledge spillovers mainly take place between firms that are networked and strongly locally embedded. A second finding that has come out of this strand of research is that a substantial part of information and knowledge transfer takes place over longer distances as firms have many network relations outside the city or cluster they are located in. From this, it evidently follows that cities and clusters are not spatially isolated entities, but embedded in a system of cities. In the end, an explicit focus on the transfer and network mechanisms of knowledge diffusion can not only help us to identify the channels through which firms benefit from agglomeration, but also help us to identify (1) which firms profit from knowledge spillovers and (2) the spatial extent of information and knowledge transfer. These are important ingredients of current innovation and network-based (“smart”) growth strategies in the European Union (Thissen et al. 2013). In the European Union, knowledge networks, free movement of knowledge workers, information flows, and knowledge-based cooperation opportunities in research and development are hypothesized to contribute to local innovation opportunities by academics and policymakers alike (Hoekman et al. 2009; Balland et al. 2013). Without a network perspective on knowledge, trade, and investments, a proper assessment of place-based growth strategies as advocated by the European Union (Barca et al. 2012) is impossible (Thissen et al. 2013). In this light, the increased attention for modeling the determinants of network formation is very much needed, especially in order to get a fully fledged understanding of information and knowledge transfer in and across regions. It enables us to explain why individuals, organizations, and regions differ in their embeddedness in information and knowledge networks, why they vary in their learning and innovation capabilities, and whether this results in variation in their performance. Analyzing the formation and evolution of network structures, however, is more complex than computing structural descriptive statistics like degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, or average geodesic distance. Explaining the structure of knowledge networks requires an inferential statistics framework, where the dependent variable is related to the overall structure of the network. Even when networks are decomposed to their smallest unit, the dyad, relational data does not fit well into traditional regression frameworks. A fundamental property of network structures lies in the existence of conditional dependencies between observations, especially between dyads that have actors in common (Linders et al. 2010). By nature, such network dependencies violate standard statistical inference procedures that assume independence among observations. But more than only correcting for such dependencies, the main challenge is to use the information included in these dependencies to model structural predictors of network formation. In this paper, we provide a discussion of the main empirical strategies that have been proposed recently in economic geography to explain the formation and structure of networks. Although these strategies are briefly mentioned in a few methodological papers (Ter Wal and Boschma 2009; Broekel and Hartog 2013a; Maggioni and Uberti 2011), a global discussion of their respective range of applicability, strengths, and weaknesses in the context of economic geography is still missing. We believe such a discussion to be useful for economic geographers and regional scientists aiming at modeling network formation, especially because the different models have emerged out of different scientific traditions. Moreover, they are often based on different assumptions, vary in terms of conceptual and empirical issues (like micro–macro relations, network dynamics, and network-geography interdependencies), and frequently require different types of relational data. This paper provides a discussion and an introduction to four main types of empirical strategies: gravity models (GM), quadratic assignment procedures (QAP), exponential random graph models (ERGMs), and stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs). Section 2 discusses GM, a class of econometric models generally used in economics to explain the flow between geographical units as a function of supply and demand factors and the distance between the units. These have recently been extended to deal with the specific characteristics of network data. To account for more complex network dependencies, QAP has been developed in mathematical sociology on the principle of bootstrapping procedures. The class of ERGM has been developed on the basis of a Markov chain to include not only dyadic effects but also structural effects at the network level. Lastly, SAOMs have been introduced again in mathematical sociology to provide a class of statistical models for network dynamics. This allows for treating of longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data, and therefore the analysis of changing network relationships.",87

Why are some regions entrepreneurial jump starters?",September 2014,Michael Wyrwich,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Entrepreneurship is a crucial element of regional development (e.g., Carree et al. 2002; Acs and Armington 2004), but it is not equally distributed across space. Some places are fertile breeding grounds for entrepreneurship; others are entrepreneurial laggards. Several scholars investigate regional differences in entrepreneurship (e.g., Reynolds et al. 1994; Armington and Acs 2002; Fritsch and Falck 2007), and they all discover that entrepreneurship is a “regional event” (Feldman 2001). Differences in the level of new business formation across space are due to several factors, chiefly industry structure, knowledge, agglomeration externalities, and entrepreneurial culture (for extensive literature reviews, see Bosma et al. 2008; Sternberg 2009; Stam 2010). Because the regional milieu changes slowly over time, so does start-up activity. This implies that regions with a high level of new firm formation in the past will also have a high level of start-up activity in the future and; indeed, this is found to be the case in studies of established market economies for time spans of 10–20 years (e.g., Fritsch and Mueller 2007; van Stel and Suddle 2008; Andersson and Koster 2011). One characteristic of these studies is that the framework conditions and thus the amount of entrepreneurial opportunities are stable throughout the period of analysis. Not much is known about the role played by regional conditions in start-up activity when the level of entrepreneurial opportunities changes significantly due to instability in the general framework conditions. Such instability can be caused by natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks; for example, after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City, there was an increase in local business founding rates (Paruchuri and Ingram 2012). World War II is an example of a large-scale event during which the structural regional milieu and, consequently, previous source of entrepreneurial opportunity were destroyed in several areas. Another illustration of instability in context is institutional upheaval as reflected by the transition from socialism to a market economy in Eastern Europe in the late twentieth century, during which there was a transition from an institutional regime hostile to entrepreneurship (Earle and Sakova 2000) to an economic system where entrepreneurship is a source of economic development and change (e.g., Audretsch and Thurik 2001; Baumol 2004). These examples show that instability in context is more the rule than the exception over the course of history, thus calling for a new zeitgeist in regional entrepreneurship research that goes beyond stable framework conditions and short time periods, an approach that accounts for Schumpeter’s plea to consider history in entrepreneurship studies (Schumpeter 1947, 1949). This requires historically informed appreciative theorizing (Feldman 2001) like that demonstrated in vivid analyses of the exceptional entrepreneurial breeding grounds of Silicon Valley in the USA (e.g., Saxenian 1994; Kenney and Patton 2005), the Cambridge cluster in the UK (e.g., Garnsey and Heffernan 2005), and the Gnosjö region in Sweden (e.g., Wigren 2003). The focus of the aforementioned case studies is on the role of the formal and informal institutional context for shaping entrepreneurial places over time. Such a historically informed institutional approach can also be applied in a multi-regional setting. A starting point is acknowledging the role of institutional arrangement in the allocation of entrepreneurial talent, which is vividly demonstrated in the seminal contribution by Baumol (1990) on entrepreneurship in different historical epochs. By “institutions” is meant the formal “rules of the game” as reflected by rules, laws, and constitutions; informal institutions are norms, conventions, and manner in which a society conducts itself. Informal institutions can persist despite changes in the formal framework (e.g., North 1990, 1994). The formal framework provides the entrepreneurial opportunities (e.g., Baumol 1990; Henrekson 2007); informal institutions, such as attitude toward entrepreneurship and alertness to opportunity, determine their exploitation (e.g., Beugelsdijk 2007). In one of the few historically informed multi-regional approaches, one focused on US regions, Glaeser et al. (2012) posit that it is the long-term persistence of informal institutions, such as local entrepreneurial attitude, that explains the finding that proximity to historical mines (and the accompanying business climate) affects entrepreneurship negatively. The persistence and resilience of regional differences of entrepreneurial culture in the face of severe changes in the formal institutional framework are demonstrated by Wyrwich (2012), who finds that remnants of the pre-socialist regional entrepreneurial culture in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) influence start-up activity positively after another disruptive shock event—transition to a market economy. The enduring effect of such an informal institution despite radical changes in the formal “rules of the game” is also indicated by Cieslik and van Stel’s (2012) analysis of entrepreneurship in Eastern Europe. The latter examples demonstrate that transition from socialism to a market economy provides an intriguing opportunity to study entrepreneurship against the background of disruptive institutional change. This paper shows that spatial differences in the allocation of talent for productive entrepreneurship in such transition environments are affected not only by the entrepreneurial awareness of the local population but also by the region’s endowment of actors with a relatively high ability to detect opportunities. In this respect, this research applies the historically informed theorizing on the role of institutions for the level and mode of entrepreneurial activities as advocated by scholars such as Baumol (1990) to the regional dimension. The paper also demonstrates how institutions shaped the role of regional conditions in making certain places entrepreneurial jump starters after the dissolution of the Soviet system. The intriguing natural experiment of German reunification is exploited for an empirical analysis. This event was accompanied by the wholesale transfer of West Germany’s extant institutional framework to the eastern part of the country, which was an exogenous institutional shock (Brezinski and Fritsch 1995). This natural experiment has been the focus of a great deal of work (e.g., Fritsch 2004), but it continues to hold much potential for further investigation and, indeed, this paper is the first to examine how and which regional conditions influenced start-up activity in the wake of German reunification. The paper focuses on the role played by regional human capital and entrepreneurial culture, both of which reflect ability and awareness of the local population to disengage from existing socialist economic structures by starting firms. Further, the role of urbanization in providing entrepreneurial opportunities is investigated. The empirical results show that the employment share of a highly qualified workforce just before transition has a positive influence on the emergence of entrepreneurship. This effect works through regional differences in the human capital of the local population and its members’ ability to detect entrepreneurial opportunities. The analysis also reveals that remnants of entrepreneurial culture have a positive effect on start-up activity just after transition. In addition, this paper demonstrates the dynamic self-reinforcing nature of this cultural effect, something previously analyzed only in a stable context (Andersson and Koster 2011). The findings suggest that entrepreneurial culture is a crucial, resilient, region-specific informal institution that survives significant historical discontinuities. Another finding of this study is that population density has a negative effect on start-up activity, which is in sharp contrast with many findings for the USA and Western Europe. An explanation for this result might have to do with urban adjustment processes and accompanying negative externalities in response to ill-devised socialist regional development strategies. Thus, population density is a case in point for role of institutional context in mediating the role of regional conditions for entrepreneurship. Altogether, the empirical results show that there are systematic effects of regional conditions on entrepreneurship even when there is a severe rupture with the past. This is discussed in more detail in the following section. The third section introduces the data, measurements, and methods employed in the empirical analysis. The results are highlighted in Sect. 4, and general lessons for research and policy are touched upon in Sect. 5.",14

Nowadays, the traditionally hyper-dense, mono-centric cities are probably the regions experiencing the most rapid change toward urban diffusion (Schneider and Woodcock 2008). Mediterranean cities are examples of compact urban regions characterized by fragmented real-estate market, consolidated urban culture and deregulated expansion (e.g., Coccossis et al. 2005; Delladetsima 2006; Sayas 2006). In these cities, several inter-related factors stimulated low-density urbanization determining socioeconomic rearrangements along the urban–rural gradient (Paul and Tonts 2005; Weber et al. 2005; Catalàn et al. 2008; Marull et al. 2009; Chorianopoulos et al. 2010). Distinguishing different patterns of urban expansion (e.g., compact and mostly dense growth vs. discontinuous, medium- and low-density settlement growth) is problematic and requires an articulated research approach (Frenkel and Ashkenazi 2008). Urban sprawl, a process observed worldwide along the last century, is particularly difficult to identify and map on a local scale compared with other settlement patterns (Kasanko et al. 2006). Due to the rapidly increasing magnitude of this phenomenon, methodologies aimed at assessing sprawl at vastly different spatial and temporal scales were proposed in the last years through the use of statistical indicators, spatial analysis, remote sensing and field surveys (Alphan 2003; Weber et al. 2003, 2005; Martinuzzi and Gould 2007; Cakir et al. 2008; Ioannidis et al. 2009; Salvati et al. 2013). Moreover, Leontidou et al. (2007), Frenkel and Ashkenazi (2008) and Salvati et al. (2012), among others, demonstrated that valuable information informing policies for urban containment can derive from the comparison of indicators including population density and settlement distribution and density in cities that differ in their degree of compactness. Only few studies, however, have analyzed comparatively a set of morphological indicators at a detailed spatial scale in socially stratified, economically complex and traditionally compact cities (see Gargiulo Morelli and Salvati 2010 for a review). An approach to perform a classification of urban settlements with the aim at identifying low-density dispersed settlements through the use of freely available indicators derived from official statistical sources is illustrated in the present study. The proposed approach is one of the first attempts to provide a multidimensional analysis of the morphological characteristics of comparable urban regions with results possibly different from those obtained from the analysis of single indicators. This rationale is in accordance with Jabareen (2006), Guérois and Pumain (2008) and Burger and Meijers (2012). These scholars claimed for a more ‘holistic’ analysis of the ‘sprawl’ concept, which was considered too ‘elusive’ and hard-to-operationalize using single indicators (Galster et al. 2001). In order to be comprehensible to practitioners and local stakeholders, our procedure is intentionally simple and develops a three-step multivariate analysis (Salvati and Zitti 2009) with the aim at defining homogeneous areas from the urban morphology perspective. The illustrated approach includes a principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on the original data matrix to extract latent patterns and simplify data complexity (Salvati et al. 2012). Subsequently, a k-means cluster analysis (CA) was applied on a restricted number of latent factors extracted by the PCA with the aim at producing a classification of the examined urban regions into homogeneous clusters. Finally, a stepwise linear Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) was performed to identify the indicators providing the highest contribution to each cluster. Based on the analysis’ results and ancillary information, spatial units have been profiled with the aim of identifying compact and dispersed settlements. The procedure was applied to three case studies in southern Europe (the metropolitan areas of Lisbon, Rome and Athens). These three capital regions are characterized by diverging urban form, population density, demographic trends, land availability to edification and landscape composition. Athens was traditionally described as an hyper-compact and dense city, Rome as a moderately polycentric, semi-dense city, and Lisbon as a fragmented, discontinuous medium-density city (Leontidou 1990; Barata Salgueiro 2001; Salvati 2013). The contribution of this study to the implementation of sprawl containment strategies in southern Europe was finally discussed.",10

Within the large literature on economic growth convergence, an aggregate stochastic production function (SPF) literature examining US regional growth has developed (e.g., Puig-Junoy 2001; Brock 2001; Yamarik 2006, 2013; Sharma et al. 2007) that can help understand state-level recoveries. In addition, several recent studies applied both nonparametric and parametric models to examine the world production frontier and how much a country might fall short of producing maximum output (Kumar and Russell 2002; Kneller and Stevens 2003; Kumbhakar and Wang 2005). They measure a macroeconomic technical inefficiency described in the literature (Moroney and Lovell 1997; Adkins et al. 2002; Henry et al. 2009) as a country’s inability to achieve maximum output due to inadequate financial markets, institutional failure and lack of economic freedom. However, these SPF models did not control for the heterogeneity that was often ignored in the more general literature as well (Greene 2005a). This paper adds to the literature by examining a decomposition of US state-level total factor productivity (TFP) change within a time-varying decay SPF framework controlling for heterogeneity. The matrix of technical inefficiency indices across time and states is then compared with state-level characteristics to examine potential influences on a state’s inefficiency over time. These quantitative measures of a state’s economy have become available only recently and have not been previously considered in the efficiency literature. Section two describes the data, and section three outlines the method. Section four discusses the results. Section five concludes.",11

Higher level roads are designed for high-speed and long-distance traffic, whereas lower level roads are designed for low-speed and short-distance traffic. Designing an efficient hierarchical network is significant for the smooth flow of traffic. The hierarchical network design has been addressed in discrete network models. Current et al. (1986) formulated the hierarchical network design problem for identifying the minimal cost two-level network connecting all demand nodes. The problem was extended by Current (1988) to include transshipment facilities and by Balakrishnan et al. (1994) to multi-level networks. A number of solution methods for the problem and its extension have been proposed (Current and Pirkul 1991; Pirkul et al. 1991; Sancho 1995; Chopra and Tsai 2002; Obreque and Marianov 2007; Obreque et al. 2010). Santos et al. (2009) presented a multi-objective approach to multi-level road network planning considering efficiency, equity, and robustness. Multiple levels of network links were also discussed by Bigotte et al. (2010), who developed an integrated model of urban hierarchy and transportation network planning. Another approach for the hierarchical network design is based on continuous models. Continuous models can yield analytical solutions, which allow us to examine fundamental relationships between variables. Analytical solutions are also useful to interpret and comprehend numerical results. The role of continuous models is therefore to supplement discrete network models. In continuous models, idealized networks such as grid and radial-arc networks have been used as an approximation for actual networks. Creighton et al. (1960) found the optimal spacings of a square grid network with three road types that minimize the sum of the travel and construction costs. Tanner (1968) evaluated networks of parallel motorways and rectangular grid motorways from the average travel time. Fawaz and Newell (1976a, b) obtained the optimal spacings of two-, three-, and four-level rectangular grid networks. Miura (1999) presented the sufficient length of high-speed grid roads required to manage traffic congestion. Pearce (1974) gave the optimal location of ring roads that minimizes the average travel distance. Mosler (1987) and Puu (1997) found the optimal number of radials that minimizes the sum of the transportation and construction costs. Fujita and Suzuki (2004) considered the optimal pattern of a network consisting of high-speed radial-arc roads and low-speed arc roads. Despite a large number of works concerning the hierarchical road network design, few studies have stated the problem in terms of road area. In fact, most of the previous studies assumed that the construction cost is proportional to the road length. The cost in practice is, however, proportional to the area rather than the length. By comparing length-based and area-based formulations, Miyagawa (2009) showed that the length-based formulation would result in the over-supply of major arterial roads. Miyagawa (2009) then derived the optimal road areas that minimize the average and maximum travel time. The analysis was extended by Miyagawa (2011) to incorporate inward, outward, and through traffic. In this paper, we find the optimal allocation of area taken up by roads at each level of the hierarchy. To obtain analytical expressions for the optimal allocation, we use a continuous model of a grid road network consisting of three levels of roads. Although Miyagawa (2011) also obtained the optimal allocation of road area, we extend the scope by determining the total road area. The assumption by Miyagawa (2011) that the total road area is the same for all cities is not necessarily valid. The total road area varies among cities because of the trade-off between the travel and construction costs. Cities with much traffic will require more roads to reduce the travel cost, whereas cities with little traffic will require fewer roads to reduce the construction cost. We investigate this trade-off by minimizing the sum of the travel and construction costs. The model that considers both the road area and the trade-off between the travel and construction costs is useful for further hierarchical network design models. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section develops a grid network model. Section 3 obtains an approximation for the total travel time. Section 4 finds the optimal allocation of road area that minimizes the sum of the travel and construction costs. Section 5 provides a numerical example together with the road areas of actual road networks. The final section presents concluding remarks.",4

Fullerton Jr.,Adam G. Walke,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Retail markets that span international boundaries are distinct from those that lie wholly within single countries in a variety of ways. In border regions, both consumers and retailers are uniquely positioned to exploit price differentials between countries. However, location near a border also entails economic risks such as a high degree of exposure to downturns in the neighboring country’s business cycle and reductions in the value of its currency. That is because changes in the incomes and purchasing power of shoppers on one side of the border often impact the sales of retail outlets on the other side (Clark 1994; Fullerton 2001). Another potential determinant of retail activity that may likewise be conditioned by the presence of an international boundary is violent crime. A high incidence of violent crime on one side of the border may affect the configuration of retail activity by redirecting the flow of cross-border shoppers toward areas that are perceived as safer. The US–Mexico border zone offers an opportunity to study these dynamics. A total of 61 million personal vehicle crossings and 40 million pedestrian crossings were recorded at ports of entry along the border in 2011 (BTS 2012). Not surprisingly, foreign visitors are important to regional economies on both sides of the boundary. Surveys conducted on different segments of the border suggest that between 42 and 85 % of Mexican visitors to the United States cross the border to shop (Ghaddar and Brown 2005). A study of the San Diego–Tijuana region indicates that US citizens account for approximately 29 % of border crossings and shopping is the purpose of many of these visits (San Diego Dialogue 1994). The effects of cross-border shopping on retail activity north of the border are well documented (Adkisson and Zimmerman 2004; Coronado and Phillips 2007). One goal of this analysis is to examine the relatively unexplored relationship between border crossings and retail activity in northern Mexico. Unfortunately, the northern border states of Mexico have witnessed an unprecedented wave of violent crime in recent years as rival factions fight to control the sale of contraband narcotics into the USA. These states experienced a ninefold increase in homicides related to organized crime between 2007 and 2010 (Presidencia de la República 2012). According to a 2010 survey, 68 % of businesses in northern Mexico have been touched by organized crime (Banco de México 2011). Greenbaum and Tita (2004) argue that, while variations in the average levels of violent crime from one area to another are unlikely to affect retail sales, a large-scale crime wave can exert a substantially negative impact on the retail sector. In cities like Ciudad Juárez that have been ravaged by crime wave in recent years, the combination of extortion by criminal rackets and reduced cross-border shopping by Americans has reportedly taken a heavy toll on retailers (Economist 2011). In evaluating the potential benefits of initiatives designed to combat criminal networks in northern Mexico, it is important to take into account the impacts of organized crime on metropolitan retail activity. This section is followed by a review of the literature regarding retail sales, cross-border shopping, and crime. The subsequent section discusses the sources of data for this study and the analytical framework employed. Empirical results are then presented, along with a conclusion.",13

Much of the literature in this tradition assumes a single exogenously determined central business district (CBD) and derives land use and rent gradient as a function of distance to this central attraction. The model described by this traditional literature has only limited relevance to many modern metropolitan and even rural areas. In many areas, we see polycentric configurations with an older core downtown area, and job or residential agglomerations at various surrounding points. Rent gradients are influenced by exogenous geographical structures (such as lakes and mountains) and endogenous choices (such as the location of roads, airports, and major commercial centers). Our goal is to use a simple analytical model to elucidate some of the fundamental forces that drive land uses and rent gradients around employment clusters both within and between cities. Although our formal model treats the two cities as distinct, and perhaps politically independent, all of our analytical insights apply equally well to regions near adjacent job clusters within a single city. Our model also relates to the discussions of edge cities. Fujita et al. (1997) consider a large firm choosing its location in a monocentric city to form a secondary employment center. They find that the equilibrium urban configuration depends on the competition in labor and land markets and the technological externalities. Henderson and Mitra (1996) discuss the decision of a developer when choosing the business district capacity and location of the edge city. Based on numerical analysis with different values of parameters, many types of urban configurations can be identified. Zhang and Sasaki (2005) also employ numerical analysis to analyze the “vacated business district” in the process of the formation of an edge city. They find that sometimes an existing business district becomes vacated when an edge city is formed, especially when the conversion cost (from business usage to residential usage) is high. However, all above three papers focus on the formation of the edge city from an existing monocentric city, while our model concerns the location choice of a monopoly vendor and the consequent changes of the urban configuration in two adjacent cities. Lai and Tsai (2008) conceptualize a very different model in which there is a single monopolist firm that endogenously influences the location of consumers and their land rents paid to the absentee landowners. They demonstrate that the monopoly firm will locate at one of the city boundaries to maximize profit.Footnote 1 We generalize their model by allowing for inter-city shopping, and the location choice of a monopoly vendor. Changes in urban configuration are also discussed.Footnote 2
 Before the entry of a modern giant vendor, we assume that there are two identical adjacent cities along a highway with a distance \(d\) between these two CBDs.Footnote 3 All residents commute to their local CBDs for their jobs, and each one consumes one unit of land and one unit of a composite good purchased from ubiquitous mom-and-pop stores with zero shopping distance. Since a global retailer (say Wal-mart or Target) may have strong cost advantage, many local mom-and-pop stores will be forced out of business after entrance of this giant retailer. We wish to study how vendors with market power may affect rent gradients and land use. Although it is rarely true that a retailer is literally a monopolist, by modeling vendors in this way, we can gain insight about basic forces driving rent gradients and land uses without the additional complexity of game-theoretic oligopolistic competition. We can think of this giant retailer as a monopoly vendor who can serve city 1, city 2, or both.Footnote 4 The vendor, perhaps for political reasons, cannot partially serve a city—if the vendor offers any service, it must serve all residents of the city.Footnote 5 Like residents in traditional Alsonso–Mills–Muth models, each resident in our model travels to the CBD of their city to work, and lives at, and pays rent on, land somewhere in the city. Residents also travel to and buy goods from the monopoly vendor on a regular basis. Since we assume that there is only one location for the vendor, residents living in another city must make inter-city shopping, which is common in reality but rarely noticed in the literature. Note that in equilibrium all residents have equal utility, because residents are free to choose their locations in these two cities. We expand the work of Lai and Tsai (2008) by investigating how a monopoly chooses location and price for an economy with two adjacent cities and an endogenously distributed population of consumers. In our model, the cities may be distinct (i.e., connected by a space without population) or connected. We will show that, depending upon various parameter values, a monopoly firm may maximize profit by choosing locations either at the midpoint of the cities, or at one of the city boundaries. Specifically first, when \(d\) is extremely large (i.e., the two CBDs are far apart), the vendor will locate at one city’s boundary and will not serve the other city. Second, when \(d\) is large enough, the vendor may locate at city 1’s right boundary and serve both cities. Third, when \(d\) is smaller, the vendor may locate at the mid-point between the cities, that is, \(z = d/2\), where \(z\) is the vendor location. Fourth, as \(d\) becomes even smaller, the vendor may choose to locate at one of the outer boundaries to minimize its land rent. An important implication of our model is that a big vendor or public facility may induce an endogenous economic behavior, say inter-city shopping or visiting, and reshape the land use patterns as well as rent gradients in a system of cities. Specifically, a (local) core-periphery urban structure—with a dominant and a smaller city—may emerge naturally from our model. Moreover, the vendor may exert monopoly power to set a high price for the composite good and consequently lower the land rent that he pays. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the model, and the concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 3.",

Yet, based on successful innovation, they are an important source of indigenous productivity and employment if they stay put. As they expand, local conditions, initially favourable to their formation, often are no longer optimal for their current production and marketing requirements (van Dijk and Pellenbarg 2000; Brouwer et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2008). They may therefore relocate between regions, transferring skills and jobs. Such mobility can occur because innovation takes place in an agglomerated centre where information and diverse resources are abundant, but factor costs are high. Once the product or process is standardised, the innovating firm has an incentive to move to lower-cost locations and export from there (Vernon 1966; Duranton and Puga 2001). Impacts of spatial mobility on the enterprise itself may be intended or unintended. In addition to access different factor scarcities, many firms that relocate experience substantial benefits or challenges to efficiency because of the adjustments they are required or enabled to make at their new sites—and perhaps because of the way they frame the management problem (Loasby 1988, 2000). A vital policy concern is that relocations may be a positive feedback of market processes, exacerbating regional disparities in economic activity; entrepreneurial firms remove their dynamism to areas that are already dynamic. This type of behaviour, aggravating regional differences, is a common prediction of new economic geography (NEG) models (Krugman 1991; Venables 2006). On the other hand, classical and neoclassical trade and growth theories predict that markets encourage spatial convergence (e.g. Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004 chap. 13). In both approaches, spatial economic patterns are changed by the movement of goods, of factors of production and of firms. Understanding the working and magnitude of each process is essential to appreciate the overall influence of the various forces. In practice, the impact of each movement may differ, in which case their net effect on geographical activity must be uncertain without investigating all of them. The present research is concerned only with a subset of one of these processes, the inter-regional mobility of SMEs. A motivation is that UK policy makers identified firm immobility as a potential barrier to the convergence of regional growth and productivity (HM Treasury 2001 34–37). 
Taylor and Wren (1997) concluded that UK regional policy had been too inadequately funded to be effective. Since this assessment, funding has not become more generous and EU structural funds apparently have not yielded high returns (Rodríguez-Pose and Fratesi 2004). A reasonable conclusion is that the number of firms moving between regions recently is unlikely to have been substantially influenced by national policy; mobility must have been driven primarily by market forces. In the present paper, we examine the relocation of SMEs using a very large UK data set with comprehensive coverage to assess whether the process reinforces core–periphery disparities, as in many NEG models, or ameliorates them in neoclassical style. Section 2 is a brief literature review of firm relocations from which hypotheses about the mobility of entrepreneurial SMEs are derived. Next (Sect. 3), the data set that allows tests of these hypothesis is described. Preliminary evidence is presented both that spatially mobile firms are more dynamic than the average of their originating region and that the dominant tendency is for such enterprises to move from the geographical core to the periphery. In Sect. 4, multivariate analysis shows the characteristics of, and explanations, for the probability of the individual SME’s relocation. Spatially mobile SMEs are more productive, usually larger and younger. They are more likely to be registered as companies, taken over and originally based in London and the South East (core locations). Consistent with successful entrepreneurship, expanding mobile enterprises are shown to increase productivity and employment strongly as a result of their move. In combination, these effects suggest that a neoclassical convergence process is a better description of inter-regional SME relocations than the increasing regional disparities predicted by NEG.",8

These centers were expected to spread growth to their surrounding areas through the trickle-down effect. On the contrary, the net transfer of resources has been in the opposite direction, known as the backwash effect (Lipton 1997). Development of hinterland areas slows because of local resource depletion, while urban areas face many problems related to excessive rural-urban migration (Anwar 2005; Rustiadi et al. 2009). As a result, regional disparities are increasing between Java and outside Java, between urban and rural areas, and between the east and west of Indonesia (Anwar 2005). These disparities disturb national development because they have increased levels of poverty, unemployment, and natural resource degradation. Additionally, excessive accumulation of people and economic activities in these few growth centers has created many social problems and intensified environmental damage as populations exceed regional carrying capacity. Actually, the problem has been understood by the government. The government has recognized these problems and created programs that were focused on developing backwards regions, including the development of Integrated Economic Development Region (KAPET), Production Center Region (KSP), Local Economic Development Region (KAPEL), Retarded Region (KATING), and Poverty Alleviation through Rural-Urban Linkages (PARUL). However, these programs did not work as intended because they were developed based on a growth pole theory approach (Anwar 2005). In other words, the government supported new growth centers without planning for connectivity to their hinterlands. It was assumed that market mechanisms will automatically distribute the economic activities after the development of growth centers. Instead, those new growth centers have been transformed into channels of the larger cities to exploit resources from a wider area (Pribadi 2005). A growth pole theory has been criticized and the spatial system approach has been proposed as an alternative (Higgins 1983). Within this approach, regional development should be planned entirely within the region; thus, interconnectivity between the growth center and its hinterland will be developed simultaneously as an integrated spatial system. The concept of urban-rural linkages (Douglass 1998; Pradhan 2003), which focuses on managing the flow of people, production, commodities, capital/income, and information between the growth center and its hinterland, is fundamental to such a spatial system. However, few studies clearly demonstrate whether and how this strategy can yield more balanced economic growth. Some researchers still focus on the role of growth poles in generating a spread-backwash effect (Mark et al. 2007; Ke and Feser 2010; Chen and Mark 2013), while those who propose a spatial system stop short of modeling the approach due to its complexity. As Higgins (1983) argued, the move from growth poles to system interactions in space requires fundamental changes in the analytical methods. This research intends to fill that gap in order to support the implementation of a spatial system approach to planning. Currently, Indonesia’s economic development is concentrated on the island of Java; thus, infrastructure development and population growth are also strongly concentrated here. Java has only 7 % of Indonesia’s total land area, but houses 60 % of the Indonesian population and produces 59 % of National GDP (Fengler 2009). Furthermore, physical development in Java has also exceeded its carrying capacity (Rustiadi et al. 2010). This situation persists despite government efforts to reduce regional disparity, particularly through the implementation of a decentralization policy in 2000. Excessive economic concentration in Java has left other areas (which have abundant natural resources) considerably less developed. Instead, many resources are absorbed just for supporting economic activities in Java as they are transformed by industries located on Java and/or transferred to ports in Java before they are exported to the international market. Within this imbalanced situation, shifting economic activities outside Java is necessary to stimulate optimal utilization of resources and release Java from increasing social-economic problems. However, this strategy should be put into the spatial system framework to avoid the previous failure where new growth centers have accelerated the backwash effect. This paper has an objective to define new growth centers that can stimulate the optimal utilization and interaction between regional resources for generating balanced and efficient development. We contend that it is not development of growth centers that will shape the future economic structure, but those growth centers should be planned within the frame of a new economic structure.",5

C. Teixeira,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The rising interest in the creative economy has encouraged several authors both in political and in academic spheres to focus on creative industries and cultural activities (DCMS 2001; Pratt 2006; Higgs et al. 2008; UNCTAD 2008) and to assess their effects on regional and national development (Capone 2008; Miguel-Molina et al. 2012). According to several empirical studies, creative industries and creative occupations have a tendency to co-locate geographically (Capone 2008; Lazzeretti et al. 2008, 2012) and are often associated with urban development and the growth of cities (Florida 2002a). The uneven spatial patterns and the co-location behaviour of creative firms and creative workers are explained by territorial factors. Highly cited studies (e.g. Florida 2002a, 2004) have shown that creative industries and workers tend to concentrate in metropolitan centres in order to take advantage of urbanization economies. The latter are provided by product differentiation, technological diversity, the geographical concentration of people, cultural diversity and the diffusion of knowledge and innovation (Jacobs 1969; Lorenzen and Frederiksen 2008; Lazzeretti et al. 2008). Despite the acknowledged role of creativity in the development of regions, the literature on the economics of location regarding creative activities is relatively scarce and recentFootnote 1 (Boix et al. 2013). Methodologies are gradually being developed, and the studies are often limited by the quality of data available in each country or region (Currid-Halkett and Stolarick 2011; Boix et al. 2013). In the empirical literature, there is a primary corpus of research related to industry-based studies on the geographical location of creative industries/creative clusters (e.g. Lazzeretti et al. 2008, 2012; De Propris et al. 2009; Miguel-Molina et al. 2012; Bertacchini and Borrione 2013; Boix et al. 2013; Lazzeretti 2013). A second strand is concerned with the geography of creative occupations and creative workers (e.g. Florida 2002a; Florida et al. 2008; Markusen et al. 2008; Boschma and Fritsch 2009; Hansen et al. 2009; Mellander 2009; Clifton and Cooke 2010; Fritsch and Stuetzer 2012). The use of either industry-based or occupational approaches leads to differing estimations of creative employment, the most common proxy to analyse the geographical patterns of the creative economy (Markusen et al. 2008; Bertacchini and Borrione 2013). Besides, studies based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) restrict the analysis to the total employment in creative industry sectors, considering all the workers (creative and non-creative) in the same production process of the final product (the creative good) and overlooking creative employment in all the non-creative activity sectors. Occupational-based methodologies, using the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes, provide an inter-sectorial depiction of the creative occupational structure across the economy, but disregard the value chain and the productive process of creative goods, where occupations considered as non-creative may be fundamental. Recently, a third research path associated with methodologies that combine industry and occupational data on the industrial analysis of creative/cultural/knowledge-based sectors (e.g. Barbour and Markusen 2007; Markusen et al. 2008; Higgs et al. 2008; Currid and Stolarick 2010a, b; DCMS 2010, 2011, 2014; Currid-Halkett and Stolarick 2011) has raised increasing interest as a way to overcome limitations of industry-based or occupational approaches and to provide an expanded analysis of local employment structures in the industrial spectrum across regions. As an extension to these recent methodological perspectives, this paper provides a detailed mapping of creative employment, at a highly disaggregated regional level, using a combined industry and occupational-based approach, which accounts for creative employment across all industry sectors—creative and non-creative. It also aims at analysing the potentially disparate geographical pattern of the several subgroups of creative employment. The paper seeks therefore to answer the following questions: Do core creative industries and creative occupations tend to agglomerate? What are the main characteristics of the locations where creative employment tends to cluster—large metropolitan hubs, small urban centres, or rural areas? Do the location patterns of core creative activities differ substantially among creative groups? Do more traditional creative sectors, such as Crafts, Design and Visual arts, tend to co-locate differently from those based on intellectual property, such as Advertising and Marketing, Software and Digital media? The analysis is carried out focusing on ten core creative groups: ‘Advertising and marketing’, ‘Architecture’, ‘Design and visual arts’, ‘Crafts’, ‘Film, video and photography’, ‘TV and radio’, ‘Music and the performing arts’, ‘Publishing’, ‘Software and digital media’, ‘Teaching, training and research’, in all the Portuguese territorial units (308 municipalities). The data used were extracted from the microeconomic Matched Employer-Employee Datasets, official databases from the Portuguese government, and each value was accurately obtained by programming each detailed SIC and SOC code, using STATA 12.0\(^{{\circledR }}\). This procedure avoided any potential overlapping of data. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of the empirical literature on the location of creative industries and occupations. Section 3 outlines the main aspects of the methodology followed. In Sect. 4, the analysis of spatial patterns of agglomeration and co-location of core creative employment in Portugal is described, and the main results are discussed. Section 5 puts forward the study’s main conclusions.",21

The seminal works by Knight (1921), Schumpeter (1934) and Kirzner (1973) developed the concept of entrepreneurs as ‘disequilibrators’ (Schumpeter) or ‘equilibrators’ (Kirzner). Following Evans and Leighton (1989), who examined the process of selection into self-employment using survey data, a rich literature has thus emerged identifying the individual entrepreneurial ability. Entrepreneurship is also a major issue for regional performance (see Audretsch and Keilbach 2005; Facchini 2007; Dejardin and Fritsch 2011 for example). Furthermore, the interest in regional aspects is motivated by decentralization policies. In France, subsidies to promote entrepreneurship and unemployment policies has been partially decentralized at the regional level since 1982. In this context, more recently, a considerable body of literature analyzed the determinants of firm start-ups on a regional basis. For example, Audretsch and Fritsch (1994) explain why firm start-ups vary across German regions. Nystrom (2007) show that the determinants of new firm formation differ between industries in Swedish regions. In France, aside from a few articles (Levratto et al. 2013; Binet et al. 2010; Bonnet 2010; Boutillier 2010), empirical studies on the determinants of business start-ups at the local level are scarce. Among these, using a shift-share analysis and data including all the French departments. Levratto et al. (2013) point out the importance of invisible factors to stimulate firm start-up activity. These invisible factors, which describe the regional entrepreneurial atmosphere, can include a vast number of local factors such as culture, entrepreneurial ability, cooperation links among local officials, adaptive behavioral rules. In this context, the goal of this article is to explain entrepreneurship in the French regions over the period 1995–2004 by analyzing regional heterogeneity in determinants of new firm formation on a sector basis. More precisely, in a first step, we estimate a simple dynamic panel data specification to explain entrepreneurship rates across the French regions and considering four different sectors. The results show that the start-up activities depend positively upon an autoregressive term, showing persistence in start-up rates as in Andersson and Koster (2011). We also observe that regional start-up determinants differ importantly across sectors which suggest implementing sector-based policies. However, one of the limitations of this first analysis is that it highlights average effects only. Therefore, these results must be interpreted with caution. The relationship between entrepreneurship and its explanatory variables is likely to be different from one region to another (see Parker 2005 who develops a model explaining regional differences in the start-up activity). Based on spatial descriptive statistics, we identify three groups of regions and two atypical ones, i.e., Ile-de-France and Corsica. A dynamic panel model explicitly integrating spatial heterogeneity is thus used in a second step. The results strengthen the existence of differences across sectors yet observed. Furthermore, Anselin’s (1990) hypothesis that the presence of spatial heterogeneity casts doubt upon the generality of theories in regional science is thus confirmed. Indeed, the results emphasize strong differences in firm start-up determinants across the French territory, which suggest reinforcing decentralization to boost the formation of new firms. Therefore, this article is an original contribution to the empirical regional science literature. It follows the work by Binet et al. (2010) and Bonnet (2010) who investigated the determinants of entrepreneurship in the French regions but without including spatial heterogeneity and without considering different sectors. For instance, using cross-sectional data for the French regions in 2005, Bonnet (2010) concludes that the decision to start a new firm is driven by the residential economy, i.e., income effects and tourism. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we outline the theoretical background on the main determinants of entrepreneurship at the regional level. Section 3 describes the data used in our paper and analyzes the Moran scatterplots built to identify clusters of regions. Section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the results of estimates of a dynamic panel model to explain the dynamics of business start-ups with and without integrating spatial heterogeneity in the specification. Section 5 concludes.",8

While external knowledge can be acquired on different spatial scales, there are strong theoretical arguments as to why geographical proximity is important for knowledge transfer. These arguments build on the acknowledgment of the partly tacit nature of knowledge (Malmberg and Maskell 1999, 2006; Polanyi 1958), the embeddedness of knowledge in a sociocultural and institutional context (Gertler 2003, 2004), the importance of social networks (Granovetter 1973, 2005) as well as local labor mobility (Agrawal et al. 2006; Breschi and Lissoni 2009). Empirical evidence confirms a strong spatial dimension of knowledge spillovers (Anselin et al. 1997; Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Jaffe et al. 1993). The importance of local knowledge spillovers and localized learning is therefore often used for explaining the positive effects of agglomerations and clusters (Malmberg and Maskell 1999, 2006). Innovative firms situated in the knowledge periphery, i.e., in areas with a limited knowledge infrastructure, are less likely to experience the benefits associated with local knowledge spillovers than firms located in agglomerations or clusters with a highly developed knowledge infrastructure. In principle, firms in such peripheral regions can compensate for a lack of local knowledge spillovers by collaborations with non-local actors. Such collaborations establish an organizational framework through which interactive learning also with distanciated partners is facilitated (Lagendijk and Lorentzen 2007; Tödtling et al. 2006; Trippl et al. 2009). This paper aims to investigate whether collaborations with non-local actors can compensate for a lack of local knowledge spillovers, more specifically, to what extent innovative firms in knowledge peripheries collaborate more on different geographical scales than firms in non-peripheral regions. This question is fundamental if we maintain the theoretical propositions that (1) innovation is essentially a collective process where firm-internal knowledge is combined with firm-external knowledge and that (2) local knowledge spillovers play an important role to access firm-external knowledge. So far, however, the literature predominantly suggests that collaborations complement rather than compensate for local knowledge spillovers (e.g., Bathelt et al. 2004; Camagni 1995; Cooke 2002). The complementary character mainly benefits firms in clusters and agglomerations where local knowledge spillovers exist and where firms arguably also have greater opportunities to collaborate. However, few studies investigate whether collaborations can also compensate for a lack in local knowledge spillovers. Notwithstanding some exceptions (Fitjar and Rodríguez-Pose 2011; Tödtling et al. 2012), there is a dearth of systematic empirical evidence on this question. This paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, which covers the theoretical background, we will discuss the importance of geographical proximity for knowledge spillovers. We will elaborate on the implications for firms in peripheral regions and argue that collaborations with non-local actors can be a compensation for lacking local knowledge spillovers. In Sect. 3, we describe the empirical strategy as well as the indicators used. This paper combines data about collaborations of 2,261 innovative firms in Sweden from the 2008 Community Innovation Survey with microdata for firms and individuals provided by Statistic Sweden. This microdata allow to measure opportunities for knowledge spillovers as well as firm-internal innovation relevant knowledge. The results are presented in Sects. 4 and 5 concludes the paper.",160

M. M. Shahiduzzaman Quoreshi,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The reduction in payroll taxes has been used as a subsidy to compensate the firms throughout Europe that are located in remote areas or have some other geographical disadvantages. Most of the studies evaluating the effects of the fiscal support focus on employment issues. In this paper, we argue that even though the subsidies are intended to raise employment, the effects of the subsidies may appear in other outcomes since the firms are free to use the subsidies as they like.Footnote 1 Payroll tax subsidies tied to individuals, which are usually of a labour market policy nature, can be directly related to employment. Previous studies have shown positive effects on employment in the sense that the unemployed found work. The subsidies that are aimed at firms, which are usually of a regional policy nature, can have several possible effects since the firms are free to dispose of the additional surplus that stems from the subsidy as they wish. Earlier studies give little support of payroll tax subsidies directed at firms resulting in effects on employment. However, these earlier studies also raise some questions: A first question concerns expected outcomes. From the theory and business logic, we claim that support given to a firm can be used; however, the firm finds most suitable. Therefore, evaluating impacts on employment and on the establishment of new firms is a rather narrow focus. For this reason, we include a significant number of other outcomes, which are turnover, employment, wages, investments, long-run debts and profits, to capture the effects of the subsidy from the perspective of firms. A second question is on the time horizon regarding impacts. For example, Bennmarker et al. (2009) evaluate the impacts of payroll tax cuts 3 years after the supports were launched. In our evaluation, the support is launched in 2001, and we follow firms until 2009 so that we can monitor the effects over an 8-year period. A third question concerns the statistical methods used when evaluating regional support. Since firms are nested within municipalities or industries, a traditional econometric approach using dummy variables to capture regional and industry heterogeneity can produce both biased impact estimates and biased standard errors. To minimize the possibility of error and bias, we apply a multilevel model which enables us not only to control of regional heterogeneity but also to measure the importance of these contextual factors.Footnote 2
 The paper is organized as follows. A short description of the support is given in Sect. 2. A theoretical framework is developed and discussed, and previous research is summarized in Sect. 3. A description of the evaluation design and econometric specification is given in Sect. 4. The sources of data and a summary of descriptive statistics are found in Sect. 5. Empirical results are presented in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the paper, and some concluding remarks are stated.",2

These forces simultaneously work on different spatial scales and are mainly responsible for shaping the internal structure of cities and districts. Knowing more about the nature of these opposing forces is an important issue for policy makers and city planners and central to urban economics. The monocentric model is the most prominent in describing the inner structures of cities. It is based on the works of Alonso (1964), Muth (1969), and Mills (1972) and shows cities as aligned around a single core hosting all economic activity (CBD). This outcome generally emerges from the trade-off between higher commuting times and decreasing land values as one moves further away from the CBD. Interestingly, while the model presents a strong simplification, it shows how changing patterns of inner-city transport sustainably influence urban spatial structures (Giuliano 2004; Muller 2004). Starting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, transport innovations and extensions of networks of rail-based public infrastructure—i.e., metro lines and urban railways—reduced transport costs considerably and allowed firms and households to move to more remote areas while not losing the privilege of accessibility to major centers of economic activity.Footnote 1 As a consequence, even areas at large distances to the traditional CBD became increasingly attractive, which is typically mirrored in changing population densities and increasing land values (see, e.g., Ahlfeldt and Wendland 2011; Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001; Gatzlaff and Smith 1993; Gibbons and Machin 2005; McMillen and McDonald 2004). These—remote—locations may be subject to interactions and generate strong agglomeration economies, leading to the emergence of subcenters and further growth. Against this background and given the worldwide observable processes of urbanization, it becomes evident that monocentric structures are not the only stable equilibrium. Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and later Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002) were the first to show, how patterns of economic activity can be polycentric and still be in equilibrium. In principle, increasing transport costs caused by constantly growing cities lead to unstable monocentric structures once population reaches a certain threshold (Fujita et al. 1999; Krugman 1996). Anas and Kim (1996) show how even polycentric structures can indeed increase urban utility in growing environments. Los Angeles makes a nice case for showing how urban location decisions are determined by a large number of subcenters, while the traditional CBD lost its economic relevance (Heikkila et al. 1989). While McDonald (1987) empirically shows how to identify subcenters in the metropolitan area of Chicago, Giuliano and Small (1999) provide early implications that their subsequent growth may critically depend on industry composition and relative location. The city of Berlin, Germany, is a regularly cited example of a polycentric city. The historical CBD and the area around the Kurfürstendamm count as nearly equal in their economic and recreational relevance (Senatsverwaltung für Wirtschaft, Arbeit und Frauen 2007). Interestingly, the rise of the secondary center is not owed to the long years of Germany’s separation, when the Berlin wall was dividing the eastern and the western part of the city. The roots of duo-centricity date back to at least the beginning of the twentieth century, when the Kurfürstendamm area began to attract local businesses, especially from the sectors of gastronomy, entertainment, and high-class retail. This initial development further thrived during the “Golden 20s” and made the area to one of the Berlin’s most prominent locations for shopping and entertainment. This was specifically mirrored in continuously increasing land values as well as an increasing building density of residential and business areas. By the early 1930s, the area already showed signs of a fully developed secondary center (Elkins and Hofmeister 1988). However, this area was originally not planned to become a major center of economic activity, and its development, given the simultaneous development of other subcenters across the city, remains an interesting outcome. A noticeable peculiarity of that area was the fast growing connection to the newly emerging network of public infrastructure. Hence, in this paper, I exploit one of the relatively few incidents that allow investigating how areas in immediate proximity to new major transport nodes may become subject to initial advantages whereupon agglomeration forces and cumulative causation lead to the emergence of strong activity clusters, or even alternative CBDs. I conduct a detailed micro-level case study focusing on the area around the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin, Germany, that is unique in the level of geographic disaggregation in a historical context. Results suggest that the emergence of Berlin’s duo-centric structure was essentially promoted by market access generated by rail-based public infrastructure, indicating that economic activity within focal areas may be fostered by means of a well-directed development of public transport infrastructure. While Sect. 2 provides the relevant historical background about Berlin, Sect. 3 introduces the data. This is followed by the strategy (4) and the presentation of the results (5).

To realize this goal, increasing population growth and utilizing agglomeration economies are key tasks for both urban and regional policymakers. Simultaneously, the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emphasizes providing cost-effective social overhead capital to achieve regional economic growth. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the connection between agglomeration economies, a driving force behind improvements in total factor productivity, and social overhead capital. The importance of agglomeration economies for regional economic growth has long been debated by regional scientists (Fujita and Thisse 2002). The term “agglomeration economies” refers to the positive externality acquired by firms through increased productivity generated from the spatial concentration of industry. Rosenthal and Strange (2004) summarized previous research on agglomeration economies by examining the relationship between industry agglomeration and city size. They concluded that labor productivity for a firm increases from 3 to 8 % when the size of a city doubles. Glaeser et al. (2001) indicated that agglomeration economies exist for consumption, although most studies focus on explaining agglomeration economies in production. In addition, many previous empirical studies demonstrated that agglomeration economies play an important role in improving the production efficiency of local firms and industry (Beeson and Husted 1989; Mitra 1999, 2000; Driffield and Munday 2001; Tveteras and Battese 2006; Otsuka et al. 2010; Otsuka and Goto 2013). Furthermore, Otsuka et al. (2014) indicated that agglomeration economies result in reduced costs and increased tax revenue for local governments, which positively influences their cost efficiency levels. This study proposes a new approach to identify agglomeration economies in production because of their demonstrated importance. Most studies of agglomeration economies assume several hypotheses and verify them using different types of production functions, such as the Cobb–Douglas, Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES), and translog production functions. Examples include Moomaw (1981, 1983), Nakamura (1985), Henderson (1986, 2003), Kanemoto et al. (1996), Ciccone and Hall (1996), Ciccone (2002), Graham and Kim (2008), and Graham (2009). Furthermore, many researchers assume Hicks-neutral technological progress when measuring agglomeration economies and attempt to ascertain agglomeration economies as an element of total factor productivity. However, these approaches have a disadvantage because they must assume a specific type or form of production function. When they attempt to identify agglomeration economies with a specific production function, the result may differ depending on the specific formulation of the function. In concrete terms, if one study determines the influence of agglomeration economies using a Cobb–Douglas function that influence may not be detected in another study using a CES or a translog function. The problem is that the agglomeration effect depends on the type of production function, which is arbitrarily selected by the researcher. Since previous findings are mixed, it is difficult for us to identify which type of function results in agglomeration, or which specific element increases the benefits of agglomeration. To overcome the problems involved in selecting a specific functional form, this study attempts to measure total factor productivity as the Solow residual. This approach enables us to ascertain the robustness of agglomeration economies as an element of total factor productivity and to investigate the relationship between industry clustering and social overhead capital using a direct connection between total factor productivity and agglomeration economies. Section 2 describes the new method used to measure total factor productivity with the Solow residual. The results of the investigation are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes the paper.",16

Hall,Albert N. Link,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"US technology-based initiatives at the state level are not a new phenomenon for stimulating regional economic development, in general, and job growth, in particular. Such initiatives can be traced at least to the post-World War II development of science and research parks. For example, Stanford Research Park in California was founded in 1951 and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina was founded in 1959. Regional economic development and job growth were explicit goals of these and other similar ventures.Footnote 1
 More recently, states have adopted more focused policies. As Eisinger (1988, p. 6) pointed out: The 50 states and many of their communities are in the process of fashioning, with varying degrees of vigor and coherence, separate little industrial policies, self-conscious attempts to foster selected industries judged to provide comparative local advantage or to be critical to the local economic future. And, as Wessner (2013 p. 11, p. 14) noted: Since the early 1990s, a number of states have increasingly viewed support for innovation clusters as a leading policy tool for fostering the international competitiveness of local industries ... Most—albeit not all—state and regional cluster initiatives seek to build on existing local industrial competencies [emphasis added] and natural resources to establish industries of the future rather than creating those industries entirely from scratch. Most recently, many state practices have focused on green technologies as they built on “local industrial competencies”. For example, in 2009 the National Governor’s Association convened a roundtable to discuss best practices in promoting green jobs and green industries.Footnote 2
 The purpose of this paper is to describe one such green program, the North Carolina Green Business Fund. From a narrow perspective, this paper could be viewed as simply an assessment of this particular regional growth policy; but from a more general perspective, we believe that it foretells the types of entrepreneurial initiatives to be seen across states and the imperative that each will face from a public accountability perspective; that is, regional scientists will be called upon to provide insight into the regional impacts associated with this use of state moneys to pursue technology-based growth. The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows. In Sect. 2, the North Carolina experience is overviewed from an institutional perspective. In Sect. 3, we describe the job growth attributable to the Green Business Fund, and we offer an empirical look at factors associated with job growth across organizations that received R&D support from the Fund. We do not find that the size of the R&D grant is statistically related to job growth, but the amount of additional investments the organization received to support its project is. Also, involvement of a university in the funded project decreases job losses if the project is prematurely discontinued; involvement also decreases employment gains in organizations for which the developed technology is commercialized. The paper concludes in Sect. 4 with remarks about the limitations of the study and, subject to those limitations, how our model and findings might still be useful as a guide to the assessment of similar programs in other states.",4

54.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,25 February 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0663-3,"On the parametric description of the French, German, Italian and Spanish city size distributions",March 2015,Miguel Puente-Ajovín,Arturo Ramos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The study of city size distribution has been, since the contribution of Zipf (1949), of great importance in the field of Urban Economics. The so-called Zipf distribution, or its more general form of Pareto distribution, has been extensively studied by many authors: Black and Henderson (2003), Ioannides and Overman (2003), Soo (2005), Anderson and Ge (2005), Duranton (2007) and Bosker et al. (2008). More specifically, in the recent times the important contributions of Eeckhout (2004), Giesen et al. (2010) and Ioannides and Skouras (2013) have appeared. The first of these references highlights the need for considering the whole sample of cities when studying their size distribution and proposes the lognormal distribution [see also Parr and Suzuki (1973)]. The second continues a line of research initiated by Reed (2001, 2002, 2003) and Reed and Jorgensen (2004) in which the so-called double Pareto lognormal (dPln) distribution in the study of city size is introduced. This distribution has Pareto tails mixed (by means of a convolution) with a lognormal body and offers a good fit to the data, see Giesen et al. (2010) and also González-Val et al. (2013c). In turn, Ioannides and Skouras (2013) propose two distributions which have lognormal body and, above a certain exact threshold, a Pareto upper tail mixed or not (by means of a convex linear combination) with the lognormal. These two recently proposed distributions still do not outperform the dPln for the US places in the year 2000, as Giesen and Suedekum (2014) indicate. In order to reconcile the tendencies of the dPln and the distributions of Ioannides and Skouras (2013), the recent work of Ramos et al. (2014) studies the US city size distribution with three types of data (incorporated places in 1900–2000, all places in 2000–2010 and CCA clusters in 1991–2000), comparing the previously mentioned distributions and some newly introduced ones. One of the main results of this last paper is that the parametric description of the size distribution of the US places can be safely taken as a new one, called “threshold double Pareto Singh–Maddala” (tdPSM), which is a distribution with Pareto behaviour in the lower and upper tails, and Singh–Maddala body. The transition between the tails and the body takes place at two exact thresholds, to be determined endogenously by the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedure. The tdPSM will be defined in Sect. 3.4, and it greatly outperforms the lognormal, the dPln and the distributions of Ioannides and Skouras (2013) in the case of the US places (incorporated and all). In addition, in the previous articles of González-Val et al. (2013a, c), city population data of France, Italy and Spain without size restriction has been used. In turn, Schluter and Trede (2013) use a data set of all German municipalities or Gemeinden and propose a composition of the normal distribution with a Box–Cox transformation of the population data, with apparently quite good results. This will lead to a distribution which we will call normal-Box–Cox (nBC), to be defined in Sect. 3.3. Against this background, this paper extends to a different geographical area the approach adopted in Ramos et al. (2014), and therefore, it can be understood as a natural complement of it. Thus, it is our aim in this article to compare the lognormal, the dPln, the nBC and the tdPSM distributions for some samples of city size data of France, Germany, Italy and Spain without size restriction. The main result, which we advance here, is that the tdPSM is the preferred distribution always and that it is a model clearly not rejected by the statistical tests we use in Sect. 4. Also, we obtain that the dPln is never rejected in the case of France 1990–2009 and is very accurate as well in the parametric description of the size of Italian comuni in the years 1901, 1951 and 2011. We obtain thus a strong result: the parametric distribution of the city size of these four European countries can be taken as the same as that of the US places, namely the tdPSM. In all cases, the Pareto nature of the two tails seems to be an essential feature to be taken into account. Thus, what we will learn from this paper is that its empirical analysis may eventually help improve our economic understanding of cities. In fact, it points out to the possible existence of a common theoretical framework for explaining the city size distribution of all of these countries, based on economic arguments. In particular, this work will make clear the following points: A familiar distribution with underlying theoretical model as it is the lognormal is clearly outperformed by a new one, namely, the tdPSM. The up to now best distribution describing city size, i.e. the dPln, is also outperformed by the same new distribution. That new distribution, the tdPSM, implements in an essential way the well-known fact that the upper tail of the distribution is Pareto (1896). Also, that the lower tail is Pareto as well (see Champernowne (1953) for the case of income and Reed (2001, 2002) for the case of city size). The tdPSM implements, however, a body of the distribution which is Singh–Maddala instead of lognormal (Parr and Suzuki 1973; Eeckhout 2004; Ioannides and Skouras 2013), leading to a better fit. In particular, these points mean that the current theories supporting the lognormal and the dPln could be somehow improved, in a theoretically significant way. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the databases used in this paper. Section 3 shows the definitions and main properties of the four distributions studied. Section 4 shows the detailed results, country by country. Finally, in Sect. 5 we offer some conclusions.",15
54.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,11 March 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0664-2,The pattern of EU FDI in the manufacturing industry: What role do third country effects and trade policies play?,March 2015,Paola Cardamone,Margherita Scoppola,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Growing attention has been given in recent international trade literature to the important role of trade costs as a determinant of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). Theoretical models of the multinational enterprise, such as the knowledge-capital model (Markusen 2002; Bergstrand and Egger 2007), suggest that trade costs may have different impacts depending upon the nature of FDI. In the two-country knowledge-capital model, trade costs positively affect horizontal FDI, while they exert a negative impact on vertical FDI. More recent literature has expanded the basic multinational firm model to the three-country case, by emphasising the role that third country markets and trade policies may exert on the integration strategies of the multinational firm; indeed, third country trade policies and characteristics may help to explain more complex types of FDI, such as the surge of export-platform FDI. With export-platform FDI, the subsidiary located in the host country serves third countries by exporting. The reduction of trade costs between the host and the third country, by means for example of a free trade area, may thus stimulate export-platform FDI (Ekholm et al. 2007). In the empirical literature, the importance of trade costs has been considered by including in the explanatory variables the usual gravity ones (Blonigen and Piger 2011): geographical and cultural distances are used as a proxy for the transportation costs and the additional costs faced by firms when operating in a foreign country. As for the home and host trade policies, dummies are generally used to capture the impact of regional agreements, while an index of the openness to trade has often been included to measure the degree of protection of the host country. A direct measure of protection, such as the bilateral applied tariff, has been also used to capture the impact of trade policies when different preferential schemes are used, as in the case of the EU (Cardamone and Scoppola 2012). While variables measuring bilateral trade policies are generally included in the models, third country trade policies have been not explicitly considered to date. A number of papers have recently estimated the so-called “third country effects” (e.g., Blonigen et al. 2007; Baltagi et al. 2007, 2008; Chou et al. 2011), that is, the impact that neighbouring third countries FDI and characteristics may exert on the FDI in a host country and found that these factors may contribute to explain more complex types of FDI. These papers, however, do not include an explicit variable for third countries trade policies. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of bilateral and third country trade policies and third country FDI on the pattern of the outward FDI of EU countries. The reason behind interest in third country FDI is that firm decisions on FDI are often interdependent across host countries. In addition, agglomeration externalities may also arise for FDI. The omission of third country effects in the estimation of the determinants of bilateral FDI may lead to biased estimates. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, the focus of this paper is the industrial pattern of FDI of European countries with countries outside the EU. While there is a considerable amount of work examining the impact of trade costs on the pattern of the US FDI, studies focusing on the EU are few and consider, by and large, intra-EU FDI (Baltagi et al. 2008). We focus on the extra-EU FDI by analysing the pattern of the EU outward FDI with various non-EU countries, including developed, developing and transition economies. As will be shown, by analysing the pattern of extra-EU FDI with 24 extra-EU countries, a considerable variability in the applied bilateral tariffs can be found, while this would not be the case with EU members only, candidate countries and/or other European countries that have signed free trade agreements with the EU. In addition, we do not use aggregated data, but rather focus on the manufacturing sector only, disaggregated into six manufacturing industries. This is because the type of FDI varies greatly from one industry to another, and hence, the impact of trade policies on FDI is likely to be industry specific. Second, we take into account the potential impact, on the one hand, of the presence of FDI in third countries and, on the other hand, of host countries participation in free trade agreements (FTA) with non-EU countries. In our model, as in the papers by Chou et al. (2011) and Blonigen et al. (2007), the existence of third country effects has been considered by testing whether there is spatial lag dependence in bilateral FDI. We include in our model a variable for the participation of host countries in FTA with third countries, which is aimed at capturing the impact that duty free access to a third country market may have on the EU FDI in the host country. Overall, taking into account both bilateral and third country trade policies provides a larger and more complex picture of the determinants of EU FDI. Our results show that trade policies play a key role in explaining the pattern of EU FDI in the manufacturing sector as a whole and in four out of six disaggregated industries; as expected, the impact of bilateral tariffs varies widely across industries. While the participation of the host country in FTA with countries different from the EU positively affects EU FDI in the manufacturing industry, we do not find evidence in favour of a spatial lag model. Hence, though our results suggest that host country FTA influence FDI, there is no evidence of third country FDI effects. The paper is organised as follows. The next section offers an overview of the main facts about EU outward FDI based on the data used in the estimations. The third section illustrates the empirical specification of the model, while the fourth deals with the data and the econometric issues. The fifth section discusses the results while the final one offers some concluding remarks.",4

Fischer,Manfred Paier,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In Europe, the primary instruments to foster collaborative research and development (R&D) activities across nation states and regions are the Framework Programmes on Research and Technological Development. They are specifically designed to pool resources and promote international pre-competitive R&D collaboration by intensifying interactions among researchers and regions. By means of these instruments, the European Union has co-funded thousands of transnational, collaborative R&D projects. Implementation of the Framework Programmes started in 1984, the seventh programme did run from 2007 to 2013. Since the launch in 1984, funding has been focused on multidisciplinary research at a transnational level. Over the years, different thematic aspects have been addressed and the main emphasis has shifted towards the establishment of an integrated European research area. The present study focuses on cross-region R&D collaboration networks in Europe, as captured by data on projects of the fifth Framework Programme (FP5). Within FP5, research projects were funded over a time period of 5 years (1998–2002), with a total budget of 13.7 billion Euro. FP5 focused on a limited number of research areas combining technological, industrial, economic, social and cultural aspects.Footnote 1 With its corresponding financial support, FP5 was open to all legal entities (individuals, industrial and commercial firms, universities, research organisations, etc) established in the member states of the European Union. Proposals could be submitted by a consortium consisting of at least two independent legal entities established in different member states or in a member state and an associated stateFootnote 2 (CORDIS 2008). Proposals were funded based on a series of criteria including scientific excellence, added value for the European Community, the potential contribution to furthering the economic and social objectives of the community, the innovative character, the prospects for disseminating/exploiting the results and effective transnational cooperation (see European Council 1998 for more details). We use data on joint R&D projects funded by the fifth European Framework Programme to proxy cross-region collaborative R&D activities between European regions. Cross-region collaborations between regions, say \(i\) and \(j\), are defined as sum of collaborations between actors located \(i\) and \(j\), respectively. The objectives of the study are threefold: first, to identify patterns of two types of cross-region R&D collaborations, namely those generating outcome in terms of scientific publications and those that do not; second, to measure effects of barriers that may hamper such collaborative R&D activities; and third, to explore whether there are significant differences between the two types of collaboration. In particular, we are interested to explore the impact of barriers measured in terms of the geographical distance between regions, institutional barriers proxied by the existence of country borders between regions, language barriers between regions proxied by the existence of distinct official languages spoken and technological barriers between regions. With its focus on cross-region collaboration, the study shifts attention from organisations to dyads of regions as units of observation. As in Ponds et al. (2007), Hoekman et al. (2009), Maggioni and Uberti (2009), Scherngell and Barber (2009) and Scherngell and Barber (2011), we adopt a spatial interaction modelling perspective to estimate the barrier effects. The study area is composed of 255 NUTS-2 regions that cover the pre-2007 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Cyprus), as well as Norway and Switzerland. Our study departs from the previous literature in at least three major respects. First, the distinction in the empirical investigation between the above-mentioned two types of cross-region R&D collaborations established within the fifth European Framework Programme is an original contribution of the current study. Second, we use dyads of regions as units of observation and analysis in order to analyse patterns of collaborative activities established within the Framework Programme, in contrast to most other studies that use organisations as observational units (see, for example, Almendral et al. 2007; Paier and Scherngell 2011; Barber et al. 2011; Reinold et al. 2014). This is an appropriate choice since the study shifts interest from organisations to cross-region collaborative research and development activities across Europe. 
Third, we adopt a spatial interaction modelling perspective to estimate the impact of barriers, but in contrast to previous research (see Maggioni et al. 2007; Ponds et al. 2007; Hoekman et al. 2009; Scherngell and Barber 2009, 2011)Footnote 3 we account for network autocorrelation (also termed network dependence) present in the cross-region collaboration data with an eigenvector spatial filtering technique suggested by Fischer and Griffith (2008). A virtue of employing a spatially filtered version of the negative binomial spatial interaction model specification is that standard pseudo-maximum likelihood techniques can be applied to produce consistent and unbiased parameter estimates and to draw correct conclusions. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the section that follows presents the negative binomial spatial interaction model for cross-region collaboration and sets forth the spatial filter methodology to account for network autocorrelation as it applies to the negative binomial spatial interaction model specification. Section 3 describes the empirical setting and presents and discusses the estimation results while Sect. 4 closes with a summary of the main results and points to some future research.",11

The main objective of these reforms is to put the national economy on a path of high growth in a monetary stability environment and expand areas of competition in order to ensure better competitiveness of the productive system by reinforcing the potential of firm’s performance. These reforms have resulted in the restoration of macroeconomic stability, and growth is enhanced through increasing contribution of total factor productivity. Although this opening gave results in terms of economic growth, it created a geographical polarization favoring coastal areas that contain most urban agglomeration (El Bekri 2000; Dlala 1999; Belhedi 1993). Coastal areas are the most favored axis by investors. They have attracted more than 75 % despite a redistribution effort since the 6th Plan of 1977–1981. More than 90 % of the total employment is still generated in the coastal part of the country, which concentrates 65 % of urban areas (Dlala 1997). It ensures 90 % of the industrial added value, 83 % of the motor industry and 66 % of modern industry. Despite the efforts made by the state in terms of conditions for investment attractiveness and incentives accorded to enterprises located in the interior regions, coastal areas remain the most attractive and most privileged territory for local and foreign enterprises. The coastal development of industrial activity in Tunisia is obviously a source of externalities supported by spatial agglomeration forces, which is not without consequences on productivity. The extent and manner in which the productive performance of Tunisian firms is affected by these agglomeration forces is one of the major contributions of this paper. Generally people tend to move in areas where productivity is higher in order to enjoy higher living standards.Footnote 1 Thus, productivity difference can be strengthened by the fact that workers and firms can move toward the most productive areas leading to increased incomes and employment in the regions that experience high productivity. Firms and workers are substantially more productive in large and dense urban environments where the vast majority of substantial innovations emerge (Puga 2010). The productivity advantages of cities and urban clusters with a high density of firms and workers have received much attention by the urban economists for a long time. Martin et al. (2011) stress the importance of analyzing the agglomeration economies to better understand the economic mechanisms at work at the local level besides its potentially important policy implications.Footnote 2 Traditionally, agglomeration economies represent the comparative advantages in terms of productivity that provides to a firm or group of firms one region over another, because of its size and structure. So from a policy perspective, it is judicious to consider how large are the gains from agglomeration and how much do firms internalize these gains when deciding where to locate? In this context, some studies attempted to explain and identify geographical and appeal factors that determine local development of a given region in Tunisia. Metral (2003) identified geographical and appeal factors of Tunis city for industrial companies. He concluded that consideration of entrepreneurs’ motivations is likely to explain the presence of concentration and dispersion mechanisms around the capital. Driss (2007) tried to evaluate the effect of some macroeconomic variables such as market size, labor availability and free trade agreements over the geographical location of foreign industrial firms in Tunisia. Examining five industrial sectors in 138 delegations across the Tunisian coast observed during the 1998–2004 period, Amara and Thabet (2012) studied the impact of industrial structure, wages and foreign direct investments on the production of manufacturing companies. They did not reject the role of agglomerations in regional growth in Tunisia. This paper aims to study the impact of agglomeration and dispersion mechanisms related to industrial structure and economic size on total factor productivity. The sample consists of Tunisian firms belonging to seven manufacturing sectors in 138 delegations across the Tunisian coast observed over the 1998–2004 period. We use as a measure of regional development “total factor productivity” (TFP) by sector instead of the employment by sector. This choice is justified by the fact that productivity of a firm may increase without a parallel increase in employment, which is true in the case of a strong substitution between capital and labor (Baudewyns 2005). TFP is calculated through an econometric estimation of a production function following Olley and Pakes (1996)’ approach, which corrects simultaneity bias due to an instantaneous correlation between unobservable productivity shocks and production factors.Footnote 3 In this study, we use the administrative unit of “delegation.” Using governorate-based data may hide strong heterogeneity (labor and other variables used in the model) between the different delegations of the same administrative unit (the governorate). To our knowledge, these issues have never been addressed in Tunisia under a microeconomic panel data analysis with very detailed data. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 summarizes the different theories and some empirical studies on determinant of spatial agglomeration and local growth. In Sect. 2, we present the empirical model, the variables used in the model and the total factor productivity estimation. The data set and the results are provided and interpreted in Sect. 3, while Sect.  4 concludes with some final observations and policy implications. Empirical studies of the relationship between specialized versus diversified spatial agglomeration and their growth dates back to the 1990s with the pioneering work of Glaeser et al. (1992) and Henderson et al. (1995). These studies focused on the relationship between the growth of the operating sectors of a local economy, measured by employment growth, and the externalities associated with agglomeration economies. Glaeser et al. (1992) distinguish three types of agglomeration externalities: MAR (Marshall–Arrow–Romer), Porter and Jacobs externalities. Marshall (1980) argued that industries tend to specialize geographically because the proximity facilitates transmission of intra-industry knowledge, reduces transport costs of inputs and outputs and allows firms to benefit from a more efficient labor market. On the other hand, Marshall (1980), Arrow (1962) and Romer (1990) claimed that agglomeration externalities operate within an industry and arise from local concentration of that industry. These scale externalities are called localization economies, or in a dynamic context, Marshall–Arrow–Romer (MAR) externalities. They focused on knowledge spillovers between firms in the same sector. In fact, the firms agglomeration of the same industry produce positive externalities and facilitate the growth of all manufacturing units within the sector. Accordingly, local industrial specialization would be an effective way to increase positive externalities between firms. Thus, the growth process would be enhanced. Moreover, specialization promotes technological spillovers and facilitates the access to specialized and sector-specific practices. Marshall mentioned also that labor market pooling in the same region promotes economies of scale through the sharing of labor equipment and infrastructure. In Marshallian tradition, MAR externalities can be attributed to three sources (Neffke et al. 2011): labor market pooling, input–output linkages and intra-industry knowledge spillovers. In contrast, if the variety of both local industrial environment and competition contributes to a faster adoption of knowledge, externalities are called externalities of urbanization or, in a dynamic context, Jacobs’ (1969) externalities (Batisse 2002a, b; Henderson 2003). Contrary to Marshall who supports the urban specialization, Jacobs stresses the importance of urban diversity. According to these authors, local diversification within an urban region fosters innovation and result in cross-fertilization of ideas which in turn favors economic growth. Consequently, variety and diversity of industries within the same geographical area promote innovation and growth. 
Porter (1990) argued that technological externalities essentially develop within the same industry and that specialization is good for growth, jointly for the industry itself and the agglomeration wherein it is located. Porter also assumed that local competition between firms positively affects growth. It feeds innovation and encourages firms to invent new ideas. In this view, for any given set of industrial clusters, competitive pressure enhances productivity. Indeed, local competition facilitates innovation and supports the creation of new ideas. It can increase the productivity of firms and stimulate the formation of new businesses within the area. Among the recent empirical studies of the effect of agglomeration economies on local growth in developed countries,Footnote 4 we mention those of Combes (2000) and Martin et al. (2011) for France, Suedekum and Blien (2007) for Germany, Baudewyns (2005) for Belgium, Batisse (2002a, (2002b) for 29 Chinese provinces (Martin et al. 2011). The majority of those studies evidenced positive externalities arising from urban or industrial scales. It is difficult to compare results pointed out by several studies because the applied econometric approaches were based on a variety of estimation strategies using different dependent variables (Graham and Kim 2008). Using American data, Glaeser et al. (1992) found that sectoral employment growth at local level is negatively affected by specialization. On the contrary, industrial diversity seems to favor sectoral employment growth. In contrast, Henderson et al. (1995) showed that mature industries tend to be subject to localization economies, but not to urbanization externalities, whereas high-tech industries are subject to both economies. For 341 employment areas observed over the period of 1984–1998, Combes (2000) also found out a negative effect of specialization and diversity on employment growth in the industry and service in France. Batisse (2002a, (2002b) provided empirical evidence about the relation between the local economic structure (local sectoral specialization, diversity and competition) and the 1988–1994 value-added growth of Chinese provinces. The econometric analysis shows that while diversity and competition have a positive influence on local growth, specialization has reversely a negative impact. Suedekum and Blien (2007) estimated that on dynamic panel data the regression of employment growth using 15 manufacturing industries from 26 German districts observed over the period of 1980–2001. The results evidenced that employment growth is solely promoted by diversity. Therefore, a lot of studies based on employment growth do not confirm the existence of Marshallian externalities and even tend to show a negative impact of specialization on employment growth, whereas evidence about urbanization economies is rather mixed. As productivity contributes importantly to economic growth, research in this field is then shifted to examining the effect of agglomeration economies on firm productivity, using firm-level data. The seminal work by Henderson (2003) and Cingano and Schivardi (2004) is those of the first empirical studies of the effects of agglomeration economies on firm-level productivity growth. Using firm-level-based TFP indicators, Cingano and Schivardi (2004) estimate the effects of alternative sources of dynamic externalities at the local level. The author find that industrial specialization and scale indicators affect TFP growth positively, while neither product variety nor the degree of local competition has any effect. For developing countries, there are very few studies dealing with agglomeration economies and their impact on growth using microeconomic panel data. In spite of this scarcity, we notice a mixture of studies and research designs. Bun and Makhloufi (2007), for instance, use a panel of 95 geographical areas of six Moroccan regions (Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, Fes, Meknes and Marrakech) observed from 1985 to 1995 in order to study the effect of agglomeration economies on local economic growth. Examining 18 manufacturing sectors, the obtained results indicate that local employment growth positively depends on MAR and Jacobs externalities. Catin et al. (2007) confirm the results found by Bun and Makhloufi (2007), using data on Moroccan provinces over the period of 1985–1999. 
Cota (2002) attempted to investigate the effect of agglomeration economies on the manufacturing sector of the northern border cities of Mexico. An econometric model was established to relate agglomeration with manufacturing growth. The results show that the externalities caused by industrial specialization among industries make up one of the explicative factors of manufacturing employment growth during 1988–1993. Matlaba et al. (2012) employed the Glaeser et al. (1992) approach to identify the role played by knowledge externalities in manufacturing employment growth and convergence across 26 states of Brazil. They found diverse results depending on the model specification. The results provide new insights into the rapid growth since 1981, particularly the north and center west of Brazil. Widodo et al. (2014) examined the effect of agglomeration economies on productivity growth in Indonesian manufacturing industries. They found evidence of a positive specialization effect and a negative diversity effect for aggregate manufacturing and sub-sectors. Furthermore, the competition index has mixed effects across industries; Porter’s competition externalities stimulate firm productivity growth solely under some conditions. One thing still seems to emerge from the empirical literature on developing countries. It seems that Jacob’s externalities and Porter’s are confirmed more in the case of economies located at a certain stage of development, while MAR externalities are confirmed in the case of less developed economies (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). In addition, the empirical investigation involving firm-level productivity have not been quite abundant in developing countries and more specifically in Tunisia.Footnote 5 While these empirical studies have provided interesting results, it largely focuses on firm’s characteristics regardless of their location and ignoring the effects that spatial agglomeration plays on productivity at firm and industry level. This issue has received little attention and has remained relatively unexamined and poorly understood despite its important implication on productivity growth in Tunisia. In this paper, we try to overcome this shortcoming by considering the issue of knowledge spillovers through local externalities to analyze the determinants of firm-level productivity.",15

Haynes,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Impact assessment of public transportation infrastructure is an important public policy issue. A valid understanding of the economic impact of public transportation infrastructure helps clarify the benefits of previous investment strategies. It also provides implication and guidance for allocation of public investment for future infrastructure maintenance and improvement. However, to achieve an impact assessment of public transportation infrastructure at an exact level is almost impossible due to the complexity of economic relationship in the real world. To obtain a relatively close assessment is challenging as assumptions have to be made for an implementable analysis. Moreover, assessment results are likely to be sensitive to methodology, data source, time period, scale and geographic location of investigation. While it is true that many attributes can be subjectively determined according to assessment purposes and requirements, it is unclear the extent to which the results are sensitive to the selection of these attributes. Consequently, interpretation and implication from ad hoc evaluation studies can be problematic or even generate misleading conclusions. Another challenge of impact assessment of public transportation infrastructure relates to the nature of the spatial interactions of infrastructure facilities across different regions. Transportation infrastructure functions as a network through connecting different regions together. The investment in transportation sectors increases transportation services by reducing the cost associated with each trip, in both freight and passenger transport. The increase in productivity in one region can be caused by the reduction in transport cost in its own region or by the increase in accessibility to other regions due to the regional transportation infrastructure investment. Without considering the spatial dependence of transportation investment, the broad regional impacts including both the local and spillover effects on economic output may be ignored and lead to biased policy conclusions. The issue of spatial dependence also exists in the processes of regional labor and capital accumulation. At a multiregional scale, capital and labor are highly mobilized due to the different rental and wage levels at different locations. An increase in the capital–labor ratio not only may be affected by the wage–rental ratio from its own region, but may also be affected by the ratio from its adjacent regions. For instance, an increase in the capital–labor ratio in New York metropolitan area not only may be caused by the decrease in wage–rental ratio in the same metro area, but may also be influenced by the change in wage–rental ratios in adjacent metro areas such as Baltimore, Philadelphia and/or Boston. This is because the increase in wage in these regions changes the tendency for labor to move in or out of the New York metro area. Without considering these spatial interactions of factor substitution, the impact evaluation can be biased. A third challenge of impact assessment of public transportation infrastructure is due to the complexity of the modeling framework. Traditional studies usually investigate economic rate of return of infrastructure investment only in a partial equilibrium framework. Impact is evaluated from the supply side by assuming the demand for infrastructure facilities and price of transport service remain constant during the given period of investigation. As a result, economic impact of infrastructure investment due to the variation in demand cannot be assessed adequately under a partial equilibrium framework. In order to capture effects from both the supply and the demand, a general equilibrium modeling framework is essential. This study is conducted to make two contributions to the existing literature: First, the study provides for the first time, an empirical investigation to understand the regional impact of public transportation infrastructure by mode and by different geographic scales including the national, the state and the metropolitan levels. The result helps to understand the sensitivity of the results with respect to the scale of analysis. This affects the validity of assessment and suggests caution. Second, the study develops a spatial econometric computable general equilibrium model for impact assessment. The model integrates both spatial econometric techniques and computable general equilibrium modeling to provide a general equilibrium assessment with a consideration of spatial dependence among the elasticities of factor substitution. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature of impact assessment for infrastructure. Section 3 presents the multilevel data structure used in the analysis. The methodology is then discussed in Sect. 4, followed by a discussion of the estimation procedure and research findings. The last section summarizes and presents conclusions.",26

Parr,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For many years, the terms “urban” and “rural” were commonly used in various branches of the social sciences. This continues to be the case, particularly in fields such as demography and the analysis of economic growth and development. Over recent decades, however, the non-dichotomous categories of “city” and “region” (and their associated adjectives “urban” and “regional”) have come into prominence and are often employed together. This combined usage of these terms appears in official publications as well as in the language of the media and is also to be seen in academic and professional contexts. Within universities, for example, it occurs in the names of subject divisions such as the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at Newcastle University, and it is found in the titles of various serials, e.g., Regional Science and Urban Economics, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, and European Urban and Regional Studies. The reasons for this combined usage of terms are not entirely obvious. One plausible explanation is that in both urban analysis and regional analysis, which have emerged as important specializations in several disciplines, use is made of closely related theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and analytical techniques. In any event, this joint usage of terms raises a number of questions. For example, is it simply acknowledging the fact that the city and the region represent two valid scales in the analysis of spatial phenomena? Does it imply that the city must necessarily be viewed in terms of the region to which it belongs? Might it be referring to important interrelationships between the city and its region? The question to be considered in the following discussion, however, concerns the extent to which the city and the region represent distinct entities. This question will be approached by comparing the spatial organization of the city with that of the region, primarily from an economic (rather than social or cultural) viewpoint. It is somewhat surprising that such a basic question not been directly addressed before, particularly since it has a relevance in a number of contexts. These include the selection of units in the collection of statistical data, the formulation of hypotheses in the analysis of these data, and the design and implementation of particular areas of public policy, to name but a few. To appreciate the city and the economic region in terms of spatial organization, it is important to recognize that both have been influenced over many decades by decision making on the part of firms, public agencies, and households in such areas as production, investment, housing, and consumption. The processes involved, which were mediated though various market systems and public allocation mechanisms, were highly interrelated and ultimately affected the long-run evolution of both the city and the region. Rather than attempting to unravel such complex, interacting processes, attention will be focused on their outcomes and in particular, on the forms of urban and regional spatial structure, to which these processes have given rise. For related reasons, no consideration will be given to the spectacular growth of some cities and the decline of others, nor to the differential economic performance of regions, nor to the various economic, social, and governance issues that have arisen in both contexts, important as all of these aspects undoubtedly are. In coming to grips with the spatial organization of cities and regions, three perspectives are adopted, each within the overall context of a nation. The first compares the city and the region independently of each other, and the second is concerned with the individual city within its region. The third perspective examines cities and regions as elements of wider systems, so that the system of cities is seen in relation to the system of regions. Consideration is subsequently given to various alternative perceptions of the city and to the validity of these.",10

On the one hand, migrants usually have weak social links with the native population in the host region, which crucially influences their personal and professional life after the migration process. On the other hand, they often have preexisting links with other migrants in their destination area and this conditions their migration decision. Furthermore, they tend to develop strong ties with other migrants in their own ethnic community within the host region after the migration process. Besides, immigrants face particular obstacles when trying to create a new business due to their insufficient language skills, the difficulty that they experience accessing to the formal financial sector or, sometimes, due to their irregular legal or administrative status. Immigrants use their social capital resources—often concentrated in their immigrant community—in order to overcome some of those limitations. For these reasons, they represent an especially interesting target group when studying the effect of social capital on self-employment. Social capital is very heterogeneous and can exist in different forms. This paper, following Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), differentiates between the structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of social capital. Our results show that these forms of social capital might exert different types of influences on immigrants’ self-employment, even some that are opposed. The focus of this paper is Chinese immigrants’ self-employment in Andalusia, a large region in southern Spain. Chinese immigration in Andalusia, as in the whole country, has been attracting considerably attention in recent times for two reasons. On the one hand, this is due to its fast growth. In the period 1995–2011, the number of Chinese immigrants in the region increased by about 15 times (Saiz 2004 and OPAM 2012). On the second hand, Chinese migrants have stood out due to their intense orientation toward self-employment. Thus, 43.4 % of Chinese people registered in the Social Security System in Spain in 2012 had a self-employed status. This was the highest ratio among all the immigrant groups according to their origin (OPAM 2012). Chinese migrants benefit from a type of social capital, called ‘guanxi,’ which is specific to Chinese culture and has very strong historical roots in the Chinese society. ‘Guanxi’ represents a sociocultural institution consisting in personal ties—delimited by implicit moral contracts—which establish the bases for long-term relationships of mutual commitment and loyalty. The recent literature has stressed the significance of ‘guanxi’ in Chinese society, as a discipline in life with profound influences on commercial activities, business ethics and organizational behaviors (Lin 2011; Troilo and Zhang 2012; Chen et al. 2013). This ancient system based on personal relationships implies a different approach to business management than the traditional Western paradigm based on discrete transactions and formal agreements (Lovett et al. 1999). These particularities could be a significant factor in explaining the high self-employment rate of Chinese immigrants. In this paper, we defend the thesis that social capital, particularly ‘guanxi’, plays a crucial role in the Chinese migrants’ start-up decision and their option for self-employment. Our results confirm this hypothesis and further contribute to the literature by exploring the mechanisms through which cultural identity conditions the formation of social capital and its impact on immigrant self-employment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the influence of ‘guanxi’ on Chinese immigrants’ self-employment. The paper is organized as follows. The second section reviews the literature on migrant entrepreneurship and social capital, and introduces the concept of ‘guanxi’. Furthermore, this section presents the theoretical framework and proposes the research hypotheses to be tested. The empirical part of the paper is based on a survey of 288 Chinese immigrants in Andalusia (Spain). The third section presents our data and some descriptive results. In the fourth section, the research methodology is described and the research hypotheses are tested using logistic regression models. The paper ends by presenting some final conclusions.",5

Audretsch,Maksim Belitski,Sameeksha Desai,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"European urban policy has focused on encouraging entrepreneurship (Szerb et al. 2013), e.g., setting up incubators (Fritsch and Wyrwich 2014a), creating supportive climate and providing financial incentives (Bosma and Sternberg 2014), and reforming regulations (State of European cities Report in Transition 2013). A large regional economics literature addresses both the determinants and outcomes of entrepreneurship (Audretsch 2003; De Groot et al. 2009; Acs et al. 2009; Glaeser et al. 2010, 2014; Andersson et al. 2011; Stam 2014). Most studies focus on countries (e.g., Audretsch and Fritsch 2002; Stam 2014; Crescenzi et al. 2007; Glaeser et al. 2010, 2014; Acs et al. 2014). However, recent research on entrepreneurship and economic performance in cities (Glaeser et al. 2014) highlights the need for more work at the city level. Cities are appropriate to study entrepreneurship and economic performance because new firms are started locally and therefore immersed in local context. This can include formal rules, culture and informal norms, infrastructure, demand trends, human capital, networks, talent, and knowledge (Szerb et al. 2013). A set of relatively fewer studies on the effects of entrepreneurship in cities tends to focus on North American or emerging economy cities, which thus also inform policy making (Glaeser et al. 1992, 2010, 2014; Florida 2002; Florida et al. 2008; Andersson et al. 2011). The contemporary European urban context (Capello et al. 2008; Dijkstra et al. 2013) has been studied less yet is unique (see Acs et al. 2014) because of spatial proximity and geographic connectedness. In this paper, we focus on the economic effects of entrepreneurship in small-/medium-size versus large European cities. Using a unique city-level dataset comprising 127 European cities (European Urban Audit), we test empirically for direct and indirect effects of new firms over the period 1994–2009. We quantify the direct and indirect effects of new firms by market size (number of residents), based on Eurostat and OECD methodology (Dijkstra et al. 2013). We measure the direct effect as initial employment (value added) in new firms, and we measure the indirect effect as employment gains (value added) from indirect supply-side effects such as efficiency, more innovation, greater variety, and improved competitiveness. The indirect or spillover effect on employment results from relatively more competition. To capture the value added of new firms, we use GDP per capita in purchasing power parity and not population or employment growth (which capture rather job creation and number of people moved into a city) (Audretsch 2003; Cheshire and Magrini 2009; Glaeser et al. 2010). Thus, our study captures real changes in the economic value of entrepreneurship. Our analysis yields several insights. First, our main finding is that the effects of entrepreneurship emerge over time. We find entrepreneurship has a “wave” effect on economic value generated in a city (this is similar to the wave pattern of employment growth in various agglomeration economies, found by Fritsch and Mueller 2004). This wave effect is apparent for both direct and indirect effects of new firms on economic development and reveals that some new firm impacts may take up to seven years to be fully exploited. Related to this, we find new firms have the strongest indirect effect in large cities after six years due to spillover effects on incumbents. Second, we find that the value added of new firms differs in large cities, due to capacity effects (Fritsch and Mueller 2004), as opposed to small-/medium-size cities. Third, the indirect supply-side effect of new entrants is found to occur only in large cities. We find that indirect effects on incumbents tend to be considerably more pronounced than direct effects and could be explained by differences in city size (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). We explain this as the critical mass in large cities leading to spillover of ideas and generating more growth (Acs et al. 2009). Our work advances knowledge on regional economic development and entrepreneurship in three important ways. First, we decompose the overall growth effect of new firms into the newcomer effect (the direct effect) and the indirect effect on employment in incumbents across cities of various market sizes. We are able to do this using a time dimension (e.g., van Stel and Suddle 2008; Brakman et al. 2009) in our empirical strategy. Second, we examine both direct and indirect effects of entrepreneurship, drawing upon market size rather than population density (which can capture social and business networks and agglomeration effects) as in previous studies (Glaeser et al. 1992; Saxenian 1994; van Stel and Suddle 2008; De Groot et al. 2009). Third, we inform regional policy with nuanced findings based on city size. Given large agglomeration externalities (Jacobs 1969; Rosenthal and Strange 2004; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009) in large cities, an indirect spillover effect of new firms increases significantly compared to the initial direct effect. The relationship is U-shaped in large cities, where both displacement and spillovers are present. Small/medium size with fewer than 250,000 inhabitants needs larger markets in order to experience the spillover effect. Overall, our findings indicate that the classic creative destruction process posited by Schumpeter (1934, 1949) is not only at work, but is marked by idiosyncratic trends over time. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we review relevant literature which provides insight into the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development in cities. In Sect. 3, we present our data, variables, and empirical strategy. Our results are discussed in Sect. 4, followed by a robustness check in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we provide policy implications, followed by a brief conclusion.",128
55.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,21 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0683-z,"Internal migration, regional labor markets and the role of agglomeration economies",October 2015,Timo Mitze,Torben Dall Schmidt,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The spatial mobility of labor between different regions of a national economic system is typically viewed as an important prerequisite for an efficient labor market allocation and consequently associated with increases in labor productivity. From a national and regional policy perspective, it is thus of vital interest to empirically identify the most relevant causes and consequences of internal labor migration flows. With regard to theoretical priors for an empirical identification approach, however, no clear-cut predictions can be made: on the one hand, the neoclassical migration theory predicts that key labor market signals such as differences in regional wage or income levels as well as disparities in unemployment rates play a major role in canalizing flows of mobile labor (see, e.g., Etzo 2011). The migration response to these initial signals then acts as an equilibrating force in terms of clearing interregional disparities in the adjustment process toward a long-run labor market equilibrium. Modern theories of economic growth and spatial equilibrium, on the other hand, have recently pointed toward the role played by agglomeration economies in attracting mobile labor, which may result in a process of cumulative causation with an advancing regional concentration of economic activities and mobile production factors rather than a balancing of interregional disparities (see Fu and Gabriel 2012). In essence, different hypotheses with regard to the labor market causes for and consequences of labor mobility are offered in the recent literature. Taking up this discussion, we analyze the migration–income–unemployment nexus for Danish municipalities over the period 2006–2012. Besides assessing the role of traditional labor market factors and general agglomeration measures such as the overall regional population density or the regional concentration of industry employment typically used in empirical studies, we aim at augmenting the current state-of-the-art by focusing on alternative measures of agglomeration economies. Specifically, we consider the region’s innovative and creative capacities proxied by the patent intensity and the regional employment share in knowledge-intensive services (KIS). Denmark can be seen as an interesting case study for investigating these factors underlying the migration–income–unemployment nexus because of two noteworthy characteristics: firstly, the Danish labor market is typically considered to be very flexible in a European perspective. Secondly, the country is one of the most innovative and research-intensive economies in the EU with 3 % of R&D expenditures relative to GDP in 2011 as compared to an EU average of about 2 %.Footnote 1
 At the heart of the empirical analysis lies the specification of a core migration equation identifying the main determinants of internal labor mobility in Denmark. Additionally, we investigate the feedback linkages running from migration to labor market signals, which leads to the estimation of a three-equation labor market system including separate model equations for regional differences in income levels as well as unemployment rates. In this context, the size and nature of agglomeration economies may play a crucial role as an attractor to human capital through labor mobility. Agglomeration economies may furthermore foster the regional innovation and income performance resulting from this human capital gain through the existence of knowledge spillovers. By adding a broad set of agglomeration economies to each equation of our specified small-scale labor market system, the aim is to identify this dual role played by agglomeration economies. The baseline hypothesis is accordingly that agglomeration economies through urbanization and localization effects attract migration, which is then observed to have a feedback effect on income levels and unemployment rates. In the course of estimation, we will account for various factors, which are likely to complicate empirical identification and lead to biases in the results if not properly addressed. Firstly, we capture the inherent temporal dynamics in labor market adjustment processes by means of a partial adjustment model approach (Lambert et al. 2014). Secondly, we capture potential estimation biases introduced by underlying spatial dependence among regional labor markets by means of estimating a spatial Durbin model specification (LeSage and Pace 2009). The introduction of spatial dynamics also allows for a richer model interpretation in terms of quantifying spatial neighborhood and spillover effects. Furthermore, in the empirical analysis we will test for potential regime shifts by focusing on the importance of factors driving high-skilled migration vis-à-vis low-skilled migration. Finally, while our baseline modelling approach already includes lagged regressors to resolve issues of reverse causality, throughout the empirical identification strategy, we will also consider the use of instruments adapted from Card (2001) and Fratesi and Percoco (2014). This may allow us to carefully interpret the obtained results as causal effects rather than just conditional correlations. On a methodological note, it may also be stated that the period of analysis includes crisis years following the global financial and economic crisis of 2007/2008. The empirical specification considers this “global shock” to the overall Danish labor market in a number of dimensions: one is by including time-fixed effects, and another is by including variables on regional employment structures by NACE one-digit industries controlling for region-specific structural change during a crisis. Thus, the contribution of the analysis undertaken here accordingly relates to four aspects. One is by contributing to a scarce and recent literature on the importance of agglomeration economies as a pull factor for human capital migration, thereby assessing the empirical validity of the model predictions of the neoclassical migration model and the NEG theory. Another is by allowing such agglomeration economies to arrive from different channels such as relating to urbanization and localization effects. Furthermore, the empirical strategy allows for dynamic adjustment processes of spatial structures, hereby considering the possible importance of regime shifting. Finally, this paper contributes by stressing the effects of internal human capital migration, rather than international migration, which is at the core of most recent empirical studies, when considering a relationship between creativity, innovation and economic development. Our empirical results support the view that agglomeration economies are key drivers of internal migration processes in Denmark. While we obtain mixed evidence with regard to the role of general labor market and housing market variables in driving internal migration flows, most of the included proxies for agglomeration economies matter: we get positive and statistically significant conditional correlations of the region’s net in-migration rate with the region’s relative population density, the patent intensity, the regional endowment with human capital as well as the employment share of knowledge-intensive services. With regard to the consequences of internal migration flows, the results do not reject the NEG view of a circular process of urbanization and agglomeration, inflow of mobile labor and increasing regional labor market differences. However, given that this analysis has been conducted for a limited time period and a labor market in “crisis,” further research effort is needed to address the complex dynamics between internal migration and regional labor market disparities. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the following section provides a selective literature review on the causes and consequences of migration in a regional labor market context focusing on the role of agglomeration forces. Section 3 outlines the specification of our small-scale labor market system and discusses the empirical estimation strategy. Section 4 provides an overview of the data and presents some stylized facts. The estimation results for the migration–income–unemployment nexus are presented in Sect. 5, while some crucial robustness checks can be found in Sect. 6. Section 7 finally discusses the results with regard to their policy implications and concludes the paper.",13

These activities, which compose a regional technological system, evolve and unfold in an endogenous and interdependent way. The interrelated dynamics are of utmost interest for regional scientists and policy makers who aim to foster regional development and to spur economic growth. Since policy instruments are usually tailored to specifically support one of the above activities, knowledge about the causal structure of the dynamic interdependencies in regional technological systems is essential to efficiently design, focus and implement policies. Does an increase in research automatically leads to more innovations and economic growth, as the traditional linear thinking would suggest, or do successful innovations generate economic opportunities and set incentives to perform further research? Are educational and innovation activities direct generators of economic growth? Are there industries in which economic growth (for instance, due to the expansion into export markets) lead to further innovation and workforce skilling? By ignoring questions like these policies often fail to reach their goal of contributing to regional development. In the literature, the relationships between the activities are mostly studied in isolation. For instance, a huge bulk of literature exists that investigates the link between regional innovation and economic growth (e.g., Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008). However, the simultaneous and endogenous development with other interdependent activities, such as research efforts or university education, tends to remain unaddressed. They cannot be neglected if the causal structure in the dynamics of regional economies as coherent, multi-dimensional systems should be uncovered. Besides, only few studies exist which take an explicit industry-specific perspective (e.g., Buerger et al. 2012). Therefore, the study at hand uses a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) framework to address the issue of causality in systems of endogenous and interdependent variables. The models, which are estimated separately for five industries, go beyond simple temporal associations by recovering the instantaneous causal effects, which would be missed if only the lagged effects are considered (Coad et al. 2012). For identifying SVAR models, the literature usually refers to theory to derive the necessary identification restrictions. Because theory is not always unambiguous and assumptions like market clearance or perfect factor mobility are rather controversial, the resulting insights are often put into question. Only recently, data-driven identification techniques, which do not rely on any a priori theoretical assumptions, have been developed in the machine-learning community (Hyvärinen et al. 2010). This paper uses a strategy based on independent component analysis (ICA), as introduced by Moneta et al. (2013) into the economic literature. By exploiting the non-normality of residuals’ distributions to establish causal relationships, this strategy is particularly suited for the analysis of systems governed by economic shocks—the existence of fat tails in economic growth rate distributions has emerged as a stylized fact from a huge body of literature (see Coad 2012 for an overview). The paper is structured as follows. The first part of Sect. 2 briefly discusses different approaches of causal discovery. The second part introduces the vector autoregression methodology and related identification issues of the structural version. Furthermore, recent empirical applications in the literature are summarized. Section 3 sketches a conceptual model of regional systems of technological activities, provides an overview on the knowledge about regional interdependencies between the economy, innovation, research and education and derives hypotheses on the industry-specific causal linkages among these activities. Section 4 presents the identification algorithm based on ICA in detail and discusses further empirical aspects concerning the estimation. It also provides an overview on the data. In Sect. 5 the results on the causal relationships are presented and discussed. Section 6 concludes by drawing policy recommendations.",4

For instance, Barabasi and Albert (1999, p. 510) have shown that “[\(\ldots \)] large networks self-organize into a scale-free state.” In a similar vein, previous empirical studies have analyzed the structural emergence of small-world networks (Baum et al. 2003). Several authors have demonstrated that large-scale network characteristics, in particular small-world properties, are likely to affect the exchange of information and knowledge and thus enhance the creativity and innovativeness of embedded actors in various ways (Uzzi and Spiro 2005; Fleming et al. 2007; Schilling and Phelps 2007). In this paper, we focus on innovation networks that are characterized by a so-called core–periphery (CP) structure. The existence of CP patterns in an innovation network is accompanied by at least two theoretical implications. On the one hand, it has been argued that a firm’s embeddedness in the core of an industry’s innovation network goes hand in hand with a better access to critical information and knowledge (Rank et al. 2006). The underlying argument is that densely connected network areas provide access to external knowledge stocks via direct and indirect linkages. Cattani and Ferriani (2008, p. 826) argue that the core is composed of “[\(\ldots \)] key members of the community, including many who act as network coordinators and have developed dense connections between themselves.” The prominent positioning of a firm in the core is usually assumed to be positively related to its innovativeness and economic performance. Another important implication is that we are obviously confronted with a separation or isolation problem. Peripheral network positions are closely related to the concept of isolation. Hall and Wylie (2014, p. 358) argue that isolation only rarely appears as a stringent analytical concept in the literature on economics and innovation and is usually used in a descriptive or metaphoric way. They make the point that isolation is a pervasive element of all kinds of social and economic systems which can be exogenous but also self-imposed (Hall and Wylie 2014, p. 373). The consequences of isolation for technological innovation are not yet fully understood. However, it is important to note that isolation in a geographical, social, or cognitive sense is not necessarily negatively related to innovativeness. Instead, isolation can provide a unique environment and induces innovation processes, that otherwise may never have happened (Hall and Wylie 2014, p. 374). Hall and Wylie (2014) give two examples of this phenomenon when they compare the different ways the air defense systems in Australia and Sweden developed. Another example of isolation as a driver for innovation is the development of microelectronics in the former GDR (cf. Heinzmann and Karrasch 1990). Inspired by the idea of Hall and Wylie (2014), who maintained that isolation can provide a unique environmental setting that breeds innovation, we formulate our working hypothesis which states that collective innovation processes (R&D cooperation) often have their origins in isolated areas of the network. We believe that the network periphery can provide fairly unique but fruitful conditions for the emergence of new ideas simply because isolated firms do not have the same set of opportunities as well-embedded actors located in the core of the network. Firms located in peripheral network areas are forced to use unorthodox techniques to solve technical problems and often need to take higher risks throughout their research and development process. However, generating such an innovation is one prerequisite but not the only prerequisite for isolated firms to outperform competitors. Once isolated firms have entered an industry’s innovation network through its periphery, they need to gain access to well-established technological knowledge that is likely to be found at the very core of the network. Hence, we are particularly interested in understanding the factors that determine the paths on which organizations move from isolated positions toward the core. In a nutshell, we argue that isolation and core embeddedness are not mutually exclusive concepts; instead, they are linked by the temporal dimension and should be analyzed accordingly in a longitudinal setting. To address the issues raised above, we explore a unique dataset encompassing the full population of German laser source manufacturers (LSMs) since the onset of this industry (cf. Buenstorf 2007). We also gathered data on public research organizations (PROs) that were active in the field of laser research. For both types of organizations, we collected data on publicly funded R&D cooperation projects from two complementary sources—the Foerderkatalog database and the CORDIS database—for the entire observation period between 1990 and 2010 (cf. Kudic 2015). We are not the first to use publicly funded R&D cooperation projects to construct knowledge-related innovation networks (see, e.g., Broekel and Graf 2011; Fornahl et al. 2011; Scherngell and Barber 2009, 2011; Cassi et al. 2008; Kudic 2015). The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we give an introduction of major facts about the German laser industry. Section 3 provides the theoretical basis for the subsequent discussion, gives a brief overview of previous research on the CP measurement, outlines most notable applications of CP models in an innovation network context, and derives two testable hypotheses. In Sect. 4, we present our dataset and address methodological issues related to the measurement of CP patterns and the analysis of core entries in a longitudinal event history setting. In Sect. 5, we present our results at three analytical levels. These are ultimately discussed in Sect. 6, not forgetting the limitations and potential refinements.",8
55.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,24 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0712-y,Patterns of innovation and collaboration in small and large firms,October 2015,Lina Bjerke,Sara Johansson,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the last 25 years, a path of literature has evolved on innovation and collaborations within regional innovation networks, showing that the local economic milieu plays an important role in stimulating firm innovation (Asheim and Isaksen 2002; Moodysson et al. 2008; Simmie 2003; Trippl 2011). Innovation is a process where different types of knowledge and competencies are combined. Through participation in different types of knowledge networks, firms can access various kinds of knowledge and information. Through such interactions, small firms can bring together similar innovation capacities as those present in large firms. Although large firms carry out more innovations in absolute number, innovation activities are observed also in small firms (Ebersberger and Herstad 2012; Gagliardi et al. 2013). A large body of literature focuses on the role of proximity for knowledge exchange and find that knowledge networks tend to be geographically bounded (e.g. Anselin et al. 1997; Asheim and Isaksen 2002). Recent literature shows that the spatial aspects of knowledge exchange and formation of knowledge networks appear to be more complex than what previously have been indicated (Boschma 2005). The perspectives of proximity are therefore broadened to non-spatial dimensions relating to cognitive, organizational, institutional and social adjacency (Boschma 2005; Boschma and Frenken 2010; Ponds et al. 2007). This paper explores the patterns of innovation and collaborations using unique firm-level survey data. These survey data include information about innovations and collaborations in 636 firms with at least one employee in the county of Jönköping, located in the southern part of Sweden. This county consists of 13 municipalities, and 11 of these are characterized as rural. Nevertheless, the county has a strategically good location in the middle of a triangle with the three Swedish metropolitan regions in the corners, and the region hosts a large number of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms. The survey data collected from firms in this region consider all types of collaborations, not only those relating directly to innovation projects, and include information about type of collaborators and their geographical location. Moreover, the data cover firms in all size classes and include also the smallest firms, which are largely neglected in the literature on firm innovation. The purpose of the paper is to explore the patterns of firm collaboration with regard to the type of collaborator and its geographical location. By quantitative analyses of the relations between collaborations and firm innovation, the paper contributes to previous research in three ways. First, the data include, in contrast to, e.g. the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), also the smallest firms (between 1 and 9 employees). Innovation activities in small firms are largely overlooked in current research, partly due to lack of data. It might be that small firms carry out fewer innovations in absolute numbers, but they are nevertheless important contributors to technological progress and economic renewal (Acs and Audretsch 1988). This paper sheds some light on innovations and collaborations in small firms, proposing that small firms may be as innovative as their larger counterparts if they find relevant partners to collaborate with. The survey data indicate that a substantial fraction of small firms are innovative, although this fraction is somewhat larger for firms with more than 9 employees. The second contribution of the paper is found in the analysis of spatial and non-spatial dimensions of collaboration patterns. This study considers general collaboration that take place for any purpose and not only collaboration directly related to innovations. These collaborations are scrutinized from a geographical perspective, where intra-regional, extra-regional and international linkages are distinguished. Furthermore, the data allow us to distinguish between intra- and inter-firm collaborations, intra- and inter-industry collaborations and collaborations along vertical and horizontal linkages in the value-added chain. These data allow us to broaden the perspectives of proximity. Hence, this study adds to a rather limited empirical literature analysing non-spatial proximity dimensions of firms’ collaboration patterns and the impact of different types of collaboration on firm innovative performance. A third contribution of the paper regards the type of region investigated. Most studies on innovation activities focus on (or are unintentionally biased towards) large metropolitan regions, simply because these regions often are the preferred location for R&D activities and also host the predominant part of knowledge-intensive firms. Innovation is, however, a phenomenon that occurs in different types of places. Still, the literature on innovation and innovation networks in regions characterized by structures with low density is not yet very developed. The results from this study suggest that spatial proximity is not necessarily very relevant for explaining firm-level collaboration patterns. Rather, non-spatial dimensions of proximity seem to be more important in shaping patterns of collaboration. Furthermore, the relationships between innovation and collaborations appear to be similar in small and large firms, with one exception; inter-regional collaborations seem to be particularly important for innovations in small firms. The paper starts with a review of previous research in fields relating to this study, covering the role of geographical and non-geographical proximity in knowledge sharing as well as the role of small firms in regional innovation performance. Section 3 presents the methodological issues relating to the survey and data collection, followed by Sect. 4 that presents the econometric methodology applied in the quantitative analyses of the survey data. The results from these analyses are presented in Sect. 5, and the outcomes of the study are finally summarized and discussed in Sect. 6.",28

A multiplicative decomposition analysis of disaster impact,December 2015,Yasuhide Okuyama,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The economic impacts of a natural hazard and the subsequent disaster situation have been studied, and the models to simulate such situations have been proposed and advanced in recent years. These research efforts have contributed to deriving more accurate estimation of the economic impact that can be used for the post-event planning of recovery and reconstruction strategy and for the pre-event evaluation of disaster preparedness and mitigation policies (Okuyama and Santos 2014). While the impact estimation of disasters has been carried out at various geographical levels, such as national, regional, or local, the common practice of such estimations has been to calculate the impact on some aggregate measures, for example, changes in gross domestic product (GDP), gross regional product (GRP), or total income. This is because the objective of such practice is to estimate the total cost of such event for considering reconstruction finance at various levels of government or for assessing the benefit–cost relationship of disaster countermeasures (Hallegatte and Przyluski 2010). The retrospective analysis of disaster impact and process, i.e., empirical investigations of economic consequences in a particular disaster including the effects from reconstruction after some years (short-run analysis), has been carried out. Recently, these short-run impact analyses of disasters were meta-analyzed and summarized (Lazzaroni and van Bergeijk 2014; van Bergeijk and Lazzaroni 2015), and the results indicate that disasters have negative impacts in terms of damages (direct costs) but have insignificant impact with regard to total losses (indirect costs).Footnote 1 While many studies estimating the short-run impact of the 1995 Kobe earthquake have been published, for example, Okuyama et al. (1999), Horwich (2000), among others, the detailed investigation of how the Kobe economy has been altered due to the event and consequent recovery and reconstruction activities using any quantitative data and methods has been limited. Okuyama (2014) is one of the studies analyzing the structural change of the Kobe economy after the event, in which the structural decomposition analysis was performed to a time series of the Kobe regional input–output tables for attempting to extract structural changes caused by the 1995 Kobe earthquake. While this study revealed some useful findings, such as identifying regional final demand as the most influential factor to the changes in regional output for many sectors, the analysis was intended toward the long run, since the 1995 Kobe input–output table was not available (not officially released). The lack of the 1995 data surely leads to some ambiguities of the results in terms of immediate impacts on the regional economic structure. In order to fill the gap in and to complement the Okuyama’s (2014) study, this paper employs a set of the 1995 input–output tables for the damaged region estimated by Ashiya and Jinushi (2001) to explore how the destructions and disruptions by the event affected the regional economic structure using the structural decomposition method with the shift-share analysis to isolate the effects from the event. The derived results are compared and integrated with the results in Okuyama (2014) for examining the ways that the initial structural changes have been dealt and adjusted through the recovery and reconstruction activities. In the next section, the paper briefly summarizes the previous studies and findings on the structural impacts of disasters. Section 3 presents the data for the case study and the methodologies for structural analysis. The results of the analysis are illustrated and discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes this paper with the discussion of findings and some remarks.",11

An increasing number of programmes are being implemented in European countries. Since its introduction, GDP has been the most widely used indicator of a country’s economic performance, and yet, it is also highly criticized as a measure of people’s well-being. Indeed, GDP is a measure of production, but it ignores the undesirable side effects, such as pollution and environmental damage, which often accompany production growth. Furthermore, it does not include in its calculation a number of factors which significantly affect people’s quality of life, for example, the quality of education, health care, the cultural and natural environment, social relations, personal safety, and decent housing (Fleurbaey 2009). Even worse, GDP may increase when children work and do not go to school or when there is growth in such criminal activities as drug peddling and prostitution. Thus, conflating market production statistics with quality-of-life evaluations may entail misleading conclusions about how well off people are (Stiglitz et al. 2009). Unfortunately, whereas there are international standards for GDP calculation, a unique and universally accepted statistic for measuring well-being has not existed until now. As a consequence, due to the lack of suitable methods to measure the quality-of-life aspects of progress, economists have often engaged in analysing economic and social progress by focusing on production indicators, albeit they were aware that mixing the two aspects could lead to mistaken policy decisions (see, for instance, Kuznets 1934; Nordhaus and Tobin 1973; Osberg and Sharpe 2005).Footnote 1 Interest in the measurement of well-being has been increasing in the last two decades, not only in the academic world, but also in public policy programmes and debates. Thus, after halting beginnings, the quest for the measurement of well-being has acquired greater interest. However, despite the important literature on the subject, this remains an empirical, as well as a theoretical, challenge. The empirical challenge comes with the difficulty of obtaining a universally accepted standard measure of the phenomenon, since well-being has a large spectrum of dimensions that should be investigated or quantified empirically. These dimensions range from material to relational features and from relational to subjective well-being, which includes the set of values and expectations of the individuals concerned. The theoretical challenge comes from the multifaceted aspect of the phenomenon, which is difficult to encapsulate within a single theory and, so, gives rise to a proliferation of theoretical approaches. Fleurbaey (2009) identifies four different approaches within which theoretical contributions can be grouped: (a) works aimed at obtaining a “corrected GDP” in order to take sustainability and nonmarket factors which influence well-being into consideration; (b) studies of the measurement of “gross national happiness”; (c) the “capability approach”, proposed by Sen (1985, 2000), which states that progress does not coincide with a country’s level of opulence, but rather with people’s quality of life and freedom of choice; (d) the approach aiming at defining “synthetic indicators” which, in line with the UNDP Human Development Index, are based on the weighted average of indicators of different aspects of human well-being (UNDP 1990, 2010).Footnote 2
 The measuring of well-being has the difficult task of taking many questions into consideration. First, the number and the variety of well-being dimensions: which and how many domains should be considered? Secondly, the internal coherence of synthetic measures of different dimensions: how and to what degree are the different domains of well-being interrelated? Do they all have the same importance (weight) in defining well-being? How can we choose the appropriate weight for each dimension? Third, the relationships between the well-being indicators and the traditional economic indicators of production: does looking at well-being indicators rather than traditional economic growth indicators make any difference? With these questions in mind, our aim in this paper is to contribute to the empirical literature on well-being measurement by considering Italy as a case study. First, in choosing the well-being dimensions, we try to limit arbitrariness to a minimum by considering the various insights which emerge from a recent project carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in conjunction with the National Council for Economy and Labour (CNEL). This project produced a database covering 12 dimensions of “Equitable and Sustainable Well-Being” (whose Italian acronym, BES, is used hereafter).Footnote 3 We then consider ten domains of well-being and calculate one synthetic indicator for each over the period 2004–2010, so combining a set of 57 variables at regional level by means of the principal component analysis. Unlike the BES report (CNEL-ISTAT 2013), we do not address the dimensions for which variables are not available at regional level or where data do not cover the same time interval.Footnote 4 On the other hand, in addition to the issues discussed in the BES report, we consider the “culture and free time” dimension in order to account for two phenomena, culture and sports, which have substantial consequences for people’s well-being in terms of physical and psychological health, individual enjoyment, and leisure. Both these aspects are particularly relevant for the evaluation of a society’s well-being because they determine externalities: cultural consumption and sport activities have been shown to foster civic participation, social capital, and social cohesion (Carlisle and Hanlon 2007; Diener 2009; Grossi et al. 2012). Secondly, our methodological strategy is to use the principal component analysis (hereafter PCA) in order to avoid subjective weighting schemes in building composite indicators. PCA is a multivariate statistical method for extracting synthetic measures from a set of variables by transforming them into a smaller number of variables, the principal components. These are given by the uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables, whose variances are as large as possible. Furthermore, PCA enables us to evaluate the internal consistency of the indicators for each well-being dimension by analysing the structure of correlations between variables and other specific related tests, such as the measures of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett’s test. We then use the partial synthetic indicators obtained in the first step to construct an overall index of well-being. This was not attempted in the BES report, yet is extremely useful because it allows synthetic analysis of the phenomenon. We finally analyse regional well-being dispersion and rank mobility across regions over the period by means of two nonparametric techniques, which are applied to both the partial and overall indicators. Then, we compare the dynamics of regional well-being with those of the traditional indicator of economic performance, the per capita GDP, in order to capture the differences in regional disparity trends when well-being is measured by just looking at the material and productive sphere and when a multidimensional perspective is, instead, adopted. Last, we investigate the contribution of each dimension to the overall well-being dispersion by implementing a regression-based decomposition. Thus, the main new contributions of the present study are both conceptual and methodological. On a conceptual level, the study refers to a wider spectrum of domains and variables than has, until now, been used in the empirical literature on the measurement of well-being in Italy (Berloffa and Modena 2012; Capriati 2011; Felice 2007; Ferrara and Nisticò 2013; Iuzzolino et al. 2011; Murias et al. 2012) and for the period analysed, which covers the advent of the present economic and financial crisis. On the other hand, on a methodological level, this is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, that uses principal component analysis in a two-step approach. We calculate single-domain sub-indices in the first step and the overall well-being indicator in the second step. This is done by using the sub-indices, which were previously calculated by means of the same methodology, as the new variables. Indeed, most of the existing empirical literature on measuring well-being relies upon either composite indicators calculated as weighted averages of variables and sub-indices (Berloffa and Modena 2012; Marchante et al. 2006; OECD 2011, 2013) or mixed statistical strategies that use principal component analysis to assess the internal coherence of the different domains and the weighted average of the partial indices to calculate the respective composite indicators (Annoni and Weziak-Bialowolska 2012). The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the data and methodology used. Section 3 illustrates the domains considered in the study and presents some preliminary results of the principal component analysis. In Sect. 4, the results of the partial and overall synthetic indices of well-being are discussed. Section 5 presents the analysis of regional disparity trends in terms of both partial and overall well-being indicators. Section 6 illustrates the results of the regression-based decomposition of well-being dispersion, and Sect. 7 concludes by discussing the results.",24

The phenomenon that minorities’ residential distributions are more geographically concentrated can be found in cities in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere (Musterd 2005). Some well-known examples of residential clustering include the Maghreb immigrants in France (Wacquant 1993), Turkish immigrants in Germany (O’Loughlin 1980), and Malayans in Singapore (Van Grunsven 1992). Wacquant (1993) also discusses the difference between segregation in the ghettos of New York and in the suburbs of Paris. Indeed, the mechanism of segregation has been of great interest in the socioeconomic field. However, because the US inner-city problem has attracted social concerns, researchers of segregation mechanisms have focused on the uneven residential distribution of minorities in US cities. Kain (1968), for example, examines the relationship between residential segregation by race and differences in unemployment rate (or income level) between races from a sociological viewpoint.Footnote 1 Indeed, researchers of segregation in US cities have succeeded in theoretically explaining these mechanisms by associating ethnicity characteristics with income level (or years of education). Many studies have analyzed the segregation mechanism by examining the income levels of multiple types of households, using the traditional bid rent curve analysis of Alonso (1964),Footnote 2 and have succeeded in theoretically explaining US inner-city problems and the tendency for whites to reside in the suburbs under the core assumption that the blacks have lower income levels. In other words, they rely on the assumption that majorities are more likely to be better educated and more affluent than minorities. However, in reality, some minorities are more affluent than majorities, although we cannot necessarily conclude that ethnicity characteristics are strongly associated with skill levels.Footnote 3 Taking this stance, this paper does not assume that majorities are richer than minorities. Put differently, the analysis of ethnic segregation presented in this paper is conducted under the assumption of skill/income-level homogeneity among ethnic groups and assume that the majority and minority have identical skill levels. Discarding the usual assumption that the majority tends to be better educated or earn higher incomes is sometimes reasonable. Indeed, in the USA, while Hispanics and African Americans are likely to be less educated than whites, while the academic performance of Asians is superior still. Moreover, in countries such as Malaysia and South Africa, minorities (Chinese and whites, respectively) have a much stronger influence on the economy. Thus, one cannot assert that the income and skill levels of the majority are greater than those of the minority. What is unusual and possibly characterizes the present analysis is that even without assuming a difference in skill level between majority and minority groups, we still draw a conclusion that ethnic segregation occurs. To go in this direction, more support for adopting the assumption that the group tendency of skill/income level of the majority and minority is identical is needed. Reardon et al. (2015) show that black and Hispanic middle-class households tend to reside in neighborhoods that contain larger proportions of their same ethnic groups than those of similar earning white households in US cities and argue that wealth differences alone do not explain the disproportionate residential concentration of black households. Bayer et al.’s (2014) empirical study more clearly shows this segregation tendency of black residents in US cities, highlighting that the increasing proportion of better educated blacks is leading to an expanding set of available neighborhood options. As a result, highly educated black residents are moving from predominantly white neighborhoods into those of middle-class blacks. This finding suggests that highly educated blacks prefer to live with black neighbors of middle- or high- income class if they are available. After eliminating income or skill level difference among ethnicities, which may be one of the reason to bring about ethnic segregation, there still remains preference to their own ethnicity.Footnote 4 In other words, after eliminating the income- or skill-level differences among ethnicities, a preference for own ethnicity remains. Which factors other than income and skill differences might cause ethnic segregation? The benefits provided by residential proximity to the same minority group, or ethnic residential clustering, especially for minority rather than majority residents, is one important factor. For example, minorities or immigrants are more likely to face language difficulties. As suggested by Yancey et al. (1976), the effect of an ethnic network is stronger among members who are geographically clustered, indicating that common occupational positions and dependence on local institutions and services are important factors bearing ethnic clustering benefits. As for public goods provision, racial division may reflect different preferences for public goods consumption (Boustan 2007). Further, Besley et al. (2004) argue that residential proximity and sharing group identity with local politicians play a role when considering public goods provision. Ethnicity clustering is also beneficial from an education viewpoint. For instance, when a sufficient number of foreign children reside in a community, schools for such students may be more easily established.Footnote 5 The mechanism considered to explain the residential segregation of minorities is the fact that once a certain threshold is reached in a neighborhood, specific “community goods” may be provided to the minority, a phenomenon that increases its utility. In other words, better accessibility to “community goods” related to ethnic-oriented preferences is a key factor generating the benefits of ethnic clustering. In terms of the housing market, minority communities may play important roles. Calomiris et al. (1994) show that community development banks may eliminate search costs by creating an alternative source of funds for minority residents in the mortgage market. The benefits of ethnic clustering in the housing market have also been empirically shown. For instance, Søholt (2001) shows that ethnic groups with denser networks enjoy higher home acquisition rates. In addition, networks within the same ethnic group create more favorable consequences for minorities in the labor market. Mexican immigrants in the USA are more likely to be employed when the ethnic network is larger (Munshi 2003). Dietz (1999) reveals that migrant networks positively affect the labor market performance of ethnic Germans, suggesting that such networks support minority enclaves in Germany. To highlight the driving forces of ethnic clustering, we introduce the concept of “ethnic clustering preference” in the minority’s utility function, since the above-mentioned factors are more related to minority residents than a majority group.Footnote 6 Unlike in the extant literature on segregation related to negative externalities such as prejudice against minority residents,Footnote 7 this study thus emphasizes aspects induced by the residential proximity of a minority group. As noted already, although differences in skill level among ethnic groups have long been considered to be an important factor of ethnic segregation, elements associated with a minority’s preferences cannot be ignored when analyzing residential segregation by ethnicity. Indeed, a segregation analysis under the assumption of identical skill-level tendencies by ethnicity can be meaningful, particularly if our primary interest is the effect of minority residents’ clustering preferences. This study investigates this sorting process on the basis of a minority group’s positive externalities rather than the negative externalities induced by residential proximity to other ethnic members, as in Rose-Ackerman (1975) and Yinger (1976). The present segregation analysis uses a model that captures the externalities stemming from residential proximity to the same ethnic community, especially for minority residents.Footnote 8
 In the present model, both high- and low-skilled workers are perfectly mobile within a closed city that contains the center (high-skilled intensive area) and suburb (low-skilled intensive area) as workplaces. There are two types of ethnic characteristics, majority and minority, in the economy; thus, in addition to skill level, each individual is endowed with an ethnic characteristic. Further, we assume that both ethnic groups have the same high-/low-skilled population ratios. Minority residents obtain utility from proximity to residents of the same minority group. As for land consumption, for the sake of tractability, we draw on Helpman (1998) and assume that residents in the same area consume the same amount of land. If a minority individual’s residence and workplace are in different areas, she faces a trade-off between the benefits of ethnic clustering and distant commuting (as well as residential congestion). The existence of this trade-off for minority people is empirically considered by Liu (2009) in the context of Latino workers in the USA. The main results are as follows. When the commuting cost is low, minority residents always cluster, while majority residents move to a less crowded area to avoid residential congestion. Although this model does not directly tackle the spatial mismatch hypothesis, its key factors are deeply related to some of those in this hypothesis such as commuting costs and access to job centers (Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist 1990, 1991), both of which are deemed to be important in the present context. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the framework of the model. We employ Krugman’s (1991) model as the base model.Footnote 9 Section 3 introduces the notion of a long-run residential equilibrium and classifies the possible equilibrium configurations. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the residential patterns in response to low and high commuting costs. Section 6 compares the population distribution gap between the central and suburban areas on the basis of stable residential equilibrium paths. Section 7 concludes.",1

Ketterer,Andrés Rodríguez-Pose,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Understanding the causes of regional population change has attracted the interest not only of academics, but also of policy-makers. This is because population change has of late been stuck in a ‘jobs versus people’ debate—i.e. the question of whether people follow jobs and hence firms, or whether quality-of-life-related factors determine people’s location decisions, with firms and jobs following suit (Partridge and Rickman 2003, 2006). Most explanations have traditionally relied heavily on differences in regional economic strength, mainly in the form of expected income and living standards, as the main motivation for population mobility (Hicks 1932; Harris and Todaro 1970). More recently—and despite the fact that money and jobs have remained at the heart of many theories—scholars have increasingly focused on differences in non-pecuniary attributes, such as place-based natural or man-made amenities (Partridge and Rickman 2003, 2006; Ferguson et al. 2007; Rodríguez-Pose and Ketterer 2012), as key factors behind population growth and decline.Footnote 1 In addition, social capital, networks, and market access have also featured prominently as potential determinants of population change (Davis et al. 2002; McKenzie and Rapoport 2007). One factor which has been generally overlooked in the literature has been that of the quality of the institutions, in general, and that of government quality, in particular. There is much more on the impact of government institutions on economic development and growth than on population differences. This is not surprising as the definition and role of government institutions has been and remains controversial, and the measurement of government quality is fraught with problems. Moreover, the perception of the quality of government in areas of destination by would-be movers may be considered as much weaker than that of the availability of jobs or the wealth of the place. In this paper, we aim to overcome this gap in the literature by drawing attention to the influence of quality of government on the attractiveness of a given region for migrants. In particular, we investigate the impact of a set of different government quality parameters—level of corruption, government effectiveness, government accountability, and rule of law—on preference rankings for different locations using Tiebout’s (1956) approach where people ‘vote with their feet’, at a sub-national regional level in Europe. Our analysis hence aims to provide a greater understanding about how the quality of the government shapes the attractiveness of a region, and hence its capacity to lure future residents. The analysis contributes to the existing literature on the link between local government quality and sub-national urban or regional outcomes by providing evidence that population migration is not based on atomistic responses to economic or environmental aspects, but tends to be shaped and embedded in societal rules and norms. We use a novel data set of institutional quality at a NUTS-2—nomenclature of territorial statistical units—regional level in order to evaluate the relevance of local government aspects on a territory’s attractiveness. The analysis covers 254 European regions for the period between 1995 and 2009. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We first review the relevant literature in Sect. 2, before developing a simple conceptual framework of regional attractiveness based on people’s revealed preferences using Tiebout’s ‘voting with feet’ approach (Sect. 3). Section 4 presents a discussion of the data, the empirical strategy chosen, and addresses potential endogeneity concerns. In Sect. 5, we introduce and interpret the regression results using a variety of different estimators. Section 6 concludes.",10

An empirical examination for poor emerging countries,December 2015,Giray Gozgor,Baris Kablamaci,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In 2010, the urban population of the world (51.6 % of the total population) exceeded the rural population for the first time, and approximately 6.5 % of the urban population resided in the least developed countries (LDCs). While the growth rate of urbanization has gradually increased to over 3 %, the LDCs are confronted with the major challenges of producing economic and social development in both rural and urban areas during an era of globalization. A high population growth rate of 2 % per year in LDCs, an agricultural sector with a large, unproductive labor force, and a rural–urban wage differential generate incentives for labor to migrate from rural areas to cities (urban areas) where labor is not fully absorbed by the manufacturing sector [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2012; World Bank 2009]. Since the LDCs have been unable to compete in global markets, which also produced a growing urban informal sector, trade liberalization has adversely influenced urban wage (formal) employment (UNCTAD 2004, 2013). In this context, how the liberalization of trade and increasing globalization besides social conflicts affect both the urbanization process in big cities and the national urban populations in small open economies have become an important issue. Indeed, this remarkable phenomenon over the last two decades has produced a considerable amount of empirical research that investigates the determinants of rapid urbanization and the dynamics of giant cities in both developed and developing economies (Ades and Glaeser 1995; Brülhart and Sbergami 2009; Davis and Henderson 2003; Glaeser 2014; Henderson 2003; Henderson et al. 2013). In this paper, we focus on poor emerging countries—cases that have received surprisingly little attention in the academic literature. This paper examines the determinants of the population in urbanization measures in 79 low- and lower-middle-income economies by controlling for the impacts of international trade and different aspects of globalization as well as internal economic, political, and social factors on the national urban population and the population of the largest cities. Urbanization is also an important characteristic of economic development, particularly in poor emerging economies. Cities in which economic activities are concentrated generate cost advantages for both producers and consumers through economies of scale in labor, transportation, infrastructure, industry, and social relationships, which outweigh the negative effects of congestion and environmental problems (Gill and Goh 2010). Cities are capital-intensive regions, and the expansion of a city is predominantly affected by imbalances in sectoral productivity, trade policy, and price policy (Kelly and Williamson 1987). Increasing urban population due to rural–urban migration reflects the transfer of labor from the agricultural to the industrial sectors,Footnote 1 which is also associated with relative price changes, such as technological improvements (technology transfers), income levels, education, ethnic tensions, and civil disturbances (Fay and Opal 2000). Both globalization and urbanization measures significantly affect economic development, but these phenomena can also interact. This possible interaction must be considered in macroeconomic and trade policies to sustain economic growth. Indeed, globalization can foster economic development, poverty reduction, technology transfer, and productivity improvement in poor emerging economies by increasing specialization in the tradable sector. The effects of the international trade and globalization on the urbanization process are particularly complex in poor emerging countries and require careful empirical examination. It is important to note that the driving force of increasing urbanization is the structural transition of the economy from agricultural to industrial production, and the link between the labor market and integration into global markets relies on this transformation. In a profoundly influential paper, Krugman and Elizondo (henceforth KE) (1996) indicate that giant metropolises in developing countries are linked to international trade and import—substitution industrialization policies. In light of the projections of the KE (1996), this paper attempts to empirically investigate whether such a relationship exists in poor emerging economies. This paper empirically examines the determinants of the urban population and population living in largest cities for 79 low- and lower-middle-income economies given their level of economic development and globalization as well as other economic, social, geographical, and political factors. This paper makes three major contributions to the existing body of literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine the impacts of different aspects of globalization on urbanization measures in poor emerging countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first study to utilize the globalization indices of KOF as a measure of globalization in the current literature. Second, we utilize the system generalized method of moments (GMM) panel data estimations and establish the robustness of these results. Third, the panel data methodology in this paper addresses both persistence in the population of the largest cities and cross-sectional dependence among urbanization measures in these economies. Therefore, we suggest that the econometric methodology provides additional empirical evidence of determinant factors on the national urban population and the population in largest cities in poor emerging economies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature and argues motivation of the study that is based upon theoretical background. Section 3 describes the features of the dataset and explains the methodology of the panel data estimation framework. Section 4 reports and discusses the empirical results and the implications. Section 5 checks the robustness of empirical results. Section 6 presents our concluding remarks.",10

They not only have to deal with limited internal knowledge resources but also scarce locally available external resources in the conduct of research and development (R&D) and innovation activities, which are typically seen as key factors for obtaining competitive advantage. As an attempt to circumvent the underlying barriers to R&D and innovation, SMEs are increasingly found to engage in new R&D strategies combining the joint sourcing of internal and external knowledge (see, e.g., Bathelt et al. 2004; Trippl 2011). The effective exploitation of collaborative R&D strategies can thereby be seen as conditional on different parameters related to the organizational type of the cooperative partnership (e.g., university–industry or intra-industry alliances) or the spatial proximity to collaborating partners (Asheim and Isaksen 2002), and the choice of the right collaboration “mix” can be expected to be crucial for SMEs in remote and peripheral locations. Focusing on these particular regional settings, we use an empirical identification strategy for a sample of German SMEs over the period 2001–2007 to establish whether collaborative R&D strategies are indeed related to higher rates of R&D and innovation activities vis-à-vis non-collaborative strategies, measured with regard to both the inputs and outputs of research and innovation processes.Footnote 1 The main source of information is survey data collected for SMEs in the East German Federal State of Thuringia. The region can broadly be classified as peripheral in the geographical and economic sense due to its lack of highly urbanized core areas (e.g., over the period of analysis, Thuringia was not included in any of the European metropolitan regions within Germany) and its weak overall economic/innovation system.Footnote 2 However, at the same time, Thuringia has a particularly high share of small innovative firms compared to other regions in Germany (Alecke et al. 2010; Cantner and Kösters 2012), which makes it a relevant choice for our empirical investigation. Our main motivation for the particular focus on the role of R&D strategies of SMEs in remote and peripheral locations lies in the observation that this research field has only recently attracted the attention of scholars from economics and management science, and is still characterized by a paucity of empirical evidence to guide policy making, with respect to both direct firm effects (Lynch and Locke 2003; McAdam et al. 2004, 2014) and the firm’s broader role from a regional development perspective (Fritsch and Slavtchev 2011; Keeble 1997; Lopez-Fernandez et al. 2012). As McAdam et al. (2014) point out, this paucity comes rather as a surprise given that SMEs—especially those in peripheral regions—can be expected to depend crucially on external sources of knowledge to cope with locational disadvantage, such as limited access to capital markets and an underdeveloped external research infrastructure (see, e.g., Gatrell 2000). One of the few recent empirical analyses addressing the determinants of research and innovation collaborations of firms located in peripheral regions is that of Grillitsch and Nilsson (2015). Using a cross section of Swedish firms in the period 2006–2008, the authors find a positive correlation between a firm’s in-house research and innovation capabilities and its degree of external collaboration related to innovation. The authors thereby focus on collaborations with non-local actors and interpret this strategy as compensating for a lack of local knowledge spillovers in peripheral regions. In a similar vein, Bjerke and Johansson (2015) find for Swedish microdata on SMEs in the rural county of Jönköping that extra-regional collaborations matter the most for their innovation performance, where the latter is measured as binary flag indicator comprising different types of innovation activity (product, service and/or process innovation). While the authors find that the empirical relationship between collaborations and firm-level innovation probability is of similar magnitude across size classes, small firms are shown to particularly benefit from extra-regional interactions. Gaining further insights into the effectiveness of R&D strategies in peripheral and structurally weak regions may prove helpful in guiding policy making with respect to the appropriate targeting of SMEs in innovation-supporting schemes, as currently pursued at the German regional, national and EU levels in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.Footnote 3 At the same time, formulating such “causal” statements is a highly demanding challenge for empirical research. We address this issue by applying modern microeconometric “treatment effect” models aiming to measure the causal effect of a policy or similar treatment variable on an outcome variable of interest. In our case, the “treatment” is the use of different collaborative R&D strategies vis-à-vis the non-collaborative strategy of pursuing R&D activities purely in house. The reader should note, though, that—despite our ambition to assess the issue of causality as carefully as possible—our interpretation of the results in terms of “effects” and “impacts” has to be read cum grano salis. Foreshadowing our empirical results, we find that participating in R&D collaborations positively affects a firm’s input and output measures related to R&D and innovation activities over and above those conducting R&D and innovation solely in-house, that is, without any collaboration activities. This result is robust with regard to the different treatment effect models applied. Looking closer at different size classes of SMEs, we obtain evidence that the estimated impact on R&D and innovation outputs, such as patent intensity, is larger for SMEs with greater numbers of employees (\(>\)50), which may be interpreted as an indicator of the need for sufficient absorptive capacity with regard to human resources in the conduct of R&D activities.Footnote 4 In contrast, smaller firms (\(<=\)10 employees) only show a statistically significant difference in outcome compared to non-collaborating firms in terms of R&D inputs such as R&D intensity. The latter result is in line with Noteboom (1994), who argues that small firms tend to spend more on R&D to compensate for productivity effects associated with economies of scale. We also check for the role played by spatial proximity in R&D collaborations, as well as the organizational type of cooperating partners. Regarding the role of geographical proximity, the empirical results provide only weak statistical evidence for a particularly positive impact of local ties. This result is in line with earlier contributions hinting at the lack of availability of external knowledge in peripheral regions. However, the applied treatment effect models strongly indicate that firms engaging in joint R&D activity consisting of a mix of both public research institutes/universities and private sector business partners show the largest difference in outcome in terms of R&D and innovation outputs compared to non-collaborating R&D-active firms.",11

During the last two decades, an increasing dissemination of spatial econometrics techniques has been observed among regional scientists, economists, and researchers in several fields (Anselin 1988; Lesage 1999; Conley 1999). The vast research of applied spatial econometrics on the interdependencies among spatial units and their effects on, among others, regional economic growth, trade flows, knowledge spillovers, migration, housing prices, tax interactions, and city’s growth controlsFootnote 1 is well known. However, this literature still lacks a better understanding of the potential reasons why models estimated at different geographic scales yield different results in the context of regional economic growth empirics.Footnote 2
 
Resende (2011) engages in an initial discussion on the determinants of Brazil’s regional economic growth at a variety of geographic scales using a cross-sectional data set over the 1990s period. Resende (2013) improves this analysis by using standard panel data models across several spatial scales, but the process of economic growth in Brazil is only examined using non-spatial panel data models. This investigation refers back to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP),Footnote 3 but it sheds new light on a core problem in the literature related to regional economic growth by estimating models that are able to provide more insights about different spatial spillover effects due to changes in the spatial scale. The choice of the spatial scale of analysis is a problematic issue in applied research (Behrens and Thisse 2007). This paper seeks to investigate the extent to which ambiguities about spatial scale undermine, or inform, our understanding of regional growth determinants and convergence. With the exception of Resende (2011, 2013) and Resende and Cravo (2014)Footnote 4 studies thus far have only investigated the determinants of economic growth at a single spatial scale to infer the consistency of spatial growth models with reality (e.g., Rey and Montouri 1999; Fingleton 1999; López-Bazo et al. 2004; Ertur and Koch 2007; Elhorst 2010; Fischer 2011). For instance, Elhorst (2010) employ spatial econometric techniques to focus on time–space models, but they only examine the process of economic growth at a single spatial scale. To our knowledge, this is the first study of regional economic growth exploring both time and different spatial scale dimensions in the context of spatial panel data models. The idea of this paper is to systematically repeat a spatial panel data model originally developed to examine this phenomenon at a single geographic scale across multiple scales. The spatial scales examined are minimum comparable areas (referred to as municipalities), microregions, mesoregions and states, which are often employed in the empirical literature about Brazil and cover the period between 1970 and 2000.Footnote 5 Initially, this approach led us to the investigation of the measurement issue that might cause variability in regional economic growth estimates due to the use of different spatial scales, likely due to the MAUP. However, it is important to bear in mind that structural (theory based) issues may be underlying economic growth at different scales; thus, we provide theoretical arguments for such variability in empirical results found across different geographic scales.Footnote 6
 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the potential theoretical reasons for different results found across economic growth models estimated at different spatial scales. Section 3 describes the spatial panel data models employed in the empirical analysis. In Sect. 4, the data set and spatial scales are explained. Section 5 presents the results and the respective discussion follows in Sect. 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.",21
56.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,11 January 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0738-1,The effect of new business creation on employment growth in regions facing population decline,January 2016,Heike Delfmann,Sierdjan Koster,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"After centuries of continuous population growth, many regions in Europe are currently experiencing a period of stagnation or depopulation (Haartsen and Venhorst 2010; Reher 2007). Historically, population growth has always been considered a sign of a successful society and a successful economy (Reher 2007; Glaeser et al. 1992, 1995), implicitly stating that population decline is a sign of being unsuccessful. Moreover, classical economic theory explicitly predicts that a larger population, by allowing for economies of scale and labour division, improves productivity, and vice versa (Coleman and Rowthorn 2011). A decline in population would thus mean slower output growth, ceteris paribus, as well as other negative consequences of depopulation, such as the restructuring of population composition causing labour shortages through ageing. Given the likely declining labour supply, population decline is strongly associated with economic decline, although this association is not automatic or inevitable (Gáková and Dijkstra 2010). In the Netherlands, for example, the Parkstad Limburg region simultaneously experiences population decline and a growing employment rate (Limburg 2011). Population decline and ageing are noticeable trends in many Dutch regions. Although decline in the Netherlands has not yet taken dramatic proportions as it has elsewhere in Europe (Barca 2009; European Commission 2010), the change is structural and incremental and there is a challenge in keeping the declining regions viable in the future (SER 2011). Particularly for declining regions, new business creation is seen as a means to secure current and future employment opportunities (Andersson and Noseleit 2011; Armington and Acs 2002; Audretsch and Thurik 2000; Stam 2010; Wennekers and Thurik 1999). Yet, the mechanisms underlying regional employment dynamics governed by new business creation, especially in the context of population decline, remain unclear, hindering the formulation of effective regional development policies. There is a clear association between population decline and new business creation. Firstly, the number of start-ups is likely to decline as the number of potential entrepreneurs declines. This is strengthened by the effects of ageing as the probability of a person starting their own firm takes the shape of an inverted U and thus decreases after a certain age (Bönte et al. 2009; Schneider and Eichler 2007). In addition, regions with a declining population have to deal with a decreasing labour and consumer market. Despite these processes impeding new business creation, the start-up rate of new firms does not necessarily drop (Delfmann et al. 2014). Secondly, the employment effects of new business creation may be mediated by population decline. Although the exact role of the regional economic context on the effects of business creation is not fully understood, empirical evidence does reveal notable inconsistencies regarding the economic impact of the firms started in different types of regions (Audretsch and Fritsch 2002; Carree and Thurik 2003; Eliasson and Westlund 2013; Fritsch 2008; Li et al. 2011; Koster 2011; Willis et al. 2012). The spatially differing employment effects of business dynamics can be attributed to the types of business that are started in specific regions and the nurturing effect of the regional economic context, including population dynamics. This paper contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying regional differences in employment change through assessing the employment effects of new business creation in the context of population change. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We first discuss the theoretical links between entrepreneurship and regional employment and the ways in which the regional context may influence this relationship. Important distinctions are made between direct and indirect effects on employment in the theoretical section. Then we outline the model structure and the data employed. Following a presentation of the results, we discuss specific insights arising from the analysis, and finally we provide some brief conclusions.",14

Geisler,Mark W. Nichols,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the last two decades, many jurisdictions have approved casino gambling with the intent to stimulate their local economies. This trend has continued, even as the gains to communities that result from opening casinos remain disputed. While the arguments for and against casinos take many shapes and forms, from cultural acceptability to site suitability, most of the claims made by economists revolve around the economic impacts of new casinos where none had previously existed.Footnote 1 As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the prevalence of casinos in the USA has dramatically increased over the last few decades. One of the main arguments against using gambling as an economic development tool lies in the claim that casinos “cannibalize” other local businesses, resulting only in a redistribution of existing spending rather than adding production to the local economy. This idea that casinos change the mix of production and output while failing to stimulate new economic growth or improve the quality of life of those who live near the casino is a theme that rises time and again, especially with respect to non-tribal casinos.Footnote 2 Economic development theory agrees that this sort of re-allocation of resources cannot properly be classified as true growth. For economic growth, an increase in local production needs to occur. This can come either by producing a good for export, or by producing a good locally that substitutes for a good that had previously been imported (Felsenstein et al. 1999). In the case of casinos, this means attracting gamblers from other jurisdictions or retaining local gamblers to spend money locally rather than in other jurisdictions (Eadington 1995). “Riverboat” states are used in this analysis for many reasons, one of the most important being the timing of when they legalized gambling. These states all legalized commercial casino gambling over a 4-year period, and they all opened their first casinos within a similarly short period (see Table 1). This timeframe has the advantage of being relatively recent but also long enough to allow for meaningful comparisons before and after the casinos open. Another advantage of analyzing riverboat states is that casinos were only allowed to open in limited locations, generally on or near a river or at an existing pari-mutuel racetrack. This limited introduction serves as a natural experiment, leaving many nearby counties without casinos to serve as valid economic controls while minimizing any biases that may be due to the selection of where casinos are located. Casino states in 1990 Casino states in 2012 Utilizing this natural experiment improves on the methodology of the existing literature by comparing casinos of a similar scope, with similar regulation, in a regional context. The current study expands on and contributes to the literature by examining a long period (1984–2009) where most existing studies use two decades or fewer. In addition, this study examines a casino’s impact not only in the host counties but also in adjacent neighboring counties, thus expanding the literature on cross-border competition.",7

To overcome these difficulties, the literature suggests two markedly different policy approaches. One set of studies is in favor of measures that would further strengthen ENCs’ current specialization in traditional industries and intensify trade relations with economically less developed EU countries. Another strand of literature suggests that ENCs possess yet unexploited economic potentials and thus encouraging the development of higher-technology and knowledge-intensive industries, on the one hand, and trade relations with core EU 15 members on the other is a reasonable option (Bergman and Sinozic 2014). In this paper we provide a comparative analysis of the likely effects of these two divergent policy options. The particular country selected for the analysis is Turkey. Despite that Turkey is an accession country, its economic, social and cultural features make this country reasonably comparable to many of the ENP countries. The choice of Turkey is motivated also by practical reasons: availability and reliability of data for the analysis. Despite that data collection for Turkey is not a process without difficulties, the situation in this respect is relatively more advantageous there as compared to other ENP countries (with the exception of Israel which cannot be considered as a typical ENP country for other reasons). The assessment of the viability of one policy approach over another is not straightforward and requires special methodologies. Economic impact modeling is one of such methodologies. With the application of an economic impact model ex-ante simulations of the likely impacts of different kinds of policies become possible. Thus model results provide a platform for the comparison of several policy options. The specific model construct chosen for policy analysis is the Geographic Macro and Regional (GMR) modeling approach. GMR models have been used earlier for EU Cohesion Policy and EU Framework Program impact analyses at the levels of European regions, the European Union and Hungary. In Varga et al. (2013) we provide a detailed description of the applied GMR-Turkey model. Following the literature we formed two alternative scenarios of regional economic development, namely the Conservative scenario and the Technology development scenario. In the model simulations we run these two scenarios separately for a selected Turkish region to assess their likely impacts on regional GDP, national GDP and interregional inequalities in Turkey. These results then provide the basis of a comparison of the effectiveness of the two policy options suggested in the literature. This paper has the following structure. In the second section we introduce and classify policy suggestions emerging from the ENP literature. In the third section we introduce our representative region where the policy simulations are carried out. The fourth section presents scenario set-ups, while the fifth one outlines the applied GMR policy modeling approach. Simulation results are detailed in the fifth section. A summary closes the paper.",11
56.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,28 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0726-5,Dirty spatial econometrics,January 2016,Giuseppe Arbia,Giuseppe Espa,Diego Giuliani,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Variables observed within territorial units are not randomly scattered, and they are almost invariably characterized by spatial dependence. Statisticians have long been aware of this phenomenon and of its non-negligible impact on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing within a regression framework. Following this tradition in recent decades a broad range of spatial econometrics models has been introduced in the literature to properly accommodate the various sources of bias and inefficiencies in the statistical inference based on spatial data. Such models almost invariably can be traced back to the autoregressive paradigm, sometimes referred to as Cliff-Ord-type models in recognition of the contribution of Cliff and Ord (1972). A “clean” ideal situation considered in standard spatial econometrics textbooks (Anselin 1988; Arbia 2014) is when we fit Cliff-Ord-type models to data where: (i) The spatial units (whether they are points in space or regions) constitute a full population and not a sample, (ii) a complete cross section of territorial units is available with no missing data, (iii) variables are observed directly, (iv) there is no uncertainty on the spatial observations that are free from measurement error, and (v) the location of the observations is perfectly known. Unfortunately for spatial econometricians engaged in empirical analysis the reality is often very different and the datasets they have to contend with are “dirtied” with all sorts of imperfections: They are often based on a sample drawn from the whole population of spatial locations, some data are missing, some variables only proxy the target variables, and they almost invariably contain both attribute and locational errors. Our aim is to show that such imperfections are not just incidental to the statistical analysis, but they can mask and hide the real phenomena up to the point of dramatically distorting the inferential conclusions. Let us consider three paradigmatic cases. A first example is the case of spatial health data. In a recent paper Deuchert and Wunsch (2014) analyze a set of Malawi data to assess the effectiveness of health policies to reduce infant mortality due to malaria. The observed database is made up of a sample of households systematically drawn from a list of enumeration areas defined in the population census. In this dataset, some of the sample units can be missing for various reasons (non-response, death, cancelations, clusters of households refusing to answer), but not at random. In the case of Malawi data (as in many other household surveys), field teams routinely use GPS receivers with a positional accuracy of 15 m or less to geo-reference the location of the observational unit, but in order to preserve the confidentiality of the GPS coordinates, they are displaced according to a “random direction, random distance” method as described, e.g. in Collins (2011). A second example concerns plant locations in official statistics. For example, in Italy the National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) collects and disseminates data related to the active firms (ASIA archive. See, for example, Cozzi and Filipponi 2012). With regard to firms, the ASIA archive includes information concerning a set of economic variables (e.g. the firm code, the sector of activity, employees, legal status, the date of the firm’s establishment and termination) together with the geographic location of the plant in terms of latitude-longitude spatial coordinates. Spatial coordinates are identified automatically on the basis of the street address and so they contain a certain location error. Furthermore, for a non-negligible number of plants for which the address is missing, the geographic location is approximated by the coordinates of the centroid of the municipality of the plant. A third example is related to forestry. Forest inventories are important tools to monitor the state of the environment, to assess the quantity and quality of forestry resources, and to measure other important variables such as biomass, growth and production capacity. The inventory is often based on samples of trees distributed in the study area following a certain spatial design. For instance, the Italian National Forestry Inventory (see IFNC 2015) collects data related to approximately 300,000 sample points, randomly located and covering the whole Italian territory. Some of these analyses involve collecting data about trees whose position is geo-masked. The reasons for masking the exact position of the observed trees are mainly connected with the need to preserve the information about the value of the trees and of their properties and in order to avoid conflicts with the owners who may refuse to include their trees in the panel. For these reasons the marking of the trees included in the INFC sample is invisible (e.g. under the earth) and the information about the coordinates is disclosed only in terms of the south-west coordinate of a 1 km-by-1 km regular grid. As a consequence the information is geo-masked with a location error of up to 1.4 km. The previous examples are paradigmatic of “dirty” spatial econometric situations where both missing data and locational errors are present. When dealing with missing data a fundamental distinction is made between data missing at random (possibly completely at random) and data not missing at random (Little and Rubin 2002). In the spatial case this distinction is particularly relevant. In fact, if data are not missing at random in space, they can dramatically distort the picture by erasing entire spatial patterns. Another fundamental distinction has to be made when dealing with locational errors of the kind discussed in the examples above. In fact in some instances the uncertainty about the position is due to imperfections in the process of data acquisition (as it is in the case of the ASIA archive of firms where the location is induced from the street address), while in some other cases the uncertainty is induced by the data producer to preserve confidentiality (as is the case with the health and the forestry data). In the latter case the process of geo-masking is disclosed and can be used to improve the inferential procedure. This paper aims at making researchers aware of problems of this kind when employing spatial econometrics standard techniques. In the present analysis we are not suggesting statistical solutions, a task which is left to eventual further future contributions. Here we limit ourselves to show how the inferential results can be affected by spatial data imperfections and to point out to what extent our results might be expected to vary as a function of the dirt of the dataset.",12

In proposing a new theory of economic geography, Krugman (1991) sought to explain the industrial agglomeration and the formation of the core–periphery (CP) structure. He showed that the decrease in transportation costs, the increasing economies of scale and the mobility of the skilled workers reinforce the economic agglomeration and make some areas more attractive than others. Since Krugman’s CP model, economists (e.g., Glaeser et al. 1992; Henderson et al. 1995) and geographers (e.g., Scott 2004; Storper 2011) have focused on how to identify the kind of agglomeration externalities needed to promote regional growth. They stressed the difference between exogenous and endogenous factors and their direct and indirect effects on agglomeration when analyzing regional performance and growth. However, despite extensive theoretical and empirical attention paid to agglomeration, there is still a significant lack of knowledge regarding the main effects of local economic structure on employment growth (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). In addition, this literature generally focuses on the developed economies (the USA, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the UK, Canada,...) where formal employment represents the lion’s share of employment and economic activity. Researchers interested in developing and transition countries have recently focused on the significance of the informal sector and its linkages with formal economy (Ghate 1992; Meagher 1995; Arimah 2001; Portes and Schauffler 1993). Some of these studies have focused on ‘what does informality refer to’ in order to avoid conceptual ambiguity. Hence, despite numerous adjectives having been used including ‘unorganized sector,’ ‘unregistered economy,’ ‘illegal sector,’ ‘parallel economy,’ ‘irregular sector’ and the ‘shadow economy’, among others, a strong ambiguity exists on what is exactly considered as informal (Williams 2009). Hart (1973) was the first to bring the term informal sector into the academic literature. He introduced this concept to describe a ‘part of the urban labor force, which works outside the formal labor market...Hart considered the informal sector as almost synonymous for all categories of (small) self-employed individuals’ (Gërxhani 2004). The most used definition of the informal employment refers to the International Labour Office (ILO) that defines employment in the informal sector as ‘comprising all jobs in informal sector enterprises, of all persons who, during a given reference period, were employed in at least one informal sector enterprise, irrespective of their status in employment and whether it was their main or a secondary job’ [the Fifteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (15th ICLS, ILO 2000)]. The informal employment comprises: own-account workers and employers employed in their own informal sector enterprises, contributing family workers, employees holding informal jobs, members of informal producers’ cooperatives and own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (17th ICLS). Yet, today, informal work remains a major part of the non-agricultural workforce of developing countries, which for some of them is reaching a worrying level. It was 55 % in Latin America, 45–85 % in Asia, and nearly 80 % in Africa (Nichter and Goldmark 2009). In North African countries (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt), the undeclared output has been found to account for about 36, 38, 40 and 35 %, respectively, of the entire GDP (Gatti et al. 2014). Some other studies reveal that informal business activities can contribute as much as 70 % to GDP in developing countries, and the percentage is increasing (Schneider and Enste 2000; Schneider et al. 2010). Recent research on the informal sector in developing countries considers the relationship between formal and informal sectors (e.g., Arimah 2001; Günther and Launov 2012). There are a number of reasons why it is important to analyze this relationship. First, as mentioned above, the informal sector accounts for a sizeable proportion of the total non-agricultural employment. Second, the informal sector contributes significantly to the GDP of developing countries. Moreover, the development and continuous growth of the informal sector depend on the nature and type of linkages between the two sectors (Arimah 2001; Mukim 2015). There are two major theoretical conceptualizations that explain the formal–informal dichotomy: ‘dualism’ and ‘structuralism’ (Hart 1973; Tokman 1978). The dualists see the informal sector as comprising marginal activities (not related to the formal sector). On the contrary, structuralists see the informal and formal sectors as intrinsically related (informal sector is part of the process of production) (Moser 1978; Portes et al. 1989). Swaminathan (1991) considered informal activities as a ‘reserve army’ of labor who survive at low subsistence levels. He argued that the problems of mass poverty and unemployment (economic reasons) can explain the emergence and persistence of informality. Non-economic factors consist of greater flexibility and greater satisfaction in work. Friedman et al. (2000) argued that the discretion in the application of rules and the corresponding corruption are correlated positively with the size of the informal sector. Geographers have attempted to identify the linkages that exist between formal and informal sectors by examining their spatial dimension. They propose two themes: the proximity theme and the generative theme. The proximity theme suggests that informal activity will be located in proximity to a central market or some other populated area, while the generative theme argues that formal activity generates informal activity (Sanders 1987). Although informal sector activities have attracted increasing attention, empirical studies in developing countries and in Tunisia in particular are rare. Tunisian studies on agglomeration instead look only at the effects of urban economic structure on formal employment growth (Amara and Ayadi 2014; Amara and Hichri 2014). The objective of this study is to help close this gap in the empirical literature. More specifically, this paper contributes to the empirical literature in three significant ways: First, we provide a quantitative analysis in order to better understand the linkages and the feedback simultaneity between formal and informal employment growth at 264 Tunisian delegations covering all territory of the country. Second, we consider the spatial dimension of formal and informal employment growth by using spatial autoregressive lag and cross-regression spatial lags that allow us to better understand the linkages between places and activities and to provide an explanation to why the degree of employment (formal and informal) may vary between different delegations. Third, whereas most Tunisian studies focus on manufacturing industries, we include construction and services as well. Our study is the first to investigate the formal–informal relationship as well as the spatial interdependence by using a simultaneous system of spatially interrelated equations. Identifying the linkages between formal and informal employment and their determinants may help policymakers understand some of the mechanisms to explain the persistence of high levels of poverty and unemployment over time in some specific regions in Tunisia (the northwest and the middle west regions specifically) and to increase the mobility from informal to formal employment through the ‘formalization’ of informal sector enterprises. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the nature and sources of our data and outlines the model we employ and provides details of the construction of our variables. Section 3 reports and discusses the results, and Sect. 4 draws concluding remarks.",2

Hegerty,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While profound improvements in communication technologies have encouraged scholars to pronounce the “death of distance,” spatial disparities in the access of vital goods and services are still important. This limited access primarily has a negative impact on those who lack the financial resources, Internet access, or transportation required to bridge the physical and digital distances that they face. Recent geographic and economic analyses have examined “food deserts” areas in which few grocery stores are accessible, as well as regions where retail outlets are limited (as in Schuetz et al. 2012). Similar access issues apply to the location of retail banks; this has led to proposed solutions such as the use of United States Postal Service offices to perform banking functions. While Internet banking has grown to include not only bill payment and account transfers, but also the deposit of paper checks using smartphone cameras, physical bank branches continue to play an important role in communities. This is particularly true in low-income areas, which might lack the necessary Internet access and where low income requires assistance in borrowing and homebuying. Unfamiliarity with and reduced access to electronic banking might contribute to persistent poverty and an overreliance on non-traditional banking services, which often involve much higher interest rates for borrowers. As Ergungor (2010) notes, a physical presence in a neighborhood is not only important for the bank itself, it also has key benefits for the customers who reside nearby. Proximity to these customers facilitates banks information gathering in a way that basic methods such as credit scores cannot, which reduces the asymmetries that can lead to excessive risk premia. This in turn leads to cheaper credit for borrowers. An empirical analysis, using census data for the state of Ohio, shows that the presence of a branch in an area leads to more mortgage originations, and a decline in interest rate spreads. Like is the case for any industry, clusters of banks also increase consumer choice and have the potential to create agglomeration economies. Understanding the geography of bank locations is particularly important for cities and regions that are experiencing often difficult shifts from manufacturing- to service-based economies. This study, therefore, analyzes two fairly large US cities—Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Buffalo, New York—to examine spatial differences in the location of banks and credit unions (BCUs) within each city. Both cities are considered to be part of the “Rust Belt,” having undergone steep declines in industrial employment in recent decades, but key differences remain between the two. Milwaukee is larger in area (\(96 \hbox { mi}^{2}\), vs. \(41 \hbox { mi}^{2}\)) as well as population (about 600,000, vs. 260,000).Footnote 1 Milwaukee’s successful annexations during the 1950s and 1960s have lent parts of the city, particularly on the far Northwest Side, a less dense, almost “suburban” feel. In contrast, Buffalo is underbounded and possesses a perfectly straight “city line” on its East Side, and is completely within the urban core. Figure 1 shows the basic geography and income differentials for both cities, as well as bank locations. Many of the lowest-income areas (the near North Side of Milwaukee and the East Side of Buffalo) have no bank locations at all. Bank locations and median income in Milwaukee and Buffalo. Data sources Income: US Census Bureau, 2013 ACS 5-Year estimates. Bank branches: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Credit Unions and Other institutions: Internet search (Yellow pages) While both cities are relatively poor and racially segregated, Milwaukee has performed better economically. Buffalo has lost more than 50 % of its population since 1950, while Milwaukee’s population has declined less than 25 % from its 1960 peak. The most important distinction between the two cities, in terms of the current study, is that New York State restricts “payday lenders” far more extensively than does Wisconsin. The lack of this type of alternative may affect the location of BCUs and retail banks within Buffalo in a way that is not the case for Milwaukee. We find that there are very few nonbank financial institutions (abbreviated in this study as NBFIs) in Buffalo; perhaps this encourages traditional banks to diversify their locations. Using a combination of geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis, we map BCUs for both cities, as well as certain NBFIs for Milwaukee, as of January 2015. We then employ a series of tests to determine whether some block groups might be considered “banking deserts.” We also examine relationships between a set of socioeconomic characteristics and different measures of bank accessibility. Finally, regression analysis suggests that a model of bank density might be applied for Buffalo, but not Milwaukee. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 outlines the analytical methodology, and Sect. 3 describes the results. Section 4 concludes.",29

A rich array of interdisciplinary research on how to enable and foster socially sustainable pro-environmental behaviors has correspondingly developed. An extensive review of such research would take a full paper in itself, but it can be useful to draw attention toward some classical approaches and references. Economists have explored to what extent responsible environmental behaviors can be fostered by designing suitable incentive mechanisms, including monetary rewards (e.g., Curlee 1986). Law studies have considered the effects of legal measures such as mandatory recycling laws (e.g., Lanza 1983). Engineering research has compared the relative effects of alternative technologies and systems of recycling (e.g., Noll 1985). Environmental psychologists have focused upon harnessing altruistic motivations (e.g., De Young 1986), while sociologists have highlighted the role of social pressures and environmental constraints (e.g., Burn and Oskamp 1986). Public pedagogues call for participation and learning processes within the context of a complex array of education for sustainable development (ESD) approaches and settings (e.g., Læssøe 2010; Van Poeck and Vandenabeele 2012). This multifaceted body of evidence clearly illustrates the complexity and elusiveness of the nature and dynamics of pro-environmental behaviors. A more recent approach (Crociata et al. 2015) has explored the effect of a new factor, substantially overlooked in the previous body of literature: cultural participation. The relationship between citizen participation and civic virtue has been in turn largely explored in the literature (e.g., Putnam 2000), but only in recent times the distinctive contribution of cultural participation to the emergence of pro-sociality has been properly highlighted, with all its local, contextual complexity (e.g., Clark et al. 2014). Despite that often cultural participation presents a strong, distinctive social component, the preliminary evidence by Crociata et al. (2015) shows that also more individualized forms of participation, like reading a book or listening to music at home, may have a distinctive effect on pro-sociality and on an environmentally related one in particular. Most of the literature takes households as the main unit of analysis. According to Miafodzyeva and Brandt (2013), variables affecting recycling behaviors can be classified into four groups: sociopsychological, technical-organizational, individual-socio-demographic and study specific. The strongest predictors of households’ recycling behaviors were identified as: convenience, moral norms, information and environmental concerns—each of which, we note, has some degree of cultural connotation. In this scenario, even though households are generally aware of the social benefits of recycling, such awareness does not necessarily reflect into actual recycling practice. To really appreciate how pro-environmental behaviors evolve in a society, we think one should go beyond the individual perspective of the household and consider social transmission effects, and in particular socio-spatial ones. The literature shows, for instance, that phenomena such as happiness, which clearly can be read and understood in individual terms, are characterized by “contagion” patterns whereby happiness levels tend to be strongly influenced by proximity effects (Fowler and Christakis 2008); similar effects are found in the establishment of the trust and social cooperation conditions for effective co-inventive performance (Cassi and Plunket 2014). We ask whether a similar dynamics take place for pro-environmental behaviors, and in particular for attitudes toward waste recycling, as a spatial dependence phenomenon rather than as a mere reflection of spatial heterogeneity (Espa et al. 2013). We therefore postulate that, as a working hypothesis, proximity to socio-spatial contexts characterized by virtuous recycling behavior could positively influence those living in less virtuous contexts, thereby bringing about pro-social behavioral change. If this should be the case, we can conclude that conceptualizing an activity with a relevant social and cultural characterization such as waste recycling as not entirely traceable to the domain of individual analysis, and in particular as highly sensitive to the domain of socio-spatial analysis, can considerably improve the understanding of waste recycling habits, and possibly, on a more general note, of pro-environmental behaviors (Bliz and Nadler 2014). Some traces of this approach can already be found in the work of Oskamp et al. (1991), in their study of residents of a city that had just began a curbside recycling program, and where 95 % of those who recycled reported that their friends and neighbors recycled too. Therefore, if people become aware that their neighbors are recycling, it is more likely that they will recycle too. To capture such factors, in this paper we consider socio-spatial effects at the province levels, that is, an intermediate level of spatial aggregation between single households and whole regions. In this regard, we find an interesting precedent in Brueckner (2003), who refers to “agents” (decision makers) as “jurisdictions” in the context of a public economics model. In particular, Brueckner (2003) develops two theoretical frameworks for strategic interaction that yield a reaction function as the equilibrium solution: one is referred to as a spillover model, and the other as the resource flow model. In our case, we consider the spillover model, where an agent i chooses the level of a decision variable, \(y_{i}\), but the values of the y variable chosen by other agents \(({y}_{{j}}\), where the j subscript refers to all agents other than i) affect her objective function as well. For example, one can think of a strategic framework where an agent has to decide whether to bother to recycle waste taking into account the behavior of other neighboring agents (see Anselin 2002a, b). In this paper, we use the differentiated waste collection rate as a proxy of pro-environmental behavior. In particular, we apply the spatial Markov Chains methodology to differentiated waste collection rates in order to obtain the probabilities of changes in pro-environmental attitudes, conditional on the level of pro-environmental attitudes of neighboring provinces (Schettini et al. 2011). This technique allows us to analyze how the level of pro-environmental behavior in a province can be explained by its geographical environment, and the extent to which such environment influences the relative position of provinces in the cross-section distribution of differentiated waste collection rates (Le Gallo 2004). In particular, in order to provide a more detailed view of the geographic dimension of the socio-spatial pattern of pro-environmental behaviors, the spatial Markov Chains approach allows us to pose a number of interesting questions concerning the spatial dimension of environmental pro-sociality. For example, is the probability of a province moving up or down the pro-sociality ranking related to the current, or past, dynamics of the ranking of its neighbors? And moreover, can we identify stable clusters as limit outcomes of the spatial Markov Chain? The identification of stable spatial clusters of homogeneous pro-social attitudes is relevant from a policy viewpoint, in that it allows us to discriminate provinces characterized by poor pro-environmental attitudes from highly pro-social ones. In particular, provinces with poor environmental pro-sociality as to differentiated waste recycling will call for substantially different policies than the highly pro-social ones. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces and reviews the methodology. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 illustrates the results of the spatial Markov Chains analysis. Section 5 concludes and offers some final remarks.",41

Mexico, in particular, ranked third in homicide count, after Brazil and Nigeria. Recent reviews of the deployment of federal troops to the northern Mexican border state of Tamaulipas after rising violence between rival drug gangs are usually linked to the “war on drugs” position adopted by Calderón’s administration (from December 2006 to December 2012): “With both its long coastline and border with Texas that allows access to US markets, Tamaulipas has been a prime drug-trafficking region for decades. It was ground zero to the wave of extreme drug-related violence that engulfed the country over the past 7 years, leaving about 100,000 people dead or missing.” Althaus (2014). Studies on the recent rise in Mexico’s violence have become increasingly more common with either city- or state-level evidence. Rodriguez-Oreggia and Flores (2012), for example, adopt a spatial analysis framework at the municipality level to explain annual homicide rates with a focus on states applying for intervention by federal forces.Footnote 1 Controlling for inequality, income, and youth unemployment, among other factors, Rodriguez-Oreggia and Flores (2012) find positive and statistically significant effects of federal intervention on crime. Pan et al. (2012) use spatial analysis from 2005 to 2009 and find that real per capita GDP growth for Mexican states depends positively on growth in neighboring states and negatively on crime in neighboring states. Liu et al. (2013) estimate annual panel fixed effects models of crime at the Mexican state level from 2001 to 2008 and find that higher wages increased federal police forces, and higher incarceration rates imply higher reduction in crime across Mexican states. An earlier paper by Albuquerque (2007) uses yearly panel data from 1985 to 2004 for 10 US-Mexico sister cities and concludes that homicide rates are fundamentally different. On the one hand, data show that US cities have positive coefficients on the aggregate homicide rate of all cities in the country except the city where the observation takes place. On the other hand, negative coefficients in homicide rates are found for Mexican cities. His interpretation is that homicides on the Mexican side of the border are being driven by organized crime, resulting in clustering and concentration of activities in one city. In this sense, when homicides rise in Mexican border cities, they tend to fall in other Mexican border cities. More broadly, Albuquerque (2007) finds that differences in homicide rates depend on differences in law enforcement institutions and population density. Using panel data methods, all of the above studies attempt to explain what determines crime in Mexico for either city or state level as units of analysis. An alternative research design is to examine the effects of crime on economic variables. In this sense, Cárdenas and Rozo (2008) and Detotto and Otranto (2010) estimate the effects of crime on economic growth for Colombia and Italy, respectively. Recent examples for Mexico include Benyishay and Pearlman (2014), who use surveys of microenterprises in Mexico, and find that the incidence of robbery is higher than fines and bribes (with a higher average loss). Their empirical estimates suggest strong evidence that higher robbery rates reduce the probability of microenterprises expanding their operations. Another study by Basu and Pearlman (2013) looks at migration effects of violence in Mexico. For the 32 Mexican states, Ashby and Ramos (2013) find a positive association between crime and Foreign Direct Investment in “mining and oil extraction,” but no association in the manufacturing sector. Hernández-Bautista and Venegas-Martinez (2014), analyzing the period of the war on drugs and employing a VAR model, note that despite that security expenditure to fight against crime and economic growth is positive correlated, no casual relation between the two variables exists. Fullerton and Walke (2014) examine the six largest metropolitan economies along the US border and show that local retail activity is affected negatively by drug-related homicides. In this set of studies, the direction of causality goes from crime to economic indicators. This study examines the effects of the rise in drug violence in Mexico on a key indicator of economic growth: labor productivity. Defined as GDP per worker at the state level, labor productivity is important for several reasons ranging from its economic content to measurement. First, it is a simple way to link the number of goods and services produced relative to quantifiable variables from the labor market (either number of employees or hours worked). The higher its number, the more goods and services are produced per employee or per hour worked. Second, labor productivity can be given a pro-cyclical interpretation with business cycles, since it is linked to the concept of “labor hoarding,” which was recently reviewed by Biddle (2014) as the profit-maximizing response by firms to costs of hiring, firing, and training workers. Third, the alternative variable of total factor productivity (TFP) links goods and services to both capital and labor markets, which is relatively straightforward to calculate at the national level (under certain assumptions of capital depreciation), but faces data limitations at the sub-national level due to measurement of the capital stock.Footnote 2
 This study adopts a variant of the methodological framework in Mollick and Cabral (2015), who estimate Mexico’s real wage convergence across its 32 national entities for the post-NAFTA years from 1997 to 2006. They use years of schooling as the basic fundamental characteristic of wages in previous Mincer-type approaches for Mexican wages, such as Hanson (2003) and Chiquiar (2008). They also use an alternative specification in which labor productivity is assumed to determine wages in an attempt to quantify the dynamics of wage changes. Mollick and Cabral (2015) allow for state-level forcing variables (FDI inflows as well as domestic and international migration flows), which endogenously impact the speed of adjustment in labor markets across regions. Among other results, they report that overall migration flows have greater effects on wages than FDI inflows. In contrast to Mollick and Cabral (2015), this paper adopts an economic growth perspective, focusing mainly on the evolution of labor productivity. Labor productivity across Mexican states is assumed to depend on real wages and several shift factors, including alternative measures of drug-related crimes. It is worth mentioning that the empirical methodology implemented below under System Generalized Methods of Moments (SGMM) addresses the endogeneity between labor productivity and wages. This methodology is implemented given the vast literature on major economies on the “labor productivity puzzle,” which can be described as the extent to which labor productivity deviates from wages. For the USA, for example, refer to Anderson and Kliesen (2006), Anderson (2007), and Feldstein (2008) and, for the UK, see Pessoa and Van Reenen (2013), and Blundell et al. (2013). For a recent overview, see Boudreaux and Palagashvili (2014). For firm-level evidence, Lazear (2000) documents that changes in the pay system, from hourly wages to piece-rate pay, have a significant effect on output per worker. The aim of this paper is not, however, to detect the cause of the puzzle (new technologies, fall in the capital/labor ratio due to higher costs of capital, etc.). Rather, it acknowledges that the puzzle exists and attempts to manage the bidirectional nature between labor productivity and wages when estimating the impact of crime on labor productivity. To quote one of the aforementioned papers on this methodological point, “We cannot tell whether productivity is driving wages, or vice versa, but understanding why wages have fallen within jobs is at the heart of the UK’s productivity puzzle.” Pessoa and Van Reenen (2013, Abstract). Some studies have looked at GDP per capita across all Mexican states. Arellano and Fullerton (2005) quantify linkages between GDP per capita and education levels, while Molina et al. (2010) verify the linkages between FDI and GDP per capita. More recently, González-Andrade (2014) estimates GDP per capita for all Mexican states, including the Federal District, from 2003 to 2010 at the annual frequency using fixed effects models. Two empirical models combine state-level economic variables (FDI, civilian labor force with access to health services, years of education, unemployment, and fiscal transfers) with crime variables (either aggregate or disaggregated by type, such as theft, kidnaping, and rape levels). The results reported by González-Andrade (2014) appear to be very sensitive to the fixed effects specification: more meaningful coefficients are found when time-fixed effects are included. This is in opposition to the results becoming much weaker when state-level fixed effects are included. The significant degree of serial correlation casts doubt, however, on these panel data models for the GDP per capita of Mexican states. In addition to fixed effects models (FEMs), this paper also adopts a different methodology (SGMM) exploiting the bidirectional nature between labor productivity and wages and controlling for productivity persistence and higher frequency of data (quarterly) in a completely different dataset. Our sample includes all 32 Mexican sub-national entities from 2003 to 2013. Using FEM, our results indicate that total crime, as well as some crime variables prosecuted by state and local authorities, has a negative and statistically significant effect on labor productivity once President Calderón started a direct war against drug cartels in 2007. However, the interaction between the “war on drugs” dummy variable and the different measures of crime results is almost always positive and statistically significant. It is conjectured that these rather unexpected results arise from the endogenous relation that exists in some of the right-hand-side variables and the inability of FEM to properly capture productivity and crime dynamics. Meanwhile, for (endogenous) wages and labor productivity using SGMM, our main results suggest the following. First, the interaction between crime variables and the “war on drugs” dummy variable indicates that total crime has a negative and statistically significant effect on labor productivity after President Calderón started the war against drug cartels. Second, contrary to crimes prosecuted by federal authorities which have no impact on labor productivity, most of crimes prosecuted by local/state authorities are negative and statistically significant having a clear negative effect on labor productivity. A possible explanation for such difference could be related to the different response of local/state authorities and federal authorities once violence arouse during Calderón’s administration. The negative effects of crimes prosecuted by local/state authorities could reflect the weaknesses of local/state authorities (i.e., municipal or state police) since they were not strong enough to prosecute crime. Presumably, federal authorities are less corrupt and might have been more effective in combating crime than local or state authorities. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and shows two political maps of Mexico, illustrating the sub-national entities (31 states plus the Federal District) according to the total drug-related crimes for the periods analyzed in this paper. Section 3 introduces the methodology. Section 4 discusses the results of the empirical models of Mexican labor productivity with subsamples estimations. Finally, Sect. 5 provides concluding remarks.",18

From the postwar high-growth period to the mid-1980s, advantages of production costs such as low labor and location costs were factors that significantly affected regional economy competitiveness. The economic cycle in Japan was positively influenced by regions that could offer low factor prices and thus industry agglomeration. The industrial agglomeration provided each region a comparative advantage and contributed to their economic growth. However, the globalization of economic activities since the mid-1990s has exposed Japanese companies to fierce global competition. A growing number of production bases, particularly in the manufacturing sector, have relocated to Southeast Asia and China. The relocation of the manufacturing sector caused increasing hollowing out of various regional industries in Japan. Moreover, Japan faces a declining and aging population problem. Under such negative environment conditions, improved productivity is a necessary condition if Japan is to boost continuous growth in its regional economies. For example, Porter (1990) and Krugman (1991) noted the importance of innovation for sustainable growth because innovation fosters regional ability to provide goods and services that can withstand global competition. That is, innovation is more important than traditional competitiveness arising from comparative advantage. Particularly, the new type of competitiveness in regional economies is determined by a production environment that supports innovation by promoting inter-company competition and cooperation. These positive aspects of the production environment spur competitive advantages. However, competitive advantages are necessary but not sufficient conditions for regional growth. In addition to holding competitive advantages, it is important to fully utilize them to realize regional economic growth. Therefore, improvements in productivity are critical. Previous studies on regional economic productivity consider trends in labor productivity (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1995) because labor productivity is simple to calculate and useful for economic growth analysis under some conditions. Labor productivity is measured by production per unit of labor and is commonly known as “factor productivity.” If the composition of inputs is approximately the same among different economic entities, labor productivity can be used as a useful measure to compare overall productivity between those entities. Alternatively, if the technology used in different economic entities or at varying periods is assumed to be the same, this indicator is an effective measure of productivity. Practically, however, industrial structures and input composition differ by region and period. For example, regions with capital-intensive industries that adopt technologies requiring substantial capital expenditure tend to obtain a higher level of labor productivity. In such cases, even if labor productivity is higher than average, it is difficult to discern whether it is a result of efficient labor or simply a high capital expenditure rate. Therefore, measuring productivity using various production factors, labor, and capital is important to examine overall economic productivity. This explains why total factor productivity (TFP) is a preferable measure to factor productivity similar to the labor productivity used in many previous studies. This study has two primary objectives: First, this study measures TFP using Japan’s prefectural data. Previous studies that measure TFP focus on national-level data, and few attempts on TFP analysis have applied regional data. Therefore, this study contributes to the TFP research on Japanese regions. Second, by performing statistical convergence testing, this study clarifies whether TFP growth in Japan converged by reducing regional disparities and, if so, whether the convergence proceeded on a national or regional level. Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) recognized regional disparity in labor productivity in Japan from cross-sectional analysis. Kawagoe (1999) and Togo’s (2002) results based on time series analyses are critical to the discussion. Particularly, Togo’s (2002) analysis that examined time trends in regional disparities of labor productivity for the period 1985–1997 does not account for the existence of productivity convergence. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to provide additional evidence to supplement the discussions of previous studies. This study is organized as follows: Sect. 2 measures TFP using regional-level data in Japan. We estimate Japan’s nationwide TFP by aggregating regional-level TFP and analyzing regional productivity variation to clarify whether TFP growth converged among regions. Section 3 presents a novel stochastic convergence model that focuses on convergence in regional disparity of TFP. Section 3 presents a statistical analysis on TFP convergence using panel data. Section 4 concludes the paper.",13

For policy makers, the knowledge on this process is an interesting issue for several reasons. First, it may allow them to adopt the required decisions in order to initiate a process of structural transformation, to enable a specific productive structure that may foster economic growth. Second, and as it has been demonstrated in the last economic crisis beginning at the end of 2007, diversification into new products may compensate in part the harmful effects on employment arising from those economies activities that face a severe decline. Economic theory has provided some insights on how countries diversify into new economic activities over time. Specifically, one of the most recent contributions is the work in the field of evolutionary economic geography, where a renewed interest over the last couple of decades has taken place, in the explanation of the emergence of new industries as a process of regional branching, in which industry relatedness encourages knowledge and capabilities transfers from preexisting economic activities to emerging industries within regional borders (Frenken and Boschma 2007; Boschma and Frenken 2012; Neffke et al. 2011). Thus, product or industry diversification is understood as a process through which new economic activities develop out of existing ones, as far as new and existing activities are technologically related and capabilities transfer can take place. It is also argued that these capabilities can be transferred through different knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as labor mobility, social networking, entrepreneurial spin-offs and the diversification of firms (see Boschma and Frenken 2012). Several case studies have provided examples of new local industries being developed in part from related activities in a region. Some of these case studies include the work by Bathelt and Boggs (2003), where the development of the media industry in Leipzig (Germany) is analyzed, the work by Glaeser (2005), where the author study the structural economic transformation of the city of Boston after several crises, the work by Klepper (2007) which analyze the development of the automobile industry in Detroit during the first half of the twentieth century, and the work by Boschma and Wenting (2007), which describe and explain the spatial early evolution of the British automobile industry. More recently, Bathelt et al. (2013) analyzed the strong influence of traditional manufacturing industries, in the structure of innovation processes and their development over time in the so-called Technology Triangle of Canada. More systematic evidence on the process of diversification into industries that are closely related to the existing economic activity within countries can be found in the papers by Hidalgo et al. (2007), Hausmann and Klinger (2007) and Boschma and Capone (2014). Hidalgo et al. (2007), using international trade data (four-digit level, SITC-4) from the project by Feenstra et al. (2005), found that countries develop comparative advantage preferentially in nearby products. Their conclusions are obtained basically, through the visual inspection and comparison of the so-called density measure between transition products and undeveloped products, and the calculated conditional probabilities of transitioning into new products. Hausmann and Klinger (2007), using the same dataset for the period 1975–2000, estimate several models and conclude that the current industrial structure of a country is an important determinant of product diversification and that countries tend to keep a comparative advantage in products that are strongly related to their current productive structure. Using a similar methodology, Boschma and Capone (2014) investigate the process of industrial diversification in the EU-27 and European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) countries in the period 1995–2010, by means of international trade data from the BACI database. The authors find robust evidence that countries tend to diversify into nearby products, being this effect larger in ENP countries than in the EU-27. At the regional level, there are also several papers that have investigated the issue. Among others, Neffke et al. (2011) investigated the economic evolution of 70 Swedish regions from 1962 to 2002 by means of detailed plant-level data. Using the indicator of technological relatedness between manufacturing industries developed by Neffke and Henning (2008), the authors show that those industries that were technological related to the current industries in a region had a higher probability of entering the region than unrelated industries. Moreover, the authors found that an existing industry had a higher probability of exiting a region when that industry was not technologically related to the current industries in that region. Boschma et al. (2012) analyzed the process of industry diversification at the regional level (NUTS3 level) in Spain during the period 1988–2007. They obtained at least two interesting results. First, Spanish regions diversified into new products that were closely related to their current industrial structure. Second, the new industries that emerged during the sample period were not only related to the current productive structure at the regional scale, but also to the national scale. However, the authors found that the regional scale is more important in the process of industry diversification by technological relatedness than the national scale. Rigby (2015), after defining the knowledge cores of US cities, shows that technological diversification in those cities positively depends upon the proximity between the set of existing specializations and new technological possibilities, and upon the available knowledge from other locations. The author measures proximity or knowledge relatedness using patent data for the period 1975–2005. Essletzbichler (2015) examine the effect of technological relatedness on the entry and exit of new industries in 360 US metropolitan areas over the period 1977–1997. To measure technological relatedness, the author calculates an indicator using input–output flows between 362 US manufacturing sectors and finds that those industries that are more closely related to the current metropolitan industry portfolio have a higher probability of entry, while the exit probability increases for those industries with a lower level of technological relatedness. Boschma and Capone (2014) analyze the effect of scientific relatedness on knowledge dynamic in biotech science at the city level worldwide along the period 1989–2008. By means of co-occurrence of pairs of topics in journal articles, the authors measure relatedness between scientific topics in biotech. They found robust evidence that the development of new scientific topics within cities is positively related to the degree of relatedness to the existing scientific portfolio of the cities. More recently, Boschma et al. (2015) investigate the relationship between relatedness and technological change at the US city level during the period 1981–2010 by means of patent data. The authors show that technological relatedness plays a crucial role in the process of technological change at the city level. Against this background, in this paper we analyze the relationship between current industrial structure and the development of new industries in 49 US states over the period 2002–2012,Footnote 1 on the basis of international trade data. In the analysis, the sample period is divided in two 5-year intervals, 2002–2007 and 2007–2012. Although the economic situation was clearly different in both sub-periods, as a consequence of the international financial crisis, our econometric specification includes different year fixed effects to control for such difference. To measure current industrial structure or available capabilities in a particular state around a particular product, we use the density measure developed by Hausmann and Klinger (2007). This density measure is constructed on the basis of the proximity index proposed by Hidalgo et al. (2007). While there exist previous works on the USA at the regional level (metropolitan areas, cities), up to date, and to the best of our knowledge, the issue has not been investigated at the state level. Not denying the heterogeneity in the size of the US states, where some of them have a similar and even greater size than several countries, we believe that the mechanisms through which knowledge flows and capabilities transfers take place may operate within states. US states are constituent political entities which share their sovereignty with the US Federal Government, and where several tasks like public education, transportation, infrastructures and law enforcements (among others) are considered state responsibilities, although these have significant federal funding and regulation. State policy makers can design and implement several economic development policies in order to promote the processes through which new industries evolve from existing ones. At this point, states have greater power and resources as compared to cities, which allow them to engage in various types of economic development initiatives.Footnote 2
 Methodologically, our paper is closely related to the work of by Hausmann and Klinger (2007) and Boschma et al. (2012). The paper builds on and complements the previous empirical literature as follows. First, it attempts to empirically corroborate previous findings of the important role of preexisting economic activities on product diversification through industries relatedness, extending the analysis from the country level to the regional level as in Boschma et al. (2012). The analysis at the regional level is interesting since, on the one hand, we would expect that capabilities are more easily transferred within regions than within countries. On the other hand, we can control for all those country-specific characteristics, which are common to all states and may influence the process of product diversification, such us several institutions or industry-specific economic policies to name a few. Second, and following the work by Boschma et al. (2012), we also analyze the effect of available capabilities at the national level on the development of new industries at the regional level, which allow us to investigate whether the positive effect found by the authors holds in the US case. Thus, we aim to study whether the mechanisms through which capabilities are transferred from existing to new industries operate not only within states, but also across the whole national territory. Third, we explore how product relatedness interacts with several state-specific economic variables, including those variables that contribute to the transfer of knowledge and capabilities within states (i.e., human capital, income, high-technology level, labor flows and cluster strength). While we are aware that some capabilities are only relevant for specific products or industries, there are also more general capabilities that are state specific and favor the process through which new products or industries evolve from existing ones. Fourth, we also investigate the effect of product relatedness on the development of new industries or products depending upon its initial level of development. We expect that industries with different degrees of development benefit in a different manner from the available capabilities from preexisting economic activities. The paper is organized as follows. The second section presents the data used in the analysis and the applied methodology to calculate product relatedness and the measure of current industrial structure. The third section describes the results from the regression analysis. The fourth section concludes.",8
56.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,18 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-016-0750-0,The role of spatial scale in regional convergence: the effect of MAUP in the estimation of \(\beta \)-convergence equations,March 2016,Alberto Díaz Dapena,Esteban Fernández Vázquez,Fernando Rubiera Morollón,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The study of convergence in GDP per capita, or similar variables, among territories has been one of the central issues in the literature on economic growth and regional economics. This interest is logical from the point of view of the design of economic policy as well as in the arena of economic theory discussion, because it is fundamental to find empirical evidence about where and under what conditions it is possible to observe processes of economic convergence or divergence. For example, identifying patterns of divergence or very slow convergence among European territories would provide the empirical evidence to support active and expensive territorial cohesion policies, such as the European Union Cohesion Policy, which is now the most expensive policy in the EU budget. From an academic point of view, the measurement of convergence processes in different scenarios implies finding an empirical evidence for the hypothesis of decreasing returns while divergence means the rejection of this hypothesis giving evidence in line with endogenous growth models or the framework of urban and regional economics. There are different ways of studying convergence among territories, but the so-called \(\sigma \) and, especially, \(\beta \)-convergence are the approaches most commonly applied. \(\sigma \)-Convergence is perhaps the simplest approach. It basically quantifies the dispersion of income per capita or a similar variable in different moments along time: if the standard deviation of the variable of interest decreases along time, this is considered as an indication of convergence. This kind of analysis is usually conducted as an exploratory or preliminary analysis in the study of convergence. The seminal paper of Baumol (1986) introduced the concept of \(\beta \)-convergence: the relation between the growth rate of a particular economic variable during a period of time with the initial level of that variable in a set of territories—countries or regions. The literature on the econometrics for estimating \(\beta \)-convergence has been growing in the last few years. Islam (2003) or Magrini (2004) present surveys of this literature classifying the studies of \(\beta \)-convergence into different types of approaches: (1) panel data, (2) time series, (3) club convergence and (4) spatial dependence. In general, the literature on \(\beta \)-convergence does not pay much attention to the level of spatial disaggregation on which the data are observable. This could be partially explained by a practical reason: the lack of information at a detailed spatial scale for many economies. For instance, in the case of European countries information on value added or income is normally available only at the scale of NUTS-2 or NUTS-3 administrative regions, which are constructed as the aggregation of a range of smaller areas of different characteristics. Additionally, a more theoretical reason justified that the role of the spatial scale of the data was neglected: the neoclassical framework on which the initial models were built on did not consider this issue as important. Oppositely, alternative approaches for modelling economic growth explicitly consider the role played by variables at a local level, where agglomeration economies and other centripetal forces have an effect at a sub-regional level. As a consequence, the aggregation of spatially disaggregated data into larger regions could cast some doubts on the empirical evidence found in convergence studies based on spatially aggregated data if regions are characterized by a high degree of sub-regional heterogeneity. This paper studies the consequences of aggregation of spatial data in convergence analysis. More specifically, we aim at quantifying the effect of neglecting small-scale processes derived from estimating \(\beta \)-convergence equations based on spatially aggregated data. Our research bases on previous studies that have already called the attention to the effect of the aggregation, like in the work by Theil (1954) for the general case on linear regression models or, more recently, by Arbia and Petrarca (2011) for the case of spatially dependent data. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on economic growth, particularly on how the spatial scale plays a role on this literature.

One of such mismatches is the phenomenon of overeducation denoting a situation in which workers’ schooling levels are not necessary for carrying out their jobs. Education–job mismatches have negative consequences for individuals and firms since they lead to lower income levels, higher dissatisfaction, lower productivity and higher turnover. Understanding the determinants of skills underutilisation is, therefore, important for enhancing human capital investment, bringing better competencies into the labour market and increasing living standards. Italy is one of the industrialised countries with the lowest percentage of graduates.Footnote 1 Nevertheless, in 2014, 18.2 % of graduates declared that their schooling level was not required for their job. Such percentage was 36.9 % for people with a secondary degree. These figures show the presence of the paradoxical phenomenon called “overeducation” in a country that relatively under-invests in high education. The Italian labour market is also characterised by strong differences in the distribution and in the quality of jobs over the territory. In 2014, the unemployment rate was 5.8 in the North, 7.6 in the Centre and 13.6 in the South. In this context of strong spatial imbalances and strong differences in the productive structure across the territory, inter-regional mobility might play a relevant role for overcoming the mismatch between the demand and supply of skills. Recently few studies have investigated this issue finding different results. Croce and Ghignoni (2015) show that for workers holding an upper-secondary degree the risk of overeducation decreases with commuting time, while among the university graduates migration reduces overeducation. This second result is questioned by Devillanova (2013), showing that when the characteristics of the job (or the endogeneity of migration) are controlled for, migration displays no effect (or a positive effect) on overeducation. Finally, Iammarino and Marinelli (2015) find that migration reduces overeducation when directed to the Northern regions of Italy where the most dynamic economic and innovation systems are located. All these studies neglect the possible role of labour market entry channels in affecting migration decisions and overeducation. In Italy, workers find a job mainly through the informal channel (family and friends referrals).Footnote 2 While, in principle, social ties can be an effective mechanism to overcome information asymmetries, thus allowing for a better matching between employers and employees, most empirical studies on Italian data have found that the use of the personal channel is associated with lower wages (Pistaferri 1999; Pellizzari 2004; Labini 2004; Meliciani and Radicchia 2011) and a higher probability of overeducation (Meliciani and Radicchia 2011). However, these studies have neglected the possible indirect effects of the informal recruitment channel on education–job mismatches through their likely impact on spatial flexibility. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by linking the choice of the recruitment channel to migration decisions and to the phenomenon of overeducation. In particular, we estimate probit models with self-selection using ISFOL survey data providing information on labour market entry channels, job-related migration and a “subjective” measure of overeducation. Our main hypothesis is that the use of family and friends referrals limits the extent of job search to the local labour market, thus reducing spatial flexibility and increasing the risk of education–job mismatches. The existence of such an effect would have important consequences on the design of effective policies devoted to reduce skills imbalances, suggesting that this outcome may be achieved not only by improving vocational education and training systems but also by better organising employment services with the purpose of enhancing mobility. The remaining of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses two stands of literature that have not communicated so far, i.e. that on spatial mobility and overeducation and that on recruitment channels and job mismatches, and introduces our main research hypotheses. Section 3 discusses the data and methodology. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical analysis. Finally, Sect. 5 draws the main conclusions and policy implications.",11

The New York Metropolitan Highway Loop, with a radius of 20 km, is considered the world’s first beltway, opening in 1944 to ease traffic congestion in Manhattan and relocate activities to the suburbs (Gutiérrez and Gómez 1999). Approximately 100 beltways (complete or partial) have been constructed in the USA since the 1950s (Sutton 1999), and many metropolitan areas in the world have orbital motorways, including Paris, London, and Madrid in Europe, and Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Beijing in Asia. Although beltways were originally intended to divert inter-urban traffic away from congested, central city areas, they have increasingly become integral parts of the intra-metropolitan highway system (Giuliano 2004). They provide high-capacity orbital traffic routes in many major cities, improving the accessibility of suburban municipalities, which, subsequently, increases the market value of these locations and encourages further suburbanization and decentralization (Martin et al. 2010). Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is no exception, having constructed a new suburban beltway in 2007. The Seoul beltway is a 127.6-km-long highway that encircles the central city of the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) and passes through suburban satellite cities (inner-ring zones), including many “bedroom” towns such as Ilsan, Pyeongchon, Jungdong, Bundang, Pangyo, and Sanbon (see Figs. 1, 2). The beltway began construction in 1988 and was fully completed when its final Uijeongbu–Songchu segment was opened to traffic on December 2007 (http://www.seoulbeltway.co.kr/main/index.asp). The 90.8-km southern section, opened on November 1999, traverses populated southern suburbs, improving accessibility of five new towns and satellite cities, and to seven other highways such as the Seoul–Pusan Highway and the Inchon International Airport, while the 36.8-km northern segments, opened on 2007, pass through relatively less populated northern rural and mountainous areas. Highways and beltway in Seoul Land development in 2003 along the beltway before the project completion Figure 3 shows public transit system along the beltway. Due to the massive investment in public transit, Seoul’s transit system is one of the most extensive and heavily used system in the world. As shown in the map, the bus stops are almost ubiquitous in the urbanized area and the subway system is highly concentrated in the central city with a few suburban extensions. As a suburban ring road, the beltway passes areas with a relatively poor accessibility to the subway system. In particular, the northern section of the beltway traverses municipalities with a lower accessibility to both bus and subway systems than other segments of the beltway. Bus and subway systems along the beltway Investments in beltways have long been controversial among scholars, planners, and policy makers. In a broader context, numerous studies have investigated consequences of highway construction, including interstate highways, urban radial highways, and beltways, on population and economic growth, trade, and decentralization. Abound empirical evidences were found in the existing literature: radial highways decentralize service sector activity, while ring roads decentralize both industrial and service activity in Chinese cities (Baum-Snow et al. 2015); one new highway passing through a central city reduces its population by about 18 % in the USA (Baum-Snow 2007); a 10 % increase in a city’s stock of highways causes about a 1.5 % increase in its employment in the US cities between 1983 and 2003 (Duranton and Turner 2012); highways contribute to the level of economic activity in the counties that they pass directly through, but draw activity away from adjacent counties (Chandra and Thompson 2000); and many rural counties connected to the interstate highway system experienced an increase in trucking and retail sales by 7–10 % points per capita and in the relative demand for skilled manufacturing workers (Michaels 2008). Emphasizing on intra-metropolitan consequences of beltways, numerous studies have investigated the beltways’ effect on core city decline and suburban expansion, and on land use and development patterns. Proponents of smart growth argue that beltway investments are a primary factor in causing low-density, auto-oriented urban sprawl by increasing accessibility, land prices, and intensity of development in the suburbs along the beltway. However, others insist that the connection between beltway investment and urban sprawl is uncertain and obscure, and other factors (e.g., housing market components) are more important causes of sprawl (see Handy 2005, for an explanation of this controversy). This study aims to explore the debate on the effects that a suburban beltway has on residential development and housing prices using a new methodological approach, focusing on Seoul’s beltway as a case study. Unlike the existing studies, this study uses a random utility-based urban land use simulation model, called the Seoul residential location model (SRLM), and assesses the effects of Seoul’s beltway on housing location choices and housing rents by comparing the simulation model results both before (baseline scenario) and after (beltway scenario) the beltway’s introduction. This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, a literature review is provided, elucidating how the current research is distinct from previous studies. In the second section, the effects of the beltway on travel time savings and accessibility are outlined. In the third, the procedures used in the construction of empirical model and parameter calibration for the SRLM are detailed. In the fourth section, we provide estimates for the effects of Seoul’s beltway on the housing market, in terms of housing units supplied and monthly rent by housing type. The paper ends with our conclusions and a discussion of the policy implications that may arise from this analysis.",4

It is evident that economic success finances quality, and that such quality proves attractive to external activities and populations, thus boosting growth and development. Moreover, when territorial efficiency is understood in modern and advanced terms as resource-efficiency—primarily efficiency in the use of land, natural resources and energy, but also of human capital—territorial efficiency policies simultaneously pursue objectives of sustainability and innovation/competitiveness.Footnote 1
 But the two objectives of efficiency and urban quality, as well as that of strengthening territorial identity, entail public investments in infrastructure, modernization, maintenance and management. These are costly investments that must be made with continuity, and, in the case of many countries strongly hit by the crisis, reactivated. There is a widespread impression in Italy that for the past 20 years there has been severe underinvestment in cities (Calafati 2009), an underinvestment which has worsened in the last decade, well before the blowing up of the crisis (Cogno and Piazza 2013). Since 2004 and up to 2012 capital account expenditure by local administrations (from regional to municipal) as a share of GDP decreased by 34 %, while that by larger municipalities alone fell, in absolute terms, by 63 % (Camagni 2014). Today the main problem to be addressed is that of finding the necessary financial resources at a time of profound crisis of public, national and local finances. The argument that I put forward in this paper is that this is possible to a large extent through a rebalancing of the surplus values of urban transformation between the public and private sectors in favour of the public one, which has been heavily penalized in numerous European countries, not only those of South Europe, and in many developing countries. Cities—the large and medium-large ones with their international projection and their resources of knowledge and creativity, and those of smaller size with their cultural, relational and environmental resources—assured, at least until the onset of the 2008 global crisis, the high, if not extremely high, remunerativity of urban transformation processes in the form of rents, capital gains and profits for potential entrepreneurs-developers. A more balanced distribution of these value surpluses is not only possible but also highly desirable. This redistribution is a concern for territorial research in many countries, as well as a number of large international agencies and important research centres. This paper addresses five interlinked theoretical and practical issues. In Sect. 2, the taxation issue of land rents coming from urban transformation is presented, leading to a win-win situation: it allows to finance new infrastructure and public goods which cumulatively relaunch public well-being, competitiveness and consequently profits and urban rents. Section 3 deals with the problem of financing cities, illustrating different fiscal exactions that are widely utilized in advanced and emerging countries and which imply a burden on land rent. Sections 4 and 5 present the legal and economic justifications for a taxation of rents deriving from urban development and transformation and Sect. 6 a tentative comparative assessment of the relevance and incidence of land rent taxation in some European countries.",11

Footnote 2That the US is a nation of immigrants is widely acknowledged—often as a steady, low-level flow but at other moments the influx has been torrential. Particularly noteworthy is the flood of Southern and Eastern Europeans from the 1880s thru the 1920s, and a second wave of Asians and Latin Americans after 1960 (Martin and Midgley 2006: 8–11). Also important is the Great Migration of the 1920s/30s wherein African Americans from the US South moved to the American Manufacturing Belt. One result was the creation of distinctly ethnic/racial neighborhoods, or enclaves. Accordingly, cities typically had colloquially named districts such as a Little Italy, Germantown or Greektown; neighborhoods associated with an ethnic cluster such as the Lower East Side in New York for Jews, South Boston for Irish or Harlem for African Americans; and some such names carry on today even though they no longer describe the area’s population—e.g., German Village in Columbus, Germantown in Philadelphia and the many China Towns. Racial/ethnic enclaves reflected discriminatory practices by the majority, white population, but they also served a substantial role in acculturating immigrants to American society, and blacks to life in northern, industrial cities. One obvious point of acculturation was learning English, and if one didn’t, still being able to converse, exchange, make a livelihood, and the like (e.g., the author’s grandparents). More broadly, Iskander et al. (2012: 57) note Ethnic enclaves ...  are defined by the spatial concentration of immigrant-owned firms that primarily employ coethnic workers. [This] ...  supports the emergence of new firms; business partnerships; and ...  often ‘ethnic,’ products and services. The economic vibrancy associated with ethnic enclaves is attributed to the social networks that run through them. [These] ...  act as institutions that structure economic behavior and social interactions ...  [which] govern repeated, continual, and evolving economic exchanges. ...  [Regarding] occupational mobility, social networks within enclaves also foster learning and the development of entrepreneurial initiatives. They provide workers with ambitions to set up businesses with entrepreneurial ‘know-how,’ informal lines of credit, contacts, and even access to markets, and thus they also support the economic advancement that entrepreneurship often implies. Over time, of course, immigrants learn English, gain job skills, realize success as employees or entrepreneurs, feel more comfortable in the majority society and seek residence outside the original enclave in better housing and neighborhoods—albeit often with households of similar background, thus recreating the enclave in some form. Hence, citing personal experience, the Eastern European Jewish enclave of Erie Pennsylvania (complete with a kosher butcher shop, bakery, synagogue and horse-drawn wagons that traversed the city to collect scraps of fabric, metal and whatever else was saleable) began at the dawn of the twentieth century; children of these immigrants and younger immigrants themselves moved to more recently built, less crowded parts of the city in the 1930s/40s (e.g. to Glenwood Hills, a 1940s development), and the enclave itself sustained until the 1960s. A similar pattern pertains to more recent immigrants such as the Cubans in Miami (Boswell 1993). Logan et al. (2002: 300) note, for example, even in the Miami region, where a vibrant Cuban enclave economy is highly concentrated in Hialeah and in the Little Havana section of Miami, immigrant businessmen, professionals, and better-paid employees have abandoned their original settlement areas and moved toward more affluent suburbs. In this second wave process of moving from the original enclave, while retaining some grouping (i.e., dispersed settlement but within a single portion(s) of the city), neighborhoods often became characterized along racial/ethnic lines; for example, Shaker Heights in Cleveland, Skokie in Chicago and Bexley in Columbus were/are associated with Jews; Dublin in Columbus with upper-middle class Asians; Prince George’s County Maryland (Washington, DC) with African Americans. And as racial/ethnic waves pass so does representation of the community—e.g., Shaker Heights became linked with African Americans. Interestingly, this may occur even if the racial/ethnic group is not a majority, perhaps because of their difference.Footnote 3 These transitions are captured through the shifting identity of Olney in North Philadelphia which was known as Jewish through the 1970s, but has since been home to immigrants and refugees from various countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Haiti, and India, but has become identified with Koreans because of its many Korean churches, businesses, and organizations ...  more recently [it has] attracted Dominicans and Puerto Ricans as Koreans have increasingly moved into the adjacent Montgomery County suburb of Cheltenham. (Singer et al. 2008: 17) Another, more recent phenomenon is immigrants settling directly into suburban neighborhoods. Singer et al. (2008) suggest that, just as earlier ethnic enclaves were near jobs in the Fordist city, which tended to be located at the center of the metropolitan area, under the new economy, post-Fordist regime jobs are in the suburbs. Hence, they note for Atlanta (p. 12) that high immigrant populations are found in Chamblee and Doraville (northeast of the MSA’s center, astride I-85 and the I-285 Outerbelt), particularly Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Latin Americans, and say that “by 1990, the Chamblee–Doraville Area had become one of the most ethnically diverse in the Southeastern USA.” Similarly for Sacramento they note “A Little Saigon,” “Latino commercial strip,” and “Korean and Slavic entrepreneurial clusters,” all located at fringes of the city (p. 13). In a more conceptual vein, Logan et al. (2002) examine the fifteen largest immigrant groups in New York and Los Angeles, with the intent of compar[ing] central city and suburban patterns ...  [to] evaluate how suburbanization influences ethnic neighborhood formation [and resiliency] (p. 303), ultimately concluding that [Our] findings provide much support for the immigrant enclave hypothesis but also show that it cannot stand alone as a model for the spatial incorporation of new groups in the metropolis ...  living in an ethnic neighborhood [may] mean living in a higher income area ...  Thus, the depressed central-city enclave is not the only form of immigrant settlement, and it is time to develop alternative models ...  the ethnic community model provides a useful [alternative]. (pp. 319–320, italics added) Similarly, Li (2009) conceptualizes such occurrences as ethnoburbs, focusing especially on those that are Chinese in orientation; Skop (2012) speaks of Saffron Suburbs as do Trinh Vo and Yu Danico (2004) regarding Koreatown and Little Saigon in Orange County California. In Li’s words Ethnoburbs are suburban ethnic clusters of residential and business districts ...  multiracial/multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual, and often multinational communities in which one ethnic minority group has a significant concentration, but ...  not necessarily ...  the majority. Ethnoburbs are likely to be created through some form of deliberate efforts of [the dominant] group ...  [thus] replicat[ing] some features of the ethnic enclave and some features of a suburb ...  an alternative type of ethnic settlement ...  [that] coexist[s] along with traditional ethnic ghettos and inner-city enclaves.

In the neoclassical framework, such regional inequalities are typically explained by real factors like differences in resource endowment, demographic characteristics, factor productivity, technological progress, industrial specialization, market conditions, etc. Keynesian theory, on the contrary, recognizes the banking system and regional financial flows as relevant to the analysis of regional disparities. Neoclassical theory does acknowledge the link between financial development and growth. Financial development is strongly linked with the rate of capital accumulation and the rate of improvement in economic efficiency. This link suggests that the level of financial development is a critical part of the growth process (King and Levine 1993), in the sense that economic growth creates demand for funds by influencing the rate of return on investment and saving rates (Levine 1997). The assumptions of perfect information and competition as well as money neutrality imply that financial funds flow toward the highest rates of return regardless of their location. This view overlooks the possibility of regional impediments to such flows and thus any differential effect that availability of finance capital and financial structure may exert on the level of development in a particular region. Moreover, according to this point of view, it does not make any difference, for regional growth, whether the financing comes from banks (credit) or capital markets (funds). Thus, direct and indirect finance, and consequently, capital markets and the banking system are one and the same. Bank-based and market-based financial systems both foster economic growth (Levine 1997). Any growth differential across regions can only be due to differences in the demand for funds, so the geography of financial intermediation is irrelevant to the analysis of regional disparities. Keynesian theories, especially Post-Keynesian theory, however, place great emphasis on risk and uncertainty, imperfect and costly information, the non-neutrality of money, as well as dependency and cumulative causation. All these imply that persistent structural differences between regions of a country can exist. As Chick and Dow (1988) explain, such differences lead to different marginal efficiency of investment in different regions. A center-periphery-type specialization pattern may emerge whereby some regions specialize in industrial production and others in primary production. Such a pattern is doomed to perpetuate itself due to declining terms of trade for primary products leading to declining relative marginal efficiency of investment in the peripheral regions. Another implication of the structural differences is the occurrence of different stages of banking system development in different regions, especially in case of a decentralized banking system. In a centralized banking system, on the other hand, the financial center may act as a rentier and show little interest in investment projects for upgrading the production structure of the periphery. Moreover, as Dow and Rodriguez-Fuentes (1997) explain, patterns of credit creation may be different in different regions due to the interdependence of demand side and supply side factors. In other words, not only do changes in regional income lead to changes in regional credits and deposits but also changes in regional liquidity preference, due to higher/lower confidence, lead to changes in regional credit and consequently regional income. Even in a centralized banking system in which regional deposits do not constitute a constraint on regional credit, national banks can exhibit different liquidity preference for different regions, in effect practicing regional credit rationing. In particular, banks will be less willing to lend in regions where the perceived risk and uncertainty is high or its assessment is difficult. Similar considerations may be valid for local savers whereby they may be more interested in extra-regional assets as a result of their risk and uncertainty assessments. On the demand side, expectations on the regional level affect the willingness to borrow by local investors. The fact that expectations and risk assessments affect both the demand and the supply of credit makes it difficult to identify regional credit gaps. Thus from a Keynesian perspective, the nature and the level of development of the banking system as well as the geography of financial intermediation are imperative to the analysis of regional disparities. Once financial inequalities are acknowledged to be significant for regional development, the question of how to measure regional financial inequalities naturally follows. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) tools presented in Anselin (2005a, b) are essential to detecting and describing regional financial disparities and dependencies. Another facet of the question of measurement is the choice of the relevant financial variable. Most of the applied work that acknowledges financial variables as relevant to explaining regional income or growth differentials use of the volume of deposits or the volume of loans as a measure of access to finance or the availability of financial services. However, whenever the banking system is characterized by national banks most of which have headquarters in a single financial center and have branches throughout the country, deposits in a particular region do not necessarily imply credit operations in that region. This together with the interdependence of the supply of and demand for credit imply that volume of credit or deposits alone will not reflect a regional credit gap. A better indicator to track financial activity is the ratio of loans to deposits in a particular region, as Lima and Resende (2008) suggest. That is the basis for the particular variant of Theil’s index they propose. The Turkish banking system provides an interesting case study in this respect because it is characterized by a single financial center in Istanbul and a lack of regional banking. There is significant variation across provinces in terms of rates of growth, per capita income, industrial specialization, population density, infrastructure and entrepreneurship. How banking activity and credit flows interact with this variety as well as the evolution of this interaction is crucial to the analysis of economic convergence within the country. In light of these ideas, this study aims to provide a descriptive analysis of the evolution of regional financial inequalities in Turkey over the 1988–2013 period. First a brief description of the ESDA tools used in the analysis is presented. A brief introduction to the nature of the banking system in Turkey and the nature of the data follows. Then credit-exporting provinces and credit-importing provinces are mapped. The presence of a statistically significant non-random spatial pattern is investigated using the global Moran’s I statistic. Statistically significant clusters of credit-importing and credit-exporting provinces are mapped using LISA techniques developed by Anselin (1995). Then the evolution of financial inequality indices as proposed by Lima and Resende (2008) are presented for different bank groups and different NUTS levels over the 1988–2013 period. Lastly a simple econometric model of convergence is estimated with the aim of investigating the role of finance in economic convergence. Concluding comments follow.",4

Explaining these forces is the main focus of the new economic geography. The canonical model of this field, developed by Krugman (1991) and known as the Core–Periphery model, relies on a dispersion force which is rooted in the agricultural sector whose share in employment and expenditure has sharply decreased in most industrialized countries, and thus does not fit well contemporary space economies. Nowadays, the main dispersion force seems to lie in the existence of urban costs borne by workers living in large urban agglomerations (Murata and Thisse 2005). Excess concentration in large cities brings negative externalities, notably due to longer commuting costs and scarce land for housing. Housing and commuting costs are interrelated and shape the spatial structure of urban agglomerations. Workers seek to reduce their commuting costs by choosing a living place in the vicinity of their working place. However, because of the scarcity of land, everybody cannot live close to its job. Competition for land among workers gives rise to a land rent that varies inversely with the distance to the city center, thereby compensating workers that live far from their workplace and have to commute between the workplace and their living place. In other words, there is a trade-off between commuting and housing costs: The former increases with distance, whereas the latter decreases (Fujita 1989). Numerous economic geography models have been built in order to address urban costs. Helpman (1998) first dealt with urban costs and introduced a housing market into an economic geography model in which all workers are mobile. However, commuting costs were not considered because of the absence of an explicit spatial extension of cities. Independently, Tabuchi (1998) developed a model in which both housing and commuting costs were described. In Tabuchi’s analysis, commuting costs combine time and pecuniary costs. Unfortunately, his model had a significant shortcoming: Analytical results are available only for two extreme cases. Few years later, Murata and Thisse (2005) overcame this difficulty and introduced iceberg commuting costs affecting labor supplied by a worker, and thus its income. When agglomeration occurs, the city spread, commuting costs increase and labor supply shrinks. The idea is that if workers save time on commuting, more labor is available for production. These three models, and all the following others, showed the impacts of urban costs on the economic spatial organization. However, as far as we know, none of them deals explicitly with transport congestion. Congestion is an important component of commuting costs, as it increases fuel consumption and commuting times. In 2011, the Texas Transportation Institute estimates that congestion caused urban Americans to purchase an extra 2.9 billion gallons of fuel and to travel 5.5 billion hours more to drive the same commuting distances without congestion, for a congestion cost of $121 billion, namely up to 25 % of car running costs (Schrank et al. 2012). It also has major public health impacts. Sitting in traffic leads to higher tailpipe emissions which everyone is exposed to. Currie and Walker (2009) show that congestion enhances prematurity and low birth weight among mothers living close to congested roads. Road traffic congestion poses thus a challenge for all large and growing urban areas, especially as it has increased substantially over the last decades (OECD 2007). It is a major issue for urban decision makers, and it needs to be further studied in order to highlight transport policies. The aim of this paper is to propose a model of economic geography integrating transport congestion. As it is standard, the agglomeration force finds its origin in the need to reduce trade costs of manufactured goods between the two regions, and the main dispersion forces stem from land consumption and the resulting need for workers to commute. We retain the general equilibrium framework of monopolistic competition la Dixit–Stiglitz with the standard iceberg trade costs la Samuelson. But, instead of iceberg commuting costs, as in Murata and Thisse (2005), or generalized commuting costs, as in Tabuchi (1998), we introduce a time constraint. Zahavi and Talvitie (1980) considered first the existence of a transport-specific time constraint as a fundamental travel behavior. The idea is that households need to spend time commuting to do most of their activities (work, leisure, shopping) and they invest a nearly constant travel-time budget per day for transportation, on average, despite widely differing transportation infrastructures, geographies, cultures and per capita income levels (Schafer and Victor 2000). This travel-time budget captures the well-known idea that a rise of commuting speed leads to increase in distance travelled and not less commuting time (Levinson and Kumar 1994). The assumption of the time constraint allows us to introduce the speed of transport modes within a city. Congestion reduces road transport speeds depending on the capacity of the urban road network, which is captured by a macroscopic fundamental diagram. A reproducible macroscopic fundamental diagram relates the number of circulating vehicles to the average commuting speed on large urban areas (Daganzo et al. 2011). The idea of such a diagram is quite old (Godfrey 1970), but the verification of its existence is recent (Geroliminis and Sun 2011). This paper explores the interplay between trade costs of manufactured goods between the two region and workers’ urban costs. The results suggest that housing and commuting costs act as a dispersion force and modifies the spatial organization of the economy. Workers tend at the same time to agglomerate in order to limit trade costs of manufactured costs and to scatter in order to alleviate the burden of urban costs due to large urban areas. Like Murata and Thisse (2005), agglomeration appears to be a stable equilibrium when trade costs are large but dispersion prevails when they are low. Indeed, the decline of trade costs reduces the need of being located in the largest market, but it has no direct impact on workers’ commuting and housing costs. However, unlike Murata and Thisse (2005), partial agglomeration in one region can be a stable equilibrium when trade costs are large. One of the most striking features of many new economic geography models—probably because it is so unexpected—is that, beyond a given value of trade costs, catastrophic agglomeration occurs. The only stable outcome is then the full agglomeration in one region. This unsatisfactory result has been overcame, in particular with the works of Murata (2003) and Tabuchi and Thisse (2002), which assume individual taste heterogeneities in perceptions of regional differences. Our model allows also for partial agglomeration to be a stable equilibrium through the integration of transport congestion and housing demand. The results thus highlight the role of congestion which enhances dispersion forces in the spatial organization of the economy. The development of alternative transport mode less subject to congestion, or the construction of road infrastructure, may foster agglomeration, as it reduces congestion. The model is introduced in Sect. 2. The properties of the spatial equilibrium with one transport mode are derived in Sect. 3 and with two mode in Sect. 4, whereas Sect. 5 concludes.",2

Torrens,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The intricacy with which agency can be treated in computational agent-based models (ABMs) has advanced with such sophistication that fleeting actions and interactions of individual agents can now be represented in simulation as they bob and bounce relative to processes and phenomena that engulf them (Torrens 2010a). Some emergent binding between the individual dynamics of agents and the holistic flux of regional systems is often inferred when these models are run (Arthur 1990), and this has renewed hope for what regional science might accomplish if the convoluted pathways that often tether the small to the large could be unfurled (Slater-Hammel 1955). It has also loudened calls for ABM techniques that can exhaustively explore what those pathways might be (Batty 2005; Torrens 2010b). Alas, teasing out the theoretical threads that fasten agency to regions is tough work, both in practice and in theory. Unsurprisingly, these difficulties have also manifested in simulation. In response, the regional science community has settled on relatively loose couplings to associate agents to regions, but a lingering sense that more could be done to build stronger, explanatory pathways between agent behavior and regions, with process models that functionally intertwine the micro- and the macro-scale has lurked in the background for some time (Batty 2008; Klosterman 1994; Boyce 1988). The ongoing search for how we build connections between the microcosm and macrocosm of regional systems (Mansury and Gulyas 2007), relative to substantive scenarios that continue to shift in form and evidence requires a scheme for delineating where, when, with whom, and with what those connections might present. In this paper, we address the issue of interweaving individual agency with regions, using a method for extracting and defining input–output regions from behaviorally modeled mental maps as they form in the interchange between agents and their environments during simulation. We specifically consider how connections between agent behavior and regions might be tempered, and we consider fleeting regions that manifest as small bundles of space and time that agents cast to mobilize their agency (output regions) and from which agents draw ambient geographic information (as input regions) as they engage with longer-run and larger-hewn processes of flow, crowding, and congestion during indoor movement. We present a scheme for (1) extracting these mental maps from the dynamic state information that is calculated when agent transition rules are computed during simulation, for (2) defining their geographies and representing them as objects in GIS, and for (3) visualizing them as binding/boundary regions between fine and coarse scale of movement phenomena. In this way, we treat agents as explorer interpreters of the dynamics that unfold around them and we view those dynamics through the contextual lens that their behavior affords us. Because agents are synthetic representations of real-world entities, we sweep their mental maps and extract regions for a variety of their behaviors in simulation. These maps then become the basis for defining regions, such that an indelible explanatory path from behavioral agency to region is revealed. We demonstrate the approach with examples of scenarios for indoor movement, where agent–region dynamics are significant and in which small fluctuations in agency can be significant in determining long-running and far-reaching dynamics with practical relevance to how people move through indoor spaces in ordinary and extraordinary situations. While the scheme proves valuable in our target scenarios, the expanded relevance of extracting and defining behavioral input–output regions from ABMs in regional science applications is potentially quite broad.",6

A dynamic pathway toward the prosperity or impoverishment of a region is shaped by many individual economic choices amplified through social interactions and subject to institutional and geographical environments (Boshuizen et al. 2009; Batten 2001). Moreover, the future economic welfare of regions worldwide relies on specific manifestations of climate change, most of which require adaptation to their adverse consequences (IPCC 2014). When studying climate adaptation, the uncertainties about climate change, individual behavior and economic consequences are large. Therefore, an effective policy formulation in which private and public adaptation initiatives are aligned is a challenging task. To be successful, one needs to explore the consequences of adaptive choices under risk as our investment decisions today shape spatial patterns of development and economic welfare of regions in the future. Analytical, statistical, equilibrium and computational simulation models serve as tools to support policy makers at the local, regional or country level. Models employed in the economic discipline often rely on the assumptions of a rational representative economic agent maximizing its goal function under conditions of perfect information and in the absence of biases or information asymmetries. This allows for elegant solutions yielding a unique equilibrium. Yet, there is an increasing trend in economic literature to question the appropriateness and consequences of these assumptions (Arthur 1999; Tesfatsion 2002; Farmer and Foley 2009), especially if interactions with the natural system are considered (Liu et al. 2007). Economic models are being extended to account for out-of-equilibrium dynamics (Arthur 2006), agent heterogeneity (Kirman 2006), bounded rationality (Simon 1997) and interactions between agents (Axtell 2005). In the context of climate change, probabilistic risks and uncertainty need to be explicitly considered, which load even more weight on the level of complexity expected from economic models. Traditionally, they rely on expected utility theory (EUT) to capture decisions under uncertainty. EUT assumes that individual decision-makers quantify uncertainties on all possible states of the world, value and weight them on their probability of occurrence and choose the alternative with the highest expected utility (Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). Yet, there is growing evidence from the psychological and behavioral literature that people are boundedly rational and that intuitive processes or heuristics and information from social networks are utilized to make decisions under risk. Specifically, empirical and experimental studies show that risk perception, experiential factors, feelings of dread or worry, perceived self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control bias individual decision-making (Tversky and Kahneman 1973; Rogers 1975; Maddux and Rogers 1983; Slovic 1987; Ajzen 2002; Slovic et al. 2004, 2007). Prospect theory, for example, shows that individuals are biased in their risk judgement because they weigh uncertain negative consequences much more heavily than uncertain gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1992). Moreover, many economic choices are subject to an influence from social networks (Jackson 2010). The social amplification of risk framework states that individual risk perceptions are susceptible to social norms through interactions within social networks (Kasperson et al. 1988). Social interaction, disaster risk experience and risk mitigating behavior are processes underlying individual and social learning and may change preferences and decision over time. Quantitative models, which are capable of incorporating these behavioral aspects to explore the cumulative economic consequences of climate risk and compare them to aggregated outcomes based on traditional economic assumptions, are in demand. Ideally, such a model should also be spatially explicit as many research and policy questions in the field of regional sciences deal with the spatial development of regions. Yet, it is a real challenge to construct an economic model that is capable of integrating insights from behavioral studies and economic choices with social networks while still operating in a heterogeneous spatial environment. Agent-based computational economics (ACE) has proven successful in modelling various economic phenomena while going beyond a representative maximizing agent with perfect information. ACE is the study of economic processes, modelled as evolving systems of heterogeneous interacting agents with the use of computers and simulation techniques (Tesfatsion and Judd 2006). Economic agents in agent-based models (ABMs) interact with each other and the environment according to particular rules giving rise to emergent macrophenomena (Farmer and Foley 2009). ABMs have been applied to study various economic phenomena, for example financial markets (LeBaron 2001; Feng et al. 2012), commodity markets (Gode and Sunder 1993; Graubner et al. 2011; Kirman and Vriend 2001), energy markets (Bunn and Oliveira 2003; Sun and Tesfatsion 2007), land markets (Chen et al. 2011; Filatova et al. 2011; Magliocca et al. 2011; Filatova 2014; Parker 2014), systems of cities (Mansury and Gulyás 2007) as well as agricultural economics questions (Balmann 1997; Berger 2001; Happe et al. 2006; Troost and Berger 2014). Nolan et al. (2009) and Parker et al. (2012) review ACE applications, in which spatial complexity matters. Irwin (2010) provides a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of traditional economic modelling methods and of ABMs. The agent-based method has been intensively applied by other disciplines including geography with its explicit treatment of space (Brown et al. 2005; Robinson and Brown 2007; Crooks 2010), psychology with its rich representation of individual decision-making (Janssen and Jager 1999, 2001; Jager et al. 2000) and sociology with its explicit treatment of social networks (Carley 2009). The ABM researchers have moved forward crossing the borders of single disciplines. Arthur (1993) opened the stage extending simple neoclassical models by advancing theoretical economic agents by means of computerized agents with learning algorithms, which were calibrated using human learning data from psychological experiments. Lux (2009) presents an empirical stock market ACE model where traders rely on the opinions of others when making investment decisions. Sun and Müller (2013) study payments for ecosystem services using an empirical spatial ABM where agents were influenced by opinions in their social network. Although significant progress was made, there still exist knowledge gaps. Firstly, the above-mentioned studies rarely combine economic choices, behavioral insights, influence of social networks and spatial aspects in one comprehensive model, which seems important to explore regional economics dynamics (Batten 2001). Secondly, while the use of empirical data in ABM is encouraged (Robinson et al. 2007), grounding behavioral rules (rather than agents’ attributes) and interactions structure, e.g., social networks, of agents is still scarce. Thirdly, studies rarely perform a systematic test on how relaxing the neoclassical economic assumptions by including empirically observed behavior and social networks affects the development of a region and its economic activities. This paper aims to make a step forward by addressing these three issues. We present an application of a spatial economic ABM to explore macrolevel changes at the regional level driven by a spectrum of microfoundations under various climate change scenarios. Microfoundations guiding agents’ behavior in our case vary from a pure rational maximizer model to more behaviorally rich agents engaging in interactions within social network elicited from a survey. The model is applied to study economic decisions of farmers adapting to climate-induced drought risks in the Netherlands. Due to climate change, droughts are expected to occur more frequently and to become more severe in the future threatening crop production. Farmers need to adapt in order to secure their income and reduce losses of the agricultural sector in the region. However, there is a lot of uncertainty about the impacts of droughts and climate change. Studies have found that behavioral and social factors play the key role in farmers’ adaptive decision-making. This paper is particularly interested in investigating the effects of including empirical social networks and different behavioral rules guiding farmers’ choices under drought risk on macroeconomic indicators (e.g., rate of adaptation, income of the agricultural sector) in the southwest Netherlands. Specifically, we seek answers on the following research questions: (1) What are the effects of microfoundations that allow social interactions and non-rational behavior on the regional drought vulnerability of the agricultural sector? (2) What is the impact of climate change on these macrometrics? In this study, we combine these aspects in an agent-based model of farmers’ decision-making under drought risk. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of empirical social networks and different behavioral rules on farmers’ choices under drought risk and its impacts on several macroeconomic indicators such as the rate of adaptation and income of the agricultural sector in the southwest of the Netherlands. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses some theoretical considerations concerning farmers’ adaptive decision-making under risk in more detail followed by the description of the case-study area. Details on the method including our specific ABM and the experimental design are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses the results. Conclusions, limitations and future work are listed in Sect. 5.",46

These facilities often yield substantial positive economic externalities that are capitalised in local land values, potentially leading to land price rises. While the betterment effect is well recognised in the literature, in practice there are different ways and diverse perspectives worldwide about how to deploy land value to fund infrastructure development (Peterson 2009). This paper provides a synoptic view of the problem of land value betterment and policy solutions building on Coasian approaches to the analysis of infrastructure development. Coase’s (1960) insights about the problem of social costs highlighted divergences between private costs and social costs (and by extension divergences between private benefits and social benefits), and our analysis explores the impact of positive externalities on infrastructure development. An important policy question is whether or different allocations of ownership rights and development rights affect the final outcomes. In his own interpretation of Coase, Stigler (1989) popularised what is now known as “the Coase Theorem” (CT)—postulating that, regardless of the initial allocation of property rights, perfect markets will ensure that Pareto optimal allocations are achieved via a process of voluntary exchange. CT is based on assumptions of zero transaction costs, perfect information and fully allocated property rights. We will be exploring these insights into the context of infrastructure development, and we identify four prototypical models of infrastructure development: This model underpins the English history of suburbanisation in general and, in particular, the growth of Metroland as a north-west London suburb since the mid-nineteenth century (Levinson 2008). In this classic model, a private developer was entitled to and responsible for development. They invested initially in major infrastructures, such as railways, and later managed to recoup most of the cost by selling land or residential properties upon the land they had owned near the rail network. A different version of privately funded infrastructure development, a present-day variant of the Metroland model, can be observed in many contemporary American suburbs, such as those around the City of Denver, Colorado (Billings and Thibodeau 2013). This second model features an allocation of land development rights and financial duties directly to individual households, who fund the relevant local projects collectively by repaying a so-called special district bond through local property tax. The third model arguably characterises the land use planning practice of many European welfare state countries, notably modern UK, where the right to develop infrastructure regulated and/or nationalised (Lee et al. 2013; Barlow and King 1992). Yet the public sector in this case becomes obliged to subsidise the construction and maintenance of major infrastructures, mostly via general tax income and/or government debt instruments. Post-socialist China characterises the fourth model. Not only is the land development right, as in the European case, reserved to the eminent domain, but the Chinese state also constitutionally owns all of the urban land (National People’s Congress 2004: Article 10).Footnote 1 The government monopoly over the land market incentivises local authorities to play the role of private developer in the classic English model. This “developer state” pro-actively supplies infrastructure, in the expectation that they will accumulate profits in the future by leasing the nearby land plots with improved land value to private parties (Lichtenberg and Ding 2009). Focusing on these four prototypical models allows us to conduct a tractable international comparison and captures the intellectual and institutional diversity that characterises the analysis of land value betterment. To understand and compare the four models in more conceptual depth, we follow Webster and Wu (2001) by conducting a series of behaviour-driven cellular automata simulations as a simplified agent-based modelling approach (Batty 2009), which enable us to identify differences in net welfare outcomes across four different land development right regimes. Our ANOVA suggests that, in a spatially explicit game setting with zero transaction costs, the classic English and contemporary American models are associated with statistically significantly higher levels of welfare than their European (including modern UK) and Chinese counterparts. However, the ubiquity of transaction costs, imperfect/asymmetric information and principal-agent problems may explain why there are limits to real-world convergence in terms of welfare outcomes across the different systems: the real-world coexistence of different outcomes reflects varying local sociopolitical circumstances and institutions. This paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we review the four models of land use and infrastructure development as documented in the recent literature. Following that, we present the design of our behaviour-driven cellular automata as a simplified agent-based model, which is developed within an analytical framework designed around two dimensions that capture the four scenarios outlined above: public versus private ownership, and household versus developer. A range of starting conditions are modelled including a checkerboard pattern to represent an even spread of households and developers and a further two simplified representations of common real-world spatial patterns of households versus developers: a monocentric pattern as a simplified representation of monocentricity in cities such as Shanghai and London; a polycentric pattern as a simplified representation of polycentric urban areas, e.g. as seen in many North American cities. The simulation results are reported and discussed before an exploration of the limitations and potential future refinements to our simple abstract model. The paper concludes with a discussion of some conclusions, policy implications and recommendations.

Plane,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There has been a constant extension of the range of mobility. ... Popular conceptions of speed and distance have been completely revised. ... The tempo of life is speeded. ... An interconnecting, interconnected web of communication has been woven about the individual. ... The web has developed largely without plan or aim. The integration has been in consequence of competitive forces, not social desirability. Recent Social Trends in the United States, Report of the President’s Research Committee, 1933 (as quoted in Meinig 2004, p. 1). It is a great honor for me serve in the role of Western Regional Science Association President. I had the singular pleasure of being the organizer for some 20 previous WRSA Annual Meetings. Each year, when I would talk to our incoming President about giving the traditional luncheon address, I always suggested two things: (1) have fun with it; and (2) keep it short. Over the years, we have, in fact, had quite a few very thoughtful—and fun—addresses. I learned, however, that asking an academic to be brief is a fool’s mission. Nevertheless, I promised Rachel Franklin, our current Executive Director, I would make mine short... more or less. Which brings me to the title of this address: “Regional science in a physical/virtual more/less world.” What do I mean by a physical/virtual more/less world? I came up with that phrase after thinking about what basic concepts in regional science have most motivated my research career. I decided there are two or three that especially stand out. And then I started pondering how those concepts have been fundamentally altered by changing characteristics of the world during my life span. And then I selected a pair of quotes to start this sharing of thoughts on a suitably lofty plain. In the holy book of Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita, it is said: “Suppose a thousand suns should rise together in the sky. Such is the power of the shape of the infinite.” Keeping that glorious image in mind, ponder next some more down to earth words. These are those of Tony Smith, my Penn Dissertation advisor. He spoke them in Philadelphia in 2003 at a special session of the \(50{\hbox {th}}\) anniversary North American Meetings organized by Andy Isserman in the format of a Quaker meeting. Each of us was invited to stand up and talk about what had been learned in the first half-century of regional science. When Tony’s turn came, he said something like: “Sometimes I think the only two things we’ve learned in regional science are: (a) people generally prefer to make shorter than longer trips, and (b) they would rather have more space than less space.” The green flash that came to me while looking to link the cosmic aphorism of the Bhagavad Gita together with Tony’s pithy insights was this: The Internet, or, more broadly, the whole electronic web of communications on which we now spend much of our lives, is the latest, greatest innovation reshaping human geographies. And it is that new electronic universe that is quietly and radically undermining those pair of things that we just might, maybe, have learned, thus far, in regional science. We now live with our feet in the physical world, but with half our brains and attention off in the virtual one. The implications of the virtual world on how business gets transacted, how we engage with one another, and how we access and accumulate knowledge all have rather profound implications for the locational or “where” questions that regional scientists research, as well as for the policy questions that our analytical methods need to be designed to help answer. Whereas our multidisciplinary field was founded to study the spaces of a material world, one where location and physical distance matter, increasingly it is a different kind of space—what I shall call affinity space—that characterizes the more ethereal realm of the worldwide web. I am going to argue that we have defined progress, in our physically defined world, on the basis of “more is more.” But at this juncture of human history, when we’ve embarked on a voyage of discovery in the boundless, ever-expanding web world, I believe the key to progress will be coming to grips with how to interact within a “more and/or less” world. And that is going to involve taking more seriously that dictum of modern architecture coined by Mies van der Rohe that “less is more.” And I actually think the more time we spend in virtual affinity space, and the less time, consequently, we devote to moving about in physical space, the more that distance matters! My longest enduring love affair in regional science has been with the gravity model. In its basic, social physics, unconstrained form, the human geography gravity model can be written as: Its three essential components, movement or spatial interaction, population, and distance, have been my primary fascinations. These are surely among the most primitive and foundational concepts of regional science (perhaps along with a few others, such as regions, economies, firms, households, factors of production, and amenities). So what I want to focus on in this address are evolving population trends and the changing nature of distance and spatial interaction. In both instances, I will suggest we need to shift from thinking about a more/more world to a more/less world.

As a consequence, a growing body of the literature has investigated the relationship between economic development and fiscal federalism, i.e., the allocation across different (vertical) layers of the administration of competencies (expenditure side) and fiscal instruments (revenue side). More precisely, following the theoretical insight on the better targeting of growth-enhancing services and infrastructural investments, a large number of empirical studies have been carried out to analyze the association between fiscal federalism and economic growth. In many cases, quantitative cross-national analyses have been performed to test whether decentralized countries are able to achieve better economic output dynamics than more centralized nations (Oates 1993; Davoodi and Zou 1998; Woller and Phillips 1998; Thiefen 2003; Iimi 2005; Thornton 2007; Baskaran and Feld 2009). Nonetheless, most of these efforts have remained in the cross-country framework. Few efforts have been made to capture within-country processes related to regional autonomy (Crevoisier and Quiquerez 2005; Crucq and Hemminga 2007). Even more scarce attention has been given to the question whether, within the same country, subnational entities with higher levels of autonomy are able to attain better economic performances than the other subnational agencies/territories. More in particular, the existing national cases of asymmetric decentralization, where autonomy is not equally distributed across subnational governments (Congleton 2006),Footnote 2 have been under-investigated to understand the mechanisms underlying the different processes of local economic development. Moreover, the existing literature has almost systematically ignored the counterfactual framework of causal inference. In particular, no attempts—to the best of my knowledge—have been made to quantify the economic development of an autonomous region if it has not enjoyed that condition. In order to partially fill these two gaps, the asymmetric Italian decentralization is exploited to evaluate the economic impact of the autonomy of one of the five Italian regioni a statuto speciale (special-statute regions), namely Friuli-Venezia Giulia (FVG). More precisely, exploiting the delayed creation of that region (1963), a quite long pre-intervention period (i.e., a pre-autonomy period) has been observed so that the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al. 2010, 2015) could be adopted. This method has allowed to construct a pertinent synthetic FVG to best approximate the counterfactual of what would be observed for the economic output of this region in the absence of its statutory autonomy. Then, the trajectories of per capita GDP, respectively, observed in the presence and in the absence of the FVG autonomy, have been contrasted in order to estimate the economic effect of the regional prerogatives. This comparison reveals that if FVG were not an autonomous region, its per capita GDP would be significantly lower than that effectively observed. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional architecture of the Italian asymmetric federalism. Section 3 delineates the potential channels of the FVG autonomy impact. Section 4 presents the data and empirical strategy. Section 5 discusses the results, while Sect. 6 draws some conclusions.",3

López,Pedro J. Martínez-Ortiz,Juan-Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The last decades have seen a huge increase in research focused on the spatial interactions of public spending policies. The seminal proposals of Case et al. (1993) and Kelejian and Robinson (1993) have led to several research papers that explored the relations between local public spending policies and their spatial spillover effects. At the same time, interest arose in research using models that explain the tax burden of local governments adding spatial effects (e.g. Brett and Pinkse 2000). Both revenue and expenditure policies show spatial spillovers because of the impact of decisions made by authorities in neighbouring regions. For example, a low-tax policy in neighbouring regions can be attractive to both citizens and business, and therefore, the region should have similar tax levels if they do not want citizens to move to neighbouring regions. The same philosophy can be transferred to expenditure in public services, particularly with subprogrammes that are intrinsically linked to citizen welfare. It is evident that certain welfare policies in a small region cannot be blocked for citizens of neighbouring regions. For instance, a low prices policy in the tickets of a local theatre, museum or music festival, due to co-financing by local authorities, will certainly benefit the citizens of neighbouring regions. These spending policies and their spatial spillovers have generated special interest for investigators. For example, some studies have analysed the total expenditure of local governments (Case et al. 1993; Solé-Ollé 2006) and others analyse specific items: Culture (Lundberg 2006; Werck et al. 2008; St’astná 2009; Benito et al. 2013), Sport and recreational activities (St’astná 2009; Ermini and Santolini 2010), Security (Schaltegger and Zemp 2003), Rescue Services (Hanes 2002) or Environment (St’astná 2009; Ermini and Santolini 2010; Deng et al. 2012; Choumert and Cormier 2011). All these papers propose different models to explain per capita public expending using spatial econometrics models in order to capture spatial spillovers in the regression model (Anselin 1988). The set of data was diverse: in some cases, only the information derived from a single cross section was analysed (Bastida et al. 2013; Ermini and Santolini 2010; Werck et al. 2008; St’astná 2009; Deng et al. 2012), while in other cases, panel data techniques are used (Akai and Suhara 2013; Lundberg 2006; Benito et al. 2013). Moreover, in those papers there is no consensus regarding how to include spatial effects in the model and the specifications vary. It is easy to find specifications that introduce endogenous interaction effects, including substantive spatial dependence, hereinafter spatial lag model (SLM) (Hanes 2002; Ermini and Santolini 2010; Lundberg 2006); or spatial structure in the error term of the regression model, hereinafter spatial error model (SEM) (Bastida et al. 2013; St’astná 2009). Mixed specifications including both types of spatial interactions are also common (Case et al. 1993; Deng et al. 2012). However, the incorporation of exogenous spatial effects is overlooked and this type of effect is not considered in any studies. With regards to the sign of the parameters of spatial dependence, the empirical evidence is also ambiguous. In most cases, spatial dependence is positive (Bastida et al. 2013; Revelli 2006; St’astná 2009; Costa et al. 2015), in others it is negative (Hanes 2002; Lundberg 2006; Akai and Suhara 2013) and there are even models that incorporate positive and negative structures with two spatial dependence parameters (Case et al. 1993; St’astná 2009; Deng et al. 2012). Some of these studies present several methodological shortcomings. One of them is related to the correct selection of the spatial regression models. Some investigators use the prevailing custom of adopting the Florax et al. (2003) methodology based on a comparison of different Lagrange multipliers (LM) tests, but as showed by Mur and Angulo (2009), this strategy is inefficient, leading to a misspecification of the spatial effects. Incorrect model selection of the type of spatial dependence induces bias in parameter estimation and, therefore, an incorrect interpretation of the results. Another is related to the hypothesis of independence between subprogramme expenditures. Some papers estimate the expenditure in several subprogrammes without considering natural relationships (Bastida et al. 2013). Obviously, the hypothesis of independence between subprogramme expenditure is not true and induces inefficient estimation in the model’s parameters. Moreover, as highlighted by Case et al. (1993), “there is no reason to assume that patterns of expenditure interdependence are the same for all categories of spending” (p. 303). Our interest is to provide new evidence while obtaining simultaneous estimations of the expenditure of ten subprogrammes, including spatial effects and correlations between them. We use the Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) methodology, using model selection based in Mur and Angulo (2009) and extended by López et al. (2014) in SUR. The study uses per capita local Spanish public spending on ten subprogrammes: Security, Housing, Welfare, Environment, Social services, Employment promotion, Health, Education, Culture and Sport. The paper is structured as follows: the second section contains a brief review of the literature related to possible spatial dependence mechanisms. The third section describes the methodology based on SUR models in a panel data framework. The fourth section presents the most important results and some political implications. In the last section, we present our conclusions, and some limitations.",22

Lacombe,Miguel Flores,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Even though Mexico’s “war on drugs” has only been noticed by the rest of the world in recent years, it has very long-standing roots. It dates back to at least the mid-1980s, when Colombian cartels extended their influence to the United States via drug-trafficking networks, particularly after the successful enforcement efforts by Colombian authorities against the Colombian Cali and Medellin cartels that eventually gave rise to the emergence of Mexican drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs). Previously, Colombians trafficked cocaine through Florida (Payan 2006). Mexican smugglers made ties with Colombian traffickers and relocated the activity to the northern border. The country’s geography has played a role in this context. DTOs have taken advantage of the rugged terrain of the mountains to plant marijuana and opium and, more recently, to produce synthetic drugs. The region referred to as the Golden Triangle, formed by the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa, has historically been a major producer of illicit drugs. Recent official sources indicate that other states such as Colima, Jalisco, Guerrero, and Oaxaca have started to grow such crops. Under these circumstances, geographic areas within the Mexican territory exist where the phenomenon of drug trafficking has prevailed and has created an institutional “space” favoring illicit activities. Though drug trafficking and related violence have become serious problems and have hindered the government and national security, the concerns do not apply to the whole territory but just to particular areas. In such areas, the levels of violence as measured by homicides have soared dramatically since the end of 2006. The unprecedented and increasing levels of violence have been attributed to the confrontation among DTOs, especially after the deployment of federal armed forces to combat these organizations and to eliminate criminal control over public spaces. These operations were coordinated by military and federal police corporations and were backed by state and local security forces. The strategy included the dismantling of criminal organizations, the arrest of the largest possible number of criminals and the confiscation of drug shipments, the deployment of military operations in several regions of the country, and a permanent increase in resources devoted to the military forces. The states exposed to these joint operations were Michoacn (December 2006); Guerrero and Baja California (January 2007); Nuevo Len and Tamaulipas (January 2008); Chihuahua (April 2008); and Sinaloa and Durango (May 2008). Not coincidentally, these states, with the exception of Nuevo León, have a long tradition of being involved in either drug trafficking or the production of illicit drugs. These characteristics may certainly play an important role in explaining the rise in violence and, in particular, the location in which violence became noticeable. The areas where the creation and expansion of illegal markets are greatest will produce extra murders when contextual factors conducive to lethal violence exist (Zimring and Hawkins 1997). Identification of concentrations or clusters of greater criminal activity has appeared as a central mechanisms to targeting law enforcement efforts and crime prevention response to crime problems. These clusters of crime are commonly referred to as hotspots-geographic locations “of high concentration of crime, relative to the distribution of crime across the whole region of interest” (Ratcliffe 2010). Law enforcement policies are often localized in such hot spot areas aiming to reduce crime and violence levels. However, it is also often the case that such policies might be ineffective in spatially restraining crime and related activities which in turn may result in the spread of violence levels to neighboring areas. In the Mexican context, the federal government has long pursued different policing efforts in particular regions of the country (Seelke 2010). Nonetheless, a major limitation when undertaking empirical analyses relates to the lack and inconsistency of data available at different geographic levels. While there are a number of explanatory variables commonly associated with crime available at municipal level, these are clearly scarce in comparison with those available at state level. This poses an important issue, particularly when the focus is on exploring local confounding factors such as corruption, the number of police forces, the seizure of guns, and drug eradication. Such information, unfortunately, is not available on a local scale. Under such circumstances, the use of appropriate econometric techniques is imperative in order to provide reliable estimates. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we explore the relationship of contextual factors associated with violence levels in Mexico taking into account recent policing and law enforcement efforts at the municipal (municipios) as well as state level. Second, we develop a spatial econometric modeling strategy that deals explicitly with the hierarchical structure and the spatial dependence arising from the data. Specifically, a Bayesian Hierarchical Spatial Lag of X Model that allows for local spillovers by including spatially lagged explanatory variables at both levels of the hierarchy. Empirical estimates of the own (direct) and cross-partial (spillover) effects are available and provide a much richer set of empirical estimates relative to a standard non-spatial random intercept model.",5

Koetse,Erik T. Verhoef,Luke M. Brander,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Natural areas and associated ecosystems provide a number of valuable services to society, such as recreational opportunities, aesthetic enjoyment, and environmental and agricultural services. Many of these ecosystem services have public good characteristics, and as a result they tend to be underprovided in the absence of policy intervention (e.g. Kotchen and Powers 2006; Smith et al. 2002). Political decision making regarding the provision of natural areas and land use planning requires information on ecosystem service values in order to make informed trade-offs against the (opportunity) costs of preservation. In this respect it is problematic that many of these ecosystem services, and especially recreation and aesthetic services, are generally not traded directly on markets, and their values are therefore not directly observed. The absence of information on these values has strong negative consequences for land use planning and likely leads to erroneous or at least uninformed planning decisions. Numerous economic studies on the valuation of natural areas have therefore been conducted over the past 30 years. Useful summaries and meta-analyses of the valuation literature on forests are provided by Barrio and Loureiro (2010), Lindhjem (2007), Ojea et al. (2010), Zanderson and Tol (2009); and on wetlands by Brander et al. (2006, 2012), Brouwer et al. (1999), Ghermandi et al. (2010) and Woodward and Wui (2001). Descriptive overviews of the valuation literature on natural open space proximate to urban areas are provided in Fausold and Lilieholm (1999) and McConnell and Walls (2005). Brander and Koetse (2011) present meta-analyses on contingent valuation (CV) and hedonic pricing (HP) studies of peri-urban open space. With respect to the CV meta-analysis, the results show that the average value of a forest is around 1500 US$ per hectare (in 2003 prices). Important factors influencing the value of open space are land use, services provided by the area, and size of the area. In particular, urban parks and areas used for recreation purposes have higher values, while size of the area decreases the value per hectare, which points to decreasing returns to size. The hedonic pricing meta-analysis results show that the average increase in house prices of being 100 m closer to open space is around 1 %. The results furthermore show that the impact of open space on house prices is substantially stronger when getting closer to open space (see also Dekkers and Koomen 2013). Although the early valuation literature is dominated by contingent valuation and hedonic pricing studies, using choice experiments to elicit consumer preferences and estimate land use values has gradually become the state of the art. A fair amount of choice experiments on land use valuation have been conducted since the 1980s. There also is a growing number of choice experiment studies that aim to value natural areas and land use change (for recent contributions see, e.g. Bateman et al. 2009; Colombo et al. 2007; Colombo and Hanley 2008; Scarpa et al. 2007; Schaafsma et al. 2012, 2013; Koetse and Brouwer 2015). A common feature of these studies is that they attempt to value changes to an existing natural area or ecosystem. The advantage of this form of application is that respondents who know the specified study site can make well-informed decisions about trade-offs between land use characteristics and monetary changes (often changes in local tax). A strong disadvantage of this site-specific approach is that it lacks external validity (e.g. Bateman et al. 2006) because results are difficult to transfer to alternative sites, making the insights location specific. It is therefore difficult to generalise the results, thereby limiting the potential for value transfer and application to alternative policy assessments (e.g. Bateman et al. 2011; Navrud and Ready 2007). In this study we therefore take a different approach and perform a choice experiment using a generic rather than a site-specific design. There are few studies that apply this approach. A notable exception is Viscusi et al. (2008), who use a generic choice experiment design to estimate citizens’ willingness to pay for rivers and lakes with good water quality at the regional level in the USA. Our main contribution to the literature is that we obtain a marginal value function for natural areas that is more generic in nature and as such can be used in policy assessments that cover a larger geographic area than studies that use a site-specific study design. Related aims are to explicitly identify use and non-use values by analysing value differences between accessible and inaccessible areas, and to quantify the effects of fragmentation on the value of natural areas, an issue that is especially relevant for densely populated regions such as the Netherlands. The use of a generic setup, however, means that values for different types of natural areas obtained from the choice experiment are estimated relative to a reference category. In order to derive a value for this reference category we conduct a contingent valuation experiment. A noteworthy feature of our analysis is that we combine the choice data obtained from the CV and CE experiments in one model in order to obtain a generic marginal value function for natural areas in the Netherlands. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the research design of the choice experiment and the contingent valuation study. Section 3 discusses the statistical design and the data collection procedure, while Sect. 4 presents the main estimation results of both the CV and CE study. In Sect. 5 we aim to uncover the main sources of preference heterogeneity, with a focus on use and non-use values and spatial heterogeneity. Section 6 concludes.",6

Irwin,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Land use outcomes and their determinants are spatially heterogeneous and dependent, making land conversion a complex process to model and the identification of policy effects challenging. Rural land use typically exhibits systematic patterns of developed and undeveloped land that are spatially correlated with heterogeneous landscape variables, many of which are time invariant or change only gradually over long periods of time. If unobserved, these spatially correlated variables and time-invariant effects will lead to similar trajectories of land use change at neighboring locations over time, making identification of policy effects in a cross-sectional framework exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Most often, identification in such settings relies on functional form assumptions (e.g., in which the structure of spatial dependence is imposed). However, model misspecification can generate severely biased estimates, and thus alternative approaches are warranted for inference and policy evaluation. Variation in a policy over time can provide a means of identification by controlling for time-invariant commonalities and isolating the effect of a policy change. We take this approach here in exploring the effect of public facilities moratorium and minimum lot size zoning on rural land conversion in Medina County, Ohio, an exurban county located approximately 26 miles south of Cleveland. Specifically, we observe a change in the zoning regulation of several counties that lifted a public facilities moratorium in 2000 that previously had imposed a strong disincentive to new development. As a result of this policy change, 1946 rural parcels that had the public facilities moratorium had it lifted. In addition, at the same time the moratorium was lifted, roughly half of these parcels maintained minimum lot size zoning restrictions while the other half lifted the minimum lot restrictions altogether. Using these policy changes as a natural experiment and data on land conversion over time, we estimate a fixed effects binary discrete-choice model that eliminates the time-invariant unobservable variables and isolates the effect of public facilities moratorium and minimum lot size zoning on residential land development. Using this conditional model specification, we find evidence that public facilities moratorium and minimum lot size zoning deter the conversion of eligible undeveloped parcels to residential land uses. Specifically, we find that a parcel that is subject to a minimum lot size zoning is between 4.4 and 6.4% less likely to be converted to residential land use in comparison with a parcel without this restriction. Results from a pooled model, in which the unobserved heterogeneity is left uncontrolled, underestimate the magnitude of the negative effect of minimum lot size zoning on land development, suggesting that the unobserved heterogeneity biases the estimated zoning effect toward zero. Our results provide evidence that failing to control for unobserved spatial correlation can lead to erroneous conclusions about policy effectiveness and demonstrate the utility of a policy change and panel data models along with exogenous policy changes that can isolate the causal effect of interest.",6

Movements in real estate prices are related to periods of economic expansion and recession (e.g., Shiller 2000, 2007), and a significant portion of transactions in the financial market is related to the housing market. The mortgage loan transactions and related derivatives are a vital component of the US economy. The global financial crisis of 2008 had its origins in the dramatic real estate crash after the price appreciation observed in previous years. A key aspect of the analysis of real estate prices is their relation to economic fundamentals. Periods with excessive price appreciations or bubbles can be identified through the systematic deviations from the economic determinants of these prices. The analysis of house prices and their economic fundamentals through an error correction model (co-integration) was proposed in Holly et al. (2010). In this work, the authors use a model for the variations of a house price index in the USA, employing a state level aggregation for the period 1975–2003. They propose an error correction mechanism between deviations from the equilibrium relationship between a house price index and a measure of per capita income, with the inclusion of controls for the cost of borrowing and population growth. The estimation procedures in Holly et al. (2010) and Baltagi and Li (2014) are based on the common correlated effects estimator (CCE) proposed in Pesaran (2006), an estimator for panel models with a multifactorial error structure. The use of this method is justified by the importance of the spatial dependence structure in the residuals of the model. Locations geographically nearby are exposed to the same unobserved factors affecting the price-fundamentals relationship. Chudik et al. (2011) show that this estimator remains consistent in the presence of a spatial error structure, justifying the use of this method to analyze the temporal evolution of house prices in the US states. The results in Holly et al. (2010) indicate the presence of an error correction component between house prices and disposable income, and point to persistent deviations of equilibrium prices in states like California, Massachusetts and New York. The work of Baltagi and Li (2014) extends the analysis of Holly et al. (2010) using a longer time period (1975–2011) and a higher level of disaggregation, relying on a sample related to 381 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), a definition of metropolitan area in the USA. The results obtained in Baltagi and Li (2014) indicate that the conclusions of Holly et al. (2010) are robust to the time period and the finer geographic disaggregation analyzed. These two works are based on the same estimation method proposed by Pesaran (2006). However, it is important to note that although this estimator is robust to the presence of spatial effects, it is not possible to directly interpret the spatial effects in the no-arbitrage relationship. To perform a type of spatial analysis, Holly et al. (2010) and Baltagi and Li (2014) analyze additional factor analysis and spatial autoregressive models (SAR) in the residuals of the common correlated effects estimator. In this paper, we analyze the same database used in Baltagi and Li (2014), but employ a different method. We propose an error correction model with the inclusion of continuous spatial random effects, using a space-temporal model based on a dynamic specification of a spatial covariance matrix of the Matérn class. The use of a continuous model for the analysis of spatial effects permits clearer visualization and interpretation of the spatial dependency patterns. The use of discrete approximations in spatial models, such as lattices and adjacency models, is only a simplification performed to approximate the true continuous generating process of location and spatial dependence effects. This modeling also avoids the problems of defining neighborhoods in the usual models of spatial econometrics and allows projecting the spatial effects for every possible location in the continuous space, avoiding the existing aggregations in discrete lattice representations. Our estimation method relies on a Bayesian procedure based on integrated nested Laplace approximations (Rue et al. 2009), a method that allows accurate inferences in complex models, avoiding the problems of convergence and high computational cost involved in the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods normally used in these Bayesian procedures. Unlike of the studies of Holly et al. (2010) and Baltagi and Li (2014), using an estimator that is robust to the presence of spatial effects, the proposed specification directly includes a parametric specification for spatial random effects. This specification allows observing the deviations from equilibrium relationship at each location in the territorial space, which simplifies the analysis and interpretation of the economic results, in contrast to the method used in Holly et al. (2010) and Baltagi and Li (2014), which require auxiliary models and factor regressions for spatial interpretations of results. The results obtained in our study confirm the existence of a co-integration equation and the consequent error correction mechanism between house prices and per capita income indexes, with the inclusion of controls for population growth and the cost of borrowing. The spatial random effects estimated also allow relating the equilibrium price differentials with the processes of price declines and recoveries observed in several metropolitan regions, with results consistent with those observed in the literature, especially the works of Shiller (2000, 2007, 2008). We also estimate a cyclical model of the spatial random effects and show that this cyclical pattern is compatible with the house price cycles observed in the US economy. We also compare our results with a spatio-temporal discrete lattice model and show that the results of the continuous model are consistent with the observed dynamic in house prices, while the discrete lattice model presents some discrepancies with the observed house price history. This article has the following structure. Section 2 presents the spatio-temporal model based on the dynamic Matérn covariance specification. The Bayesian estimation method used is discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we present the variables used in this work. The estimation results and analysis are presented in Sect. 5, and the final conclusions are in Sect. 6.",4

In most models of city formation, once random events determine a particular initial condition (e.g. a settlement in a specific location), subsequent population growth becomes locked-in regardless of the advantages of different alternatives. In these theories, first-nature forces—that is, characteristics that are intrinsic to a specific location, like proximity to navigable waters or climate—are crucial determinants of a city’s fate. The main implication of these models is that exogenous shocks to population should only have temporary effects as long as the fundamental features that determined the location and size of the city in the first place are not affected. A different—and much more scant—strand of the literature studies the relationship between urban agglomerations and warfare or conflict. The theoretical link between these two variables is unclear, and the few existing empirical studies find ambiguous results. In this paper, we use a major historical event that allows us to formally study the behaviour of several cities after a period of conflict and warfare—the Spanish Reconquest. We focus on the striking population shifts that took place in the Iberian Peninsula between the 700–1500 A.D. This period of time witnessed the invasion of the peninsula by the MoorsFootnote 1 armies from Northern Africa in 710 and its subsequent expulsion at the end of the Reconquest, around 1500. Figure 1 shows the Caliphate of Cordoba around 1000, at the apogee of Al-Mansur, the de facto ruler of the Moors of Al-AndalusFootnote 2 in the late tenth to early eleventh centuries. It is apparent from the map that almost the entire territory of the peninsula was under Moorish domain in that year. 
Source Wikipedia Caliphate of Cordoba c. 1000.  In the year 722, soon after the beginning of the Moorish occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, a noble named Pelayo led the first phase of what has been known as the Spanish Reconquest, a military campaign to expel the Moors and repopulate Iberian towns and cities with Christian population.Footnote 3 The Christian army’s victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the north-western coastal mountains. The Reconquest then advanced towards Galicia, in the furthest northwest of the territory and, through a lengthy process, kept moving towards the south. Although there is no clear consensus among historians about its exact time span, the Reconquest was a long process that was particularly intense during the 1100–1300 (or 1400) period.Footnote 4 The Christian kings of Spain ruling in the thirteenth century reconquered more land from the Muslims than all of their previous predecessors. In his excellent account of the Reconquest, O’Callaghan (2003) argues that around the mid-eleventh century the Spanish Reconquest became a Christian crusade that was quite explicitly sponsored by the pope. Pope Alexander II (1062–1073) and most of his successors up until the fourteenth century encouraged European Christian knights to carry out expeditions into Spain and offered the same spiritual rewards that were offered to those who would fight in the crusades in Jerusalem: relief from penance and remission of sins.Footnote 5
 The main purpose of war against Islam in the Iberian Peninsula was to expel the Muslims from the peninsula or to exterminate them: it was not to convert them to Christianity. Claiming descent from the Visigoths, Christian rulers argued that they had a right to expel the Muslims who were wrongfully occupying territory that by right belonged to the Christians. The evidence suggests that Christian and Muslim societies were mutually exclusive in terms of social and legal differences but also, above all, because of religion, which suffused every facet of life. While daily interaction between Christians and Muslims did contribute to a degree of acculturation, especially in matters and social usage, there was no real possibility of the full integration of Christians into Muslim society or Muslims into Christian society. In each instance, Christians or Muslims could only be protected minorities with limited political and legal rights (O’Callaghan 2003, p. 10). An obvious consequence of the Reconquest was that the share of the Muslim and Christian populations changed dramatically during this period, as panel (a) in Fig. 2 illustrates, with the former experiencing a huge decline at the expense of the latter.Footnote 6 This figure also shows that while this tremendous change occurred, the total population of Spain grew at a rather constant rate of about 10% per year, which is similar to that of other European countries, as Graph (b) in Fig. 2 shows.

This paper exploits the Spanish Reconquest to estimate its effect on the population of the largest Iberian cities. We find that the Reconquest had an average significant and negative effect on the urban population of the main Iberian cities. However, our estimates imply that after controlling for the timing of the Reconquest in each specific city and a large set of variables, the effect of this shock across cities was only temporary, vanishing in less than one century on average. It is important to point out that in spite of the fact that this was a time period with quite frequent battles and conflicts, the Reconquest should not considered as “business as usual”. As it has been confirmed by many medieval historians, the ultimate objective of almost all or most of these battles was to expel the Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, while the Reconquest had a much longer duration than, for example, the bombings of Japan and Germany in WWII studied in related papers, this shock can still be interpreted as a temporary but very long shock, at least from the point of view of individual cities.

Krugman, the initiator of the NEG, attempted to internalize the idea of pecuniary externality, deriving from Marshall’s threefold classification (1920, p. 271) which was proposed to explain the agglomeration phenomena of spatial economic activities, into a normative economic model upon which the demand and supply mechanism operates. Under the mechanism of general equilibrium, the key features of the NEG are to explain the spatial phenomena of economic activities and to explore the stability of the equilibrium, by deriving and analysing sets of nonlinear equations. However, in order to derive sets of equations, these theoretical models have to be constructed using rather unrealistic assumptions and omitting certain factors known to be relevant in the real world. It was just recently that empirical economists and quantitative geographers started to test the theoretical frameworks against real data and estimate some of the basic parameters (Roos 2001; Head and Mayer 2003; Redding and Venables 2004; Mion 2004; Hanson 2005; Kiso 2005; Brakman et al. 2006; Fingleton 2006, 2008, 2011; Baltagi et al. 2014). One of the most successful equations tested by researchers is the wage equation. This equation which illustrates the subtle relationship between nominal wage levels and market potential is the core element of the NEG and is widely used in studying different levels of spatial aggregation. Drawing on a socio-economic panel dataset at the prefecture level for Japan from 1977 to 2006 not previously analysed, one of the major aims of this research is to estimate key parameters of the wage equation and test whether market potential is a significant variable in explaining wage variation across Japan. In addition, given the topographic characteristics of Japan, we contemplate whether the mountainous landscape can be reflected in the process of estimation through the specification of the transport cost variable, an essential component of market potential which makes real geography matter. Spatial dependence is a fundamental property of data collected across spatial units particularly where unit boundaries are arbitrarily drawn. The importance of this property when fitting spatial econometric models is now well established, and in this research we incorporate a model for spatial dependence (Anselin 1988; Haining 2003; Arbia 2014). Finally, following Fingleton (2011), endogeneity between nominal wage and market potential will be allowed for in the estimation process.",2

Applying an econometric shift-share model to regional tourism developments,May 2017,Matthias Firgo,Oliver Fritz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Shift-share analysis is a well-established method to decompose growth rates into a structural and a “competitive” performance component. The method was applied for empirical analysis as early as in the 1960s (Dunn 1960) and since then has undergone numerous extensions and improvements. The original shift-share equation is an identity that decomposes any sectoral growth rate into three components: a growth effect with respect to a reference area, which in regional applications is commonly the national economy (“national share”), a structural effect (“proportional shift”), and a factor of competitive performance (“differential shift”). The latter implies a residual component of growth that indicates the relative competitive advantage or disadvantage of the specific regional sector at hand. However, the traditional shift-share approach has been widely criticized despite numerous extensions of the original approach (see, e.g., Knudsen and Barff 1991). A major concern is that the approach fails to measure a region’s performance independent of its given sectoral structure.Footnote 1 Consequently, the so-called dynamic regression shift-share analysis (Berzeg 1984) has been proposed to tackle these deficiencies.Footnote 2 In this approach, the shift-share identity is transformed into a stochastic, linear equation that can be estimated using standard econometric methods. In such a framework, the structural composition of the regional economy has no influence on the measurement of a region’s performance. The purpose of the present paper is twofold: Firstly, at least to our knowledge, we are the first to apply an econometric shift-share approach to the tourism industry in order to disentangle structural (i.e., the regional visitor mix) and region-idiosyncratic components (as an indicator for tourist appeal or attractiveness of the region) in analyzing long-run tourism developments.Footnote 3 To test the methodology and demonstrate its usefulness in a tourism context, we make use of annual data on the number of touristic overnight stays by origin country available at the level of Austrian NUTS 3 regions over a time span of 18 years. Secondly, we extend a model proposed by Marimon and Zilibotti (1998) to evaluate a region’s “actual” performance by comparing it to its “virtual” counterfactual that excludes all region-specific effects.Footnote 4 Unlike the original model, our extension accounts for the fact that small absolute changes in the target variable (overnight stays in our case) might translate into high relative changes in regions with only minor tourist activities and thus rather low absolute numbers of overnight stays. Also known as “shipbuilding in the midlands” problem (Möller and Tassinopoulos 2000), this issue becomes particularly relevant when analyzing spatial units of smaller scale (such as NUTS regions) and/or individual industrial sectors such as tourism rather than highly aggregated industrial sectors, and may drastically affect the measure of relative performance for all regions in the original Marimon and Zilibotti (1998) model due to the model constraints imposed. Tourist destinations are permanently competing for visitors with other destinations inside and outside their national boundaries. Measuring a destination’s performance and identifying the factors determining its competitive position has therefore received ample attention in the tourism economics literature (Crouch and Ritchie 2012). Most of this literature has dealt with constructing models and composite indicators based on competitiveness input factors such as prices, service quality, and environmental and historical attributes which determine the overall competitive position of a destination and thus its performance. A seminal model of this kind was proposed by Crouch and Ritchie (1999; see also Ritchie and Crouch 2003); other examples include the Integrated Destination Competitiveness Model by Dwyer and others (Dwyer and Kim 2003; Dwyer et al. 2004, 2014) and the Tourism and Travel Competitiveness Index (TTCI) by the World Economic Forum (first published by Blanke and Chiesa 2007). The econometric shift-share approach proposed in this paper departs from this literature in two respects: Firstly, it provides a performance measure for destinations (tourism regions) which controls for the impact of the region-specific visitor mix; secondly, it focuses directly on output of the tourism industry (number of overnight stays) rather than on input factors determining the output. The differences in absolute tourism numbers across regions are mainly determined by individual regions’ endowments with respect to the scenic, historic and/or cultural appeal. However, growth in regional tourism is commonly determined by a number of other factors: Firstly, a number of national factors such as political (in)stability in a country or changes in relative prices (for instance via exchange rates) may change national developments, as do national tourism branding and promotion efforts aiming at generating benefits across all tourist regions within a country. Secondly, the regional mix of visitors by their country of origin may push or depress total touristic demand in a region depending on how demand in a specific source market develops. Thirdly, the performance and growth of the regional tourism industries is heavily influenced by both private and public sector initiatives implemented at the regional or local level. Fourthly, the developments in all three factors in potential rival destination regions may affect a region’s tourism demand. While national tourism promotion activities are mainly exogenous for individual regions, the latter two determinants can be directly and indirectly influenced by regional policy makers. Frequently used policies and activities by tourism agencies include, for instance, regional and local destination marketing efforts in promising source countries (thus attempting to change the existing visitor structure). Faulkner (1997) and Smeral and Witt (2002), among others, stress the importance of a favorable portfolio of visitors to assess the overall competitive performance of tourist destinations. Furthermore, both private and public entities are engaged in improving the local and regional tourism infrastructure in order to secure and enhance the destination’s attractiveness and successfully cope with an increasingly competitive global tourism market. Disentangling the long-run effects induced by the structure of visitors from those of idiosyncratic changes in attractiveness should provide guidance as to which of these factors seems more relevant and thus may help in making decisions about resource allocation. In the Austrian case, we find substantial deviations in the growth rates of visitors from different countries of origin. However, our results suggest that for the long-run performance relative to peer regions, idiosyncratic shocks in regional tourist attractiveness are dominating the portfolio-effect of visitors’ origin countries in about two thirds of all regions. Also, a number of mega-events during the period analyzed seem to have had temporal positive effects for the host regions compared to their peer regions at most. Thus, tourism administrations should focus on increasing the permanent attractiveness of local tourist supply rather than putting too much effort into enhancing the portfolio of their visitors with respect to their countries of origin or into landing mega-events.",14

Smit,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Labour mobility can be a prime source of new ideas and new knowledge for a firm. Peter Hall extensively describes how Silicon Valley in its early years thrived on employees that moved seamlessly between different start-ups (Hall 1998, pp. 435–446). The more closed culture of the competing Route 128 cluster is often seen as a cause for its decline (Saxenian 1996). A broad range of literature, discussed below, has asked the question whether attracting new employees benefits a firm. The diversity of such inflows, where a receiving firm gains access to a diverse range of sources, has undeservedly not played a role in this literature. Hence, our key question is whether receiving new employees from a range of source firms is important for the success of the receiving firm. In addition, we believe the heterogeneity of such effects on firms of different sizes and sectors, and the contrast with traditional ‘black box’ agglomeration measures deserves more attention. Subtleties of academic argumentation are all too often lost in translation to policies, and correlations which are only valid in certain settings are too easily taken for universal laws. Instead, heterogeneous effects should have important policy implications. We therefore study the impact of new employees on the innovative and productive performance of firms. Besides the number of new employees, we include their diversity of source firms, and we are able to contrast this with the diversity of firms in the region. We then separate out the results for productivity by firm size and sector to test whether the effects are universal. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the literature on employee mobility; Sect. 3 discusses the analysis at hand; Sect. 4 describes the data sources; Sect. 5 presents the results; and Sect. 6 concludes.",2

A declining trend is already evident in the working-age population in each region, and household savings are starting to decline. When not accompanied by an increase in total factor productivity (TFP), reductions in labor input and the rate of capital increase reduce the potential growth rate of regional economies. Moreover, a rise in TFP requires technological innovations and greater productive efficiency. As such, structural economic reforms are necessary to enable the reallocation of economic resources currently employed in low productivity sectors to high productivity ones. A rise in TFP can be achieved by: (1) a shift in the production frontier, which amounts to an increase in production output for a given input volume (productivity effect); and (2) approaching the production frontier by ensuring actual production outputs closer to the production frontier levels for a given input volume (productive efficiency effect). The external economic factors of social overhead capital stock and population agglomeration affect both. Social overhead capital stock is the capital stock formed by annual public investment on key elements of the entire national economy, including agriculture, forestry and fisheries facilities, roads, harbors, airports, communications, parks, water supply and sewerage systems, social insurance and welfare facilities, schools, hospitals, and soil, water control and conservation facilities, as well as their smooth operation. This represents the accumulation of social overhead capital. The economic effects of social overhead capital stock are known as the effect of TFP increases (Ashauer 1989). Companies in areas where social capital is abundant can achieve a shorter time–distance, reducing transportation costs and increasing transportation volume by using social capital. These factors contribute to the improvement of firm TFP as an external economy. Regarding social overhead capital stock, the stock of social infrastructure that supports industrial activities, such as roads, harbors and airports, accounts for more than 50%. As such, the development of social infrastructure as social overhead capital stock increases is expected to improve regional productive ability, allowing regions to procure inputs and utilize production facilities more effectively, and, thus, produce goods at lower costs. Numerous previous studies demonstrate that a region with rich social infrastructure enjoys a TFP boost (Mera 1973; Merriman 1990; Kanemoto et al. 1996; Yamano and Ohkawara 2000). We also consider that social overhead capital stock enhances a firm’s product ability and strengthens regional economy TFP. Agglomeration—the tendency for populations, firms, or sectors to cluster—improves economic productivity. Agglomeration economies—the benefits accompanying agglomerations of people and companies—have long been discussed, being first proposed by Marshall (1890); they refer to the cost savings and increased productivity obtained when companies are spatially agglomerated. Agglomeration economies are conceptually classified into localization and urbanization economies (McCann 2001). Localization economies are those agglomeration effects that accrue to a group of firms belonging to the same industrial sector and located nearby. Urbanization economies are agglomeration economies that accrue to firms across various sectors. Empirical research indicates that these agglomeration economies contribute to improving regional economic productivity and global competitiveness (e.g., Eberts and McMillen 1999; Rosenthal and Strange 2004; Combes and Gobillon 2015). For example, the empirical impacts of localization and urbanization on productivity are examined by Henderson (2003) and Otsuka and Yamano (2008) using a production function approach. Otsuka et al. (2010) and Otsuka and Goto (2015a) demonstrate that industrial agglomeration improves productive efficiency in regional economies and is the driving force behind TFP growth. These studies report that firms in a high density area benefit from external economies. If companies are spatially agglomerated, technical knowledge generated by one can easily spill over to others through channels such as face-to-face communication and the movement of skilled workers among companies. That is, these agglomeration economies contribute to the improvement of regional economic productivity by creating technical knowledge and its resultant spillover through both types of agglomeration (Fujita and Thisse 2002). Although social overhead capital stock and population agglomeration are both important in determining the TFP of a regional economy, previous research has considered productivity and productive efficiency effects separately. Moreover, there is limited consideration for these two effects simultaneously, which is essential for regional economies’ growth policies in Japan. Improving TFP is important for realizing sustained growth in the regional economies of Japan. Therefore, this study focuses on TFP determinants in these economies and performs empirical analysis of TFP growth. Additionally, preferred regional policy measures are discussed. This study’s contributions to existing research are threefold. First, it considers social overhead capital and population agglomeration and analyzes their productivity effects (shift in production frontier) and productive efficiency effects (ascending along an existing production frontier) simultaneously. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no previous studies consider these effects simultaneously. Important previous research on social overhead capital focuses on detecting the productivity effect of social overhead capital stock (Mera 1973; Merriman 1990; Kanemoto et al. 1996; Yamano and Ohkawara 2000). Few studies focus on the efficiency effect of social overhead capital stock—exceptions include Puig-Junoy (2001), Kim et al. (1999) and Kim and Lee (2002)—and adequate subject understanding is lacking. Moreover, empirical analyses of agglomeration economies traditionally focus on the productivity effect (Rosenthal and Strange 2004; Combes and Gobillon 2015). Recent analyses focus on the productive efficiency effect (Beeson and Husted 1989; Mitra 1999, 2000; Driffield and Munday 2001; Tveteras and Battese 2006; Otsuka et al. 2010; Otsuka and Goto 2015a). However, no attempts to understand the effect of agglomeration on TFP from both perspectives, the productivity and productive efficiency effects, exist. Second, using the TFP index, this study tackles endogeneity, which occurs in productivity analyses that use the production function. Most previous studies that examine the economic effects of social overhead capital stock and agglomeration vis-à-vis productivity use the production function (Rosenthal and Strange 2004; Combes and Gobillon 2015). This results in an endogeneity problem, which is known to generate estimation result bias (Ciccone and Hall 1996; Ciccone 2002; Henderson 2003; Rosenthal and Strange 2004; Graham 2009; Graham et al. 2010; Combes and Gobillon 2015).Footnote 1 It is important to control this bias in empirical analysis. The TFP index approach can avoid estimation bias due to endogeneity because we do not need to estimate a specific production function with specific factors representing externalities in calculating TFP. Otsuka and Goto (2015b) show that it is possible to resolve the problem of endogeneity in the measurement of agglomeration economies using the TFP index approach. Third, this study considers the effect of the regional industrial structure on productive efficiency. Internationally competitive companies are mostly concentrated in regions with a large manufacturing sector presence, and the productive efficiency of the regional economy in these regions is expected to be high. Conversely, in the services sector, numerous industry types are labor intensive, and because labor productivity is low, the productive efficiency of the regional economy is also expected to be low. Otsuka et al. (2010) and Otsuka and Goto (2015a) show that, in Japan, the manufacturing sector has higher-than-average productive efficiency and, in contrast, non-manufacturing industries have lower-than-average productive efficiency. Therefore, this study proposes the precise level of TFP in regional economies by considering both effects simultaneously, taking previous research as reference. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and data of empirical analysis using the measurement of TFP indexes and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Section 3 presents and interprets the estimation results of the model. Section 4 concludes and provides policy suggestions.",29

An analysis for US states and counties using a multilevel approach,May 2017,Alberto Díaz Dapena,Fernando Rubiera Morollón,Dusan Paredes Araya,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Convergence among territories has always attracted the attention of regional scientists since the early papers by Kuznets (1955), Easterlin (1960) and Williamson (1965), among others. In these initial studies, the evolution of spatial disparities is studied using one or other key variable such as per capita income or productivity. A kind of standard deviation is normally used in these measurements to represent the level of dispersion, usually labeled as \({\sigma }\)-convergence. The seminal paper by Baumol (1986) introduced the concept of \({\beta }\)-convergence. In line with the basic postulate of decreasing returns of neoclassical models (Solow 1956), Baumol proposed studying the relation between the growth rate and the initial level of that variable in a set of territories, countries or regions. If the estimated slope of this relationship (\({\beta }\) parameter) has a negative sign, this will indicate that lower levels of income per capita produce higher growth rates, leading to a process of convergence in the long run. The value of the parameter also allows the calculation of the rate of convergence. In his initial approach, Baumol (1986) proposed studying the relationship between productivity growth between 1870 and 1979 and labor productivity in 1870 using a cross section of countries. He obtained a negative and significantly weak relationship, which indicated a slow rate of convergence in productivity between different countries. The idea of \({\beta }\)-convergence was promptly applied by other authors to study the convergence in GDP per capita at different spatial scales. Sala-i-Martin (1994) applied it in their study of regional convergence in GDP per capita in several countries: the UK (1950–1990), the USA (1880–1990), France (1950–1990), Germany (1950–1990) and Italy (1950–1990). Coulombe and Lee (1993), Shioji (1992), Koo et al. (1998) and De la Fuente (2002) extended the application of the concept to Canada, Japan, Korea and Spain, respectively. These and other analyses concur in finding that poor regions generally grow faster than rich ones but with weak processes of convergence: approximately 2% of the speed of convergence.Footnote 1 As explained by Barro et al. (1991), at least 35 years are necessary to reduce the initial differences in income by one half. However, other researchers state that different results can also be found. For example, Tsionas (2000) and Ganong and Shoag (2012) observed that it appears that US states were not converging during a recent period: the distribution of regional income in the last several decades showed only slight variations, with the \(\beta \)-convergence estimation indicating a pattern of divergence or very slow convergence. In this sense, the meta-analysis by Abreu et al. (2005) offers an extraordinary revision and evaluation of the named “legendary two-percent”. Using a dataset of approximately 600 estimations taken from a random sample of empirical growth studies published in peer-reviewed journals, they concluded that this two-percent ratio is not as frequent and that when the analysis is corrected for unobserved heterogeneity in technology levels, endogeneity on the explanatory variables or other factors such as financial and fiscal levels of development, it provokes important differences in the convergence ratios. They also found that at a regional level, the convergence is normally lower than the two-percent. The policy implications of convergence studies and the weakness of the conclusions obtained call for an improvement in the economic analysis with more precise results. This means an exhaustive review of applicable econometric approaches. All of the aforementioned studies were based on cross-sectional data, mostly employing OLS regressions. This implies important limitations on the analyses and the possibility of significant estimation problems. In order to structure the recent advances in the empirical estimation of convergence models, Islam (2003), Magrini (2004) and Alexiadis (2013) present outstanding surveys of the evolution of this topic in recent years. These authors differentiated four types of approaches: (i) panel data, (ii) time series, (iii) convergence clubs and (iv) spatial dependence. One of the more relevant contributions was made by using panel data in the estimation procedure. \({\beta }\)-convergence regresses the income per capita or similar variable growth rate in a territory on the initial level of that variable. It is clear that this regression should be controlled by the initial conditions of each region. When no other control variable is considered, we talk about an analysis of unconditional \({\beta }\)-convergence, whereas if another explanatory variable is included, we conduct a conditional \({\beta }\)-convergence analysis. However, having extensive databases that provide information on the initial state of the region is not easy and lack of information usually restricts the possibilities of researchers. Panel data permits introducing a procedure based on fix-effects, see Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988) and Arellano and Bond (1991), thanks to which it is possible to control the different initial characteristics of each spatial unit, see Caselli et al. (1996). Using different panel data for the period 1960–1985, Islam (1995) reports that countries are converging very rapidly, but not at the same or similar level of income per capita. 
Quah (1992), Bernard and Durlauf (1995) and Carlino and Mills (1996) check the stochastic convergence in time series with a unit root test, which makes it possible to check whether there are persistent differences in the series of income or total production. For instance, Carlino and Mills (1996) study US data from 1929 to 1990, finding evidence of unit roots in state income levels and persistent state-specific shocks which imply a lack of stochastic convergence. They demonstrate that, by allowing for a trend break in 1946, stationary-specific shocks are found in the two sub-periods, which are consistent with stochastic convergence. In general, these applications of time series to convergence tend to reject the existence of convergence. Finally, since the contributions of Anselin (1988), regional analysis should always consider spatial interactions and spatial heterogeneity; see Anselin and Florax (1995) or Anselin and Rey (1997), among others, for a review of the literature. Krugman (1987) pointed out the influence of spillovers on economic growth, making them a very relevant factor in the convergence analysis, especially for local data. 
Rey and Mountouri (1999), Durlauf et al. (2001), and Durlauf et al. (2005) establish the basis of spatial econometrics in convergence models. Ertur et al. (2006), Ertur and Koch (2007) and Ramajo et al. (2008) constitute some examples of this approach to the \({\beta }\)-convergence estimation. All these contributions solve most of the estimation problems, significantly improving the quality of the analysis. Nevertheless, the basic conclusion is similar to that reached in the initial studies: processes of convergence are usually observed, although these processes are both weak and slow, besides presenting the possibility of different levels of stationary states. However, the relevance of the spatial unit and the level of disaggregation is practically not considered. Lack of information and the neoclassical framework on which the initial models were built partially explain the lack of attention paid to these features in convergence models. Simultaneously, a parallel body of literatureFootnote 2 reported that aggregated data could conceal heterogeneous intraregional patterns of behavior. Some papers explore this idea from a statistical perspective; see, for example, Arbia and Petrarca (2011). Díaz-Dapena et al. (2016) carried out a particular analysis focused on \({\beta }\)-convergence models and found a significant bias in the estimations when local data are aggregated within large regions or states. Miller and Genc (2005) and Resende (2011) evaluated this question with empirical approaches using different data. Miller and Genc (2005) estimated \({\beta }\)-convergence equations over the period 1969–1997 for different types of Economic Areas, states and counties in the US and found no evidence of a significant effect of scale on their results. Likewise, Resende (2011) explored the case of Brazil in 1991–2000 from data at the scale of states, spatial clusters, micro-regions and municipalities and found a problem of aggregation in the results. We believe that it is possible to contribute to the extensive previous literature on regional convergence by indicating the relevance of the different trends at different spatial levels of disaggregation. Our idea is not completely new in the field of economic geography. Li and Wei (2010) applied it to analyze spatial inequalities in China. However, this is the first time that it has been used in a \({\beta }\)-convergence model. Furthermore, it could constitute an important issue for convergence studies for many reasons. First, the Neoclassical theories explaining economic convergence do not specify the exact spatial level at which the economy operates. Although steady-state differences are expected to be more important between countries than within them, New Economic Geography highlights the importance of within differences caused by core-periphery and cumulative processes (see Krugman 1991; Fujita et al. 2001 or Fujita and Thisse 2013). According to this literature, central locations generate positive incentives toward the concentration of the activity in a few places. Because of this debate, researchers do not have sufficient information to determine whether convergence should be measured at a county, regional, province or state level (Hoover 1971). Moreover, researchers do not necessarily need to choose just one level. Rather, the econometric strategy should be able to capture all of these scales simultaneously in a unified framework. Multilevel modeling helps by mixing the entire scale in a single empirical approach. Second, the explicit and prior choice of a specific level of aggregation could have inevitable effects on the conclusions reached. Although this problem has been the subject of a significant number of papers in fields such as spatial econometrics, we think that its consequences on convergence modeling have not yet been extensively studied. Finally, the correct specification of multilevel structure in the convergence model helps provide a better estimation of standard error, given the recognition of clustered errors (Díaz-Dapena et al. 2016). The objective of this paper is to propose an estimation of the standard \({\beta }\)-convergence regression, but using a hierarchical geographic structure: namely, how regional convergence is shaped when we accept that counties and states interact simultaneously to define a catch-up condition. Our aim is to contribute to both these perspectives by: (i) presenting a proposal for the estimation technique which overcomes the limitations of standard procedures, simultaneously using different regional scales; and (ii) finding evidence regarding the possibility of there being overall patterns of convergence which are coherent with heterogeneous intraregional trends. We use the widely known economy of the USA to compare our estimations with previous research, thus allowing the generation of debate using the generally accepted existing literature. In addition, recent literature has been interested in this economy due to the reduction of the convergence in the last decades—see Ganong and Shoag (2012). The paper is structured as follows. The specific approach we shall use, i.e., multilevel analysis as well as the database, are explained in the following section. Its empirical application and results are summarized in Sect. 3. The main discussion of these results and our conclusions are included in the last section.",3

Murray,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The founding principles of regional science revolve around the use of rigorous analytical methods from multiple disciplines to address real-world problems and issues (Isard 2003). Analytics is central. The Oxford dictionary defines analytics as the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. In fact, the past decade has seen considerable gravitation toward the broad term “analytics” to refer to the development and application of quantitative methods relied upon. Analytics preceded by the terms location, decision, predictive, visual, applied, prescriptive, health, big data, etc., are very commonly found in the description of research, as titles of symposia and as names of national/international conferences. Consider for a moment the business analytics definition (Evans 2016): “... use of data, information technology, statistical analysis, quantitative methods, and mathematical or computer-based models to help managers gain improved insight about their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions.” This is strikingly similar in intent and meaning as most other \({<}\)blank\({>}\) analytics specialty areas. The significance of analytics goes beyond the mere use of the term. Programs offering degrees of some sort in analytics can be found at many if not most universities. Worth particular note is the Master of Urban Spatial Analytics at University of Pennsylvania, an institution central in the emergence and development of regional science. Learned societies too have made changes to recognize analytics. As an example, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), which has about 11,000 members, has also embraced analytics as a descriptive terms of what members do. Established essentially in the early 1950s, it identifies itself as the largest society in the field of operations research, management science and analytics, including as members people in engineering, mathematics, statistics, business, economics, (some geographers) and others. What is most noteworthy is the movement toward and inclusion of the term analytics in recent years to characterize a field when it has historically been operations research/management science since the early 1950s, as the very name suggests. Finally, the significance of analytics can also be seen in the journal Environment and Planning B, an outlet that many regional scientists have regularly published in. With Environment and Planning established in the late 1960s, Environment and Planning B was a spinoff in 1974, subtitled Planning and Design. This year it has become Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science. Noteworthy indeed given the prominence of the journal, but reflecting the significance of analytics as a reference to the type of work done in the areas of interest to the journal. With this in mind, a strong implication of these observed trends is the emergence of regional analytics as a reflection of the tools and techniques relied upon in regional science. Does this make sense? Are there benefits to such thinking and strategic positioning? Frankly, should we care? The remainder of the paper is devoted to analytics and regional science.",12

One of the main areas of policy is access to capital which is based on the belief that the credit market does not work as expected or that the credit markets fail when it comes to small and minority-owned business (Aghion et al. 2007; Bates 1989). One main intention of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 enacted in the USA was to address some of the issues emanating from this argument. More generally, the enactment of the CRA was a result of the argument that banks fail to provide credit in minority and low-income neighborhoods and to small businesses and small farms. Continuing concerns about redlining and other credit market failures, and beliefs that credit access and homeownership grant social benefits motivated ongoing support for and strengthening of the CRA in the 1990s. The CRA encourages commercial banks and savings institutions to help meet credit needs of their local communities including low- and moderate-income (LMI) areasFootnote 1 in a manner consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and small business support is an important aspect of this practice. The regulations under the CRA are implemented through a series of coercive actions by the federal regulators. The regulators evaluate depository institutions periodically on how they help meet credit needs of communities using mandatory reporting requirements maintained by depository institutions. Members of a community may submit comments on performance of a particular depository institution and those comments will be taken into consideration during the next CRA examination. A depository institution’s CRA performance record is taken into account in considering its application for deposit facilities.Footnote 2
 The Act was revised in 1995 and among the changes was the implementation of institutional reporting requirements. The reported data permit analysis of trends and geographic distribution of the loans reported under the act and the impacts of the legislation on various economic outcomes over the space. A central question, which this paper seeks to answer, is whether the CRA lending practices are associated with small businesses dynamics. This question is of importance to policy makers and regulators in order to see if the expected objectives of the CRA are accomplished, but currently there is very little evidence about the impact of such loans on small business dynamics. This paper is an attempt toward that direction and examines the effects of small business loans that were reported under CRA reporting requirements by lending institutions on small business growth. More specifically, we use geographic (cross-county) and time variation in CRA small business loans to evaluate empirically the relationship between CRA loans and small business growth rate in the USA over the period between 1996 and 2010. The CRA small business loans were expected to exert a significant impact on small businesses dynamics. We hypothesize that loan amounts reported as CRA by lending institutions are positively associated with small business growth at the county level,Footnote 3 measured by annual business establishment growth rates. The paper reports a comprehensive multivariate analysis of the relationship between small business growth rate and the CRA small business loans as a percent of county real income and other factors associated with small business dynamics. Measured in terms of the amount of outstanding small business loans, and the different sizes of these loans, we find that in general, these loans have a statistically significant positive effect on small business establishment growth in the USA. Since the supply of loans itself may depend in part on the demand for it, that is, on the growth of small businesses, we also conducted instrumental variable analysis. Our results remained robust to these specifications. For example, doubling of CRA loans that are <$100,000 as a percent of county total real income for small businesses results in about 19% increase in the growth rate of those businesses in a county, ceteris paribus. Our findings are consistent with the theoretical literature on access to capital and business dynamics. Our evidence is also consistent with the findings documented in several recent empirical papers that focus on access to finance and small business development and the general strand of literature on access to finance and economic growth. We also divide the all counties sample into several subsamples, namely rural, urban, and low and moderate income (LMI) and find the results to be consistent with those of the full sample specification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a descriptive analysis of small business growth in the USA, and Sect. 3 presents a descriptive analysis of CRA small business loans. Section 4 lays out theoretical considerations for the empirical approach and discusses related literature. Section 5 presents the empirical model. Section 6 describes the data and variables, followed by Sect. 7 which describes empirical strategy. Section 8 presents estimation results and discusses robustness of results. Section 9 concludes.",17

Particular attention has been given to the tendency of innovative firms to concentrate in particular areas, such as Silicon Valley in California and Route 128 in Massachusetts (Saxenian 1994; Trigilia 2008). This has pushed policy-makers to invest heavily in the co-location of private companies, universities, and other centres primarily involved in research activities. However, co-location is not sufficient for the emergence of collaboration. Specific investments by firms are required to identify and connect to useful partners for the exchange of knowledge (Fitjar and Rodríguez-Pose 2016). Some clusters are therefore characterised by little knowledge exchange among actors, being mere co-locations of organisations (Philippen and van der Knaap 2007). On this basis, a growing literature studies the various networks produced by co-located firms in regions or clusters (e.g. Giuliani and Bell 2005; Morrison et al. 2013). A key question is why some clusters develop dense inter-organisational networks, while others remain mainly co-locations of related firms. From a policy perspective, the question of whether and, if so, how policy can stimulate knowledge exchange among co-located actors is of particular importance. Italy has been a paradigmatic case in this context, with both scholarly attention to—and policy support for—the development of industrial districtsFootnote 1 (e.g. Becattini 1990; Piore and Sabel 1984). In recent years, policy-makers have invested intensively in the implementation of technology districts in Italy. These aim to foster firms’ innovation capabilities and the competitiveness of local production systems by creating synergies among firms, universities, research centres and local authorities located within limited territorial boundaries (Bertamino et al. 2014). Some of these districts are located in Southern Italy, which has traditionally received less attention in the literature on industrial districts. Among these clusters, the mechatronics district in Apulia (MEDIS)—where the present research was carried out—was classified by Cersosimo and Viesti (2012) as one of the six most notable, dense and differentiated clusters in Southern Italy in terms of businesses and institutions involved. The MEDIS was created in 2007 in the form of a limited liability consortium and since the early phases of its implementation has focused partly on an indirect policy measureFootnote 2 aiming to strengthen relationships among its members. This policy measure has sought to promote collaboration based on the joint presence of its members in research projects and programmes (partnerships). The paper analyses this policy action, asking whether it has been associated with more collaboration and stronger ties among organisations in the industrial district. In order to address this, the analysis compares two distinct periods (2008–2010 and 2011–2013; see Giuliani 2013; Balland et al. 2016), corresponding to the period during which the policy was implemented. Additional preliminary and follow-up qualitative interviews were carried out before, during and after the data collection. Social network analysis (SNA) methods and techniques were used to analyse the dynamics of collaboration in terms of network structure. The paper makes two main contributions: first, it aims to contribute to the cluster policy evaluation literature (Giuliani and Pietrobelli 2011, 2016) by focusing on an indirect policy measure based on coordination and networking actions, while most earlier literature has focused on harder measures such as direct R&D support (see Nishimura and Okamuro 2011) . Second, it aims to contribute to the body of literature examining knowledge exchange and policies in peripheral and less innovative regions. This study of the Apulian mechatronics district is furthermore among the first case studies analysing knowledge exchange dynamics in a southern Italian technology cluster. The article is organised as follows: in the next section, the literature regarding knowledge exchange and policy measures at the cluster level is reviewed with the objective to determine the theoretical background of the study. Section 3 offers an overview of the socio-economic fabric of Southern Italy and describes the main characteristics of the MEDIS. Section 4 explains the methodology adopted. In Sect. 5, the results of the policy are analysed by using the aforementioned methods and techniques. Finally, in Sect. 6, the major results are discussed and the conclusions are presented.",6

Evidence from a hedonic valuation approach,July 2017,Hector M. Nuñez,Dusan Paredes,Rafael Garduño-Rivera,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Although hedonic valuation literature has widely identified the role of amenities to explain the regional differentials of wages and rents, there is a lack of empirical analysis to measure the economic valuation of amenities in less developed countries. As Lavín et al. (2011) pointed out, this shortage is due to the lack of information on crucial amenities such as air quality, traffic congestion indicators, and insecurity (or homicidal violence), especially at municipal level. This article argues that this gap is a problem related not only to information availability, but also to the social and economic realities of these countries, which require a different conceptualization of the appropriate analysis. For most developed countries, disamenities like crime and insecurity are a serious disincentive to local housing prices and wages (Aslam and Corrado 2011; Berger et al. 2008; Roback 1982, 1988). Although the empirical applications fit very well for these contexts because people are willing to avoid dense, insecure, and polluted regions for cleaner, safer, and sparser areas, this preference appears not to be enough to explain why populations in less developed countries concentrate in dense areas like capital cities even if other cities offer lower costs of living (Krugman 1999). Using this perspective, this article asks: how would this economic valuation change if scholars interpreted these disamenities as economic opportunities to increase wages? For example, could local inhabitants see an illegal activity as an amenity? This potential interpretation opens new research questions for less developed countries and requires empirical tests of the hypothesis that illegal activities are amenities. This article explores the case of Mexico for several reasons. First, the literature has widely highlighted the alarmingly levels of Mexican crime, which is mainly associated with drug trafficking (Pan et al. 2012; Rios 2008). Second, the illegal-drug market in Mexico deals with high profits that could make some citizens better off (Reuter and Kleiman 1986). Third, drug trafficking in Mexico follows a clear spatial pattern, in which main clusters of crime are consistently located near the US border (Vilalta 2013). These facts enable us to test our hypothesis about the potential differentiation of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) between the North and the rest of Mexico. This research expects that insecure conditions are disamenities in those states where inhabitants do not see illegal drug trafficking as a regular economic activity. Fourth, this research uses the context of one country to exploit similar and homogeneous institutional backgrounds, namely different institutional rules could form different mechanisms in different countries, in which our empirical strategy might not capture. This paper uses Roback’s (1982) hedonic wage and rent theory to compute the MWTP for crime and other amenities in Mexico. In the estimation process, this research proposes a nested specification for wages and rents to estimate the shadow prices for each amenity, including, of course, crime rates. After estimating the MWTP for crime rates at the state and municipality level, we use regional exploratory analysis both to test whether the regional pattern of MWTP follows a significant non-random pattern and to build confidence intervals of MWTP to test whether our estimations are significant across all of Mexico. Using data from the Mexican Household Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH), along with other information available at municipal and state levels from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography’s (INEGI) Population and Economic Censuses (and Surveys), our results show that amenities do reduce the income differential across regions. This research suggests that illegal earning opportunities outweigh crime disamenity by those inhabitants of traditional drug-trafficking states, like Sinaloa and Baja California (in the Northwest). Regarding other amenities, this paper finds evidence that higher pollution and commuting time negatively affects income and rents, while climate conditions effect is unclear.",6

More and more people live in urban areas than in rural areas, with 54% of the world’s population residing in urban areas in 2014, as compared to just 30% in 1950 (United Nations 2014). Urbanization is not only relevant to the physical construction but a range of disciplines including urban planning, geography, economics, sociology, and public health. As the world continues to urbanize, a series of challenges will be increasingly encountered in cities, particularly in the lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is the fastest. Meanwhile, rapid urbanization characterized by urban agglomeration is also causing many problems including population concentration, high rent, congestion, and environmental contamination. These are considered urban malaise that pose a threat to urban health. In fact, an upward trend in population explosion, traffic congestion, land use conversion, and air pollution is becoming an important concern, and it is drawing worldwide attention from not only scientists but also from politicians and the public. Therefore, sustainable urban policies to improve the life quality, economic growth, and environmental conservation are needed. In other words, it is necessary to establish an integrated urban model to illustrate how land use and traffic behavior interact with each other and test how infrastructure planning and urban policies would influence urban agglomeration. As this is a central issue concerning urban planners and policymakers, there has been considerable research into integrated urban modeling for optimum urban policies. Starting from the conceptual model of interactive land use–transport system and their causal loop, urban economic theories represented by computable urban economic (CUE) model are employed to simulate how urban land use pattern affects travel behavior and transport system and vice versa (Ueda et al. 2013). Anas (1996, 1999, 2007) presented a spatial urban computable general equilibrium model (RELU-TRAN), which takes into account location choice and traffic assignment models in order to describe the interactive mechanism between regional economy, land use, and transportation. The RELU-TRAN model has been applied to urban policy simulation through a series of market equilibrium conditions under which consumers’ and producers’ behaviors are defined explicitly by utility and profit maximization. Following the spatial urban computable general equilibrium model, a number of CUE models based on standard urban economic theories have been developed for urban policy analysis (Ueda et al. 1993, 2013; Takagi et al. 1999; Yamasaki et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2016), though a few model structures were simplified in market sector or transport assignment to improve the implementation of the model. Undoubtedly, CUE model used to simulate the urban land use and transport interaction, which is consistent with the microeconomic theory, can be seen as a powerful analytical tool for urban planning and infrastructure policy evaluation. However, economies of scale, which are the primary cause of urban agglomeration, namely population concentration and clustered industries, have not been considered in the existing CUE modeling, though the existence of scale economies has been proved in a variety of empirical studies (Quigley 1998). Urban modeling and simulation without regard to economies of scale might draw an evaluation result quite different from the reality where agglomeration effects exist. In recent years, with the development of New Economic Geography (Krugman 1991) that provides a practical methodology to model the mechanism of urban agglomeration, economies of scale have been gradually considered in economic modeling (Dixit and Stiglitz 1977; Fujita 1988; Tabuchi 1998; Glazer et al. 2003). Hence, it is also conceivable to introduce economies of scale and agglomeration to computable urban economic modeling. The purpose of this paper is to develop a CUE model incorporated with economies of scale and to provide an operable analytical tool for urban planning and infrastructure policymaking. The agglomeration in the CUE model is driven by the positive feedback mechanism between location of retail industries and households. Such feedback system was mentioned by Lowry (1964) to describe the phenomenon that households locate in regions where more retail industries exist, and vice versa. This paper further explicitly explains the mechanism by use of Dixit–Stiglitz type utility function within the general equilibrium framework. More precisely, the study intends to investigate how urban land use and transport pattern influence each other, as well as the forming process of urban spatial morphology and agglomerations through using an extended CUE model. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the study area and detects the urban agglomerations in study area. Section 3 formulates the model structure. Section 4 describes the numerical computation and provides a discussion of urban agglomerations simulated by CUE model extended with economies of scale. Section 5 concludes the main summaries and findings with a recommendation of future research tasks.",9
59.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,13 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-017-0830-9,Local manufacturing productivity markers: an empirical study of the Italian counties,July 2017,Stefano Manzocchi,Beniamino Quintieri,Gianluca Santoni,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Low productivity dynamics is a main concern for Southern EU economies, especially since the outburst of the world financial crisis of 2007–2008. The weakness of productivity trends makes it difficult to improve living standards, make public finances sustainable, and to cope with the membership arrangements of the European Monetary Union. These considerations apply even more forcefully to productivity trends in the manufacturing sector. Industry is by definition more open to international trade than many service sectors and is commonly associated with a more competitive context where productivity rises on average faster than in the service sector. Manufacturing productivity has been sluggish in several EU Southern economies over the last 20 years, and this has contributed to the worsening of aggregate economic outcomes. An interesting issue in this respect is to analyse how much of the productivity performance is related to the behaviour of drivers internal to manufacturing firms, or to external drivers associated with some features of the geographical location of the enterprises. Italy, for instance, is the EU country where inter-regional differences in per capita income are the largest, according to the EU Commission. Interestingly, this is not only reflected in the well-known North–South divide but is also true at a more disaggregated level. Indeed, large differentials persist in the level and dynamics of productivity across individual regions and counties in Italy. An intriguing and policy-sensitive question is to investigate whether these differentials can be accounted for by local external markers such as the innovation environment, the quality of local political institutions, market proximity and infrastructures, financial development, and to assess which of these and other variables are significant. The policy implications of measuring the impact of local external markers of productivity growth are far-reaching. For instance, the more some of the external factors listed above can be shown to account for local productivity dynamics, and the more policymakers can focus on the right targets in order to set favourable conditions for inter-regional convergence towards higher productivity standards. The reduction of geographic economic imbalances in Europe is one of the main objectives of EU regional policies, as suggested in the “Europe 2020” policy framework, and some main expenditure items of the EU budget are devoted to this objective. Wage setting rules and practices can be also concerned if one recognizes that part of a firm’s productivity outcomes are not due to internal efficiency or to the quality of the internal inputs, but rather to external factors beyond the scope of the firm. If this is the case, wage setting at local or company level must take into account not only the effort and the quality of the internal inputs, but also the local conditions affecting productivity performance. In this paper, we focus on productivity differentials across 63,000 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2001–2010, in order to disentangle the role of external versus internal productivity markers. We track total factor productivity (TFP) dynamics for individual firms located in one of 103 home counties and investigate the determinants of TFP at the external (county) level. We find that a limited set of external local variables related to institutional quality, market access, financial development and the innovation environment significantly contribute to explain manufacturing productivity dispersion in Italy. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide a selected review of the recent empirical literature on productivity markers. In Sect. 3, we describe our empirical methodology while in Sect. 4 we list our variables and their sources. In Sect. 5, we provide econometric results and discuss them.

For instance, increasing on-the-job training participation quotas is featured prominently in the Strategic Framework for European Cooperation in Education and Training 2020 under the Lisbon Strategy of the EU (EU Council 2009).Footnote 1 This policy effort focuses on skills since in most European countries, as in other industrialized countries, human capital-intensive sectors are the driving forces of GDP growth (Barro 2001; Cohen and Soto 2007). Keeping the skill set of the workforce up-to-date in a context of constantly changing economic conditions can be challenging. The ongoing digitalization and automation is just one example of current labor market challenges in this respect. Recent analyses suggest that 6–12% of jobs in OECD countries may become redundant due to automation and that the skill requirements for another 25% of jobs are bound to change immensely (Arntz et al. 2016). Hence, further training of today’s workforce can help to renew employees’ skills to meet the requirements of future skill demands. To foster further training of employees, knowledge on its determinants—i.e., who receives training and who does not—is important for policy makers. In the large literature concerned with training determinants, researchers have concentrated on the “usual” characteristics which are individual, job and firm characteristics (Bassanini et al. 2007; Büchel and Pannenberg 2004; Grund and Martin 2012; Yendell 2013). In this literature, labor economists have largely neglected the spatial dimension of training investments. This paper fills this research gap by investigating how regional factors influence employees’ continuous training participation. The focus of this paper lies on answering the research question whether a high regional density of training suppliers is correlated with employees’ training participation conditional on individual, job, firm and other regional factors. From a policy point of view, this is an important research question. In recent years, subsidy and voucher programs to foster training participation have been introduced in different European countries, for instance, in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands (Brunello et al. 2012). Such programs can be targeted either at the supply-side or at the demand-side, i.e., subsidizing training suppliers or subsidizing training participants, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any study investigating whether and to which extent training supply is associated with training participation. Even though we provide only correlations of this relationship, we think it is an important first step to answering this research question. In the absence of any statistical significant correlations (conditional on a variety of regional factors), one would be rather pessimistic about the importance of supply-side factors for training activities. In the theoretical context, training participation takes place when training returns exceed training costs (Becker 1962). Therefore, one of the decisive factors for nonparticipation are training costs which can be either pecuniary (e.g., tuition fees) or non-pecuniary (e.g., time). Tuor and Backes-Gellner (2009) show empirically that having to give up free time for training discourages participation even more than having to spend money for training. Training costs also arise because participants have to travel to the suppliers of training. Traveling costs should be higher, the lower the number of regional training suppliers. The literature that is concerned with the more general topic of regional training determinants is small. One strand of the literature concentrates on how regional economic density (measured as the number of employees per square kilometer) impacts training incidence. For instance, Muehlemann and Wolter (2011) find that dense local labor markets are negatively associated with the provision of apprenticeship training by firms in Switzerland. Similarly, Brunello and de Paola (2008) and Brunello and Gambarotto (2007) find that regional employee density has a negative effect on training participation in Italy and the UK, respectively. This also holds true for Germany, where employees participate less in on-the-job training when they work in local labor markets with a high number of firms in the same industry (Rzepka and Tamm 2016). These studies find suggestive empirical support for the existence of the poaching externality. Bellmann et al. (2011) took a broader approach by investigating a variety of different regional determinants for firms’ investments in training of their employees; in particular, they examine the population density, the unemployment rate and the industrial concentration. The authors only detect a statistically significantly negative coefficient for the regional unemployment rate. Using data from the National Educational Panel Study, this paper estimates the determinants of individuals’ training participation considering the regional training supply and a variety of other regional factors in addition to the usual characteristics. As there is no single perfect measure of training supply, we will use two alternative data sets on training supply to check the robustness of our results. This paper contributes to the literature in various aspects. It is the first to take a closer look at supply-side aspects of training participation. While in the economics of education the proximity to colleges was already identified as a determinant of educational attainment (Card 1995; Spiess and Wrohlich 2010), there is no such evidence for training. This is one of the first papers investigating the role of traveling costs approximated by the density of training suppliers for training participation. Since policy makers are also concerned with equity issues of training and equal opportunities (Bassanini et al. 2007), regional variation in training supply affecting training participation creates regional imbalances which could be addressed by regional policies. Furthermore, given the small number of papers being concerned with regional determinants, we also contribute to the literature by considering its importance empirically.Footnote 2
 The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we describe the data (putting a particular focus on comparing the two measures of training supply) and we discuss the empirical strategy. Section three is devoted to presenting and interpreting the results. The final section concludes the study.",4

Japan can be considered one of the most urbanized countries in the world. The World Bank estimated that roughly \(93\%\) of the Japanese population lived in urban areas in 2015. Huge populations settled in very small extents of habitable land in Japan, creating high-density cities along the country’s plains and shorelines. This is the main factor that shaped the Japanese industry into a high-density agglomerated economy. Tabuchi and Yoshida (2000) suggested an expected \(10\%\) wage increase when the Japanese city population doubles. Because of its unique spatial distribution, Japan could be one of the most suitable candidates for case studies to investigate the relationship between regional agglomeration and productivity. Furthermore, the rapid development of transportation in Japan after World War II, such as the development of the high-speed railways and extensive investments on expressway networks, can be regarded the main factor that induced agglomeration economies along the densely inhabited Japanese shorelines. From an economic perspective, such agglomeration benefits due to transportation investment can be treated as a technological growth. Christensen et al. (1947) estimated a total factor productivity (TFP) growth of 4.02% in Japan from 1943 to 1973 and a capital and labor growth of 3.28 and 2.21%, respectively. Although the Japanese economy faced its first economic crisis in the late 1980s, the contribution of TFP growth to the country’s total economic growth is still significant. Despite the lower total growth after the economic crisis, the TFP growth contributed to up to around 30% of the total growth (Fukao 2013). However, Fukao (2013) showed a change in the trend of TFP growth among the industrial sectors, with an increasing trend in the service sector and a decreasing trend in the manufacturing sector. When investigating economic growth by considering agglomeration as one of the contributions to TFP, it would be interesting to investigate the agglomeration sensitivity of each industrial sectors, especially during the dynamic change from before the economic crisis to after the crisis in Japan. An agglomeration economy is typically defined as a benefit of firms staying close together. The concept of industrial scale of economies in Marshall (1890) has been further formulated into three factors leading to agglomeration economies, all closely related to transportation service. First, agglomeration creates clusters of firms wherein producers, suppliers, and customers are located together; this reduces the cost of goods, materials, and even services. Better transportation services can create more opportunities for firms to access better and cheaper input material. Second, this effect is observed in the case of workers as well. A larger pool of workers enables a better matching between firms and workers, and this improves productivity because skilled workers can better match their work with their skills. Since better accessibility inspires workers to work away from home, larger agglomeration can be attained in labor pooling through better transportation. Third, the so-called knowledge spillover can be expected in agglomerated areas. One of the most famous examples is the Silicon Valley; many firms including semiconductor manufacturers and IT firms are located together here, leading to an environment of mutual learning and assistance. Once again, better transportation encourages more meetings, discussions, or even workshops between firms, and this hastens the learning process, accelerates firms’ technology, and results in better productivity. To understand the mechanism of Marshall’s economies of scale from an empirical perspective, past studies have categorized agglomeration in different ways. Rosenthal and Strange (2004) provided four types of categorization: industrial scope, temporal scope, geographical scope, and organization scope. As for organization scope, Thabet (2015) provides an investigation between agglomeration and organization-related variables such as competition, firm size, and foreign investment in a case of Tunisia. However, this study would like to focus on agglomeration with regard to the other three scopes. As for temporal scope, the key issue is to investigate whether the effect of agglomeration is static or dynamic. In other words, the agglomeration effect might require an accumulation of knowledge and its effect might develop over a period of years. By using the time lag of a number of plants in the area, Henderson (2003) concluded that high-tech firms also benefitted from the agglomeration level in the past. In a case study of Japan, Fukao et al. (2011) highlight the dynamic change of the manufacturing industry’s structure into a technologically oriented one in Japan during the 1990s. As for geographical scope, the key issue is to investigate whether an agglomeration spillover effect exists across the geographical border or not. We provide an index to measure agglomeration by considering the transportation service to capture the spatial lag effects. For industrial scope, which is the main issue in this study, agglomeration is categorized into localization and urbanization agglomeration. In localization agglomeration, we can expect better productivity from agglomeration if the firms in a similar sector are located close to one another. From Marshall’s economy of scale, firms benefit from supplier sharing or even technology transfer through localization. The concept of localized industries was proposed by Marshall (1890) and expanded into a growth model by Arrow (1962) and Romer (1986); the accumulation of knowledge spillover within the same industry is now known as the Marshall–Arrow–Romer externalities. On the other hand, in urbanization agglomeration, the firms’ productivity level increases as the total market expands through urbanization, leading to larger labor pooling and cross-industry activities and further to productivity improvement. The benefits of urbanization agglomeration, as described in Jacobs (1969), emerge from different sectors’ knowledge spillovers supporting one another. Moreover, innovation growth is believed to be stimulated by a variety of industrialization approaches, because different ideas and information can be synthesized through variety rather than specialization. Glaeser et al. (1992) showed that the economic growth of cities could be developed through the cross-fertilization of ideas in urbanization agglomeration. In other words, firms in large cities benefit from a variety of economies compared to those in small towns. Empirical studies have reported the robust result of the importance of localization and urbanization agglomeration. For example, Henderson (1986) and Moomaw (1988) highlighted the significance of economies of scales in localization agglomeration in several production industries. Specifically, Henderson (2003) found that the high-tech industry benefits from more localization economies whereas the machinery industry does not, and the machinery industry benefits from more urbanization agglomeration whereas the high-tech industry does not. In contrast, Glaeser et al. (1992) claimed that industrial diversity promotes employment growth in cities, rather than specialization. As regards the study of Japan, where extensive agglomerated areas can be observed because of limited habitable land, Nakamura (1985) estimated the cross-section data for 1979. The result showed that localization agglomeration is more important for light industries, whereas urbanization agglomeration is more important for heavy industries. However, from these studies, it is still difficult to clarify whether localization agglomeration or urbanization agglomeration is more beneficial to the economies. Nevertheless, there are several insights that we can use from the existing studies. First, previous studies usually considered only the firm scale (number of workers, number of firms) or urban scale (population) to explain the agglomeration level. In this study, we provide an insight on the agglomeration effects from the regional scale. Second, previous studies highlighted only the manufacturing industry, but we would like to expand the scope by covering every industrial sector in the economy for the consideration of agglomeration. Finally, while previous studies discuss the importance of localization agglomeration and urbanization agglomeration, we propose another mechanism between the two agglomerations. Agglomeration does not have to be in a similar industry, as in localization agglomeration, or the absolute size of the agglomeration economies, as in urbanization agglomeration, but we investigate how to best match the different industries to locate together in a precise proportion to maximize the input–output matching process. We provide an index to measure these three types of agglomeration and analyze its impact on production in later sections. Geographical distribution, as well as transportation services, can shape agglomeration activities. Transportation studies such as Graham (2007), Graham et al. (2009), and Melo et al. (2013, 2016) examined the contribution of transportation to productivity. Graham (2007), Graham et al. (2009), and Melo et al. (2013, 2016) consider transportation as one of the factors for agglomeration economies and showed that improvement in accessibility to transportation in term of “Effective Density” can create a better agglomeration environment. A significant contribution from agglomeration in the context of an urban rail project has been shown in Hensher et al. (2012) in a city scale as well. However, most of these studies investigate the firm- or urban-level effect of agglomeration and ignore the possibility that the spillover effect can spread across the region. Therefore, this study analyzes agglomeration in the regional scale. The case study of Japan can be one of the ideal regional scale case studies for two reasons. First, the firm- or urban-level data could be applied in other countries where the built-up area is distinctly separated and the cross-border effect is unlikely to be expected. However, the built-up area in Japan is highly connected, especially in the coastal area, and so the agglomeration effect can be expected to overflow across the region. Second, since Japan is an island nation, agglomeration across the national border is unlikely to occur. In other words, regional agglomeration can be fully observed without interfering with the agglomeration effect of other countries. This paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the methodology used, including the formulation of regional production function and definition of agglomeration. Section 3 presents empirical data with uncontrolled relationships between agglomeration and economic development. Section 4 discusses our estimation methodology, the results of an econometric model and the interpretation of the agglomeration impact on regional economic productivity. Finally, Sect. 5 summarizes our conclusions and further issues.",29

A cross-country comparison,September 2017,Kyung-Min Nam,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The control of city size is a key characteristic of China’s spatial policy (Wu 2015). In the post-reform period, the Chinese government has controlled the phase of urbanization in various ways, although its traditional anti-urbanization stance has become increasingly diluted. The one-child policy, which was in effect until the end of 2015, exemplifies the public intervention in the natural growth of the urban population; the domestic household registration system (hukou) has leashed domestic population mobility, suppressing the social-growth component. These measures have presented a clear size-biased tendency, where larger cities are subject to stricter and more stringent regulations. Promotion of industrial relocation in favor of small cities, restrictions on economic activities within large cities, and development of satellite towns have all strengthened the anti-large and pro-small tendency. An implicit assumption underlying such public interventions is that the spatial distribution of China’s national population tends to be overly biased toward large cities. Reducing the bias can be justified from both social and economic perspectives. First, increased spatial inequality of population distribution may challenge social harmony. In China, spatial distribution of population and that of economic opportunities substantially overlap, suggesting certain mutually reinforcing, cumulative causation dynamics (Ke and Feser 2010; Wu and Gaubatz 2013). Failure to break the link in such divergence mechanisms threatens the stability and sustainability of a society (Wallace 2014). Unequal spatial distribution of population may also translate into a gap in national or local politics, which can further affect public resource allocation. From an economic perspective, excessively unequal spatial distribution of the national population is not ideal, either. In oversized cities, diseconomies of agglomeration, such as congestion and environmental pollution, exceed the benefits of spatial clustering, including increased efficiency; undersized cities may not be able to take full advantage of external economies of scale. Then, the question is whether the assumption holds in reality: is the spatial distribution of China’s population excessively unequal? At a glance, China’s population geography seems to present a bias, at least at two levels. At one level exists a bias toward large cities, which have taken the lead in China’s urbanization process. In 2010, for example, prefecture-level cities with an urban population of \({\ge }1\)million accounted for 87% of China’s total urban population, showing an increasing trend from 49% in 1982 (Fig. 1a). At another level is a bias toward coastal regions. In 2010, for example, the Eastern region, which occupies 15% of the national land area, accounted for 48% of the national population (Fig. 1b). This picture hints that the spatial clustering of large cities at a regional level further extends the cross-city disparity, forming mega-city regions (Xu and Yeh 2011). The Eastern region hosts all of China’s three largest mega-city regions: the Bohai Economic Rim, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. 
Source: Created by the author from China’s official census data Distribution of China’s population: a decomposition of urban population by city size, 1982–2010; b regional distribution, 2010. A balanced population-to-land share ratio, however, is hardly to be considered a reasonable reference value for the judgement of such spatial unevenness. In reality, completely even distribution of population over geographical space neither exists nor is achievable in the presence of scale economies. The mismatch between population and land shares is found virtually everywhere; thus, this is a question of degree. In essence, size-biased spatial interventions can be justified only in a context where the distribution pattern deviates from a certain ideal range. Nevertheless, such spatial inequality of population distribution tends to be assumed without rigorous analysis, and the literature on this topic is sparse. This study aims to fill this gap. In this study, I introduce a new approach to the question and apply the method to China, testing the excessiveness of the geographical unevenness of its population distribution. The test introduced here neither adopts the Pareto exponent of 1 as a reference value (given its high sensitivity to sample size) nor assumes a certain optimal city size to reduce subjectivity. Instead, the size bias in China’s population distribution is compared with its global mean, which is directly estimated from a 101-country panel dataset.",9

One strand of the associated academic literature is concerned with how population mobility impacts macro-level outcomes, such as regional economic growth and regional development. Another strand, the one in which this study is framed, is devoted to examining the individual-level consequences of internal migration. The effects of internal migration on labour market outcomes have been extensively researched across a range of disciplines including economics, demography, sociology and geography (Greenwood 1997). Most research has been devoted to establishing their positive impacts on objective indicators of labour market ‘success’—particularly employment, earnings and occupational standing (Wilson 1985; Krieg 1997; Yankow 2003; Taylor 2007; Böheim and Taylor 2007; Cooke et al. 2009; Flippen 2014). Findings from this research provide a good picture of the net benefits of internal migration. However, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the relationships between migration and labour market outcomes. This paper addresses two important gaps in the literature. First, there is a dearth of research on how internal migrations affect subjective indicators of work outcomes, such as self-reported job satisfaction. The prevailing utility-maximising models of human migration in economics and demography pose that individuals move to maximise utility and decide in favour of relocating when the benefits outweigh the costs of doing so (Sjaastad 1962; Greenwood 1997). However, in empirical applications, the utility arising from internal migration is almost invariably measured by pecuniary returns in the form of income or wages. This is restrictive for two reasons: (1) life domains other than work may enter migration cost–benefit calculations, and (2) subjective indicators of well-being at work that convey useful information remain underexplored. I focus on the second of these points. Subjective indicators of well-being at work, typically operationalised using self-reported job satisfaction measures, have gained popularity in recent decades—spurred by the Sen movement (Sen 2000). Job satisfaction captures work outcomes more globally and democratically than income or wages, and may approximate the theoretical construct of ‘utility’ better (Freeman 1978). This is particularly the case for highly educated people, since increases in earnings are not an adequate proxy for compensation/utility for these individuals (Mathios 1989). Hence, considering job satisfaction as an outcome of interest is an important step forward in gaining a more holistic understanding of the effects of internal migration on labour market outcomes.Footnote 1
 Second, despite increasing availability of longitudinal datasets, there is a paucity of evidence on the dynamics underpinning the relationships between internal migrations and job outcomes, i.e. how the job satisfaction of workers evolves in the time periods leading to, coinciding with and following from a move. Since the 1980s, the life course approach to the study of life events and transitions has gained momentum in the social sciences (Mayer 2009). This pays attention to how trends in outcomes lead to life course events, and how the consequences of life course events unfold over time. However, the life course approach has only timidly permeated research on residential mobility (Coulter et al. 2013). Studies of the consequences of internal migration usually limit themselves to evaluating outcomes across two time points—typically the years immediately preceding and following a move. A small but growing number of studies since Spitze (1984) has paid attention to dynamics in internal migration outcomes as time since the move elapses—see, e.g. Clark and Huang (2006), Cooke et al. (2009) and Nowok et al. (2013). None of these studies examines job satisfaction. Exploring the dynamics of job satisfaction around moves can shed light over the processes which trigger and result from internal migration, for instance, by identifying trends in job satisfaction leading to internal migration or establishing whether the effects of moves are short- or long-lived. It also enables researchers to assess whether any effects of internal migration on job satisfaction are sustained over time or, as proposed by ‘set point theory’, individuals revert to their baseline satisfaction levels after the experience of the event (Clark et al. 2008; Clark and Georgellis 2013). For several reasons, the focus here is on young people. The prevalence of internal migrations peaks during early adulthood, and so young adults are more exposed to its consequences than are individuals in other age bands (Rogers and Castro 1981; Bernard et al. 2014). The nature and patterns of internal migration also differ markedly by age: moves motivated by work and employment tend to occur more often in early adulthood when individuals’ careers are forming, whereas moves motivated by other reasons such as retirement are more common at older ages (Geist and McManus 2008). Additionally, early adulthood is a critical time for individuals’ career development. Choices concerning work and residential mobility and early labour market experiences at this stage can have lasting consequences for individuals’ subsequent work and life outcomes (see e.g. Nordström-Skans 2004). The importance of work for well-being is also higher during this phase of life, as young adults are less likely than children and teenagers to be dependent on family support (e.g. living in the parental home) and less likely than mature age individuals to receive government payments (e.g. work pensions). Therefore, the decision to migrate via-a-vis staying in the same location is thus more critical for early-career workers than for workers with established careers, and the first few moves undertaken after labour market entry are likely to have pervasive consequences. For these reasons, understanding the intersections between internal migration and job satisfaction during early adulthood is particularly important (Switek 2014). In the remainder of this paper I will use long-running annual panel data and fixed-effect panel regression models to examine whether and how episodes of internal migration influence young people’s satisfaction with their jobs. This research goes beyond the limited body of previous evidence by estimating effects across measures of migration and job satisfaction, comparing the outcomes of university graduates and non-graduates, deploying a modelling strategy that reduces omitted variable and selection bias due to unobserved person-specific effects, examining the time dynamics underpinning the relationships of interest and contrasting the results between Britain and Australia.",9

This higher mobility appears to be at least partially attributable to greater responsiveness to job opportunities in other areas and greater demand for location-specific amenities (Adamson et al. 2004; Chen and Rosenthal 2008; Whisler et al. 2008; Wozniak 2010; Brown and Scott 2012; Arntz et al. 2014; Zheng 2015). Recent research also shows that college graduate income differences across areas differ somewhat by college major (Cunningham et al. 2013; Winters and Xu 2014; Abel and Deitz 2015). Consequently, one might also expect differential location decisions by college major. However, differences in migration by college major have gone largely undocumented and unexplained. This paper seeks to help fill this critical gap in the research literature by examining how migration decisions of college graduates relate to earnings differences across college majors. The data come from the American Community Survey (ACS), which in 2009 began asking persons holding a bachelor’s degree or higher to report the field of study in which they earned their bachelor’s. The descriptive analysis shows that there are indeed differences in average geographic mobility across college majors. Furthermore, the regression analysis indicates that higher major-specific earnings in an individual’s state of birth reduce out-migration and therefore increase birth-state retention of college graduates. Thus, college graduates are attracted toward areas that especially reward the specific type of human capital that they possess. These results have important implications for policymakers interested in reducing brain drain from their states. Economic opportunities play an important role in college graduate migration decisions, and the opportunities available to a given college graduate depend on their college major.",12

Dotzel,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In an increasingly saturated education market characterized by declining enrollment, universities are seeking ways to attract quality students, not only locally but also nationally. In 2012, nearly one in fiveFootnote 1 first-time freshman matriculated to a university outside of the home state, confirming that a large group of students remains willing to incur migration costs to attend college. Investigations of the determinants of interstate student migration, or the matriculation of students to universities outside of their home state, have mostly focused on university characteristics and local labor market conditions, while the relationship between student migration and natural amenities remains underexplored. If it is the case that exogenously determined factors, such as a favorable climate and topography, impact the matriculation decisions of students, then universities may have less capacity to influence own enrollment than previously believed. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the influence of natural amenities on student migration decisions using institution-level data from the National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It builds on the existing literature in a number of ways. First, a comprehensive set of variables related to climate and topography is included in the model to evaluate the effect of natural amenities on student migration. By matching interpolated weather station- and county-level data to each institution, the paper surpasses the scope of previous studies focused on natural amenities, providing meaningful insights into the relative importance of consumption-based motives for student migration decisions. Second, the possibility that the climate or topography of a student’s origin state may influence preferences for natural amenities during college is accounted for by interacting natural amenities measured at university location with measures of natural amenities in the student’s origin state. Reliance on state-to-institution migration flows, rather than the more commonly used state-to-state migration flows, also allows for a more precise measurement of university and regional characteristics at the destination. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief summary of the relevant literature on the topic, followed by a discussion of the data, empirical strategy, and pre-analysis hypotheses in Sect. 3. The main results are presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 concludes.",14

The locational choices of graduates in Sweden,November 2017,Lina Bjerke,Charlotta Mellander,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In this paper, we examine the locational choices of young graduates from an urban–rural perspective. Economists have long sought to identify the factors that influence migration patterns and individual location choice, primarily based on perceived economic rewards that result from geographical movements. Much of this research focuses on the factors that shape in-migration. Generally, the biggest and most diverse regions come out as “winners” in attracting graduates. A vast amount of research has shown how big, tolerant, and diverse metropolitan regions function as magnets for young, talented, highly educated individuals (Florida 2002). The flipside of this movement is the sustained process of depopulation in most rural areas, where the youth are leaving and the remaining population is decreasing and aging, leaving these areas with a weakened market, and fewer public and private services. A youth population study in Sweden (Mellander 2013), for example, shows that an astounding 86 % of municipalities have fewer 25-year-olds today compared to the number of 18-year-olds they had 7 years ago, a pattern that has remained stable.Footnote 1 The net gainers are bigger regions and college towns. While this pattern is not new, the effects have become more visible and acute. The sustained long-term loss of younger individuals has in many ways “drained” the labor market as well as the economic market power of rural areas. Not all rural areas fit this pattern; they are heterogeneous and exhibit a range of economic trajectories. Some areas have an increasing population, though most others have a long history of decline. Those that are closer to larger cities have generally experienced more dynamic growth than ones further away. Indeed, most rural areas have seen a significant loss of young people over time. A fairly large share of this loss consists of young people moving away to go to university and not returning. Efforts to attract this group back to rural areas have largely proved unsuccessful. One probable reason for this is that there is limited knowledge of who the young graduates that move to rural areas really are, and therefore, the strategies and public policies to attract them are ineffective. Greater knowledge about returning migrants and the locational choices of graduates would benefit many of these rural areas whose population numbers are declining. If there are regional qualities that affect migration and locational decisions, rural areas could develop these qualities more strategically as they try to attract more highly educated young people. Thus, rural areas do not only lack young people, but they also lack knowledge about who may be willing to return or chose to live in a rural region once they have graduated from university and what factors could attract them to a rural location. Understanding such factors is an element in the focus of this paper. Using a micro data set covering the entire Swedish population, we identify all individuals who graduated in 2001. We divide them into two main groups: those who lived in a rural area before attending university and those who lived in an urban area prior to university. We follow these individuals at two points in time. First, we examine where they lived 5 years after graduating (short term) and then after 10 years (long term). This allows us to study which graduates moved back to the area they originated from and which graduates decided to live elsewhere. In light of rural depopulation, we are also able to identify some of the factors influencing individuals who lived in an urban area before entering university but who decided to migrate to a rural area after receiving the degree. In the analysis, we account for individual characteristics such as age, gender, immigration background, and if they commute to work. We also examine the regional qualities such as the regional share of human capital, wage levels, the presence of a university, as well as the type and number of lifestyle amenities found at the choice of location. While several studies have analyzed the UK graduate migration in the past (see e.g., Faggian and McCann 2006, 2009a, b; Faggian et al. 2006, 2007a, b) and in-migration in a Swedish context (e.g., Bjerke 2012), none has, to our knowledge, analyzed the patterns from an urban–rural perspective. Given the major loss of young people from rural areas, understanding this relationship seems vital to understand if rural areas are to develop better strategies for the future.",29

Yet, the study of international migration is still at the heart of a lively debate that mainly centers around the causes and consequences of geographic mobility both at the individual, regional and country level. In particular, due to the growth of inter-regional and international flows of high-skilled workers, there has been a renewed interest on the topics of brain drain and brain gain (Beine et al. 2001; Docquier and Rapoport 2012). Surprisingly, among the highly skilled, less attention has been paid to Ph.D. graduates. Moreover, an analysis of their outcomes related either to inter-regional or international mobility is completely absent. Thus, the present study is an attempt to fill this gap by focusing on doctorate holders and their early performance in the labor market associated with the choice of international mobility. Understanding the determinants and outcomes of Ph.D. mobility can be of great relevance not only for individuals themselves, but also for society and policy makers. For individuals, private benefits may be monetary and non-monetary, such as employment opportunities, higher wages, career prospects and job satisfaction (Abreu et al. 2015; Pitcher and Purcell 1998). Differently, social benefits crucially depend on the knowledge transfer to the private sector. Outflow mobility of high-skilled labor is often perceived in terms of human capital depreciation, while the ability to attract high-skilled migrants turns out to be fundamental to the enhancement of the workforce skill composition and the innovative success of regions and countries. For instance, since human capital intrinsically resides in individuals, the flows of highly educated individuals have a direct impact on regional development through its influence on firms’ success in competitive environments (Parey et al. 2015). In this context, studying the migration behavior of doctorate holders is particularly relevant, as they are among the most qualified workers both in terms of educational attainment and their ability to conduct research and contribute to economic development.Footnote 1
 This study is also policy relevant, as it represents the first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the international migration of Ph.D. holders. When the home country provides education, but highly skilled workers migrate elsewhere, the higher education system loses its educational investment. The effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing the brain drain crucially depends on the correct design of private incentives, which obviously must take into account also individual gains associated with the choice of migration. Over the past two decades, the number of doctorate graduates has increased sharply, due to the worldwide development of higher education systems. Auriol et al. (2013) report a 38 % increase in the number of Ph.D. students who graduated from universities in OECD countries for the period 2000–2009, but similar trends can be also observed in other non-OECD countries. Furthermore, opportunities for academic employment have declined over time and the labor market for Ph.D.s has changed markedly.Footnote 2 In parallel, many countries have adopted quality-selective immigration policies, such as tax benefits and simplified immigration measures,Footnote 3 aimed at attracting the best talents from all over the world (Beine et al. 2008). Thus, both supply and demand factors have changed the composition of international migration flows. Moreover, since mobility has been proven to be a key dimension in making more effective investment in human capital, our focus on Ph.D. graduates aims at building an information base for the design of policies directed toward highly qualified individuals. Similarly to other countries, also Italy has experienced a constant growth in the provision of Ph.D. programs, with a constant increase in the number of graduates. The Italian National Institute of Statistics reports that in 2000 around 4000 students were granted a Ph.D. degree from Italian universities, while the number had risen to over 12,000 in 2008. However, few permanent positions in universities and public research centers have become available (Ballarino and Colombo 2010). From this point of view, it is interesting to investigate the outcome of those who are at the top of the educational system, but at the same time face a considerable insecurity should they choose to pursue an academic career. Ph.D. students are often trained in internationally vivid environments and grow close to scientific communities that, in their nature, overcome national borders, and this makes doctorate holders a peculiar population to look at in terms of mobility choices. Is then mobility an option that is rewarded with higher wages? To answer this question, this paper looks at the international mobility of Ph.D. graduates and their earnings performance after graduation. The paper presents novel results on the relatively unexplored topic of Ph.D. graduate mobility by exploiting a population-based survey of two cohorts of Italian Ph.Ds. Our econometric analysis confirms that the choice of mobility is associated with higher wages and that selection on unobservable factors is essential to address the issue of the returns to migration. Interestingly, we find negative selection in all our estimates. Additionally, we do not detect individual heterogeneity in the response of wages to migration. Moreover, we show that our results are always confirmed when we include two exclusion restrictions in the empirical model and when we restrict the analysis to different subpopulations. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 links this paper to the existing literature. Section 3 outlines the estimation approach and describes the data. Results and robustness checks are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes with a discussion on policy implications and offers some directions for further research.",18

Venhorst,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The presence of human capital in regions and cities is widely regarded as conducive to development and economic growth. Highly skilled individuals, using the urban density to share knowledge and to learn, promote productivity increases (Lucas 1988; Krugman 1991). Potentially, cooperating and sharing the city market place with such highly skilled individuals has beneficial effects for other skills groups. These benefits may materialise through production and consumption spillovers. Production spillovers occur when complementarities are sufficiently strong, such that an increase in demand for highly skilled workers also leads to an increase in opportunities for other higher or less-skilled employees. It has been shown that lower skilled workers benefit from learning in dense urban environments (Glaeser 1999; Jovanovic and Rob 1989). Further, a growth in low-skilled services, as a result of consumption spillovers, has been related to the presence of a highly educated incumbent population (Sassen 2001; Glaeser et al. 2001; Glaeser and Gottlieb 2006). Through such mechanisms, the presence of highly skilled individuals in cities may boost opportunities for all skills groups. There is a strong focus among local policymakers on attracting and retaining graduate human capital (see Venhorst et al. 2011b for an overview for the Dutch case), with the aim of capturing these benefits for the regional economy. However, there is little knowledge on how this affects a city’s skills structure in the longer term. Does the presence and inflow of highly skilled workers and inhabitants create or reduce the opportunities for only such highly skilled groups, or are there also effects on other skills groups? What is the most important mechanism that drives these effects: productivity or consumption spillovers? Should policymakers focus on retaining or attracting graduates to the local labour market, or is there also a role for the residential market? In this paper, we study the structural determinants of the skills structure of Dutch cities. We focus specifically on the interaction between the employment skills structure and the inflow of graduate human capital. We apply a unique dataset that allows us to control for the existing city stocks of human capital and other factors that may influence the city’s skills structure. In order to address both production and consumption spillovers, graduate human capital inflow is operationalised in terms of labour market inflow relative to housing market inflow. Our dataset allows us to distinguish between graduates starting a career within a city’s labour market and graduates moving into the city’s residential areas. Likewise, an important feature of this study is our differentiation between the exact location of jobs by qualification level and the location of the resident population by education level. We argue that such a distinction is instrumental in disentangling consumption and productivity effects of both existing stocks of resident and working individuals as well as recent graduates. As Venhorst and McCann (2015) demonstrate, among graduates job-place mobility is consistently larger than residential mobility, with especially the latter dropping substantially as the years relative to the moment of graduation go by. Secondly, we use the skills level required by employers. This may be a better measure of a city’s skills structure as workers with long tenures tend to progress to higher level jobs through on-the-job learning or additional training (Schlitte 2010) than their initial education level would suggest. As such, this approach allows us to look at how skills are utilised. Thirdly, little is known about how a city’s skill structure is related to the characteristics of other nearby cities, or those with which a commuting tie exists. This is particularly important when studying employment and population interactions on lower spatial scales. Since cities can be regarded as perfect open economies (Nijkamp and Poot 1998), it is important to take into account the effects of nearby areas. For example, it has been demonstrated that nearby large cities can create substantial backwash effects (Partridge et al. 2007a, b) and that nearby residential amenities may have effects on a firm’s location choice (Boarnet 1994; Gottlieb 1995). This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the main findings that have emerged from the literature. This is followed by a discussion on the approach taken in this study. In Sect. 3, we introduce our dataset covering 287 Dutch municipalities and discuss the operationalisation of our variables. In Sect. 4, we discuss the results from our empirical analysis and Sect. 5 presents the main conclusions.",2

Affected by declines in labour force opportunities driven by technological change and increased mechanisation, non-metropolitan communities have historically experienced out-migration of young individuals to urban centres where they pursue education, employment opportunities and a more vibrant social environment (Corcoran et al. 2010; Gottlieb 2011; Rowe 2013; Tang et al. 2014, 2016). For many young individuals from non-metropolitan areas, migration to major cities is an essential component of the transition from school into further education and the workforce, as this move enables access to education and job opportunities not available in the local community (Winters 2011; Rowe et al. 2014b). While the out-migration of young individuals from non-metropolitan communities is well documented, little is understood about how this migration interacts with pathways into employment and influences subsequent earning capacity. School-to-work transitions comprise a critical period of human capital development for young people. There is growing evidence that transitionary pathways during this time are both diverse and complex. For non-metropolitan youth, successful completion of such transitions may necessitate relocation to urban centres as opportunities for further education and employment may not exist in the local community. Yet there is limited empirical research on the educational and labour market trajectories of individuals after migration, particularly about the way they evolve over an extended period of time (Cushing and Poot 2004; Newbold 2012). A better understanding of the pathways young people take post-schooling, and the influence such pathways on future wages is needed to inform strategies to curtail net migration loss of young people from non-metropolitan communities and to entice youth to return to their community of origin after a period of urban living. Migration to urban centres is thought to enhance the educational and employment outcomes of people in their transition from school into higher education and the labour market. There is consistent evidence that migration to metropolitan areas leads to higher earnings (Glaeser and Maré 2001; Mills and Hazarika 2001). In the USA, Glaeser and Maré (2001) reported that non-metropolitan migrants experienced a wage premium of 8–12 % compared to those staying behind. Rapid human capital accumulation is argued to underpin this wage premium in metropolitan locations (Glaeser 1999; Peri 2002). However, the dynamics of human capital accumulation following migration to metropolitan areas remain poorly understood, and some research suggests migration can disrupt transitions into employment (Rowe et al. 2014b). To expand understanding of the interplay between school-to-work transitions, migration and wages, this paper aims to determine the wage returns to migration for young people from non-metropolitan areas and to examine the impact of the pathways these individuals follow in their school-to-work transitions on their wage outcomes. To this end, we use a three-stage analytical approach, drawing on data from the 2003 Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth (LSAY). First, kernel density plots and significance tests are used to compare wage outcomes at the age of 25 for young people who lived in a non-metropolitan area at the age of 15 and migrated to a metropolitan location after leaving school (non-metropolitan migrants) against two other groups: those who remained in non-metropolitan communities after leaving school (non-metropolitan stayers) and those who remained in metropolitan locations (metropolitan stayers). Second, sequence analysis techniques in combination with quantile regressions are employed to define representative school-to-work pathways and determine their role in explaining wage differentials between non-metropolitan migrants, non-metropolitan stayers and metropolitan stayers. Third, a quantile decomposition approach is performed to determine the main source of wage differentials between these groups. It seeks to measure the selectivity effects of migration by decomposing wage differentials into differences in individual attributes (observed characteristics) or in the remuneration of those attributes (unobserved attributes and skills). This study expands existing research on graduate mobility in two important ways. First, it examines the school-to-work pathways and wage outcomes of school and vocationally educated young people, extending the focus of existing research which centres on university graduates. Second, it employs a longitudinal approach based on sequence analysis to examine the influence of individual trajectories on shaping the wage outcomes of young people in early working life. Together, these contributions provide a basis for better assessment of the performance of university graduates in the labour market and assist development of policies to enhance labour market outcomes for young people. This is achieved by identifying the school-to-work trajectories more likely to result in low wage outcomes so that timely interventions can be implemented. The paper is organised in six sections: The next section reviews the literature on the school-to-work transition and the role of migration. Sections 3 and 4 present the data used in the analysis and describe the methodology. Section 5 discusses the results, and Sect. 6 summarises the main findings.",14

Lacombe,James P. LeSage,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There have been a number of studies in various fields that have adopted the use of spatial autoregressive and spatial autoregressive probit models (e.g., Crowley 2012; Fiva and Rattso 2007; Leeson and Dean 2009; Hall and Ross 2010; Rincke 2006; Seldadyo et al. 2010). One consequence of this is that issues relating to estimation and interpretation of these models have been part of an evolving literature. Conventional econometric models for choices (logit/probit) assume decision outcomes for each individual or region are independent of neighboring individuals or regions. This leads to choice outcomes that depend only on individual- or region-specific characteristics and not choices made by other individuals or neighboring regions. Spatial models involve individuals or regions located in space as the observations, and in the case of probit models the dependent variable reflects individual- or region-specific outcomes. One can model dependence between choices made by individuals or regions using two approaches (1) dependence in the model disturbances or (2) dependence in decision outcomes (LeSage and Pace 2009, Chapter 10). The former can arise as a consequence of omitted explanatory variables that are uncorrelated with variables included in the model and exhibit a structure of spatial dependence. Mixed logit models attempt to model (heterogeneous) variation in choice outcomes attributable to this type of omitted variable using a vector of random effects. A spatial econometric approach that follows the first approach is set forth in Smith and LeSage (2004) that replaces the random effects vector with a set of spatially structured random effects, so the random effects are modeled as similar to those for nearby decision makers or regions. The second approach to modeling choices that exhibit spatial dependence involves direct application of a spatial autoregressive process to the dependent variable (which can be viewed as binary indicators of latent utility differences in probit models). LeSage and Pace (2009, Chapter 10) provide details regarding estimation of this type of cross-sectional model. A motivation for this type of model is that omitted variables that exhibit a structure of spatial dependence and are correlated with variables included in the model lead to this type of econometric specificationFootnote 1 (see LeSage and Pace 2009, Chapter 2). As a concrete example in the context of our voting illustration, consider that media market variables are omitted when considering voting outcomes in each region. These would likely be omitted explanatory variables since it would be difficult to obtain sample data information regarding media slant/bias as it pertains to our county-level voting jurisdictions. Suppose an included variable x in our model is majority party affiliation of voters in the county. It seems likely that the excluded media slant variable might be correlated with majority party affiliation in the county, since newspaper endorsements in a Republican/Democrat county would likely follow the majority party affiliation of its citizens. It would also be the case that the omitted variable reflecting media slant would exhibit spatial dependence, since broadcast and print media do not stop at county borders, so that county-level measurements of media slant would tend to be related to those from neighboring counties. We rely on this type of motivation and focus our empirical application on the second approach to modeling spatially dependent voting outcomes. It should be noted that interpretation of the first type of spatial probit model (that with spatially structured random effects) is straightforward in that traditional linear probit regression methods can be used to calculate marginal effects estimates that vary as a function of the levels of the explanatory variables. LeSage and Pace (2009, Chapter 10) do not provide details regarding interpretation of estimates for spatial autoregressive probit models, but these can be found in LeSage et al. (2011). In Sect. 2, we discuss the spatial autoregressive probit model,Footnote 2 and in Sect. 3, there is a review of key issues pertaining to interpretation of the estimates and associated inferences set forth in LeSage et al. (2011). In Sect. 4, we set forth our empirical specification for the spatial autoregressive variant of the conventional probit regression model that allows for interdependence between county-level voting outcomes. We refer the interested reader to LeSage and Pace (2009, Chapter 10) for details regarding Bayesian MCMC estimation of these models, and note that publicly available MATLAB functions are available to carry out estimation at http://www.spatial-econometrics.com. Our focus in the applied illustration of Sect. 4 is proper interpretation of the coefficient estimates and inference regarding the impact of explanatory variables on voting choices for our illustrative example of the spatial autoregressive probit model.",17
60.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,24 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-015-0737-2,Spatial lag dependence in the presence of missing observations,January 2018,Takahisa Yokoi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Missing data are an important issue in statistical analysis, and there are many studies reporting estimator properties and a method to use for recovering missing information. For example, Little and Rubin (2002) discuss applications of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. There has been little research discussing the sampling problem in spatial statistics. As exceptions, Griffith et al. (1989) discussed the interpolation of missing samples in a spatial model, LeSage and Pace (2004) used a Bayesian approach to recover missing information (specifically, they imputed prices of unsold properties as the missing data by utilizing interdependency in prices), and Goulard et al. (2009) discussed prediction problems in this context. Kelejian and Prucha (2010) proposed new instrumental-variable estimator in spatial lag models for handling incomplete data. Their econometric model includes nonparametric estimation of the disturbance term, and they confirmed the large-sample properties of the estimators. Wang and Lee (2013a, b) developed new nonlinear least squares methods and generalized method of moments estimations for spatial lag models with missing data in both cross-sectional and panel settings. They derived the large-sample properties and performed detailed small-sample Monte Carlo experiments. Arbia et al. (2015) point out that there are two problems—missing data and locational errors—in typical empirical applications of the spatial lag model. Two patterns tested are with respect to spatial patterns in the set of missing data: spatial concentration and spatial clustering. They confirmed the effects of many channels of such problems through a series of Monte Carlo experiments. One of their findings is that spatial correlation tends to disappear, especially in the case of a missing-in-clusters pattern.Footnote 1
 Little and Rubin (2002, ch.1) classified missing data into three types. (1) ‘Missing completely at random (MCAR)’: the missingness does not depend on the data values. For an example in the context of public finances, assume that we have data of the 100 cities randomly sampled. (2) ‘Missing at random (MAR)’: the missingness depends on only the components of observed data values. As an example, assume that we have the data of only the 100 largest cities. (3) ‘Not missing at random (NMAR)’: the missingness depends on the missing values in the data. As an example, assume that we conduct a survey of welfare policy among local governments. Some hidden attributes of the local governments determine the missingness (here non-response) characteristics of the data. There is a similar concept: ‘systematic sampling.’ ‘Systematic sampling is associated with the concept of a stock variable, that is, a variable that has a value at every point in time rather than a value only between two points in time’ (Freeman 1989, p. 63). See LeSage and Pace (2004) for an example in the context of real estate prices.Footnote 2
 In the literature, there have been analytical and simulation-based analyses on how often the correctly specified model is selected in spatial model comparisons with a full sample. Unfortunately, there is no consideration of sampling problems in the model selection for these analyses. In other words, the risk of specification errors in the presence of missing data has not been discussed in a spatial setting. As most empirical analyses are conducted using sampled data, knowledge of the relation between specification errors and the sampling ratio is essential for further study. If the strength of interdependency between observations needs to be measured, sampling may also be a pivotal problem; estimation bias in spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions or large prediction biases in the theoretical model. There are many models of real estate prices, local public finance, and other subjects that consider spatial interaction, including the spatial lag model and spatial error model. If there are no missing data, it is easy to interpret the spatial autocorrelation process. Sometimes very sparsely sampled data are used in empirical studies. In other words, we observe only some of the data, which are possibly interdependent. For example, in Japan there is an annual land-price notification system in which the government yearly publicizes land prices for twenty thousand tracts. Although this source provides a large and important sample set for real estate pricing, it does not cover all Japanese real estate. Applying models to such sampled datasets leads us to the conclusion that the spatial lag model is suitable in many empirical analyses. We confirm the relation between the selection ratio of the spatial and non-spatial models and the sampling rate with a simulation analysis based on artificial data. The data-generating process (DGP) considered is a spatial lag process in which spatial autocorrelation in dependent variables exists. We estimate three empirical models: ordinal least squares (OLS), the spatial lag model, and spatial error model. Comparisons are performed from the points of view of properties of the estimator and selection probabilities using an information criterion. The composition of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the econometric models. In Sect. 3, we describe our Monte Carlo simulation setup. We discuss our results in Sect. 4. Conclusions are stated in Sect. 5.",2

Thus, it becomes more and more important to analyse real-estate markets and their influence on economic systems. Real-estate prices highly depend on the location of the real estate and the time, when it is sold or purchased, so the price process is characterized by high spatial and temporal dependence structures. Therefore, it is essential to grasp the price process in detail. On the one hand, governmental authorities are forced to understand the process of real-estate prices in order to predict the impact of investments in infrastructure, which generate direct shocks in the real-estate prices. On the other hand, the future price of some investment could be evaluated more accurately, if one understand the price process in detail. The second mentioned fact is of great importance for each person deciding to purchase real estate for private purposes as well as for persons investing in real estate. However, there are no data on real-estate prices over a long period of time measured at many points in space. Long-term data are mostly measured at one point in space, e.g. 400 years of Herengracht Index in Amsterdam in Eichholtz (1997) or 9 years of housing prices in San Francisco in Vidger (1969). Most of the data provided by governmental institutes are aggregated over space, time, or both. Therefore, it is often difficult to quantify both temporal and spatial dependence. In the literature, several approaches have been proposed to model spatiotemporal data (cf. Anselin 2010). Lee and Yu (2010b) compared different panel data approaches and the maximum likelihood estimation for these models. In order to capture spatiotemporal issues, Wrenn and Sam (2014) proposed an extension to the weighted likelihood regression. Moreover, Lee and Yu (2012) developed a spatiotemporal panel data model with an autoregressive process for the matrices of spatial weights. Considering spatial heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence, Holly et al. (2010) considered a panel model for US house prices. The proposed parameters are estimated by the common correlated effects estimator (cf. Pesaran 2006). They further showed that the house prices and the disposable income per capita are cointegrated. Case and Shiller (2003) stressed the importance of checking for cointegration between housing prices and other possible fundamentals, because price bubbles are less likely in this case. The importance of cointegration has been also pointed out by Sirmans and Slade (2012). Furthermore, Yunus et al. (2012) checked via cointegration analysis whether there are interactions between private and public real-estate markets. In contrast to most of the published literature (e.g. Holly et al. 2010; Green 2002; Koetter and Poghosyan 2010; Pace et al. 2000 or Möller 2009 considering all West German regions), we consider highly structured data of 412 administrative units during the years from 1995 to 2010, i.e. 15 years. The main aim of our paper is to quantify the relationship between population density, income, and real-estate prices. Our focus lies especially on the German real-estate market. In recent literature, there are several papers dealing with the problem of quantifying spatial and temporal effects. For instance, Kuethe and Pede (2011) tested whether the disposable income per capita or the unemployment rate and the regional housing prices in the USA are cointegrated. In addition, they examine the convergence between regional prices and the average price of their neighbouring regions to draw conclusions about the ripple effect. On the contrary, Holmes and Grimes (2008) checked for cointegration between the regional price and the average price of the entire economic system for UK data. They found evidence for the ripple effect. Furthermore, they showed that the adjustment speed of the regional prices towards the state average decreases for growing distance from the central region of London. Moreover, Fingleton (2008) assumed a moving average model for the residuals of a spatial autoregressive process in order to model local spillover effects of economic shocks instead of global spillover effects. He applied this estimator to real-estate prices in the UK. In Sect. 2, we introduce two different ways of modelling spatiotemporal data. First, we consider a spatial dynamic panel data model as “time–space simultaneous” model proposed in Anselin (2001). Second, spatial autoregressive models with different spatial errors processes (e.g. Fingleton 2008) are compared with the dynamic model in Sect. 3.3. Furthermore, we quantify temporal and spatial dependence structures. The impact of two regressors and autoregressive shocks is discussed eventually in more detail, since it has not been done up to now for real-estate markets and the German real-estate market in particular. The two regressors are the real disposable income per capita and the population density. The impact of both regressors should be examined concerning its influence on neighbouring regions. Additionally, one can observe that shocks ripple out over the whole economy. As a consequence, shocks have a certain impact on neighbouring regions with some temporal delay. In recent literature, this issue of the so-called ripple effect is widely discussed. Meen (1999) figured out four possible explanations analysing the economic reasons for the existence of the ripple effect. These reasons are migration as well as equity transfer between the regions and spatial arbitrage possibilities or similar spatial patterns of the fundamentals without direct links between the housing markets. Our results permit to quantify the influences of the applied characteristics to the prices process. We can study how a change in the regressors influences the prices of real estate. Both models lead to similar results. However, the goodness of fit of the dynamic model is slightly larger. Therefore, we recommend this model. Our study gives rise to the conclusion that the willingness to move or to commute decreased in recent years. In the following section, both considered models and the likelihood estimation are introduced. Further, we explain the results of our empirical study. In Sect. 4, we provide several concluding remarks.",9

The banking and housing sectors were reformed, while stock markets were created (Chow 2004; Ye et al. 2010; Man et al. 2011). Privately owned businesses increasingly replaced state-owned enterprises, foreign direct investment increased and exports increased, notably with the accession of China into WTO membership (Tung 2005; Wu 2007). However, growth across regions of China has been uneven during the post-reform period (Wei 2002; Fan and Sun 2008; Hao and Wei 2010; Lin et al. 2013). Studies of regional growth in China have focused separately on agglomeration economies (e.g., Fan and Scott 2003; Lu and Tao 2009; Ke 2010), exports and foreign direct investment (Wu 2007; Hao and Wei 2010; Dreger and Zhang 2014), household amenity attractiveness (e.g., Liu and Shen 2014) and housing supply (e.g., Wang and Zhang 2014; Yuan and Hamori 2014). Yet, there have not been any studies that have compared the relative importance of labor demand, labor supply and housing supply as sources of regional growth in China using multiple economic indicators as has been done for the USA (Partridge and Rickman 1999, 2003, 2006; Glaeser and Tobio 2008; and Rickman and Wang 2017).Footnote 1
 Therefore, this study assesses the relative roles of firm productivity/labor demand, household amenity attractiveness/labor supply and housing supply in explaining growth differences across the provinces and municipalities under central government control of China. We examine the period of 1995–2013 because of the number of reforms undertaken in the 1990s, particularly the late 1990s. The study formulates an integrative empirical approach in examining the patterns of growth in per capita income, housing prices, gross regional product, unemployment rates and population. The integrative approach we employ synthesizes the traditional labor market and spatial equilibrium frameworks of previous analyses for the USA. Analysis by Partridge and Rickman (1999) focused on patterns in traditional labor market indicators such as unemployment rates, labor productivities, wage rates, population growth and employment growth. Partridge and Rickman (2003, 2006) employed a long-run-restrictions structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of US population, employment and wage growth to assess the relative roles of labor demand and labor supply. Rickman and Wang (2017) employed the spatial equilibrium growth model of Glaeser and Tobio (2008) to decompose the patterns in US regional growth of population, income and housing prices into the three components of firm productivity, household amenity attractiveness and housing supply elasticity. Instead of focusing solely on traditional regional labor market indicators, regional housing prices play a key role in the Glaeser and Tobio (GT) model. The absence of housing prices in the empirical analysis of Partridge and Rickman (1999, 2003, 2006) precludes a role for housing supply elasticity in explaining differences in regional growth. The GT model generalizes the traditional spatial equilibrium approach, which focuses solely on regional differences in household amenity attractiveness and firm productivity, by incorporating a regional housing supply elasticity. To be sure, GT report that more elastic housing supply was primarily responsible for population growth in the US South during 1980–2000, not household amenity attractiveness. However, the absence of land in production of the traded good in the GT model precludes household amenities from affecting the nominal regional wage rate (Rickman and Wang 2017). The assumption of full employment by GT removes the unemployment rate as an indicator of labor market demand/supply as used in Partridge and Rickman (1999, 2003, 2006). The use of unemployment as an indicator may be more important for China than the USA because of restrictions on labor mobility by the Hukou household registration system. Therefore, an empirical approach is needed that synthesizes the predictions of the previous studies into a more comprehensive single empirical framework. In this paper, we empirically integrate the above approaches into a single framework to examine regional growth in China for the period 1995–2013. Evidence of labor demand-induced growth will be argued to be found in increasing per capita income, gross regional product, population and housing prices, and declining unemployment. Evidence of labor supply-induced growth will be argued to be found in rising population, housing prices, gross regional product and unemployment, and declining per capita income. Evidence of growth induced by elastic housing supply primarily will be evidenced by lower housing prices relative to income and population growth. The patterns among the indicators are identified using principal component analysis. Once the principal components are extracted, principal scores are calculated for the observations and examined for patterns across China’s provinces and municipalities under central government control using regression analysis. The next section discusses the previous studies and their findings for the USA, and synthesizes them to provide an integrative empirical framework for analysis of China’s regional growth patterns. Section 3 discusses the empirical methodology and data sources and calculation of the outcome variables. The results are presented in Sect. 4. The primary findings are that over the entire period, labor supply shifts primarily fueled the regional differences in regional growth, though labor demand shifts were almost equally as important, while there is a lesser role for housing supply shifts. Notable patterns for certain regions also are highlighted and discussed. Section 5 contains a brief summary and conclusions of the study.",18

For instance, Putnam (1995) shows that membership of organizations, like parent–teacher associations and the Red Cross, dropped by 25% between the 1960s and the 1990s, while (Costa and Kahn 2003) show that the proportion of individuals who did any volunteer work dropped from 29% in 1974 to 26% in 1989. This period coincided with a large inflow of immigrants, with the foreign-born population rising from 5.4% of the total in 1960 to 12.96% in 2010. In this study, we attempt to understand whether there is a causal relationship between these two trends. How and to what extent has immigration contributed to reduction in social capital in the USA? There is extensive literature that attempts to explain the decline in social capital in the USA. Previous studies highlight the role of community heterogeneity in explaining social capital formation. For instance, (Alesina and Ferrara 2000; Glaeser et al. 2002) find that social participation, measured as group membership, is lower in neighborhoods where inequality is higher, and there is larger racial and ethnic fragmentation. Similarly, Costa and Kahn (2003) find that community heterogeneity, measured by income inequality and racial and birthplace fragmentation, reduces the likelihood of volunteering. However, these studies focus on the correlation between community heterogeneity and social capital and do not attempt to address the fact that racial and even income composition of communities is endogenous, as people sort themselves into the communities in which they live. The exception is (Charles and Kline 2006), who analyze the relationship between carpooling and racial fragmentation of communities. By using the racial fragmentation of the state and year in which the individual was born, the authors find that people are less likely to carpool in communities with larger racial fragmentation, correcting for potential endogeneity of the racial composition of an individual’s neighborhood. Significantly fewer studies investigate the relationship between immigration and social capital. Of those that do, recent studies, such as (Handy and Greenspan 2009; Behtoui and Neergaard 2010; Kanas et al. 2012; Halapuu et al. 2013), find that social capital improves immigrants’ outcomes. Other studies, such as (Kawashima-Ginsberg and Hoban Kirby 2009), find no difference with volunteering patterns of children of foreign-born and US-born individuals. In this study, we examine the degree to which rising immigration in the USA from the 1960s has contributed to the reduction in volunteering, a form of social capital. Because social capital cannot be observed directly, a commonly used proxy is trust, as measured by a question, such as, “Would you say that most people can be trusted?” However, the answer to this question may not reflect belief about others’ cooperation but in fact the responder’s preferences regarding cooperation (Thöni et al. 2012). Another commonly used proxy is organizational membership (see Putnam 1995), which, however, does not imply that members interact (Charles and Kline 2006), while active community participation is more important to the construction of social capital than group membership (Beyerlein and Hipp 2006; Putnam 2000). Volunteering is an important form of community participation that captures engagement in a social activity in which individuals interact (Bekkers 2005). Although volunteering has been used typically to examine altruistic behavior (Brekke et al. 2003), it shares many characteristics of other social capital proxies (Costa and Kahn 2003). We collect data from the September Volunteer Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 2005 and 2011, and our OLS results show that a 1 standard deviation increase in the proportion of foreign-born individuals reduces the likelihood of US-born individuals volunteering by 0.05–0.06 standard deviations and the number of hours volunteered by up to 0.007 standard deviations. A major methodological concern is the endogeneity of migration flows as immigrants may choose to move to states with higher social capital (Massey and Aysa-Lastra 2011), biasing the results downwards. We address this issue by using a supply–push instrumental variable (SPIV) commonly used in the immigration literature (Card 2001; Peri 2011; Wozniak and Murray 2012). Our instrumental variable estimates show that a 1 standard deviation increase in the proportion of foreign-born individuals reduces the likelihood of US-born individuals volunteering by 0.09 to 0.15 standard deviations and the number of hours volunteered by 0.13 to 0.21 standard deviations. In addition, our robustness checks show that this result is not driven solely by increased racial fragmentation in the receiving community. Our study contributes to the literature on both social capital and migration in three main ways. First, we explore a novel data set on volunteering and show that volunteering behavior shares the same characteristics as other types of social capital investments. Second, we show that immigration influences receiving communities by reducing social capital investment because immigration increases heterogeneity beyond racial fragmentation, income inequality and changes in income of natives. Finally, we argue that the negative relationship between heterogeneity and social capital is causal. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our theoretical framework; in Sect. 3, we describe the data; and in Sect. 4, we show our empirical strategy and present our results. We verify our results with a robustness check in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6.",3

As a result, measuring the agglomeration elasticity of market outcome variables such as wages, firm dynamics, or competition is of substantial importance.Footnote 1 Oftentimes, these studies are based on an arbitrary choice of spatial unit—cities, counties or regions—and shall be hence interested in the robustness of their results given the choice of unit. Furthermore, we may be interested in comparing results obtained on one country to estimates from another. Hence, we need to understand how the specific characteristics of selecting the features of spatial units may affect the outcome of an estimation exercise. This paper will present a method to transparently investigate the impact of modeling choices of spatial aggregation that can be applied in any spatial setting with different layers of aggregation. The method will allow us to compare the magnitude of differences to aggregation to those resulting from running different regression with different controls.Footnote 2
 The unit of spatial scope can make a difference since externalities are often found to be in operation but fading away at a distance. For instance, Fotheringham and Wong (1991) argued that the features of areal units affect regression results—often in an uncertain fashion—while Dewhurst and McCann (2007) supplied evidence that the relationship between specialization and urban structure is a function of the scale of analysis. Using UK data on administrative units, they found a strong negative relationship between regional specialization and regional size. Burger et al. (2010) found different effects of agglomeration forces across geographic levels in the Netherlands. More recently, Larsson (2014) investigated how the wage density elasticity depends on spatial resolution in Swedish city areas and highlighted how quickly agglomeration effects attenuate with distance. Furthermore, the size of observation units and some of their features may be correlated and hence, estimates may be biased. For instance, large municipalities may be clustered in space because of first geography, specialization in agriculture, hard barriers to migration, distance to markets—crucial aspects of spatial economic structure that we may be looking at. Furthermore, the spatial scope of an activity may or may not coincide with the spatial scope of a political-administrative unit. At the same time, policies may affect relationships wherever interacted. Hence, any measurement at some regional level should combine the role of size (inclusion of externalities within) as well as the possible impact of regional policies. Consequently, there is a need to compare in a statistically meaningful way estimation results across spatial units of different sizes taking into account the uneven (non-random) distribution of unit size. To this end, this paper offers a transparent, easy-to-use method. The core idea of our procedure is to set up an artificial grid over the map of the country, assign municipalities (or ZIP codes) to it and then randomize the position of the grid to get a distribution of results. To do this, first, we create a grid of squares of a given size, L. Second, we take this grid of \(L \times L\) squares and randomize its place on a map and, as a result, obtain a set of random realizations of artificial spatial units. By repeating this procedure (in this paper 300 times) we can get smooth kernel distributions. Third, we iron out the border effect by merging very small areas into bigger ones. Finally, we run our regression on each of these realizations and gather coefficients that yield a distribution of our parameters of interest. After this procedure, we can look at moments of this distribution, relate the distribution of coefficients to a single measure, for example, at the administrative regional unit, or compare distributions from two randomizations. Our method is related to several earlier approaches proposed to treat the spatial aspects of estimations. The treatment of the location issue will often include spatial regression methods, and spatial lags in various forms have been widely used to gauge uncertainty about the right spatial scope (Anselin 2010). Artificial aggregation methods were also put forward. Amrhein and Flowerdew (1992) studied Canadian migration data both along region size and created artificial regions by setting a seed and randomly adding neighbors. In a close exercise to ours, Briant et al. (2010) placed starting points randomly on the map and added up an equal number of municipalities until the country was fully covered. Also closely related to this work is Menon (2012) who studied concentration patterns of US industries to disentangle labor market forces and set up a counter-factual exercise.Footnote 3
 We will be arguing that our method has the following merits: (i) it allows for carrying out estimations at various levels of aggregation and compare evidence; (ii) it treats uneven and non-random distribution of administrative unit size; (iii) it has the ability to compare results on administrative and artificial units, and (iv) it is able to gauge the statistical significance of differences. We will show that existing methods can match some but not all of these merits. To illustrate our procedure, we will use Hungarian data—see an illustrative map of Fig. 1. Hungary is a country of 10 million inhabitants, over 93 thousand square kilometers, with 3125 municipalities. There are 150 micro-regions (kistérség), 20 NUTS3 (megye) and seven NUTS2 regions defined—see details in Table 3 of “Appendix” section. At the time of our empirical exercises, administrative duties had been shared by municipalities, micro-regions and NUTS3 regions. Briant et al. (2010) argued (p 301) that for historical reasons yielding very similar regions, the French data are well suited for their approach. We believe that for historical and geographic reasons, the Hungarian landscape is rather different and its unbalanced size distribution offers a laboratory to study our method of spatial aggregation and allow for a comparison with other approaches, such as the one by Briant et al. (2010). Map of Hungary at municipal level We will consider two examples, estimating the agglomeration premium of wages and new firm formation, and we compare elasticities at two administrative units, i.e., municipal (NUTS5) and micro-region (NUTS4) levels, and for three artificial units. We are interested in the relationship between an estimated coefficient at an administrative regional level and a comparable estimate for an artificial region of similar size as well as how the average size of the defined area affects the estimated coefficient. Further, our method will be compared to earlier approaches and we argue that our methodology is better able to capture some important real-life features such as the non-random heterogeneity of the size of areal units, such as municipalities and regions. We will discuss similarities and differences with regard to other methods, in particular, with respect to Briant et al. (2010) whose method we replicated. In what follows, we first describe key issues that shed light on why measurement methodology matters. Section 3 introduces the methodology we developed, and in Sect. 4, we illustrate the method introducing two examples and present the empirical results and compare our method with some existing approaches. The last section concludes.",2

First, the Great Recession and its uneven consequences within and across countries posed new challenges to policymaking and, in particular, to the design and the adoption of policies that can help different territories to bounce back from the deep and prolonged crisis and sustain inclusive growth (Lagarde 2017). In this sense, the recent turmoil provided new stimuli to researchers interested in understanding why and where the Great Recession produced the harshest economic and social consequences and how the places more affected by the crisis can undertake recovery paths. Second, the need of interpreting the abrupt and to some extent unexpected effects of the recent crisis motived the search of different conceptual frameworks, which can be able to overcome the weaknesses of standard equilibrium approaches (Boschma 2015). Building on this, the main merit of Ron Martin in his influential seminal paper (Martin 2011) was to use the concept of resilience, which had a well-established tradition in fields like engineering and ecological studies for decades (Holling 1973; Pimm 1984), for reintroducing old concepts in the economic debate such as hysteresis, out-of-equilibrium patterns, and place-specific effects of aggregate shocks. In few years, the resilience talk experienced a spreading academic success among regional scientists and beyond (Martin 2016): a large number of papers, special issues and books dealing with it have been published. The empirical contributions investigating economic resilience looked at very different realities, from Australia to the USA, many European countries, and some developing nations (Bergeijk et al. 2017). Furthermore, resilience papers focused on different levels of analysis (Modica and Reggiani 2014): country, region, province, city, local labour market, neighbourhood, etc. Also methodologically, the papers were quite different, from case studies (Simmie and Martin 2010; Evans and Karecha 2014) to papers using indicators, shift-share or input–output analysis (e.g. Giannakis and Bruggeman 2017; Martin et al. 2016), to papers using models (e.g. Capello et al. 2015, 2016) to papers using long-run time series to investigate the transition functions of regions (Fingleton et al. 2012; Cellini and Torrisi 2014; Di Caro 2014, 2017). From a policy perspective, the resonance of the concept has also been noteworthy, for instance the European Union highlighted the importance of relying upon the resilience approach for sustaining innovation strategies and inclusive growth in Europe’s regions (EU 2017).",52

The OECD estimates that the loss of potential 2014 GDP in OECD countries which experienced a banking crisis in 2007–2011 amounts on average to 5.5%, while the average for OECD countries is of 3.5% (Ollivaud and Turner 2015). However, despite the pervasiveness of the crisis, its effects on different European countries have varied, with some losing a large percentage of GDP and/or a very large number of jobs (e.g. Greece, Italy and Spain), and others, such as Germany and Poland, being able to maintain employment and GDP levels. A country-level analysis of the impact of the financial crisis, however, conceals the highly differentiated levels in regional performance. By looking at the real GDP growth rate of European regions between 2008 and 2012 (Fig. 1, map on the left), it is certainly clear that national aspects are indeed very important, as the national boundaries are clearly identifiable. At the same time, different situations also occur within countries. For instance, one group of countries, such as France and the UK, had some regions with positive and others with negative growth rates. In a second group of countries, in particular Poland and, to a lesser extent, Germany, almost all regions had a positive average annual growth rate due to favourable national macroeconomic conditions and, finally, in a third group of countries the adverse national conditions led all regions to have negative growth rates. However, in all cases regional differences were also significant: the regional divergences from the national trend easily range from 4% more to 4% less than the national average. These differences are shown in the map on the right in Fig. 1, where the real GDP growth rate of regions is mapped relative to the national average value. The map shows that in each European country the differences between regions are highly relevant, and that all countries have some regions significantly outperforming others, and other regions significantly underperforming. There is often, but not always, a significant urban divide, with the regions of the largest cities generally performing better than other regions in the country, confirming the relative strength of metropolitan areas in the crisis (Capello et al. 2015) (Fig. 1). Absolute and differential regional growth rate 2008–2012 The literature has analysed the impact of the crisis at regional level, adopting the notion of “resilience”. This concept arose from engineering and environmental studies and is meant to represent the ability of a system to deal with shocks, either by anticipating them, by responding to them or, finally, by returning to the equilibrium which has been disturbed. The literature generally identifies three types of resilience (Martin 2012): engineering resilience, defined as the ability of a system to return to its state of equilibrium after a shock; ecological resilience, defined as the scale of shock or disorder that a system is able to absorb before it is destabilized and moves to a different state or stable equilibrium; and, finally, adaptive resilience, defined as the ability of a system to reorganize its forms or functions in an anticipatory or reactive way so as to minimize the impact of a destabilizing shock. The concept of resilience has been widely used, often with quite different nuances, but this has also led to important criticism of its applicability to regional analysis (these objections are listed and addressed in Martin and Sunley 2015) despite that it has been extended to include references to adaptation or adaptability (Hassink 2010) and, more recently, to the long-term ability to develop new growth paths (Boschma 2015). A large number of studies have empirically addressed the existence, definition and measurement of resilience. A first wave of works, mainly in the years immediately after the start of the crisis, focused on the spatial asymmetries in the reaction to the exogenous shock (e.g. Cellini and Torrisi 2016; Fingleton et al. 2015; Sensier et al. 2016). A second wave of studies, drawing on the conceptualization presented in the first wave and the availability of more data from the years after the crisis, started to investigate the determinants of the crisis. For instance, Groot et al. (2011) studied the factors behind the different sensitivity levels of countries and regions to the first phase of the crisis, identifying sectoral composition as the most important condition for resilience. Lee (2014) found that highly skilled UK cities experienced lower increases in unemployment. Martin et al. (2016) demonstrated the decreasing role of economic structure and the rise of a number of region-specific factors. Fratesi and Rodríguez-Pose (2016) showed that economies which were protected from cyclical downturns in the period prior to the crisis were not protected from the crisis itself. This paper is part of the second wave of literature and looks at the determinants of economic resilience in a holistic way, adopting the concept of territorial capital (TC), defined as the system of territorial assets of an economic, cultural, social and environmental nature, that determine the development potential of places (OECD 2001; Camagni 2009). Our assumption is that these structural territorial growth potentials characterizing each region are not neutral in the response to exogenous shocks. Rather, they allow local economies to be more resilient to negative macroeconomic trends. Obviously, this is not expected to hold true for all of the components of territorial capital. The link between territorial capital and resilience, in fact, goes beyond a mediation effect such as that hypothesized above. As with any kind of capital, territorial capital can be either accumulated or dispersed. In some cases, as in institutions, agglomeration economies and cultural heritage, for example, these processes of accumulation and dispersion are likely to occur over the long term. On the other hand, certain territorial assets, such as private capital, human capital, are less sticky and persistent over time. Therefore, since the different components of territorial capital have a more or less immediate transmission link with economic growth, and given the fact that their accumulation or decumulation times might be different, we hypothesize here that different typologies of territorial capital play different roles in the distinct phases of recession. Expectations are that the least sticky factors are also those less able to induce resilience, and that those factors whose relationship with the economy is less direct are also less able to affect resilience, which is connected to short-run adjustments. Based on this reasoning, the remaining sections of the paper are organized to meet three goals. First (Sect. 2), a review of the relationship between territorial capital and regional growth is presented. Section 3 is then devoted to the definition and empirical measurement of the endowment of territorial capital in EU NUTS3 regions, in order to highlight their specificities. Afterwards (Sect. 4), the paper analyses and measures, for the same areas, different kinds of resilience to the economic recession, which allows a distinction to be made between short-term and medium-term effects. Then, in Sect. 5, the empirical measures of resilience and territorial capital are jointly examined in an econometric analysis in order to derive conclusions about regional reaction and adaptation to the global crisis. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes by showing which aspects of territorial capital are more important and presents some policy implications.",76

In the UK, in addition to a decrease in output, the crisis led to a drop of 2.3 % in the rate of employment and an increase of 2.8 % in the rate of unemployment between 2007 and 2011. At the subnational level, there have been significant variations in the performance of different areas; for example, during the same period, Tamworth in Staffordshire lost 11.8 % of its employment, whilst Hackney in London gained 5.6 %. These wide variations lend credence to the arguments of a number of researchers that economic downturns impact on localities in significantly different ways and with varying levels of severity (Capello et al. 2016; Fingleton et al. 2012). The magnitude of the downturn and its differential impact across various areas have sparked research on identifying the underlying factors behind these differences as well as whether it is possible to influence these factors. The concept of resilience, broadly defined as the ability of a system to withstand or overcome a shock—economic or otherwise—provides one useful framework to study these questions. Within the context of the recent crisis, it is useful to identify two stages in the process of examining resilience—the initial impact/downturn or recession phase and the rebound/adaptation or recovery phase (Fingleton et al. 2012; Lee 2014; Martin and Sunley 2014). Recent empirical research on resilience focuses on examining quantifiable economic indicators such as GDP, employment and unemployment (Cellini et al. 2014; Fratesi and Rodríguez-Pose 2016; Lee 2014; Martin and Sunley 2014). A number of studies examine “peak” to “trough” differences at the national, regional or city level (Lee 2014) during the period 2008–2010. However, with 240 out of 380 GB Local Authority Districts (LADs) reaching their minimum employment rate after 2010, most of these studies fail to consider the full extent of the crisis. In addition, the use of the difference between two single points in time is subject to potentially significant errors arising from survey data based on small samples at the subnational level. As a consequence, single observations may suffer from high levels of volatility and weak reliability as evidenced by large confidence intervals for data such as unemployment at the subnational level in Great Britain. This study focuses on the impact of the 2008 recession on local labour markets and the factors behind it using an econometric analysis of data at the GB LAD level. A new method of calculating the crisis impact is proposed which involves averaging the annual data on pre- and post-2008 employment performance and examining the change of these averages in order to ameliorate the issues associated with single-year observations. The paper begins by reviewing recent developments in the study of economic resilience and the factors behind resilience performance. Section 3 discusses the data and methodology, whilst Sect. 4 presents the results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes and discusses further steps for research. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study based on the methodology and variables discussed as well as its focus on the GB’s 380 LADs.",67

During the years of the crisis and the first instances of the recovery, labour markets’ indicators and the distribution of economic activities varied significantly across and within countries (OECD 2015). From 2008 to 2014, for instance, the standard deviation of the regional unemployment rate in 276 European regions (NUTS-2 level)—data from Eurostat—increased by about 0.67. As for Italy, the Great Recession contributed to amplifying the long-established spatial divergences with regard to economic and social conditions. In the South of Italy, the contraction of the gross domestic product (GDP) registered from 2007 to 2013 was twice that observed in the Centre-North (Bank of Italy 2015). To shed new light on the spatial dimension of economic shocks, regional scientists and economic geographers have pioneered the usage of the concept of economic resilience (Reggiani et al. 2002), that is, the place-specific capacity of given areas to resist to and recover from adverse events such as natural disasters and economic crises (Martin 2012). This definition allows for the combination of the two traditional meanings of resilience (Holling 1973; Pimm 1984): engineering resilience, the capacity of a system to keep its long-term growth equilibrium path following particular disturbances; ecological resilience, the degree of resistance of a system before switching to different equilibria. As suggested by Martin and Sunley (2015), if we look at resilience as an evolutionary process both meanings are part of the more complex set of features characterizing spatial contexts that experience some shocks. Amid the theoretical and empirical questions that remain unsettled in the resilience literature, two fundamental ones have to be deal with in the near future (see the special issue ‘Resilience Revisited’ in Regional Studies
2016): the connections between resilience and the long-run growth patterns of regional economies; what determine differences in resilience across areas. This paper has three main objectives that represent novel contributions to the existing literature. First, the presence of engineering and/or ecological resilience patterns in Italy is further scrutinized by applying the nonlinear smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) methodology proposed in Di Caro (2015a) to recently available quarterly data on employment. The application of the nonlinear STAR framework results convenient for: providing a comprehensive approach for modelling the different definitions of resilience; studying the North–South disparities in Italy by allowing for the possibility of structural changes and nonlinear behaviour of employment series. Second, empirical evidence is provided for assessing whether and to which extent the occurrence of specific events registered in the early 1990s on a national (e.g. the Lira crisis, the redefinition of regional policies) and international (e.g. the signature of the Maastricht Treaty and the take-off of the European Monetary Union) level produced asymmetric consequences on the Italian regional labour markets (Cuadrado-Roura 2001; Bank of Italy 2010). Third, we participate to the alive debate on the determinants of economic resilience, by studying the role of the manufacturing or industrial sector for explaining differences in resilience across places and over time. The focus on industrial activities for economic resilience is in line with the recent interest on the effects of deindustrialization and structural change. Charles et al. (2013) pointed out that the combination of sectoral reallocations and declining manufacturing activities influenced the vulnerability of local areas. Our work makes a further contribution to the resilience literature by exploring the regional patterns of female employment during economic shocks. Specifically, the empirical analysis is applied to female employment series in order to study the interactions between gender issues and the resilience of local labour markets (Auer and Cazes 2000). Indeed, the place-specific evolution of female occupations in normal and crisis times can be the result of the particular configuration of regional labour markets (Baussola et al. 2015). Analysing the role of women in the local labour markets, moreover, is crucial for understanding the multifaceted consequences of female job opportunities like the impact on fertility intentions (Modena et al. 2014). Belloc and Tilli (2013) highlighted the relevance of regional factors for explaining the gender aspects of Italian labour markets from 1992 to 2009. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief discussion of the literature. Section 3 describes the methodology and the data. The empirical results are presented in Sect. 4. The concluding section summarizes the main findings of the work and proposes some policy implications.",9

It is clear that different regions show varying ability to successfully mitigate or react to economic crises, and one crucial question is: “Why?” What are the factors explaining a high level of regional “resilience”? Moreover, are these factors different than those driving regional growth in periods of relative stability? After briefly defining the concept of resilience and its recent application to the regional context, this paper presents a preliminary evaluation of regional economic resilience in the case of Italian Local Labor Systems (LLS). In doing so, we follow the approach by Martin (2012) and Martin and Sunley (2015) who identify three different dimensions of regional economic resilience: (a) resistance, i.e., the degree of sensitivity or depth of reaction of a regional economy to a recessionary shock; (b) recovery, i.e., the speed of recovery or degree of recovery after a certain period of time; (c) reorientation and renewal, i.e., the ability of a region to adapt in response to the shock and return to, or even improve, its long-run growth path. Our initial analysis in this paper focuses on the first two aspects of resilience, resistance and recovery. In an effort to identify what factors foster higher regional resilience, we analyze the employment growth paths and their determinants in Italian local labor markets for the period 2007–2011. In our model, we employ a set of explanatory variables, which include indexes of specialization, diversification and concentration as proposed by Mameli et al. (2008). The Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) defines a recession as a decrease in GDP for at least three consecutive trimesters. In our sample, this covers 2009–2010. We are defining the pre-recessionary period as 2007–2008, and the recovery period as 2011 (as a new recession started again in Italy at the end of 2011). The results clearly point at very different levels of resilience for the Italian LLS. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the multitude of contributions in regional science and economic geography over the last few years to the concept of regional resilience. It also describes the scope of our paper and the empirical modeling strategy. Section 3 introduces the data used in the analysis and our case study. Section 4 presents some preliminary results and discusses them. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks and avenues for future research.",110

A geographical dimension,May 2018,Erika Raquel Badillo,Rosina Moreno,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Knowledge diffusion between individuals and firms is critical for innovation and growth (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Lucas 1988; Romer 1986, 1990). Firms need to innovate continuously and rapidly to survive in today’s competitive and global markets; thus, the diffusion of new knowledge is of utmost importance. Knowledge is known to diffuse through a variety of mechanisms (Döring and Schnellenbach 2006), among which networks of collaboration in innovation activities are considered pivotal. The literature on collaborative networks, and their impact on knowledge diffusion and innovation and consequently on growth, has expanded greatly in recent years (see special issues by Autant-Bernard et al. in Papers in Regional Science 2007; and by Bergman in The Annals of Regional Science 2009). This growing need for enhanced innovation capability through the use of new knowledge produced elsewhere is forcing firms to expand technology interaction with different and increasingly geographically dispersed actors. Indeed, collaboration with a broader range of external partners may enable innovating firms to acquire required information from a variety of sources which could lead to more synergies and intake of complementary knowledge, thus promoting innovation performance (Belderbos et al. 2006; Laursen and Salter 2006; Nieto and Santamaría 2007; Van Beers and Zand 2014). The present paper contributes to this literature. In particular, we focus on the geographical scope of R&D collaborators and study their differential impact on innovation performance. A priori, external collaboration with partners abroad provides access to unique resources of foreign partners, which can produce complementary knowledge that may be in short supply in the firm’s home country. This is because collaborators abroad are embedded in different national innovation systems than collaborators in the domestic market (Miotti and Sachwald 2003; Lavie and Miller 2008; Van Beers and Zand 2014). Therefore, we expect collaborations with partners from abroad to have higher impact on the firm’s innovative performance than national collaborations. In addition, the underlying logic would state that when the external knowledge is similar to existing competences in the country, it can be absorbed easily, but will not add much to the existing local knowledge (Boschma and Iammarino 2009). In sum, distant knowledge sources should allow individuals in innovative firms to make novel associations and linkages which increase their innovativeness. Despite the extensive literature on the relationship between R&D collaboration and innovation performance, little attention has been placed on the impact that the geographical scope of such collaborations may have. There are some papers with national studies on the differences between national and international R&D alliances with respect to the impact on innovation output (Miotti and Sachwald 2003; Cincera et al. 2003; Lööf 2009; Arvanitis and Bolli 2013) which tend to conclude that innovation performance is positively and significantly influenced by international R&D cooperation, but remains unaffected or less affected by national cooperation. However, our study extends previous literature by disaggregating the geographical scope of the international alliances to explore the effect of collaboration in innovation activities with partners in particular geographical areas. Specifically, for knowledge that comes from abroad, we differentiate among collaborations maintained with European partners and those further away (the USA, China, India, or other countries). The latter are theorized to provide less redundant pieces of knowledge, which would allow enhancing creativity and innovation to a greater extent than in the intra-European case. Indeed, Miotti and Sachwald (2003) conclude that French firms resort to transatlantic R&D alliances in order to access specific and complementary R&D resources, whereas cooperation with European partners is mainly motivated by cost economising. This being true, it is sensible to think that both transoceanic and intra-European cooperation have a positive influence on the share of innovative products, although cooperation with transoceanic partners can have a higher influence whenever firms conduct research at the technological frontier. The reasoning is that this difference is due to the complementarity of the resources of extra-EU partners with those of European firms, making this type of cooperation more efficient in terms of innovation, especially for more radical innovation. Despite the general idea in favour of international cooperation providing new sources of attractive technologies and resources that are in short supply in the firm’s home country and therefore having a positive impact on innovation, the national differences between the local firm and its foreign partners can also imply barriers to efficient resource exchange, so that the final result is in doubt. According to Lavie and Miller (2008), the benefits and costs of cooperating in international contexts may vary according to the level of internationalization: the concept of alliance portfolio internationalization. This degree of internationalization refers to the cross-national differences between the firm’s home country and its partners’ countries of origin. Among the main reasons behind these differences, Ghemawat (2001) includes cultural differences, geographical distance, institutional differences, and dissimilarities in levels of economic development. With proximate foreign collaborators, the firm may fail to recognize latent national differences that would hinder its ability to understand the technology in the foreign country. And the benefits of collaborating with proximate foreign partners can be not as high since the resources that can be reached thanks to cooperation agreements do not differ dramatically from those with domestic partners. Since for the Spanish case we will differentiate between close foreign partners, such as the European ones, and those further away as in the USA and Asia, among others, we will provide evidence if the benefits of internationalization in cooperation more than compensates the organizational problems they imply, in line of the notion of the alliance portfolio internationalization given by Lavie and Miller. In tackling with the ideas above, we follow the literature on absorptive capacity and organizational learning applied to the study of alliance management (Levitt and March 1988; Kale et al. 2002; Sampson 2005) as well as that of internationalization (Lane et al. 2001). The second issue in which this paper extends the existing empirical literature addresses the fact that firms can collaborate with agents from several geographical areas at a time. Previous literature has focused on the importance of diverse collaborative networks in terms of the type of partner—supplier, client, competitor, or research organization—in achieving product innovations. In general terms, it is concluded that firms that obtain the greatest positive impact maintain external R&D collaboration with different types of partners. In other words, using a wide range of external actors helps the firm to achieve innovation since having a broader spectrum of experiences with diverse partners should allow for wider knowledge than collaboration with only one type of partner (Becker and Dietz 2004; Laursen and Salter 2006; Nieto and Santamaría 2007). We extend this reasoning to the geographical dimension. In principle, we hypothesize that collaborating with partners from diverse geographical areas should substantially boost innovation thanks to the amount and variety of knowledge that can be shared, allowing the alliance partners to fill out their initial resources and enabling the firm to make novel association and linkages. In contrast, additional alliances with the same partner may provide only redundant information and could result in inertia (Hoang and Rothaermel 2005), the same that additional alliances with partners in the same geographical area would imply information from the same regional or national innovation system. We can then argue that diverse geographical sources of knowledge provide opportunities for the firm to choose among different technological paths. Having a heterogeneous portfolio of partners enables access to diverse sources of information which facilitates firms to transfer and apply that knowledge (Ahuja and Katila 2001). However, this heterogeneity implies high costs of international and interorganizational coordination. Indeed, Frost and Zhou (2005), Lahiri (2010) and Duysters and Lokshin (2011), among others, have paid attention to the co-practice in effectively organizing for international R&D. In words of the latter, “each organization has a certain management capacity to deal with complexity which sets limits on the amount of alliance portfolio complexity than can be managed within the firm”. Thereby, we plan to evaluate the impact of conducting external collaboration with partners in at least two different geographical areas, which is assumed to provide greater diversity of the type of knowledge exchanged but also a higher degree of complexity to handle. The third and main hypothesis of this paper states that firms’ absorptive capacity determines collaboration returns to innovation. Innovation is an evolutionary and cumulative process. In consequence, only with the necessary capability to identify, assimilate, and develop useful external knowledge can the host firms and regions effectively benefit from incoming technology flows through a network of collaborators. As discussed by Cohen and Levinthal (1990), the differential impact of external incoming knowledge flows depends mainly on firms’ absorptive capacity. In the present inquiry, we argue that absorptive capacity is needed to understand and transform inflows of knowledge into innovation. Those firms with higher levels of absorptive capacity can manage external knowledge flows more efficiently, and therefore, stimulate innovative outcomes (Escribano et al. 2009). Thus, even firms exposed to the same amount of external knowledge—within a cluster, for instance—might not enjoy the same benefits, because of their different endowments of absorptive capacity (Giuliani and Bell 2005). However, we plan to give a step forward and analyse whether this absorptive capacity is equally important for national and international sources of external knowledge. A priori, investing in internal innovation activities and training employees add to the absorptive capacity of the firm and increase its ability to understand and assimilate any knowledge from external sources. However, when these sources originate in very distant geographical areas, with different economic and social backgrounds, absorptive capacity may play even a higher role than in the case of external knowledge originated within the same region or economic area. We check the validity of these three hypotheses using data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel for the period 2004–2011, which contains detailed information on the innovative behaviour of Spanish firms. Since innovation performance can only be observed for firms which report at least one innovation, the empirical strategy consists of a two-stage selection model, estimated using the Wooldridge’s (1995) consistent estimator for panel data with sample selection. The first equation is a selection equation indicating whether or not the firm was innovative. The second stage of the analysis captures the impact of collaboration with different and diverse geographical areas on innovative performance, taking into account how this impact may vary according to the absorptive capacity of the firm. From a policy perspective, the results in this paper confirm that not only investments in R&D are important to generate innovations, but also the degree to which connectivity with the outside world, which gives access to global knowledge hot spots, is useful for innovation. Such connectivity, among other ideas, is at the core of the “smart specialisation” strategy recently launched by the European Commission (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2013). According to it, the “smart specialization strategy” should include an analysis of potential partners in other regions and avoid unnecessary duplication. It also needs to be based on a strong partnership between businesses, public entities, and knowledge institutions (European Commission 2012). The empirical evidence presented in the present paper goes in this direction. However, the present paper also aims at showing to what extent the benefits of collaboration in innovation activities are likely to differ across different geographical scales. Understanding such differential impact of collaborations may help to identify the geographical areas from which the highest benefits can be obtained, which is critical to effectively promote regional economic growth and cohesion. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 offers the empirical model. The data set, variables, and a descriptive analysis are given in Sect. 3, and Sect. 4 provides the main results. Section 5 concludes.",12

Semih Akçomak,Hanna Müller-Zick,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"There is a huge literature on the impact of social capital on economic and social outcomes. Researchers have associated social capital (and/or trust) with economic growth (e.g., Knack and Keefer 1997), innovation (e.g., Akçomak and ter Weel 2009), education (e.g., Coleman 1988) and value creation by firms (e.g., Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1997). This paper looks at the relation between trust and inventive activity in European regions by considering causal, nonlinear and spatial forces. Social capital can affect inventive activity via two main mechanisms.Footnote 1 The impact of social networks on R&D and innovation has already been discussed extensively in the economics and economic geography literature (e.g., Maskell 1999; Dakhli and de Clercq 2004; Doh and Acs 2010; Malecki 2012; de Dominicis et al. 2013; Angeli et al. 2014; Crescenzi et al. 2013; Camps and Marques 2014; Leyden and Link 2015). This literature shows that social networks are important in the diffusion of tacit as well as codified knowledge. For instance, Bottazzi and Peri (2003) argue that the externalities caused by localised spillovers in European regions might be a result of non-codified, tacit knowledge of persons who frequently interact and exchange. Social networks not only play role in the diffusion of information but also create social control among economic actors. In small worlds, entrepreneurs and firms are forced to behave in a trustworthy manner in fear of loss of reputation (e.g., Rost 2011). Most elements above are mainly utilised through information exchange within a network (or across networks). On the other hand, some researchers focus on the benefits of social networks in reducing transaction cost (e.g., Zak and Knack 2001; Akçomak and ter Weel 2009; Kemeny 2012; Josten 2013; Leyden and Link 2015) and solving moral hazard problems. This second channel is mostly attributed to generalised trust. Trust relations are either formed through personal contacts (i.e., dense social networks may form trust among actors) or trust may form as a by-product of binding institutions (e.g., Beugelsdijk 2006; Akçomak and ter Weel 2009; Tabellini 2010). In both cases, high-trust environments are vibrant in creating and sharing knowledge. Thus, high-trust environments are seedbeds for entrepreneurs and researchers to conduct inventive activities (Doh and McNeely 2012; Kim and Kang 2014). This paper looks at the trust–inventive activity link in European regions. The paper investigates whether (1) there is a causal relationship between trust and inventive activity, (2) other forms of trust (e.g., general and personal) are important, (3) nonlinearity of trust is a factor to consider and (4) spatial forces affect the trust–inventive activity link. Previously, these issues have been tackled individually. The causality issue is as old as the seminal Knack and Keefer (1997) paper and has been addressed in previous research (Algan and Cahuc 2010; Crescenzi et al. 2013). Researchers have also investigated the more is better assumption of trust and social capital. Researchers report that social capital may have inverted U-shaped relation with inventive activity (e.g., Rost 2011; Echebarria and Barrutia 2013; Yu 2013). de Dominicis et al. (2013) investigate spatial forces in the social capital and innovation link. This paper is the first research that takes all these issues as a package. The empirical investigation in this paper shows that on average a one standard deviation rise in general trust (a 12.5 % rise in the trust level) increases patents per million inhabitants by 2 %. By providing a survey on the empirical literature specific to cross-section regressions that use social capital and/or trust as independent and economic growth and/or innovation as dependent variable, this paper also addresses the weak and indirect policy implications of the social capital research (see “Appendix”, Table 13 for a list of literature). For social capital to show its full effect, it is better to move away from the concept of “regional learning” that emphasises spontaneous cooperation and knowledge exchange to “learning region” (e.g., Morgan 1997) where the emphasis is on regional policy that induce learning through networks. The reason is that social capital has indirect implications for the concept of “regional learning” but can directly affect economic outcomes in a “learning region” when policy making complements. The paper proceeds as follows: Next section discusses the literature on social capital in general and trust–innovation link in particular. Section 3 presents information on the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results, and Sect. 5 provides further robustness analysis. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the findings.",13

Analysing agglomeration economies and European Investment Bank funding in European neighbouring countries,May 2018,David Castells-Quintana,Vicente Royuela,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Spatially blind policies are considered to be those that are universal in their coverage such as those associated with trade, regulation of land use or labour. These policies, though, are not necessarily blind in effect, as Hewings (2014) shows. On the contrary, regional development policies are usually justified as a way to correct market failures, many times assuming that the benefits of these policies are going to take place in regions where investments are made. Among the latter type of policies, investment in infrastructure has received a large attention of academics for decades. Infrastructure is a heterogeneous concept that includes physical structures of various types, such as “economic infrastructure” (i.e. network utilities) and “social infrastructure” (i.e. schools and hospitals). Similarly, infrastructure can be “national” (such as roads and telephone networks) and “urban” (such as sanitation facilities). Infrastructure affects economic development in two ways: (i) by the importance of investment in the sector itself on GDP and as an input of other sectors and (ii) by improving overall productivity. As Kessides (1996) highlights, infrastructure promotes development not only by increasing productivity but also by providing amenities that enhance the quality of life. Infrastructure also contributes to growth by enhancing structural change, including favouring economic diversification and technological innovation, and by changing the structure of production and consumption. According to Hakfoort (1996), most studies report a significant positive effect of infrastructure on development, although the recent literature tends to report smaller effects than effects reported earlier, as a result of asset-quality issues, nonlinearities and, not less importantly, the need to provide spare capacity as a necessary condition for a properly functioning system. Hakfoort highlights the lack of empirical evidence of how congestion of “impure public goods” (as transportation infrastructure) leads to a suboptimal growth path, while Newbery (2012) notes that to the extent that suboptimal infrastructure investment constrains other investment, it constrains growth.Footnote 1 As Estache (2010) remarks, the more important the opportunity cost of infrastructure investment gaps in terms of growth and productivity is, the poorer is the country. Consequently, it is needed to consider different levels of development when analysing this relationship. Among all infrastructure in Europe, transport is the single largest sector by investment, accounting for more than half of total investment, followed by utilities (i.e. energy, water, and waste and sewage) (Wagenvoort et al. 2010). The provision of these different types of infrastructure has an impact on the spatial distribution of population and economic activity. Within the context of the New Economic Geography models (Fujita et al. 1999), improving connectivity between cities can result in spatial agglomeration. And, as Anderson and Lakshmanan (2007) note, agglomeration economies are the most important spatial process promoting productivity growth and in many developing countries, population distribution (Royuela and Ordóñez-Cuenca 2016). Hence, agglomeration economies taking place in urban areas represent one underlying mechanism through which infrastructure can potentially enhance productivity. Urban agglomeration, in particular the degree of urban concentration, has been found to strongly affect economic growth (Henderson 2003; Brülhart and Sbergami 2009; Castells-Quintana and Royuela 2014). The 2009 World Development Report (WDR) stressed that “economic development is seldom balanced... efforts to spread it prematurely will jeopardize progress” (World Bank 2009, p. 6). This leads to increasing income disparities across regions, especially in developing countries. However, the WDR also points out that “the question is whether growing concentrations of humanity will increase prosperity, or produce congestion and squalor” (World Bank 2009, p. 3). In the urban economics literature, the nature of the national urban system and the interactions between cities (Duranton and Puga 2000), as well as the functional characteristics of cities themselves (Camagni et al. 2013; Capello and Camagni 2000; Royuela and Suriñach 2005), have been suggested as further determinants of the benefits and costs from agglomeration. By improving the connectivity between cities or by lowering congestion and disamenities within them, infrastructure developments are expected to enhance the benefits from urban concentration (see also Bertinelli and Black 2004; Henderson 2005 and Castells-Quintana 2016).Footnote 2 In this line, we assume that the way that countries can exploit the full benefits of agglomeration economies depends on the quantity and type of infrastructures provision.Footnote 3 Thus, we can expect that the national rate of economic growth will depend not only on the process of urban concentration, but also on its interaction with the development of infrastructure (either of all types or specific—i.e. connectivity or urban). In policy terms, the relevant question concerns whether public funding associated with the provision of infrastructure explicitly considers such relationship.Footnote 4 In the recent years, a public debate is devoted to the “spatial footprint” of public policies. Barca et al. (2012) explain how globalisation has made localities and their interaction more relevant for economic growth and prosperity, where space has become more rather than less relevant. The 2009 WDR advocated the advantages associated with the agglomeration effects of large cities. The Report supported spatially blind strategies able to generate efficiency and development. Barca (2009) and OECD Reports (OECD 2009a, b, c), among others, claim that the objective of development intervention should be to promote growth in all regions and propose a string of place-based interventions (integrated regional policies). The aim of this paper is twofold: on the one hand, we embrace the urban economics and infrastructure literature by assessing the role of different types of infrastructure in the relationship between urban concentration and economic growth. On the other hand, we embrace the institutional and policy literature to investigate to what extent public policies have considered the spatial dimension and the connection between infrastructure and agglomeration. In order to achieve our aims, we first assess the role of the infrastructure–agglomeration interaction on economic growth by means of a panel data analysis that considers different measures of infrastructure (as the provision of basic services, transport, and communications). We study differential effects using as case study the European Neighbouring Policy (ENP) countries, EU countries, and the rest of the world. Second, we provide a simple assessment of to what extent the urban structure influences the allocation of funds for infrastructure investment (i.e. whether the allocation these funds is spatially blind or not). For this we analyse the same policy instrument, the funding and lending policies of the European Investment Bank (EIB), for both the EU and ENP countries. Our results provide evidence on the relevance of the interaction between transport and communications infrastructure and the process of urban concentration on economic development in ENP countries. On the other hand, we do not find an explicit relationship between the urban structure of neighbouring countries and the funding policy of the EIB, in contrast to what takes place in the EU. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the ENP. In Sect. 3, we review the association between economic growth and the urban structure of countries, with particular attention to ENP countries and the role of infrastructure in this relationship. We describe the empirical model and the data we use and present some results. In Sect. 4, we analyse the projects financed by the EIB over the 1995–2010 period. We investigate whether these projects are connected with the spatial structure of our considered countries. In Sect. 5, we conclude with the main outcomes of our research and with several policy implications that can be derived from them.",4
60.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,02 December 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-016-0798-x,Spatial dynamics and agglomeration forces in the external EU periphery,May 2018,Dimitris Kallioras,Vassilis Monastiriotis,George Petrakos,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The recent European Union (EU) enlargements brought the borders of the EU to a set of countries in the East with historically less intensive economic relations and little experience with democratic capitalism. These countries have been part of the (former) Soviet Union and are characterized by lower development levels and significant institutional and structural weaknesses. At the same time, in the Southern and the Eastern rim of the Mediterranean Sea, the EU is faced with countries that are facing their own challenges with regard to economic and democratic transition and which are historically linked to individual EU countries through their colonial past. Both bordering areas, in the EU East and the EU South, have been gaining significance as they include emerging economies, energy suppliers, or, simply, a large neighboring market, which is crucial for the EU economy. More importantly, perhaps, they have been gaining significance for security reasons, including in relation to illegal migration and the control of international terrorism and, more recently, the refugee crisis. In response to these, the EU launched, in 2004, the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP), a unified policy framework toward its neighboring countries (the ENPCs), laying in the external EU periphery, aiming at strengthening prosperity, stability and security around its geo-political borders (EC 2004, 2010, 2011, inter alia). The policy covers six countries of the “eastern” neighborhood (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine—the ENPCs East) and ten countries of the “southern” neighborhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Occupied Palestinian Territory (Palestine), Syria and Tunisia—the ENPCs South). Recent developments in the region (i.e., Ukrainian crisis, Libya and Syria wars) saw the revision of the ENP framework with a shift of focus to security and societal issues (human trafficking, anti-radicalization, youth unemployment) aiming not only at economic stabilization but also at addressing social and political destabilization (Monastiriotis and Borrell 2013; EC 2015). This is especially in response to the sociopolitical turmoil that has engulfed some of these countries, especially after the short period of optimism following the so-called Arab Spring, and which has resulted in significant and sometimes extreme population movements both inside (Ukraine) and outside (Syria) their borders. Partly motivated by these significant social and demographic changes, in this paper we take a step back and seek to examine the dynamics of population growth within each of the ENP countries prior to recent turmoil. Borrowing from the urban economics literature, but applied here at the regional level (partly due to data limitations), we look at one particular influence on population change, namely the role of agglomeration. We examine specifically whether sub-national population change responds positively or negatively to agglomeration (measured as population density), i.e., in ways that reinforce or instead equalize population concentrations across space. This question has a relevance which goes beyond the demographic interest per se. In the absence of good quality (or, sometimes, any) sub-national level income data, examining processes of concentration and de-concentration of population can also shed light on questions concerning economic convergence/divergence more generally. Although, admittedly, interest in spatial patterns of disparity is generally associated to variables measuring income and welfare, the analysis of the spatial dynamics of population concentration is important both in itself and in the sense of understanding wider economic processes (Duranton and Puga 2014). Indeed, scholars both in the urban economics (Fujita 1988; Heslsey and Strange 1990; Glaeser 1999; Duranton and Puga 2001) and the growth economics tradition (Lucas 1988; Glaeser et al. 1995) have well-recognized that studying population growth offers a window through which to study the process of economic growth as the latter is systematically related to population growth through the trade-off between agglomeration economies and urban (i.e., commuting, housing, land use, environmental, inter alia) costs. This is especially so in the context of the ENP space, in particular, given that productivity levels, capital deepening and levels of technology in these countries are still low and thus economic growth is still very much of the extensive (increase in inputs, including labor) than the intensive form (increase in the productivity of each input and in total factor productivity). Moreover, given that the vast majority of these countries are still at low levels of economic development, spatial productivity differentials are predominantly along the lines of urban-rural (core–periphery) dichotomy (Harris and Todaro 1970; Galor and Weil 2000; Hansen and Prescott 2002; Lucas 2004; Henderson and Wang 2005), and thus very much related to patterns of population agglomeration (urbanization). In these conditions, measures of spatial disparity in population concentration act as a lower bound indicator of spatial disparities in economic activity and wealth. Thus, by examining how agglomeration influences population growth across space—irrespective of whether this is instigated by migration or natural movements—we also obtain some insight into how agglomeration influences economic growth across regions in these countries. Irrespective, however, of the question as to how well spatial inequalities in population growth reflect disparities in economic indicators (e.g., regional GDP per capita), examining the dynamics of the former—and whether they reflect cumulative or equilibrating tendencies—is of acute analytical and policy interest in itself. If patterns of population growth are found to be cumulative across space, this could be taken as a signal of a wider spatial disequilibrium in these countries, representing spatial inequalities in economic opportunities more generally. The latter would in turn raise concerns about social and economic cohesion in these countries and ultimately about the support to—and legitimacy of—processes of market liberalization and economic integration, including those instigated directly by the EU’s policy in the region under the ENP framework. This is especially important because, as the literature has shown in relation to the experience of previous EU association waves, spatial imbalances are often accentuated by processes of deeper association and integration with the EU (Neven 1995; Quah 1996; Rodriguez-Pose and Fratesi 2004; Barrios and Strobl 2009; Petrakos et al. 2011; Monastiriotis 2014; Monastiriotis et al. 2016, inter alia). As a corollary, accentuated spatial disparities (both in incomes and in perceived economic opportunities), and the legitimacy questions that they may raise, can act as an impediment to the ability of the EU to stimulate, and pursue, effective democratization in its neighborhood. Thus, either as a possible side-effect of integration or as a precondition for its success, the extent of regional disparities and imbalances in the associated countries matters. Nevertheless, explained to a large extent by the absence of suitable data and especially data that would be comparable across countries, the literature has so far only offered very limited insights into these questions of spatial disparities and their dynamics in the ENP space. Among the handful of exceptions, the paper by Peridy et al. (2013) stands out as perhaps the most comprehensive study to date to examine questions of regional convergence for a group of ENPCs. Specifically, the authors use regionalized GDP data from the Yale University GEcon3.3 dataset project to study spatial dependence as well as conditional and unconditional convergence at the sub-national level for a sub-set of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries. Although this is a welcome contribution to what is, largely, an unexplored topic, their reliance on artificially constructed regional units on the basis of “1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude terrestrial grid cells” makes their empirical findings somewhat less relevant for understanding the actual special-economic dynamics underpinning the growth process of these countries’ actual regional economies. Besides this, a limited number of studies have examined patterns of regional disparities for a select few number of countries for which better-quality data exist (e.g., Demchuck and Zelenyuk 2009; Kokko and Kravtsova 2012; Kallioras and Tsiapa 2015 for Ukraine; Lipshitz and Raveh 1998; Portnov and Erell 2004; Beenstock and Felsenstein 2008 for Israel; Petrakos et al. 2016 for Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Israel and Ukraine). In this context, the analysis presented in this paper makes, we believe, an important contribution to our knowledge and understanding of spatial processes in the ENP region. To perform our analysis, we take two complementary steps. First, we specify a simple equation which makes population growth a function of population density. We treat this as an insight model for the relationship between agglomeration and growth, a relationship that has been examined widely and under a variety of settings in the spatial economics literature (see, inter alia, Cheshire and Magrini 2000; Brülhart and Sbergami 2009; Boschma et al. 2012). We note that although the intuition of the model derives from the literature of the economics of agglomeration (Marshalian externalities, knowledge spillovers, etc.—see Glaeseret al. 1991; Coombes 2000) its form is equivalent to a simple (unconditional) convergence model specified in terms of population densities. Geared with the empirical evidence collected from this analysis and the similarity in form to the convergence hypothesis, we then move on to perform a more detailed analysis of club convergence, using the methodology developed by Chatterji (1992) and Chatterji and Dewhurst (1996) which examines the temporal dynamics of each region’s distance from a national frontier. In both cases of the empirical analysis, we find evidence of diffusion of agglomerations, or of convergence, only in a minority of countries and regions. On the whole, the ENPCs South space is characterized by evidence of diffusion of agglomerations (convergence), while the ENPCs East exhibits stronger and more consistent evidence of regional concentration (divergence). Our results suggest that agglomeration and cumulative causation forces are more strongly in operation in the more advanced, at least in terms of EU relations, countries of the ENP East, where also the “pull” factor of the EU economy is stronger. In contrast, in parts of the ENPCs South we find that agglomeration forces play a limited role and thus that centripetal tendencies of divergence are scarcer and weaker. These findings, besides their academic interest more generally, provide significant implications as regards EU policy in the ENPCs—an issue that we touch upon in the concluding section. Before that, in the next section we present some basic descriptive information on our sample of ENPCs regions and the details of our empirical approach. Sections 3 and 4 present, respectively, our empirical analysis on the impact of agglomeration on population growth and on the possibility for the emergence of regional convergence clubs at the sub-national level. As noted above, the last section concludes with some implications for policy.",3

As Fatas and Mihov (2009) highlight, for the first time in recent history the “periphery” is producing more good and services than the “core” and the consolidation of new actors in the global economy has occurred faster than ever. Didier et al. (2012) have also shown that, although emerging economies have also suffered growth collapses, they have been more resilient and have continued growing and recovering pre-crisis levels faster than developed economies. In Europe, the economic situation resulting from the 2008 crisis cannot be explained by a simple North–South divide (Crescenzi et al. 2016), and the evolution in recent year has been quite diverse not only among European Union (EU) members but also in the European neighbouring countries (ENC) (European Commission 2009). Several neighbouring countries in the East and South borders of the European Union were among the best economic performers in relative terms during the pre-crisis period. For instance, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were very often described as “Baltic Tigers” with GDP annual growth rates above 10 % from 2003 to 2007 (Dudzińska 2013). The increase in oil prices from 2000 to 2008 together with the impact of the 2000’s reforms lead Russia to record growth rates and an impressive improvement in the living standards of the population (World Economic Forum 2013). In a similar way, countries in the Mediterranean area considered to be “lion economies” include several ENC as Algeria, Morocco, Egypt or Tunisia. Europe’s demographic and economic decline together with policies supporting a better integration in world markets have been key factors to explain the better performance of countries in the Mediterranean area during the last decades (World Economic Forum 2011). The objective of this paper is to analyse the recent evolution of the ENC not only by looking at GDP growth but considering different dimensions related to economic performance (measured in a broader sense), social progress and institutional reforms. The ENC performance in these different dimensions is compared to the one experienced by a wide sample of economies including not only developed economies but also developing and emerging ones. In order to facilitate this comparison, we develop a composite indicator capturing economic, institutional and social aspects of the different countries. Composite indicators are relevant tools for monitoring and policy assessment. As highlighted by Murillo et al. (2015), they provide a synthetic view about the evolution of variables of interest, but as the indicator breaks into simple indicators, they can also help policy makers to understand the strong and weak points of their economies and, if required, to simulate the results of different economic policies. Taking this into account, our proposal adds to the growing literature that tries to overcome the shortcomings of unidimensional approaches such as those focusing on Gross Domestic Product per capita or those based on multidimensional index such as the United Nations’ Human Development Index that has been widely criticised in the literature (see, for instance, Wu et al. 2014). The wider perspective in the construction of the index will allow us to focus on different aspects using a homogeneous approach. In fact, the use of composite indicators to compare different dimensions between developed and emerging economies (and even within them) is not straightforward. The literature is currently expanding this view not only in economic terms but also on social and institutional dimension (see, for instance, Çolak and Ege 2013; Mitra 2013; Giambona and Vassallo 2014 or Smits and Steendijk 2015 as representative examples of this recent literature). In this paper, we build a new multidimensional index in order to analyse the economic, social and institutional performance of ENC compared to a wide sample of developed and developing economies. Although several similar indexes exist nowadays, their composition and their time and country coverage are quite different to the one proposed here taking into account the objective of our analysis. For instance, the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) provides data for 140 economies (including ENC), but the first year for which data are available using the current methodology is 2005 while some of the actions related to ENP started in the end of the nineties.Footnote 1 Regarding the dimensions considered, and although the information is much more disaggregated, the main three pillars are basic requirements, efficiency enhancers and innovation and sophistication factors, aspects that cannot be easily associated to economic, institutional and social aspects. Other indexes such as the GEDI index,Footnote 2 or the Legatum Prosperity IndexFootnote 3 have similar limitations in terms of the time period covered. Last, the IMD World Competitiveness YearbookFootnote 4 covers a longer time period than most available indicators, but its main problem from the point of view of our analysis is its limited country coverage (61 economies), particularly regarding ENC. An important aspect that we have to take into account when carrying out our comparative analysis of the ENC relative performance is the adoption of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP). The aim of this policy is to promote political and institutional changes towards democratic governance and market liberalisation, a process that at the same time is understood as a tool for economic development in neighbouring countries and convergence towards the European Union member states. ENP does not offer accession perspective to the EU for these countries, but promotes close political cooperation, close economic integration and access to the EU market as an incentive to carry out economic and institutional reforms with the aim also of improving the social cohesion in these countries. In fact, as highlighted by Dodini and Fantini (2006), the economic effects of the ENP would be related to three interrelated channels (structural reforms, macro policy anchor and trade and factor movement) that could allow neighbouring countries to benefit in the long run from positive impacts that would reduce their current gap with EU member states. Taking this into account, our analysis has to consider the potential effects of this policy on the relative evolution of ENC. Considering this background, in the second section of the paper, we summarise the scarce literature that has analysed up to now the impact of ENP on the relative performance of the affected countries. Next, in the third section, we describe the methodology used to elaborate the Institutional, Social and Economic Performance Index (ISEPI). In the fourth section, we analyse the regional differences in the evolution of this index (and its components) through the comparison of ENC with a wider sample of economies. Last, the paper concludes summarising the main findings and discussing its implications regarding the future design of the ENP.",4
61.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,30 October 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-017-0855-0,Spatial convergence of real wages in Russian cities,July 2018,Vera Ivanova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There is strong empirical evidence showing that regional economies grow at different rates which (i) tend to converge over time (see Baumol 1986, and the subsequent literature on “convergence”) and (ii) are spatially correlated (Abreu et al. 2005). Convergence in per capita incomes finds its theoretical basis in models of economic growth (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992), while spatial convergence has been theoretically justified by Ertur and Koch (2007), who derive a spatial autoregressive equation from a growth model which takes into account technological interactions between regions based on proximity and neighborhood effects. Furthermore, new economic geography models predict spatial convergence in real wages, since migration between cities/regions leads to real wage equalization in the long run. This idea was proposed by Krugman (1991) in a setting with two regions. I derive a spatial beta-convergence equation for real wages using the simple multi-region model proposed by Tabuchi et al. (2005) in Sect. 3. This paper tests these spatial convergence predictions for Russian cities. Since Russia is a large country with a very uneven distribution of economic activity, it is natural to conjecture that the “spatial” component of convergence in both real wages and per capita incomes is essential. Until now, the analysis of the spatial determinants of regional economic growth in Russia has been addressed in the literature by using the subjects-of-federation-level data.Footnote 1 This approach, however, is problematic, for it leads to a loss of information due to extremely high intraregional heterogeneity (Zubarevich 2015). Moreover, because the regions are few, this limits the use of advanced econometric methods in order to estimate the relevant effects. In this paper, I suggest a way of overcoming these difficulties. Using disaggregated geo-coded data, I study whether the properties of city location patterns foster convergence in real wages, and quantify the impact of the spatial structure of the economy on \(\beta \)-convergence in real wages in Russia. This has the advantage of exploiting a finer location pattern as a source of variation, and allows me to design a flexible empirical strategy that yields robust inferences. I apply Bayesian spatial econometric models that allow a comparison of the estimation results for different spatial weight matrices. The flexibility of this econometric procedure also comes from the possibility of fine-tuning the sparsity of the spatial weight matrix, a property that is of paramount importance in modern spatial econometrics (LeSage and Pace 2009). To the best of my knowledge, no similar setting has ever been used in previous empirical work on Russian regional development. My main findings can be summarized as follows. First, real city wages (i) converge over time and (ii) are significantly affected by the initial levels of real wages in neighboring cities. Second, the radius of significant spatial interactions between Russian cities is around 300–600 km for cities west of the Urals, and around 1000 km for the Far North (cities in the Arctic Circle and some other isolated cities), where convergence is slower. Third, the effect of regional subsidies on real wage is negative, and the effect of natural resources on real wages has become weaker over time. Finally, although no official statistical data on per capita incomes are available at city level in Russia, I find a strong positive correlation between per capita income and wages at the subject-of-the-federation level, which persists over time. Based on that, I believe that my main results provide indirect evidence for spatial convergence of Russian cities in per capita incomes. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature, mostly based on Russian regional data. Section 3 provides a theoretical foundation for real wage convergence in cities. Section 4 describes the dataset. I discuss spatial weight matrices applied to Russian regional data and show a significant positive autocorrelation of real wages in Russia using a series of spatial matrices. Section 5 shows the findings: (i) conditional sigma-convergence of spatially weighted real wages and (ii) spatial beta-convergence of real city wages. I show that my conclusions are robust to the threshold distance, i.e., the estimation results are not sensitive to the exclusion of remote towns from the dataset. Section 6 concludes.",6

Komarek,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the 2000s, the USA began experiencing a boom in oil and natural gas production. Estimates from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicate natural gas production increased by over 25% from 2000 to 2013. The sudden expansion of natural gas was largely due to new technologies that combine horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturingFootnote 1 (a.k.a. fracking). Specifically, advances in fracking technology made it profitable to extract natural gas from shale formations,Footnote 2 which were previously inaccessible. The EIA 2013 Annual Energy Outlook predicts natural gas production will continue to rise. Estimates suggest the USA holds 70 years of natural gas reserves. The natural gas boom will likely have broad impacts on issues ranging from energy security to climate change. Furthermore, the energy boom will also impact local communities, or “boomtowns” where extraction takes place. These boomtowns are often the epicenter of rapid population and economic growth from resource extraction. There is a large literature examining the effect of resource extraction and specialization on the labor market and economic growth. First, resource extraction could create short-run benefits through spillovers in the multiplier process (e.g., income and jobs). The income multiplier development channel is likely to be relevant for shale gas production due to the potential financial windfall to mineral rights owners (Paredes et al. 2015). In particular, Brown et al. (2016) estimate local royalty income in the Marcellus region was $2.15 billion in 2014.Footnote 3 Second, Dutch disease, a version of the resource curse, highlights that some industries could be harmed over time. This could take place through the extraction sector bidding up factor prices and subsequently crowding out the traded sector (Corden and Neary 1982; Sachs and Warner 2001; Jacobsen and Parker 2016). Nonetheless, the literature has found little evidence of Dutch disease during the fracking boom (Komarek 2016; Allcott and Keniston 2014; Brown 2014). Resource extraction could also impact the labor market and subsequent economic growth through human capital development. Growing evidence shows that areas with high levels of shale oil and gas extraction see declines in high school and college educational attainment (Rickman et al. 2017; Cascio and Narayan 2015). Media outlets have also begun to draw attention to a darker side of the fracking boom. An article in National Geographic on the Bakken Shale area of North Dakota highlights binge drinking, prostitution and violence among other negative behaviors associated with “man camps” that spring up to house outside workers (Dobbs 2013). Journalists have also noted increases in drugs and drug-related crimes in the Washington Post (Horwitz 2014), violence against women in the New York Times (Eligon 2013), as well as fatal accidents and sexually transmitted infections (Food and Water Watch 2013). In a revealing exposition titled “Wildcatting: A Stripper’s Guide to the Modern American Boomtown,” an adult entertainment worker describes her “roughneck” customers and the transition of Williston, N.D., into a resource extraction boomtown (Shepard 2013). The author writes: Williston residents complain that an unsavory element has been drawn to town, pointing to spikes in violent crime, sexual assault, and drug-related (often meth) arrests. In March, a man was murdered in the street in front of the two strip clubs. A brawl in Heartbreakers spilled into the street. It was possibly spurred along by one of the Heartbreakers bouncers. A man was shot and killed. The police didn’t arrive for 30 minutes because the on-duty officers were tied up at another (non-lethal) shooting on the other side of town. The phrase “the Wild West” is frequently uttered; to many it feels lawless. The author describes the population growth in the boomtown, which largely comes from young males earning a high salary with little attachment to the community. This echoes academic research (e.g., Archbold 2013; Ruddell 2011) that shows the inability of local governments, including law enforcement, to respond to rapidly changing local conditions in boomtowns. The resource curse literature has examined channels that perpetuate poor overall growth prospects for resource-rich areas. These channels have included labor market issues such as Dutch disease and reductions in human capital formation as well rent seeking, corruption and conflict (van der Ploeg 2011). At the country level, this literature has considered armed conflict for control of resource income (van der Ploeg 2011). James and Smith (2017) suggest that elevated criminal activity from a resource boom, which has parallels to armed conflict, could also lead to a long-term resource curse. For example, elevated levels of criminal activity could lead to out-migration of both human and physical capital and a decrease in business formation, among other issues. Nevertheless, the research on the localized effect of a resource boom on criminal activity in a developed country is scarce. The criminology literature has utilized qualitative methods to show an increased fear of crime and drunk driving among local residents as a result of resource-based booms (Carrington and Pereira 2011; Ruddell et al. 2013). While Luthra et al. (2007) use pooled time-series analysis for the offshore oil industry in Louisiana, but do not find significant effects on local crime. In contrast, Haggerty et al. (2014) find that specialization in oil and gas extraction in the 1970s negatively effected crime rates (property and violent) and education rates long term. Haggerty et al. (2014) quantify the negative effects of the resource bust on crime and quality-of-life indicators. In contrast, James and Smith (2017) examine the continental USA during the shale boom and show that the cost of an additional crime creates approximately $2 million in damages. Furthermore, the authors show that individuals with criminal records move disproportionately to areas experiencing the shale boom. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of the unconventionalFootnote 4 (fracking) natural gas extraction boom, and more generally resource booms, on crime. Social costs associated with resource extraction are an important, yet less understood component of the resource curse. I use county-level data from 2004 to 2012 on seven FBI Index I offenses and unconventional natural gas wells drilled. My identification strategy uses a difference-in-differences model and exploits a natural experiment from differing policies related to fracking in the Marcellus region. The State of New York imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking techniques (Rabe and Borick 2013). Conversely, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania permitted use of fracking technology over the sample time period. The natural experiment provides arguably exogenous variation in policy regimes, because the New York moratorium and later ban was largely due to environmental concerns, and not the fear of increased criminal activity.Footnote 5 I bring together various theoretical links from the economics and criminology literature to look at the relationship between the resource extraction boom and crime. It is outside of the scope of this study to disentangle each of these sources of criminal activity. However, I do use a wide range of control variables to account for the indirect influences of the fracking boom through the local economy and police activity. This allows me to isolate the effect of fracking-related labor activity on crime. My results show that natural gas boom counties (measured by 75 or more unconventional wells drilled in a year) experience an approximately 30% increase in violent crimes compared to control counties. In contrast, property crimes in boom counties were statistically insignificant in my preferred specification. There is weak evidence, when not controlling for indirect influences of fracking through the local economy, that fracking activity effects violent crimes in neighboring counties. Falsification tests suggest that the positive relationship between fracking and crime is not due to divergent preexisting trends, and therefore support a causal interpretation. Furthermore, I show that the results are robust to alternative specifications, samples and estimation techniques. Finally, I use information from the criminology literature to estimate the total victimization cost, which totals $8.1 million in high fracking counties per year and $1.8 million in low fracking areas each year. This study contributes to the literature by measuring the contemporaneous effect of a natural resource extraction boom on criminal activity. Ideally, one would want to examine the effect of the influx of extraction workers on crime. However, labor market data are unreliable due to the transient nature of many extraction workers and censored industry classification information at the county level. Thus, I use the number of unconventional wells drilled to determine boom areas and in some specifications a wide range of control variables to isolate fracking-related labor activity on crime. Inevitably humans commit and are victims of crimes, nonetheless unconventional wells drilled act as a proxy for economic activity from resource extraction. According to Jacquet (2009), the drilling phase is the most labor-intensive part of natural gas extraction. This work complements James and Smith (2017), which quantifies the cost of shale boom-related crimes for the entire USA. In comparison, I use an identification strategy that focuses on a natural experiment in the Marcellus shale region. The time horizon and phase of resource development I measure differs from Haggerty et al. (2014). My estimates examine criminal activity that is a consequence of the boom period of fracking, while Haggerty et al. (2014) considers crime resulting from industry specialization and an energy extraction bust. Thus, my results should be taken in the context of the fracking boom period in the Marcellus region and caution should betaken in generalizing them to other industries, time periods or technologies.",35

61.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,17 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-018-0863-8,Access to banks and external capital acquisition: perceived innovation obstacles,July 2018,Mikaela Backman,Tina Wallin,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In this paper, we analyse whether low access to banks increases the difficulty of acquiring external financial capital among firms that wish to innovate. In the EU, banks are by far the most common providers of loans to firms (European Commission 2011). Overall, 87% of the firms that were granted loans during 2009–2011 obtained them from a bank. Only 4% obtained loans from private individuals, such as family members or friends, and 8% obtained loans from other sources, such as microfinance institutions or government-related sources. The same pattern can be observed in Sweden, which has a financial system that is bank-oriented and founded on relationships between banks and their customers (Avdeitchikova 2008; Sjögren and Zackrisson 2005). Most Swedish firms use bank loans; small- and medium-sized enterprises are particularly reliant on banks for their external financial funding needs (Berggren et al. 2001). Although banks are the main providers of financial capital to firms, there has been a drastic change in the organisation of the local financial infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2010, approximately half of Sweden’s local bank branches closed, a development that was particularly prevalent in rural areas. This change was problematic, as studies find that access to financial capital is important for both new firm formation (Backman 2015) and firm-level innovations (Hall et al. 2016; O’Sullivan 2005). In addition, studies find that it is the local financial infrastructure that is important for many firms (Backman 2015; Cole 1998; Cole et al. 2004; Ferri and Messori 2000; Fritsch and Schilder 2008; Lutz et al. 2013; Pollard 2003). Using this development as a starting point, our purpose is to analyse how access to financial capital, proxied by the Euclidian distance to bank branches and the number of bank branches in the surrounding areas, is related to firms’ perceived difficulties in obtaining external financial capital for their innovation processes. By doing so, we extend previous findings that financial obstacles impede firms’ innovative capabilities (Alessandrini et al. 2010; Blanchard et al. 2013; Canepa and Stoneman 2008; Lee and Brown 2017). Our research contributes to the field of the literature in several aspects. First of all, the main contribution of this study is the ability to relate the exact distance between the firm and the bank branch, i.e. we analyse the operational distance between bank branch and the borrower. We test how the Euclidean distance between a bank branch and the firm influences the firm’s ability to acquire external capital for innovation. Previous studies have used a region’s overall supply of bank branches. It further allows us to move away from administrative borders and can measure urbanity and rurality as a continuous measure rather than separating administrative borders into different regional taxonomies. Second, despite a growing field, the geography of debt financing has been less extensively analysed compared to, for example, venture capital. Lastly, it is the first study on the importance of geographical distance and financing in innovative firms in a Swedish context. Doing research on Sweden complements the previous studies that have analysed the situation in, for example, the UK and in Italy. Sweden is a bank-oriented country where distance and peripherality make a large difference for firms and their daily practices. Focusing on innovations also has several advantages. By definition, innovations are accompanied by a high degree of uncertainty, and firms often require external capital to finance their innovative activities (Canepa and Stoneman 2008; Hall et al. 2016). Thus, banks have high monitoring costs related to these kinds of projects. By focusing on innovations, we also reduce the heterogeneity associated with the numerous purposes for which a firm can use borrowed funds. We use the demand perspective in this paper whereby we analyse a firm’s perceived difficulties in obtaining capital. We acknowledge the importance of the supply side, but because of data limitations, we are unable to further investigate this aspect of the issue. To answer our research question, we combined the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) wave from 2010 with detailed geo-coded data on firms at the coordinate level. From the CIS, in which firms are requested to rank (in terms of magnitude) the problems they have encountered when acquiring external financial capital, it is possible to observe perceived obstacles to innovation. Our hypothesis is that lower access to banks is associated with larger perceived obstacles to obtaining capital for innovation. This hypothesis is examined using a logit model in which we include distance to the nearest bank branch, the total number of bank branches in the vicinity, and firm- and region-level controls. The results show that longer distance is associated with a higher probability of a firm experiencing external capital problems. In addition, the local supply of bank branches appears to be important, as a larger number of local bank branches are associated with a lower probability of experiencing external capital problems. The implications of our results are that low access to banks renders firms less innovative as a result of perceived financial constraints. Technically, such constraints arise when there is a difference between the rate of return required by the owner investing internal funds and the rate of return required by external actors in the investment activity. Thus, a firm is financially constrained if it cannot obtain external capital at the market price (Hall 2002; Hubbard 1998). The consequence of firms encountering external financial constraints while lacking internal funds is less innovation activity than is optimal and thus market failure. Regulations that target the financial sector (e.g. Basel III and MiFID), which reduce banks’ ability to provide finance, also lead to a tighter credit supply. Combined with the ongoing trend towards the closure of bank branches, especially in rural areas, we may observe severe problems in the long run, with firms performing less than optimally because of their diminished ability to conduct innovative activities. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of why access to financial intermediaries matters to firms and presents a brief background description of the Swedish financial sector. Section 3 presents the data, variables and method employed. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical estimations, and Sect. 5 concludes this paper.",17

Many Japanese companies have focused on and are expanding into these large foreign markets. Previous studies show that, in addition to traditional cost-reduction factors (e.g., lower wages, the infrastructure in a host country), Japanese companies’ choices of location are affected by the agglomeration of Japanese firms and domestic market demand (Akune and Tokunaga 2003, 2012; Ikegawa et al. 2013), as well as by promotion policies (Ikegawa et al. 2014b). In the 1990s, prior to the Asian financial crisis, companies focused only on traditional cost-reduction factors. However, since then, they have also focused on the host countries’ domestic markets (Ikegawa et al. 2014a). Based on an interview survey, Ikegawa et al. (2014a) found that the number of middle-income households is increasing in East Asia, particularly since 2000, and that refrigerators have become popular in urban areas. However, it has also become clear that the cold chain and refrigerators in each country are not always adequate and are unequal in terms of quality, presenting a significant challenge to Japanese frozen food companies. Frozen foods have several characteristics in terms of consumption, including the high price of, and the need for refrigerators for storage. As a result, consumers of these products need to have a higher level of income and are drawn mainly from households above the middle-income level. Several past studies have shown that the demand for frozen food increased in East Asian countries in the wake of the region’s rapid economic growth since the 2000s. In this study, we examine the determinants of the location choice for Japanese frozen food industry investments in East Asia. Here, we focus on domestic market access and the penetration rate of refrigerators—the edge of the cold chain on the consumer side—in each country. We analyze the following 10 East Asian countries for the 10-year period, 2000–2009: China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, and India. We focus on the frozen food industry that manufactures “freeze,” “frozen,” and “freeze-dry” products, according to Toyo Keizai Directory of Japanese Overseas Affiliates 2011 (Kaigai Shinshutsu Kigyo Souran 2011). For example, precooked frozen food, frozen meat and vegetables, processed food with freeze-dry technology (e.g., retort food), and instant noodles are included. Processed goods include sauces and spices for firms producing goods such as oil, pork extracts, and amino acid seasoning. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 examines the demand for frozen food in Japan and East Asia. Section 3 presents a literature review. In Sect. 4, we present the baseline estimates from our trade equation, and Sect. 5 shows how to calculate market access using the penetration rate of refrigerators. In Sect. 6, we explain the location choice model using the market access calculated in Sect. 5. Section 7 concludes the paper.",6

The value of these contributions comes from three key features. First, it is often the micro-phenomena observed at specific locations that lead to an emergence of the macro-outcomes to which national policy tends to react. For example, regional economies can serve as the drivers for national economic change, as well as migration that then generate the macro-patterns associated with business cycles and broader social outcomes. Second, because investment and policy making take place at the level of individual communities or firms, for example, it is at these finer scales where the impacts of policy are most directly felt. Conversely, in times of deficient national political and economic leadership, considerable opportunities may arise for decision makers at the regional scale to counteract undesirable national developments and to put in place strategies that are fine-tuned to the region’s conditions. A corollary of this second set of values that stems from a regional perspective is that diversity in regional approaches to social and economic policy and investment create a database of natural experiments that may ultimately inform policy and investments at larger scales. The word database is used here in both a literal and figurative sense. It refers to the many observable outcomes associated with individual, independent, region-specific investments and policies. These outcomes can often be quantified, then analyzed, and generalized. It also refers to the collective experiences that are shaped by observing what works where and why. Regional science is rich in methods and approaches tailored to harness the information generated at regional scales. In recent years, it has led to considerable advances in space–time analysis, management of highly heterogeneous and big data, and visualization of both the micro- and macro-phenomena mentioned above. Being able to effectively make apparent and harness the information embedded in data requires systematic analysis guided by theory. Here, too, the field has contributed to the understanding of social and economic dynamics by seeing what happens on the ground as an articulation of the fundamental mechanisms that are at work in the background. Many of the early conceptualizations of location theory or diffusion models, for example, are relevant still today. In short, there is great power in choosing a regional perspective on social and economic processes. But with great power comes great responsibility. By its very definition, a focus on a smaller subset of a larger system is prone to relegating to the sidelines, or even disregarding, constraints imposed from the outside. Knowing what these constraints are, and how to operate at a regional scale within them, is a precondition for regions to flourish and to contribute to the sustainability of the larger systems within which they operate. Being able to retain a regional focus in the analysis, while bringing just enough external context to the endeavor, is not just a craft but also an art. The following section looks from the region beyond the boundaries to explore the role of fundamental constraints that will be binding in the long run. From that I then turn to the implications for theory, empirical application, and policy. I will then close my comments with reflections on the culture of regional science within which that art and craft are fostered.",2
61.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,29 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-018-0866-5,A prospective review on New Economic Geography,September 2018,José M. Gaspar,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the path-breaking contribution of Krugman’s monograph Geography and Trade (Krugman 1991a), “which most people consider the beginning of New Economic Geography” (Krugman 2010), together with his seminal Core-Periphery (CP) model (Krugman 1991b), many researchers have devoted their attention towards providing theoretical foundations and empirical research that add to the study of the geographical distribution of economic activities. Throughout its rather brief history, up to recent years, New Economic Geography (NEG) has remained yet an attractive and vibrant field for many economists. In spite of this, NEG has also been constantly susceptible to a wide range of criticism, both from within and from outside the field.Footnote 1 Moreover, the lack of departure from some restrictive assumptions has confined the field to a theoretical strait-jacket, thus thwarting efforts to come up with new insights (Behrens and Robert-Nicoud 2011). In this review, we summarize the contents of a number of papers in the NEG literature which we consider to be very successful in the attempt to provide an overall assessment of the discipline. What these works have in common is the fact that they are aware of the technical limitations of the frameworks generally assumed in the literature, and they seek to analyse the causes for the shortcomings in terms of new developments in the field. Some of the causes include, but are not limited to: the stringent assumption of constant elasticity of substitution models of monopolistic competition, the unrealistic assumption of iceberg transportation costs, the lack of calibration and attention devoted to the use of numerical computations, the strict homogeneity assumed across consumers and firms, the homogeneity in location space, and the overuse of migration adjustment processes where agents are assumed to be short-sighted, among other issues. Outside the NEG, the most relevant issues are raised by (would-be) closely related fields, such as those stemming from Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG) (Boschma and Frenken 2006; Frenken 2007; Boschma and Martin 2007, 2010) or from the geographers dedicated to Proper Economic Geography (PEG) (Martin 1999; Overman 2004; Scott 2004). Our paper focuses heavily on the theoretical foundations and assumptions in NEG that have been debated within the economics profession. As such, it does not attempt to cover all possible topics and issues on the broader subject of Economic Geography, which contains NEG, EEG and PEG as subsets. However, in order to provide an accurate assessment of NEG’s limitations and provide new avenues of research, some views of these (sub-)disciplines cannot be disregarded. They are naturally intertwined and cannot be dissociated from each other. This argument extends to the inter-disciplinarity between NEG and other fields within economics, where we emphasize the connection between NEG and Urban Economics. In fact, several authors have argued that the lack of cross-fertilization between these fields can only thwart further developments in Economic Geography (Combes et al. 2005; Duranton and Rodríguez-Pose 2005; Fujita and Mori 2005; Garretsen and Martin 2010; Rodríguez-Pose 2010). Therefore, we also aim to provide some prospective analysis in these directions. At a later stage, we briefly describe some notable contributions in the literature that address some of the issues raised by the recent criticism surveyed in this work. Some of the issues pertain to: the influence of firm or consumer heterogeneity in spatial agglomeration outcomes; more general models of monopolistic competition; the role of the spatial topology in a multi-regional setting; forward-looking expectations in the migration adjustment process; the role of the computer; new analytical approaches that provide valuable insights on bifurcation mechanisms in CP models, the role of self-selection and sorting of agents across regions, the rise of hierarchical urban systems and the formation of cities, as well as the treatment of geography and history in NEG (Krugman 2010). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we review the literature from the dawn of NEG up to subsequent early models that allowed NEG to span across fields such as urban economics and economic growth. In Sect. 3, we overview the main limitations that have confined the field of NEG in a theoretical strait-jacket as well as some works that have tried to counter them. In Sect. 4, we proceed to identify new possible avenues of research and describe some contributions that are guiding NEG along these paths. Section 5 is left for some concluding remarks.",18
61.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,08 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-018-0867-4,Logistics agglomeration and logistics productivity in the USA,September 2018,Bowen Sun,Haomin Li,Qiuyun Zhao,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Logistics can be broadly defined as a group of connected activities that are involved in freight transportation-, distribution-, warehousing- and other logistics-related operations. Efficient logistics system is crucial for the economy as it moves and distributes goods for production and consumption at various locations. At the same time, there is an increasing need for high-level logistics services, driven by multiple economic factors including: (1) urban and regional economic development; (2) globalization and transportation costs reduction; or (3) customer-oriented economy which requires highly customized and efficient services, etc. (Rivera et al. 2014; Mariotti 2015a, b; Holl and Mariotti 2017). As Hesse and Rodrigue (2006) argued, given pressures from the supply chain system for higher operational productivity, such as just-in-time (JIT) requirement, the logistics system should be considered as the part of the holistic value generation process rather than a mere support of transportation mobility. For the past few years, the location change in logistics activities has been documented in the literature from the perspective of logistics agglomeration (e.g., Rivera et al. 2014; van den Heuvel et al. 2014b; Heitz and Dablanc 2015). The geographical concentration of companies that engage in logistics activities can be characterized as logistics agglomeration (Sheffi 2012; Rivera et al. 2014). The scope and scale of logistics agglomeration range from a single logistics park such as the BNSF Logistics Park in Illinoi to a large logistics metropolitan such as Memphis, Tennessee (Rivera et al. 2014). Logistics agglomeration has advantages in providing the system with more efficiency. For example, convenient access to intermodal transportation facilities and regional markets from logistics agglomeration reduces operational and transportation costs. Close proximity also facilitates collaboration among firms serving different industries by sharing resources (Rivera et al. 2016). In addition, the policy tax abatement or free trade zone within logistics clusters can further drive companies to operate closely. As in the case of Alliance logistics hub in Texas, companies within the cluster immediately benefit from Triple Freeport tax exemption, direct access to transportation facility assets and universities and research centers. Benefits of logistics agglomeration are being widely recognized by researchers and practitioners in many cities worldwide, including major cities in North America, Europe as well as Asia (Dablanc and Ross 2012; Rivera et al. 2014, 2016; Heitz and Dablanc 2015). The literature also suggests that development of logistics agglomeration could have positive impacts on regional economic development (Hesse 2008; Jing and Cai 2010; Rivera et al. 2016). However, at the same time, increased freight demand from urban growth in many cities, as McKinnon (2009) suggests, generates large demand for logistics floor space which consumes large amounts of land and potentially contributes to urban sprawl. Some researchers raised concerns of the spatial mismatch between logistics and other types of land use. They suggest that negative externalities including pollution, congestion and noise associated with logistics activities could potentially diminish the benefits of logistics agglomeration (Sakai et al. 2015; Holl and Mariotti 2017). With increasing resources devoted to logistics agglomeration in many cities, there are clear interests from policy makers in leveraging logistics agglomeration. Therefore, an understanding of benefits associated with logistics agglomeration could make significant contribution in terms of resources investment and industrial policy making. However, research is still inadequate on discussion of the economic benefits associated with logistics agglomeration, especially in terms of the application of quantitative methods to examine the trend (Rivera et al. 2016). This paper builds upon current efforts to continue exploring the benefits from logistics agglomeration with a focus on quantifying its economic benefits—logistics industry productivity gains. Agglomeration economies theory holds that concentration of industry activity enables optimization of costs, and therefore facilitates higher productivity for companies (Marshall 1895; Ciccone and Hall 1996; Graham et al. 2010). Yet evidence also suggests industry agglomeration might bring negative externalities including congestion or unbalanced competition and not all industries can benefit from it (Combes 2000; Feitelson and Salomon 2000; Brülhart and Mathys 2008; Gambardella and Giarratana 2010). Additionally, while most empirical evidence of agglomeration economies comes from manufacturing or services sectors, it is not clear whether productivity gains could be captured from logistics agglomeration. The paper adds to the literature by examining whether productivity gains from logistics agglomeration can be achieved in areas where logistics activities are concentrated, and more specifically, to what extent the logistics sectors enjoy the benefits. This is done by applying recently developed panel unit root tests and panel cointegration techniques with data obtained from County Business Pattern (CBP) for US counties between 2007 and 2014. In this study, logistics sectors are defined as the following sectors that perform logistics activities including: freight transportation, distribution, warehousing, cargo handling and other transportation support activities sectors. The following paper is structured as follows. The literature review examines topics of logistics agglomeration and industry agglomeration. We then present the analysis whether logistics agglomeration can drive up logistics productivity by using panel cointegration estimation. The conclusion and discussion summarize results and provide some policy suggestions.",12

Multicollinearity greatly reduces the reliability of estimated coefficients, and consequently, hinders an appropriate understanding of the role of independent variables. The variables often evaluate the distance from urban facilities, which are called landmarks in this paper. Since distance variables are measured on the same two-dimensional space, they are inevitably correlated at least to some extent with each other. Hedonic housing price models consider the distance from housing units to CBD, schools, urban parks, and hazardous waste sites to evaluate the spatial environment around each house (Berry 1976; Li and Brown 1980; Bender and Hwang 1985; Harrison Jr and Rubinfeld 1978; Ihlanfeldt and Taylor 2004; Noonan et al. 2007). A close relationship between obesity and neighborhood shopping environment is represented as a regression model that utilizes the accessibility to supermarkets, farmers’ markets and local food stores as independent variables (Morland et al. 2006; Rundle et al. 2009; Jilcott Pitts et al. 2013). Spatial distribution of air quality is often represented as a regression model that includes the distance from chemical plants, power plants, smelters, and airports (Gordon and Gorham 1963; Riga-Karandinos and Karandinos 1998; Yu et al. 2004). A wide variety of methods have been developed to handle with multicollinearity in regression analysis (Farrar and Glauber 1967; Asteriou and Hall 2007; Chatterjee and Hadi 2013). A simple method is to remove independent variables that are highly correlated with others. Numerical measures are available for this purpose including correlation coefficient, determinant of correlation matrix, VIF, and more sophisticated indices (Weissfeld and Sereika 1991; Kovàcs et al. 2005; Curto and Pinto 2007; Dormann et al. 2013). Ridge regression, principal component regression, and their extensions are also useful for mitigate the multicollinearity among distance variables (Mansfield et al. 1977; Vigneau et al. 1997; Kashid and Kulkarni 2002; Ni 2011; Chen 2012; Miller 2012). The above methods implicitly assume that the observation data used in regression models have already been prepared. On the other hand, if data are not yet collected, we can reduce the multicollinearity by carefully controlling independent variables. Experimental, agricultural and behavioral economists, for instance, evaluate the effect of independent factors by changing the variables in such a way that they are completely independent or minimally correlated (Heady et al. 1955; Heady and Yeh 1959; Davis and Holt 1993; Kagel et al. 1995; Camerer et al. 2011; Wilkinson and Klaes 2012). This approach is effective if we can easily control independent variables. In regional science, however, the nature of two-dimensional space prohibits such experiments. If we move an observation point, the distance from landmarks changes simultaneously, and thus the distance variables are inevitably and highly correlated. To tackle this problem, Heikkila (1988) evaluates the multicollinearity among distance variables using numerical experiments under hypothetical circumstances. The paper assumes a unit interval and a unit square on which either two or three landmarks are located. Given a population distribution from which sample data are drawn, the paper evaluates the location of landmarks in terms of the correlation between distance variables. The results provide useful implications for a desirable location of sample domain in relation to the location of landmarks. Focusing on the case of two landmarks on a one-dimensional unit interval, Dewhurst (1993) also discusses the choice of sample domain. Instead of distance correlation, the paper utilizes the variances of estimated parameters to evaluate the degree of multicollinearity. Numerical simulations yield the location of sample domain that minimizes the variances and hence maximizes the stability of model estimation. Following the line of Heikkila (1988) and Dewhurst (1993), this paper discusses more extensively the configuration of sample points that reduces the multicollinearity among distance variables. Our focus is on the case of two-dimensional space where two or more landmarks are located. We propose a mathematical method for deriving the optimal location of sample points that minimizes the correlation between distance variables. The method is effective either when observation data are not yet collected or already prepared. In the latter case we can extract a subset of sample points from the original data to reduce the multicollinearity. The method also helps us to derive the maximum number of landmarks that does not cause a serious correlation between distance variables in a systematic way. Section 2 proposes a method for locating sample points that reduces the multicollinearity among distance variables as small as possible. Description of the method is accompanied with numerical experiments and empirical applications that test the validity of the method and provide findings useful for the design of sample location. Section 3 summarizes the conclusions with discussion.",1

Early interest in the effect of telecommuting on commuting distance and household travel was mainly aimed at establishing whether telecommuting could be an effective policy instrument to alleviate congestion and emissions associated with car use (Salomon 1985; Nilles 1991; Lund and Mokhtarian 1994). Increasingly, attention is being given to the notion that telecommuting also affects the geography of labour markets, for example, by having a positive effect on job accessibility (Muhammad et al. 2008; Van Wee et al. 2013). Understanding the relationship between telecommuting and the length of the commute may thus both inform policies aimed at alleviating congestion and transport-related emissions, and policies that aim to improve the economic performance of cities and regions. Most empirical work on the effects of working from home on commuting tends to corroborate the intuitive notion that being able to avoid the commute one day in the week makes workers more willing to accept a longer commute on the other days of the week (Jiang 2008; Zhu 2012; Kim et al. 2015). However, estimates for the size of this effect vary across the literature, the set of control variables included differs between studies, and there is little attention for the intensity of telecommuting (the number of days per week/month). Moreover, there is no consensus on a strategy to deal with sources of bias stemming from the fact that commute length and telecommuting are often decided upon simultaneously. While some studies aim to eliminate the positive bias that arises if long commutes influence the decision to telecommute (Jiang 2008; Zhu 2012), there is a lack of attention for preference-based sorting. OLS estimates will be biased downward if workers who dislike commuting, and hence have shorter commutes, might also be more likely to work from home. On the other hand, those who have long commutes may be the ones that value residing in more rural areas, where housing quality is cheaper, and working from home may also be more attractive. The latter type of sorting would bias OLS estimates upward. The objective of this study is to find out to what extent controlling for preference-based sorting affects the relationship between telecommuting and the length of the commute. Where earlier research on this subject is largely based on either panel data from specific experiments, or cross-sectional data from large-scale surveys, we use Dutch data from a panel survey, representative of the Dutch working age population, spanning 12 years. In the first part of our analysis we provide evidence that preferences for commuting differ between telecommuters and non-telecommuters by comparing the marginal costs of one-way commuting time (MCC) of both groups. To estimate the MCC we use job search and job mobility models, following the approach of Van Ommeren and Fosgerau (2009). The panel structure of the data then allows us to model commuting time and examine to what extent such individual preferences bias cross-sectional results, through preference-based sorting. We do this by comparing OLS estimates of commuting time to the results of a fixed effects model that controls for unobservable time-invariant characteristics of respondents. Finally in the sensitivity analysis we apply an even stricter identification method based on the timing and intensity of telecommuting, we employ two alternative identification methods, and we allow for a nonlinear effect of weekly hours spent working from home.",41

As innovation is an outcome of a complex process, the locus of innovation is not usually the individual inventor or the firm, but is often the integration of internal capabilities with the network in which the individual or the firm is embedded (Tödtling et al. 2009). Particularly in knowledge-intensive industries, firms increasingly view collaborations strategically as an important way for improving their competencies and gaining new capabilities in order to be innovative (Doloreux et al. 2015). In parallel to this renewed understanding, there has been a shift in the research agenda of regional scientists. Highlighting the role of geography in collective knowledge production, sharing and innovation, over the years the economic geography literature has broadened its emphasis in cluster research from an analysis of forces of agglomeration to forms and contents of organizational learning and knowledge exchange. Specifically, the original scholarly interest in industrial clusters as mere geographic concentrations of sectors and firms has been converted to a search for institutions for knowledge management and organizational learning (Steiner and Ploder 2008). Within this stream of research, the spatial dimension of knowledge-based relationships has been at the heart of theoretical debates on innovation and central to geographic analyses of inventive activity for almost a decade now (Autant-Bernard et al. 2014). The purpose of this study is to contribute to this stream of research by ascertaining the relative importance of local and non-local linkages in the innovation process using the US biotechnology industry as a case study. We are specifically testing to see if inventor collaborations built at different geographic scales result in qualitatively different inventions. The analytical approach taken in this study differs from that of previous studies. While previous research almost exclusively focused on firms or regions as the main unit of analysis, the present study focuses on inventions (approximated by patents) as the main unit of analysis. Although for policy purposes adopting an explicit spatial perspective and focusing on regional scale is understandable, we argue that this restricts analysis to aggregate statistics which may result in concealing important details in observations (i.e., technological and commercial value of inventions). In most empirical models developed for the regional scale, innovative performance is operationalized through the number of patents produced by firms located in the region. Such an approach requires a rather strong assumption that patents developed in different places (states or provinces) are equally commercially exploitable. As noted by Balland and Rigby, “Although earlier research has explored the geography of patenting, this work largely treats individual patents as homogeneous, assuming that each patent adds only as much technological potential to a region’s economy as the next. However, not all patents hold the same value” (2017: 18). To our knowledge, outside the management literature, very little research on innovative performance takes both the spatiality of collaborative research relationships and the quality of the output of these relationships into account. Some notable exceptions include the following: Singh (2008), who examines the role of cross-regional knowledge integration on innovation; Ejermo (2009), who distinguishes innovations from patent grants and shows that the former is more geographically concentrated than the latter; Briggs and Wade (2014), who investigate the relationship between joint patent ownership and the quality of an innovation; and Balland and Rigby (2017), who explore the linkage between the quality of patents and the geographic patterns of their production. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section briefly reviews the theoretical literature on knowledge sharing and collaboration in the innovation process and presents competing propositions as to the importance of local versus interregional collaborations for innovation. Section 3 discusses empirical findings from recent studies. Section 4 reviews conceptual and analytical issues surrounding the use of patent renewal data as a measure of innovation value. Section 5 explains the reasons for focusing on the biotechnology industry as a case study and discusses sample construction using patent data. Section 6 presents hypotheses and results. The final section concludes with the study’s contribution, its limitations and suggestions for future research.",4

But the term “entrepreneurship” can mean different things, especially in empirical studies of entrepreneurial phenomena. Among theories attempting to treat the topic with more theoretical rigour, there are three classic treatises that have stood the test of time. Joseph Schumpeter’s innovation-driven theory of economic development (Schumpeter 1934), which first appeared in German in 1912 (Schumpeter 2006), focuses on disruptive innovations that cause disequilibrating shocks to the economic system as the cause of economic development and as symptomatic of dynamic capitalism. In Schumpeter’s narrative, the entrepreneur is a heroic figure who singlehandedly brings about change through the introduction of new combinations of land and labour (with capital treated as a mixture of land and labour). Steve Jobs’ innovation of the MacIntosh personal computer and, later, iPhone and Mark Zuckerberg’s innovation of Facebook are examples that can illustrate the Schumpeterian theory, but it would be misleading to apply it to the more mundane and quantitatively numerous business start-ups and incremental innovations that are the mainstay of empirical entrepreneurship studies.
 Frank Knight (1921) offered the next major work of entrepreneurial theory, where he describes the entrepreneur as anyone who exercises judgment and shoulders non-probabilistic uncertainty (i.e. “Knightian uncertainty”) when making future-directed decisions. The key distinction is between the maximizing approach typical of much formal economic theorizing and decision-making that cannot be optimized because the future states of the world cannot be known—not even the number of possible future states can be known. Thus, the entrepreneurs must exercise a non-quantifiable type of decision-making for which the most appropriate term is “judgment”. Unlike Schumpeter, Knight does not distinguish between entrepreneurial and capitalist functions. The founder of a firm who judges that she can revolutionize the world with the help of a new pathbreaking technology and the venture capitalist who judges that the innovation is a good bet are both entrepreneurs in the Knightian sense—both exercise judgment in the face of Knightian uncertainty. The final classic treatment is associated with Israel Kirzner (1973) and uses an approach that is more congenial to economists accustomed to general equilibrium theory. In fact, we can think of Kirznerian entrepreneurship as a complement to the maximizing framework of neoclassical economics. Entrepreneurship arises because of economic agents’ imperfect information of interlocal and intertemporal price differences. Only entrepreneurs who are alert to such differences reap entrepreneurial profits. These profits are costless at the point of entrepreneurial discovery, and yet at the same time those entrepreneurs with location-specific or industry-specific knowledge are more likely to activate their alertness and thus take advantage of profitable opportunities to sell outputs at a higher price than the input costs (Andersson 2005). Like Schumpeter before him, Kirzner (ibid.) makes a strict separation between the entrepreneurial and capitalist functions. Individuals only earn profits in their role as “pure entrepreneurs”. While all three classic theories are pathbreaking theoretical achievements, they are not all equally serviceable as the theoretical basis for empirical studies. Schumpeter’s theory confines itself to innovations that revolutionize a key industry such as the automobile or assembly-line production, while Kirzner’s assumes exogenously given consumer preferences, technology, resource availability, and property rights. Andersson (2017) argues that only Knightian entrepreneurship theory provides a useful theoretical foundation of the subject matter of most empirical entrepreneurship research. The actions of disruptive and incremental innovators, new business start-ups, venture capitalists, and business angels all conform to the notion that the entrepreneur is a profit-seeking agent who exercises non-maximizing judgment under conditions of Knightian uncertainty. The main weakness of the Knightian approach is its silence on the systemic features associated with either equilibration—as in Kirzner—or disequilibration—as in Schumpeter. Andersson (ibid.) therefore complements Knightian theory with Roger Koppl’s notion of system constraints (Koppl 2002; Koppl and Whitman 2004). Economic action will be equilibrating along the lines of Kirznerian theory if competition is atomistic and market institutions are stable. If we are dealing with a monopoly, as is the case with non-incremental innovations, or if Big Players have the power to engage in discretionary institutional disruptions, systemic effects become uncertain, and Schumpeterian disequilibration becomes the most likely outcome. The empirical articles in this special issue are all examples of analyses of processes that illustrate the spatial and temporal effects of numerous uncertainty-bearing judgments of individual entrepreneurs. The explicit theoretical frameworks are different, but there is an underlying unity in the sense that what the authors observe are different from the profit-maximizing or utility-maximizing behaviours that are the mainstay of analyses that make use of comparative statics. While all contributors take a spatial perspective, they make use of several different research programmes in economics. Banczyk and co-authors adopt the psychological assumptions of behavioural economics, while Hårsman et al. adopt a more mainstream approach. Andersson and Johansson, meanwhile, extend the conventional production function approach by introducing spatial factors and intra-firm interactivity. Gordon and Cho’s treatment of supply chains of ideas and products in space makes use of a Hayekian spontaneous-order understanding of the economy. Desmarchelier and Zhang use an explicitly evolutionary treatment of the economy, while the final paper by Lai and co-authors applies Coasean and other new institutional theories to illuminate spatially situated entrepreneurial processes.",2

He assumes that each individual has two separate skills and will choose to become an entrepreneur whenever the income from that choice exceeds the income from choosing to be wage employed. The income as an entrepreneur will equal the strength of the weakest skill times a parameter reflecting the market value of entrepreneurial talent, and the income as employed will correspond to the strength of the strongest skill. It follows that the incomes of entrepreneurs and wage employed will reflect the distribution of skill profiles in the population and the market value of entrepreneurial talent. The market value is determined by the supply and demand of entrepreneurs and is therefore likely to vary across local labor markets. The paper has two major aims. The first is to develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the income return to entrepreneurship by combining the Lazear model with the assumption that the skill profiles in a population are Fréchet-distributed. The second is to demonstrate that the resulting theoretical derivations can be used for a new type of regional analysis of the income return to entrepreneurship and wage employment. The empirical analysis is based on data from the Swedish employment register. Entrepreneurs are defined as those registered as self-employed, and a distinction is made between all self-employed and the self-employed hiring at least one person. Since most countries exhibit pronounced regional differences in self-employment rates, as reported by Parker (2009), for instance, we compute the return to self-employment and wage employment in three parts of Sweden: the Stockholm region, the combined Gothenburg and Malmö region, and the Rest of Sweden. The calculations are made for all individuals that have a Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and were self-employed or wage employed in 2008. In order to obtain some indirect information about the appropriateness of assuming that skill profiles are Fréchet-distributed, we will compare average incomes between self-employed and wage employed as well as the corresponding observed and theoretically derived income distributions. A central issue in studies of the income return revolves around the “what-if question” about how much entrepreneurs would have earned if they instead had chosen to become wage employed. This is the case whether non-pecuniary benefits are included or not (see Åstebro and Thompson 2011, Hamilton 2000, respectively). Disregarding non-material benefits, the common approach is to compare the income of entrepreneurs and wage employed, and apply different techniques to separate out the influence of other factors likely to affect the income. Åstebro et al. (2013), for example, compare the current and previous incomes among Swedish academics that have recently started new businesses making adjustment for income growth over time, whereas Hyytinen et al. (2013) estimate the income differences between identical twins that have made different occupational choices. Even if the compared categories are similar in virtually all observable respects but the occupational choice, one problem remains. According to Lazear’s model, the income is determined by the weakest skill for an entrepreneur but by the strongest skill for a wage employed. Therefore, we argue, a more appropriate way of estimating the income return for entrepreneurs is to compare their incomes as entrepreneurs with the hypothetical incomes they would have received if, for some reason, they had instead become wage employed, and thus had had incomes related to their strongest skills. Though the analytical expressions we derive for the expected income returns to entrepreneurs and wage employed are crucial for their occupational choices, to the best of our knowledge, no one has derived them earlier. Assuming, as we do, that the skill profiles in a population are Fréchet-distributed and applying Lazear’s model, Hårsman and Mattsson (2017) show that a lower expected income for entrepreneurs than for wage employed is fully compatible with Lazear´s model. However, a comparison of the expected income for entrepreneurs and wage employed differs fundamentally from our concept of expected income returns. The income for an individual entrepreneur will by definition be higher than it would have been if he or she had made the opposite occupational choice, but the expected income for the population of entrepreneurs might still be lower than that for the population of wage employed. Expressed in another way, the applied concept of income return provides the conditions that govern the occupational choices, while the expected income for a population represents the outcome of the choices. Our empirical analysis differs from approaches based upon comparisons of the income of entrepreneurs and wage employed. We calculate the income return to entrepreneurs by comparing their incomes with the hypothetical incomes they would have received if they instead had chosen to be wage employed. Additionally, we will calculate the corresponding income return to wage employed. It is impossible to do this for individual actors, but the assumption that the skill profiles in a population are Fréchet-distributed allows us to calculate the expected actual and hypothetical income and the corresponding income returns for the populations of entrepreneurs and wage employed. The computations are made for different parts of Sweden and for several subgroups of these populations. Each such calculation rests on only three observed quantities: the relative frequency of self-employment and the average income for self-employed and wage employed, respectively. The empirical computations show that the income return to self-employed that hire at least one person is highest in the Stockholm region and lowest in the Rest of Sweden—presumably reflecting various agglomeration benefits. The regional differences change when including the self-employed who do not hire anyone. In this case, the average income return is the same in the Stockholm region and the Rest of Sweden and lowest in the Gothenburg and Malmö region. With few exceptions, the average income is lower for self-employed than for wage employed in all regions. Additional support for the assumption of Fréchet-distributed skill profiles is provided by the similarity between the theoretically derived income distribution and the empirically observed income distribution for self-employed as well as for wage employed. The paper is structured as follows: The next section describes the Lazear model and the income resulting from preferred vis-à-vis opposite occupational choices. Section 3 introduces the Fréchet distribution and provides analytical expressions for the expected income returns. Section 4 presents the data and Sect. 5 the computed regional income returns to entrepreneurship and wage employment. A summary and some conclusions follow in Sect. 6. Mathematical derivations are collected in “Appendix A” and some data characterizing our population in “Appendix B.”",3

Andersson,Börje Johansson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In science, economics, and engineering, a black box is a system which can be viewed in terms of its input and output (vectors), without any knowledge of its internal workings or the possible interactions with the environment. Its implementation is “opaque” or black. Observing and guiding the firm would then consist in manipulating the inputs so-as-to achieve the aspired output(s) (Fig. 1). Co-variation of input and output flows In most of the microeconomic theory, the firm is depicted as a “black box” consisting of a set of production activities or even a presumed production function with a finite set of inputs to be adjusted so-as-to generate a set of outputs corresponding to a maximal level of profits or some other measure of owner utility. The inputs controlled by the firm are then assumed to be put to their most efficient use without having a look “inside” the firm or “outside” in the relations with other economic agents, excepting for competition with other firms. In Fig. 2, the output is affected by external factors, represented by Z. Solow (1957) made A(Z) a function of the level of technology as reflected in the productivity trend as measured by a time series regression estimate. Later, this approach was complemented by estimates of the impact of the size of the region or the accessibility of the economy as reflections of conditions external to the firm or the local production system. It is now common to econometrically relate the total factor productivity (TFP) and its growth to some function of Z (Cardarelli and Lusinyan 2015), i.e., to “explain” productivity by factors outside of firm owner’s control (Lööf and Johansson 2014). Cobb–Douglas production function Coase (1937) was the first economist pointing out that in addition to production costs of the usual sort, one must also consider transaction costs inside and outside of the firm in explaining institutions such as a firm. He focused on the comparative transaction costs of alternative organizational structures, such as firms and markets. This theory was later extended by Oliver Williamson and became widely known as transaction-cost economics (Williamson 1989) or more broadly the economics of organization. Coase (op.cit.) and later Demsetz (1968), Williamson (op.cit) and Beckmann (1977) opened the black box representation of the firm, claiming that an understanding of the evolution of firms requires an analysis of transaction costs and benefits inside and outside the firm. Chenery (1949) and Smith (1959, 1961) extended the analysis beyond the black box by proposing a model of the firm based on engineering data, but this approach was not followed by him to any substantial extent. This approach was later adopted in several studies by Scandinavian economists (Forsund and Jansen 1983; Wibe 1977). While the black box approach might be reasonable in the case of a single site firm, it becomes inadequate when analyzing modern multilocation network firms with production units located in hundreds or even thousands of globally distributed nodes. The black box approach is not easily adaptable to the analysis of network firms. If a firm is producing a homogenous output, there could be good reasons to allocate production between several identical plants operating on their own in regions, differing in cost of inputs. In this case, the decision rule is to allocate production so that the marginal cost of each plant equals marginal revenue of total output. In a multilocation network firm producing heterogenous output, different spatially separated units have economic reasons to interact with each other with positive and negative consequences for the returns of the network firm, seen as a whole. The interactions will have an impact on productivity as well as the quality and pricing of the outputs as demonstrated below. The C-society is “post-industrial” by its orientation toward creativity, communication, knowledge, etc. It is now slowly establishing itself in some of the world’s regions. Industrialism is being abandoned in those regions to allow knowledge, creativity, and innovations to take the center stage in economic life. The regions that are currently being integrated in the emerging global knowledge networking economy are all relatively well positioned in the air transportation, communication, and road networks. They are therefore well endowed with interaction capabilities. Compared with the rest of the world, these creative regions also have superior access to public scientific and private R&D knowledge. Frequently, they contain a collection of diverse creative environments in universities, high-technology firms, and different cultural entities. Firms that rely on exploiting natural resources and the manual employments are being phased out in these regions, while new firms that rely on knowledge, networks and globally important institutions are creating a new economic structure. This transformation is creating substantial social and political tensions between regions, generations and occupational groups. Post-industrial firms exploit communication and transportation infrastructure, since it is an accessible, highly productive and profitable production factor. But, a successful use of new infrastructure requires of firms that they adapt organizationally as well as in their pattern of locations. The networks are now much denser than in the early industrial era. Together, the various networks also amount to a multi-layered, mutually reinforcing system. In the best case, a firm in a specific location can simultaneously take advantage of international and domestic flight connections, freeways and other roads, railways, sea transportation, and digital communication. Firms with great contact and transportation needs can achieve dynamic comparative advantages by locating in regions that have developed into central nodes in the new multi-layered networks. But, firms can also strengthen their comparative advantages even more by creating a new and more externally and internally interdependent network organization of their production and distribution system. Corporations producing and distributing material goods such as Walmart, Amazon, IKEA and the major ICT, pharmaceutical and auto manufacturers were among the first firms to discover the profit potential in using and adapting their organization to the new network potentials for more efficient product development, marketing, logistics and production. Network firms solely producing and distributing information—e.g., Google or Netflix—are subject to different network constraints and opportunities. Manufacturing firms such as producers of pharmaceuticals, cars, and computers buy a wide variety of patented knowledge and knowledge-based components from subcontractors, which are used as inputs in the production of the final product. They are inherently networking firms that are heavily dependent on powerful transport and communication networks. These firms have also restructured the most to exploit the opportunities presented by the new arena. Amazon, Walmart, and IKEA are textbook examples of how the new networks have created economies of scope and scale. Large-scale communication systems and transportation terminals are also afflicted with capacity utilization problems. Large airport terminals, for instance, are necessary to cope with temporarily large loads of passengers and cargos. At other times, the terminals seem desolate and incur high average and low marginal costs. Terminals are therefore also increasingly designed to achieve economies of scope. A precondition for exploiting diversity is that it is possible to attract customers from a variety of localities. Economies of scope in production go hand in hand with economies of scope in the networks. When a corporation decides to take advantage of the capacity of the networks, it will systematically harness the resource of diversity. IKEA offers a great variety of furnishings that attracts a wide cross section of society to visit its stores in a wide cross section of societies including Europe, America, Australia, China, Singapore, Korea, and Taiwan. But, the new diversity is not confined to the range of products or the variability in the customers’ appearance, age, or income. Behind the diversity that is visible to customers, there is an even greater diversity in the production and logistical structures that characterize the new corporate networks. The economics of diversity makes it possible to meet the pent-up demand of very small groups and to make use of highly specialized, but unusual skills. Networking firms thereby equalize the employment and consumption conditions of different regions. These firms invariably operate under conditions of monopolistic competition. To illuminate the management issues introduced in Sect. 1, the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 investigates productive advantages of collaboration inside the firm, describes its interactivity with the firm environment in product development, and identifies a basic interplay between knowledge creation and economies of scale. Section 3 focuses on management of multilocation firms and characterizes collaboration between units of a network firm and makes precise the role of large scale in production and distribution. In addition, the section suggests that that management employs a “split-vision approach” when making the transmission from hierarchy to self-organization principles. Section 4 presents concluding reflections.",5

Cities are called “engines of growth.” But entrepreneurs are also seen as engines of growth. It follows that we investigate what entrepreneurs in cities do.
 It is well known that urban agglomeration economies are a source of increasing returns because they facilitate interacting and the formation of new ideas—which is often a step away from a productivity-enhancing innovation. Modern levels of production and consumption would be inconceivable without the economies provided by urbanization. But it is not the binary choice, “urban or not.” Agglomerations of many sizes and shapes, as well as many types of networks, are prominent in the modern economy. Each facilitates the formation and maintenance of supply chains.Footnote 2 Fly low enough over any large city to see features on the ground and what do you see? An urban economist might say that you see the spatial realization of a very large number of overlapping supply chains. Opportunities available in large cities support supply chain flexibility as needed. Every act of consumption or production is a link in a very long (often international) and complex supply chain. The well-known essay, I, Pencil makes the point beautifully.Footnote 3 It is unfortunate that most introductory courses in economics introduce gains from trade (nonzero-sumness) via a simple two-person, two-goods example.Footnote 4 Better to grasp the lesson of pencil and see that each of us is involved in a very large number of complex supply chains that we do not (cannot) fully understand but from which we clearly benefit. All these chains are formed (emerge) in markets via individuals’ seeking profit, e.g., making continuous (usually small) adjustments at many margins. The many choices of the participants are guided by market prices. Price signals help us economize on information gathering costs (Hayek 1945). But market participants are also keen to evaluate the reputations of anyone they deal with. Supply chains can include hundreds or thousands of participants. We do not seek relationships with all of them, but we do care to get to know and collaborate with some of them. The story involves everything that we consume or produce. All the labor we sell, for example, is in at least one supply chain. But households supplying labor is all that is included in the simplest urban models. We prefer to think of many supply chains—for ideas and for goods—in place of the more general term agglomeration. Likewise, “networking” is a widely used concept. But what is it about? People are keen to find ideas and also establish trust. Supply chains for information, notably for ideas, are a clearer notion than simply networking. We test whether production relations (supply chains for goods) explain significant amounts of observed co-location in the Southern California metropolitan region. We find that they only explain a small amount. We then examine observed co-location among firms in various manufacturing and information sectors. Just as advances in transportation and communications have caused cities to expand outward, we find that agglomeration occurs over various distances. There is agglomeration near as well as far. Far-flung agglomeration is not an oxymoron. Cheaper communications have for years strengthened the reach of comparative advantage, including the reach of innovative managers and firms.",1

Within clusters, geographical proximity and repeated interactions among a variety of actors (firms, universities, venture capital, R&D, training centers, etc.) generate positive externalities, such as the appearance of a pool of qualified workers or the emergence of knowledge spillovers (Audretsch and Feldman 2004; Scott 2006; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). These virtuous phenomena are, however, limited in time, since clusters and regions can enter phases or durable stasis or decline (Cooke 2001; Menzel 2015). Such observations have led to conceptualizations of the dynamics of industrial clusters in the form of a life cycle narrative in successive phases: birth, growth, and maturity—with the possibility of a rebirth (Bergman 2008). The birth of an industrial cluster is often attributable to historical events, some isolated initiative or even luck. For instance, Scott (1991) traces the origin of the aerospace cluster of Southern California to “a series of purely fortuitous circumstances in which several pioneers of the aircraft industry came to be associated with the region” in the 1920s and 1930s (p. 440). Similarly, Feldman (2003) evokes patent applications by two professors from Stanford University and the University of California at San Francisco in 1973 as the starting point of the biotechnology industry (pp. 312–313). In 2001, \( 24.3\% \) of the biotech firms in the USA were still located in California Feldman (2003). The growth phase is triggered when the cluster concentrates a critical mass of heterogeneous actors. This critical mass generates several positive externalities, which attract newcomers and foster the creation of spin-offs. These spin-offs can even be a major driver of the geographical clustering of companies. For instance, Klepper (2010) shows that much of the entrants in the Detroit automobile industry from 1900 to 1925 were spin-offs from incumbent firms. Similarly, he shows that most successful companies operating in the Silicon Valley in 1970s were spin-offs from Fairchild Semiconductor. Decline appears when agents become too homogeneous (Menzel and Fornahl 2009; Bergman 2008), or when the knowledge base of the sector becomes codified, thus easily transferable (Audretsch and Feldman 1996). This later remark shows that—in some cases—clusters’ dynamics can be determined by the life cycle of the sector. For instance, the clustering of biotech firms around universities and “star scientists” may be the result of a relatively young industry whose knowledge base is still mainly tacit (Feldman 2003). All these contributions show that one should not rely too much on geographical proximity as the main driver of clusters’ evolution. Without denying all explanatory power to geography in clusters’ life cycles, this paper’s objective is to shed light on how network analysis could help to explain clusters’ success (or failure) as well as their transition from one phase of the life cycle to another. As an illustration, Saxenian (1994) finds that proximity did not ensure the emergence of a self-sustained growth trajectory in Route 128, while a dense network of interactions among actors has fueled Silicon Valley’s success. On a similar note, Boschma (2005) proposes to complement geography with four other dimensions of proximity: cognitive, organizational, institutional, and social. Under this framework, firms that are too similar—or alternatively too different—in terms of knowledge, routines, coordination abilities, and values will have a low probability of interaction and co-innovation. Giuliani (2013) studies the evolution of the Chilean wine cluster under the lens of the network of relations among actors. The networks are constructed through face-to-face interviews conducted in 2002 and 2006. The author finds an increase in agents’ connectivity, as well as evidences supporting the idea that reciprocity and the quality of agents’ knowledge base are important for the cluster’s development. Giuliani’s work (2013) moves away from geography as the main explanatory factor of clusters dynamics and allows to visualize and quantify knowledge spillovers. However, the face-to-face interviews employed for building the interaction networks make the extension of the analysis to other clusters difficult, as the data collection requires a deep knowledge of the local environment—especially for identifying the relevant actors and keeping track of the newcomers and of those leaving the cluster. Another limitation is that the two observed years may be not representative of agents’ connectivity in the cluster, and we do not know how the connectivity evolved during the years between 2002 and 2006. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to build clusters’ innovation networks based on publicly available information. Industrial clusters are often organized in formal associations which provide exhaustive information about past cooperative projects carried on by one or several member organizations. In this paper, we build temporal innovation networks for three clusters from different countries and industries: Lyon Biopole—biotechnologies, located in the Auvergne-Rône-Alpes region (France); Céréales Vallée—food industry, also in Auvergne-Rône-Alpes; and Skywin—aerospace, in Wallonie region (Belgium).Footnote 1 In particular, our analysis shows that clusters’ growth is all but smooth and that low assortativity (Hamill and Gilbert 2009) and preferential attachment (Barabási and Albert 1999) among agents can constitute safeguards against clusters decline.Footnote 2 Finally, we find that clusters’ innovation networks are resilient to decline. This later observation supports contributions advocating for non-deterministic life cycles in which clusters can still grow, even after a period of pronounced decline (Menzel and Fornahl 2009; Martin and Sunley 2011). The remainder of the paper is organized in two sections: Firstly, the literature on networks dynamics is reviewed and is linked to clusters’ evolution through a series of hypotheses. Then, these hypotheses are empirically tested in the three chosen clusters.",6

C. Lai,Stephen N. G. Davies,Frank T. Lorne,Male,Male,Male,Male,"From the economics point of view, the importance of the property boundaries of land is much neglected. This neglect generally happens when cross-boundary issues like trespassing or nuisance are considered. Resolution of these by contract or private norms has been proposed as alternatives to government directions, assuming that either the boundaries in question is ex ante well defined in the case of a “Coasian bargain”, or irrelevant in the case of some privately agreed norms in dealing with harms done to chattels on land but not to the land per se. That is fine in so far as no boundary alignment is contested in relation to the subject of the bargain (loss of cattle) or the locational idiosyncrasies of the land properties other than size or output. However, when the shape of land is called into dispute, land boundaries disputes cannot be ignored and this paper addresses why such disputes in an urban context are more likely than not settled by litigation. The next section will paint a picture of the terms of art of land boundary disputes in land use research. This will be followed by an account of the reasons why the visible hands of the state and the law are often called into settle land boundary disputes in lieu of private settlement. Surveying and economic reasons are then offered to support this general view. There is no claim, however, that the courts are always the best or correct solution in specific cases. However, that the courts are found to be so “popular” must be due to the fact that they adopt long-run efficient rules (Priest 1977) as well as that they are “self-correcting”.Footnote 1

This is the so-called adverse possession. The first risk increases with the length of statute of limitations, while the second risk decreases with the statutorily length because the current landowner can mitigate such a risk by monitoring his or her property periodically. A longer statute of limitations could reduce the monitoring cost because the landowner can inspect his or her land less frequently. Therefore, the regulator can choose an optimal level of statute duration to balance these two risks.Footnote 2 To examine the design of an optimal statute of limitations policy, we assume that in a monocentric open city a landowner and regulator compete in a dynamic Stackelberg game (Jou 2004, 2012, 2014; Krawczyk and Zaccour 1999).Footnote 3 The landowner has some leeway in choosing the date of development, but he or she can possibly lose the ownership of land because the title system is recorded as in the USA. As the follower, the landowner decides the date on which to develop his or her vacant land, given that he or she receives rents after development, and the regulator has already set the statute of limitations. As the leader, the regulator anticipates the timing for development chosen by the landowner in a location and sets a period of statute of limitations so as to maximize the joint welfare of the landowner and the resident in that location.Footnote 4 We do not consider a uniform policy of statute of limitations that maximizes the joint value of aggregate landowners and residents because such a policy will then depend on the factor that affects stochastic demand for urban land. We first assume that urban rents increase non-stochastically over time and analyze how a more stringent statute of limitations as well as the optimal period of statute affects a landowner’s choice of the date of development. Taking the option value of waiting into account, the landowner will develop the vacant land to the point at which the value of delaying development is just equal to the net value of development. A shorter statute of limitations will expedite development because waiting becomes less valuable for the landowner. Our result thus contradicts that of Miceli et al. (2003), which allows a landowner to decide both the intensity and the date of development. Miceli et al. (2003) show that the statute of limitations has no effect on the pace of development of land that is to be developed after the expiration of the statute, but it expedites the pace of development for land prior to expiration of the statute. Furthermore, we find that the regulator needs to lengthen the statute of limitations for land that is farther from the CBD (central business district) for land developed before the expiration of the policy. By contrast, a uniform statute of limitations policy can be imposed for land developed after the expiration of the policy. We then move to the case in which urban rents evolve stochastically. We derive the condition for the critical level of urban that triggers a landowner to excise the development option. Anticipating this development decision, the regulator sets a period of optimal statute of limitations, which, however, is path dependent. We thus employ the finite difference method as addressed by Hull and White (1990) to investigate the determinants of this policy. Employing plausible parameter values, we find that greater uncertainty in urban rents delays the date for a landowner to develop, thus requiring a shorter statute of limitations to enhance the likelihood for the current landowner to retain title. Given that cyclic fluctuations of housing prices are common in the real estate market, we thus extend previous study on optimal statute of limitations that assumes urban rents increase non-stochastically over time such as Baker et al. (2001) and Miceli et al. (2003). This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 develops the model for two cases in which urban rents evolve non-stochastically and stochastically, and then we compare the results of the non-stochastic approach in our study with those in the literature. Section 3 conducts numerical analysis to investigate how uncertainty in urban rents affects the design of optimal statutes of limitations. Section 4 concludes and offers suggestions for future research.",1

Yet, as part of China’s “New Normal”, there is growing evidence of a significant slowdown in this growth rate; the average growth rate of real GDP of the order of 10% per annum in the three decades to 2008 has fallen to around 7% in 2016. This slowdown has generated considerable concern both in China and in the rest of the world, given the increasing integration of the Chinese economy into the world economy. Not surprisingly, it has also generated a rapidly expanding research literature expressing a variety of view on the nature and sources of the slowdown; see Cai (2016), Lin et al. (2016), Lou (2016), Bai and Zhang (2017) and Lu (2017) for recent contributions to this literature. In this paper, our focus is on the spatially disaggregated impact of a growth change such as the slowdown. Given the geographic diversity of the Chinese economy, it is likely that the effects of such changes will be felt differentially across the provinces and, if that is the case, it will interact with China’s already substantial and persistent inter-provincial disparities which have long been a source of serious policy concern at the highest levels of Chinese policy-making. The coefficient of variation (for provincial GDP per capita) fell steadily over two decades from the late 1970s until the late 1990s, after which it began to rise so that by 2004 it had returned to the level of the mid-1980s when it began to decline, but it remains high: the ratio of GDP per capita in the richest province in 2016 (Jiangsu in the coastal region) to that of the poorest (Gansu in the western region) was still at 3.5, a very large disparity by any standards.Footnote 1 Thus, an analysis of the likely effects at the provincial level of an aggregate change will be an important basis for the formulation of a policy response to the slowdown. This paper addresses this issue. In particular, we ask the question: what will be the effects at the provincial level of aggregate shocks which are felt initially in one of three regions—the coast, the centre or the west? We argue that this is an important perspective since it is likely that, for example, the initial effects of a slowdown emanating from a world recession will be felt more keenly in the coastal provinces with the stronger connections with the rest of the world. In Fig. 1, we picture the annual real GDP growth rates for the three regions over the period 1980–2016. Clearly, growth rates have varied between regions considerably over this period and, in particular, the growth slowdown was more rapid in the coast than the other two regions after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Annual growth rates of real GDP per capita in three regions We attack our problem using two alternative modelling approaches, both based on a vector-autoregressive (VAR) model. The first model is based on work by Lastrapes (2005, 2006) and is an extension of the application of that model in a recent paper by Chen and Groenewold (2018). The other approach uses a sequence of VAR models, one corresponding to each Chinese province, and is related to earlier work by Carlino and DeFina (1998, 1999). Our findings are, briefly, as follows. First, we find that the regional source of the aggregate shock does, indeed, affect the provincial distribution of its effects. In fact, the results are quite stark—the short-run effects of a regional shock are felt predominantly in the provinces within the region itself although there is some diffusion to other provinces over time. This feature is most striking for a coastal shock from which there are almost no spillover effects to provinces in other regions. There are more widespread spillover effects from central and western shocks, especially in the long run; the central shock spills over into provinces in the western region while the effects of a shock to the western region shift over time from the west itself to the coast. Second, we find that both methods generate remarkably similar results. This gives us greater confidence in our conclusions as well as casting some doubt on the criticisms of the sequence-of-models approach by proponents of the Lastrapes method and providing support for the restrictive assumptions underlying the Lastrapes model. These results have important implications for the likely effects of regional-level shocks on disparities. In the context of the slowdown, we might think of a negative shock. If this has its initial impact on the coastal region (say, due to its closer connections with the international economy), inter-provincial disparities which now favour the coastal provinces will be reduced in both the short and long runs as most of the contractionary effects of the shock will be felt in these provinces, even in the long run.Footnote 2 The provinces in the other regions are, in this sense, relatively insulated from the effects of coastal shocks. On the other hand, if the initial effect is felt in the west (as the result of, say, a reduction in mining exports), initially existing disparities will widen, but this will be ameliorated over time as the effects are dissipated, particularly to the coastal provinces. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we review related literature and explain the contribution which our paper makes. In the next section, we set out the modelling framework. The data to be used are described in Sect. 4. The results are discussed in Sect. 5, and conclusions are drawn in the final section.",2

While for many individuals who currently endure a 40-h working week this prediction might stand as wishful thinking, it is widely accepted that technological progress positively affects productivity and output growth (Jorgenson et al. 2008; Commander et al. 2011) although not necessarily hours worked (e.g., Pissarides 2000). Ongoing advancement in information technology which is probably the most spectacular technological development over the past two decades strongly affects how people perform their job duty. This paper takes a closer look at one such aspect by examining the causal long-run effect of the growth in adoption of information technology on average commuting distances within professions, challenging the assertions made by authors such as Cairncross (1997) and Friedman (2006) that commuting distances should increase because of the advent of information technology. It is nowadays quite common that a job duty is subdivided into separate job tasks which might be performed at locations other than the conventional workplace. Residential location is one of the places where employees might carry out job tasks by engaging in teleworking, an out-of-office work arrangement, for some days of the week or hours of the day. Until the 1990s, teleworking was mainly associated with (low-paid) manual jobs (see IDS 1996). However, it has become increasingly relevant for other types of jobs as well, largely due to the continuing technological progress with regard to telework enabling technology, such as e-mail, smartphones and the Internet. For example, EU average incident rates of teleworking among employees were around 4% and 7% in, respectively, 2000 and 2005, but with large variations between countries and industries (Paoli 2001; Welz and Wolf 2010). Potential benefits from increased teleworking adoption, which include, among others, reduced congestion, better work-life balance (James 2014), improved job matching and higher productivity (while the latter might be debatable due to shirking although Bloom et al. (2015) provide quasi-experimental evidence of a positive effect of teleworking on routine tasks’ performance), have led many governments to develop friendly policy measures toward adoption of information technology. For instance, the US Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 endorses teleworking among public employees, while the European Framework Agreement on Telework in 2002 promotes telework-friendly policies in the EU.Footnote 1 Despite strong policy support for information technology adoption, not least on the ground of its mitigating effects on the negative externalities of transport, such as congestion and pollution (De Borger and Wuyts 2011), the possible countervailing causal effect of improved information technology on commuting distance travelled has never been convincingly estimated. The previous research has been largely descriptive, mostly due to lack of data [see discussions on causality identification in Mokhtarian et al. (2004) and Moos and Skaburskis (2008)]. It is neither straightforward to anticipate the sign of the technology effect based on socioeconomic theory. If an employee works from home for some days during the week, then the number of trips to work is reduced.Footnote 2,Footnote 3 However, teleworking might in the long run also result in a relocation of residential and employment sites which changes the commuting distance per trip. Thus, the possibility to telework may induce individuals to choose their residential locations further away from the workplaces or, alternatively, choose workplaces which are further from home (see for an exposition of the strength of these two mechanisms de Vos et al. 2018), so the commuting distance (per trip) increases [see as well Kim (2016), for an empirical path analysis on the relation between telecommuting, job and residential location]. Lund and Mokhtarian (1994), Safirova (2002), Rhee (2008) and Glaeser (2008, p. 41) provide urban economic models on the relocation of households due to information technology, which show that commuting distance might be longer for employees who telework (hereafter, teleworkers) than for other commuters. Technological progress not only has allowed workers to perform tasks at home, but also from other locations, which provides an even stronger incentive to workers to lengthen their commute. Thus, such long-run behavioral response of employees to information technology might, in principle, be detrimental for social welfare, as negative transport externalities, for example congestion and pollution, might aggravate. In these models, however, it is ignored that the information technology might also affect non-teleworking employees (hereafter, non-teleworkers) within firms where relatively many people telework.Footnote 4 This might happen for various reasons. First, workers who prefer to work from home in the near future (e.g., as they expect children) are more likely to move their residence further away from the job (e.g., to the suburbs) when this job allows for teleworking (Van Ommeren et al. 1999). Importantly, this possibility is consistent with several studies that point out that many employees iterate short periods of teleworking with prolonged periods of conventional working, which is often driven by the nature of a particular job task at hand (Bailey and Kurland 2002). Secondly, due to new technology, firms might find it profitable to locate away from central urban places with high land rents and instead, to save on land costs, locate in cheaper but more accessible places that might be closer to residential locations. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, progress in information technology in general and teleworking in particular most likely changes agglomeration economies. Some research suggests that agglomeration economies might decrease because face-to-face interactions of workers employed by different firms are less frequent and thus might be less valuable [see, for example, literature surveys by Anas et al. (1998) Audirac (2005)]. However, most theoretical and empirical research suggests exactly the opposite: Information technology increases agglomeration economies (see, among others, Gaspar and Glaeser 1998; Storper and Venables 2004). Therefore, we focus on the empirical question of the long-run effect of technology adoption on the average commuting distance of both teleworkers and non-teleworkers combined. To answer this question, one has to estimate the information technology effect on commuting distances of both teleworkers and non-teleworkers within the same profession (we define profession as a particular job within a given industry), while accounting for reverse causality and omitted variable bias.Footnote 5 The issue of reverse causality is fundamental in the estimation of the effect of technology adoption on commuting distance, as employees who commute long distances might have stronger incentives to telework. Thus, a naïve OLS approach of explaining employees’ commuting distance by teleworking would produce biased estimates (likely to be overestimates). An experimental setup, in which the opportunity to use information technology would be provided to only one of two otherwise identical groups of employees, is one of the ways to avoid this bias and estimate the average causal effect (see, e.g., Angrist and Pischke 2008). The major disadvantage of this approach, provided that it is feasible, is the short-run nature of a typical experiment in comparison with the effect of teleworking on commuting distances which manifests itself over the long term through changes in workplaces and home locations. An instrumental variable approach is another alternative. However, an instrument for the use of information technology that does not correlate with commuting distance is hard to find, as commuting distance and teleworking are both related to behavior in labor and housing markets.Footnote 6 In this study, we introduce an innovative methodology that uses information from 2 to 1 year when information technology was scarcely adopted for teleworking and a more recent year when teleworking is technologically possible and adopted in a wide range of professions. We employ cross-sectional Dutch labor force surveys for the years 1996 and 2010, which provide relevant data on teleworking activities of workers. The information technology of 2010, such as high-speed Internet and powerful computers, was generally not widely available in 1996.Footnote 7 In contrast, high-speed Internet and powerful computers were pervasive in 2010. We also note that technological progress affects production functions of various professions in a different way, making telework a more feasible arrangement in some professions, but less so in others.Footnote 8 Such variations in teleworking adoption over time and professions will allow us to infer the causal effect of interest for professions through difference-in-differences after applying propensity score matching. In a nutshell, at first, we consider commuting distances of workers in 2010 who work in teleworking professions—we define these professions based on a minimum share of teleworkers in 2010, a year when the use of information technology is common.Footnote 9 Workers in these professions are considered treated. Then, we compare these commuting distances with the ones of comparable employees in the same professions in 1996 who, by assumption, did not have access to information technology. These employees are considered the non-treated sample. In our preferred specification, to find comparable employees across time in treated professions, we match employees from 2010 and 1996 within the same industries. The difference in commuting distance between these matched employees of 1996 and 2010 is due to information technology plus an industry-specific time trend, which we account for. We define this trend, which might vary across industries due to, for example, variations in demand shocks, by the difference in commuting distances of matched employees from 2010 with 1996 within a given industry in non-treated professions. We interpret the resulting difference-in-differences estimate as the average causal effect of information technology on commuting.Footnote 10 While different workers might sort into different types of professions in 1996 and 2010, our estimation procedure aims to account for this, by comparing similar employees in terms of their socio-demographic and job-related characteristics (which include, among others, age, gender, family size, education, industry, job, firm size and total hours of work). Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some variables uncorrelated with such characteristics might affect the general trends differential in commuting distances between professions within the same industry, it is not obvious what these variables are and how empirically relevant they could be. However, if our main assumption does not hold and thus the within-industry time trends are not similar for treated and non-treated profession, our results should be seen as overestimates if, e.g., because of increasing workers’ flexibility, the within-industry time trends are steeper for treated than for non-treated professions. On the other hand, our results are lower estimates if the within-industry time trends are flatter for treated than for non-treated professions. The latter might be due to stronger economies of agglomeration for these professions. We find no evidence that the adoption of information technology causes commuting distances to increase. In treated and non-treated professions, the average commuting distance between 1996 and 2010 increased by about 2 km. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the identification strategy and inference. Section 3 gives an overview of the data, provides definitions of treated and non-treated professions and presents results of the matching procedures and difference-in-differences estimation. Section 4 offers varying robustness checks related to our main assumptions. The last section concludes with the discussion of the results.",13

Lopez,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cities often pride themselves on the scale and variety of their local cultural sector. Broadway in New York City, the West End in London or the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles are cultural emblems and indicators of urban vitality. As cities grow, it is important to understand the role that the cultural sector and its producers play in a city’s expansion. The share of the population living in cities has been steadily increasing over the last century (United Nations 2015). However, growth has not been uniform across cities, with some metropolitan populations rising while others have dwindled. Such regional shifts in the population have altered the economic fortunes of those cities involved. Growing cities can increasingly provide a greater variety of urban amenities which, in turn, attracts new residents. While declining cities are able to maintain fewer local amenities, reducing the local quality of life. However, when there are large income differentials and a limited housing supply within a growing metropolitan area, high-income households bid up rents beyond the reach of less affluent households. Therefore, thriving cities often struggle with providing affordable housing for lower-income workers. Many such cities are finding much of the urban core primarily occupied by high-income workers, while peripheral cities are increasingly being settled by migrating workers looking for cheaper housing (Florida 2017). This is particularly important with regard to cultural workers, many of whom are well educated but often receive lower wages than their equally well-educated counterparts employed in traditional professional industries (Alper et al. 1996). In fact, a recent survey of US musicians found that 64% of the sample had at least a bachelor’s degree, yet the median income for the sample in 2018 was $35,000 (Krueger and Zhen 2018). In contrast, the average starting salary in 2016 for a US college graduate majoring in finance was $48,285 (CERI 2017). The contribution of this paper is in developing a framework to analyze cultural producer’s location and labor supply decisions when cities differ in income demographics and available housing. Cultural producers are often caught in the divide between high- and low-income residents in cities. One the one hand, locating in an affluent city where the demand for urban amenities is high provides a large income source for cultural producers. 
As casual empiricism suggests, high-income cities offer a greater variety of cultural goods and can accommodate more rarefied tastes, such as record stores devoted solely to jazz or classical music, specialty restaurants, experimental theater (Glaeser 2011). On the other hand, high-income cities tend to have more expensive housing. In contrast, peripheral cities may provide a lower level of aggregate demand for cultural goods, but offer more affordable housing options. A concern for cities where rents are rising rapidly is what will happen to the cultural makeup of the city as artists are unable to afford to live and work in those locations? The fear is that artists will leave to look for more affordable locations. Indeed, a number of smaller cities have proven to be a haven for the cultural class: Asheville, NC; Tucson, AZ; and Athens, GA, for instance. Interestingly, Detroit’s recent financial distress has been a boon to both local and relocating artists who have taken advantage of the low cost of housing from the spate of foreclosures over the years (see Ewing and Grady 2012). To some extent, this is not surprising. Cities with a declining population retain a stock of both public and private infrastructures left behind by departing residents, which can be relatively quickly and inexpensively reconfigured for a new use. For example, popular cultural establishments in high-rent cities are often forced to close due to the high rental costs but resurface in lower-rent neighborhoods or cities nearby. In this paper, we avoid normative statements regarding the quality of cultural work and make no direct comparison between, say, the value of fine art as compared to light entertainment (for a theoretical analysis of high and low art, see Cowen and Tabarrok 2000). This allows for a particularly broad view of the ingredients of a specific city’s cultural makeup and can include local restaurants and museums, music and theater venues, book and record stores. The primary focus is that households have some interaction in the city through the consumption of cultural goods beyond simply housing and employment needs. Our model modifies the footloose entrepreneur model developed by Forslid and Ottaviano (2003) to explore the effect of agglomeration economies on the cultural makeup of cities. Additionally, this research extends the literature on land use in multiregion spatial models, pioneered by Helpman (1998) and extended by Tabuchi (1998), Murata and Thisse (2005), Pflüger and Süedekum (2007) and Pflüger and Tabuchi (2010). In our model, a variety of local cultural goods are produced requiring a fixed cost of the “talent” of a cultural worker. In our formulation, the New Economic Geography (NEG) framework is altered to incorporate a non-tradable cultural good with the intuition being that many urban amenities are perishable, an “experience,” that cannot be equivalently replicated in another location (Glaeser et al. 2001). Therefore, two regions may have similar but not identical varieties of a good (e.g., a Broadway play in comparison with its nationally touring companion with a different cast). What we argue is that a major draw of a city is not the relative cost for all varieties in each city but rather the varieties available in one city which are simply not available in another. Each city is endowed with a fixed supply of housing. There are three types of mobile workers: cultural producers, workers in a traditional industry and workers in a modern industry, which shows external economies of scale. Initially, we study worker’s location decision when each type supplies labor inelastically to their respective industry. Under this specification, the concentration of all workers in a single region is a stable equilibrium when the “love of variety,” represented by the elasticity of substitution between cultural goods, is strong, while full integration is never stable. Additionally, we derive the conditions for partially segregated cities, where modern and traditional workers live in opposite cities and cultural producers are divided between both regions, and partially integrated cities, where one of the two regions contains a share of all types of workers. In traditional NEG models, regions are endowed with a fixed number of immobile workers. In contrast, in our model when all workers are mobile there tends to be a degree of regional segregation between modern and traditional workers. Therefore, regional differences in average-income levels and available housing create two distinct labor markets for artists, and a different number of available varieties of cultural goods in each city. Conceptually, the contrast we make between cultural producers and modern workers is akin to the divisions employed by Florida (2011) in defining the “creative class.” Florida makes the distinction between the “super-creative core” which “...includes scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and novelists, artists, entertainers, actors, designers and architects, as well as thought leadership of modern society,” and “creative professionals” consisting of a highly educated professional class including doctors, lawyers and businessmen. The “creative class” is set in contrast to a “working class” made up of industrial workers and a low human capital “service class.” These latter two groups are consistent with our definition of a traditional sector. Florida (2011) provides data showing that the artistic class on average have incomes less than 50% above those of the “working class,” whereas legal and managerial workers on average have incomes nearly triple those of the working class. This suggests that from an economic standpoint, cultural workers bear more resemblance to the working class than the professional class. There has been considerable research on artists labor markets that debunks the vision of the starving artist (Throsby 1992; Alper and Wassal 2006). This is due to the fact that artists tend to be relatively well educated and have access to more lucrative outside options, allowing artists to smooth their income. Therefore, “moonlighting” in other industries provides cultural workers a more reliable income stream (See Alper and Wassall 2000). To account for this, our model is extended to allow for cultural producers to split their time between cultural production and production of the traditional good. As Throsby (1994) writes “... theories of labor supply in the arts will need to account for multiple jobholding by artists, and in particular for the differences in their motivations in supplying work to the arts and nonarts labor markets...artists as a group differ by virtue of the fact that their professional creative work alone is, in the majority of cases, unlikely to generate a living wage over a reasonable period of time, either because the hourly earnings are too low and/or because remunerative work opportunities are not available.” Indeed, in one survey 61% of musicians indicate that they could not afford to live solely on music-related income (Krueger and Zhen 2018). Furthermore, the survey indicates that music-related income came from a number of different tasks including live performances, music lessons and merchandise sales, revealing the multiple jobholding of artists. In our modified model, some additional outcomes emerge. There is a stable equilibrium in which all traditional and modern workers concentrate in one region, while a portion of the cultural producers live isolated in the opposite region, creating what is described as an “artists’ colony.” Access to the traditional sector’s labor market creates a safety net that is able to sustain a small community of cultural producers. However, we find that under this configuration artists in the larger market are able to devote more time to cultural production than those in the smaller market. Additionally, we construct an equilibrium where one region contains a number of artists that are able to devote all their time to artistic production, while in the opposite region cultural producers must spend a portion of their time moonlighting in the traditional sector. Finally, we show that under both a partially integrated and partially segregated equilibrium there are a greater number of varieties of cultural goods available in the region with the greater supply of housing. The remainder of the paper is presented as follows: Section 2 develops the model. Section 3 analyzes a number of equilibrium configurations. Section 4 extends the model to allow for moonlighting by cultural producers. Section 5 provides a discussion of the results and a numerical analysis. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",4

Fonseca,Irving Llamosas-Rosas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Which characteristics drive foreign direct investments (FDI) into a particular region? Do regions compete to obtain these investments? Or does a particular FDI helps to increase the amount of investment in neighboring states? These questions are of particular importance in a developing economy like Mexico because FDI helps to improve the economic conditions of the recipient region and its surroundings (Coughlin and Segev 2000). Among other things, FDI gives developing countries the opportunity to facilitate access to developed countries’ markets and global production systems through technology, production supply chains, and other intangible assets unavailable at accessible prices in the local economy (UNCTAD 2006). For example, from 1999 to 2015, FDI accounted for, on average, 12.6% of Mexico’s total gross capital formation and 2.7% of its total GDP. Also, the literature has identified FDI as an important vehicle for technology and knowledge transfer through spillover effects.Footnote 1 Since FDI is an important source of financial resources that help to improve a region’s economic activity, states can offer investors favorable conditions to acquire FDI’s benefits and to enhance job creation and economic growth. That is why a better understanding of the determinants of FDI attraction helps to shape future public policy strategies toward regional development (Jordaan 2008). Using an up-to-date database on the distribution of FDI at the state level, and using spatial econometric techniques that allow us to test our hypothesis about the presence of spatial effects (the so-called third-country/region effect; see Blonigen et al. 2007 and Regelink and Elhorst, 2015), we analyze regional patterns of FDI inflows in the manufacturing industry in Mexico from 1999 to 2015. We focus on this sector because it accounts for about 50% of the total inward FDI during this time period. By applying a panel data Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), our main result indicates that manufacturing FDI is consistent with the case of complex vertical specialization (Bloningen et al. 2007; Baltagi et al. 2007) in which firms tend to offshore parts of their production chains to various regions to benefit from cost differences. We believe this is the case in part because the main source of manufacturing FDI in Mexico (just over a third of manufacturing FDI) is in the automotive industry, which is characterized by a high level of integration among its production chains: the car manufacturers and their suppliers (Sturgeon and Van Biesebrock 2010). Across states, we find a positive spillover effect on the process of attracting manufacturing FDI. The estimated spatial effect indicates that with a 10% increase in manufacturing FDI in a state’s neighbors, the state’s FDI manufacturing flows will increase on average between 3.7 and 4.3%. Moreover, we obtain other results of the estimations with respect to control variables that are considered standard in the literature: (1) Variables such as agglomerationFootnote 2 and schooling show a positive and significant impact as factors of manufacturing FDI attraction, while higher wages have a negative and weak effect; (2) infrastructure and homicide rate have the expected effects, although without statistical significance; (3) from a methodological point of view—and in the spirit of LeSage and Pace (2009)—the interpretation of the estimated parameters is based on the decomposition of the impact effects, both direct and indirect, which enables us to get a richer interpretation of the variable impacts not only of a state’s own characteristics but also of its neighbors’; and finally, (4) we include an indicator of fiscal incentives (fiscal margin) that is novel for the Mexican case and that helps us examine how subnational governments in the country compete for FDI projects in the manufacturing sector. With these results, we infer that manufacturing FDI is attracted to states with better-educated populations and with higher ratios of workers employed in the manufacturing sector (our proxy of agglomeration). Along with the indirect impacts found on the same variables, this implies that in general, the manufacturing FDI flows to a state depend not only on its own characteristics but also on those of the neighboring states, thus generating a clustering-type dynamic (Porter 2003). Our novel findings regarding the fiscal margin variable (both direct and indirect) support this argument. Given that this variable is the most widely used and immediately available tool for state governments to attract FDI projects in the manufacturing sector, we discuss in detail its possible public policy implications. Finally, we consider that the design of public policy aimed to increase FDI flows into regions should be analyzed in a regional context and not only from a local perspective. This article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 contains a literature review; Sects. 3 and 4 include data and descriptive analysis and the econometric model specification, respectively; Sect. 5 shows the results; and Sect. 6 concludes.",10

S. Kim,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Improving health levels can be achieved through various factors. Highly advanced medical technology and specialized medical resources serve a great purpose in fulfilling that goal. The fact that overall improvement of living conditions is in line with technological advancement played a great role in reducing the mortality rate. The medical technology undoubtedly is absolutely necessary in raising the quality of people’s health and lives (Tan and Ong 2002). Although advancement in physical aspects of medical technology advancement can play an important role in improving the health levels, the number of doctors can be a major factor in enhancing the accessibility to medical services (Lee and Hwang 2015). Increase in the number of doctors, together with advancement in medical technology, had in fact led the way to enhance various health levels, including the mortality rate. The progress in medical technology and increase in supply of doctors can be interpreted in a similar context as the economic growth accounting which comprises labor and capital in classic production function. The health level can be compared to production output, while technical progress and supply of doctors correspond to total factor productivity and increase in labor input, respectively. The important point here is that economic growth—perceived as the increase in production output—and enhancement in health level are conceptually the same. This argument, of course, is valid only under the premises that such enhancements can be quantitatively measured—as in mortality rate—and that many factors compositely affect the outcome. In-depth analysis of this issue is necessary to investigate how the increase in physical and human medical resources along with advancement in medical technology helped achieve higher health levels, one of which is the reduction in mortality rate. Increasing health levels, such as lower mortality rate and higher life expectancy, have always been a great societal interest. In this context, the number of doctors and advancement in medical technology has emerged as important social issues. Therefore, it is necessary to examine their relationship, both systematically and quantitatively. Approaching these issues in terms of economic variables and examining them with production function can serve as a practical method in understanding the imbalance and disparity of medical resources in different regions. Application of production function’s input and output concept in health economics is in fact the background of this study. In health economics, production of health can be clearly figured out simply by understanding its main roles in the healthcare sector (Folland et al. 2010). In other words, exploring how health output is dependent on input of medical resources is in fact the assessment of health production. This idea closely relates to the fundamental purpose of healthcare resources to promote higher health levels. In health care’s historic perspective, it is conceivable to conclude that the role the doctors played in reducing human mortality rate over the course of its long history is insignificant, considering that revelation of medical science’s effectiveness has been realized only recently (Folland et al. 2010). The influence on mortality rate by main medical resources to be examined in this study can be expressed as the “outcome,” one of the major factors in health economics which in turn is a clinical outcome. As for the questions on how such clinical outcome would be measured, or how the state of health level and its changes would be measured quantitatively, it can be said that mortality rate is the indicator currently being used. However, in addition to mortality rate, the morbidity rate is also used as health-level indicators (Karpa and Leśniowska 2014; Lee and Hwang 2015). The fact that advancements in supply of medical resources and medical technology have great influence on reduction in mortality rate can be recognized from latest trends (Fig. 1). Moreover, considering regional economic condition as another influencing factor can be understood in line with imbalance in medical resources between different regions due to unequal distribution. In regions with higher economic conditions, high-quality medical resources—with latest technologies and greater number of doctors and medical personnel—become concentrated. On the other hand, in other economically weak regions, concentration of such resources is relatively less, or even non-existent. Consequently, it is very likely that such difference in concentration or unequal distribution naturally would lead to disparity in medical outcome such as mortality rate reduction. This reasoning, in connection with aging population, would serve as the grounds for various discussions on improving accessibility to medical resources for the elderly population. The prevalence rate or mortality rate of elderly population is dependent on distribution of medical resources within their residential area. In this respect, regional characteristics unquestionably are relevant to death rate and can be said to encompass very important significance. When various indicators on healthcare utilization cannot explain the decrease in mortality rate, it can be interpreted to suggest that the expansion of medical facilities and services (the supply) has to have close connection with accessibility (the demand). Changes in age-standardized mortality rate, number of high-end medical equipment, number of medical personnel per population of 100,000 (from 1990 to 2014). Note: High-end medical device is the aggregate total of CT, MRI, and PET. Age-standardized mortality rate is the number of medical personnel per 100,000 The objective of this study is to find the effects human and physical medical resources have on age-standardized mortality rate. The main purpose of assessing regional health level is to figure out demand in health care as well as to provide information necessary in adopting government policies. The outcome of these health economic based quantitative analyses can serve as an important means for requiring policies to promote balanced medical resources and improve health levels in all regions.",12

People tend to engage in regional migration at three time periods during their lives: when entering higher education institutions (HEIs), when procuring a job, and when retiring. Among these, emphasis has been placed on migration related to entering HEIs since it is linked to students’ subsequent career and migration, as well as to university education opportunities, and it leads to the redistribution of human capital on a national scale. With such increases in scholarly attention as well as increased data availability, researchers have investigated the determinants of college-bound flow. These determinants include geographic and socioeconomic factors, such as physical distance, job availability, and amenities in the origin and the destination, as well as the selectivity of HEIs (Ma et al. 2017; Faggian and Franklin 2014) and the effect of academic field (e.g., Faggian et al. 2007a). One interesting factor is the effect of the stock of former migrants on new migrants with whom they share a prefecture of origin (i.e., network externality). In the case of Japan, however, a number of interesting questions remain due to previous constraints on accessible data—namely, the effect of academic field and HEI selectivity (i.e., the preferences or characteristics of study at HEIs), which are aspects that high-school graduates usually consider when selecting HEIs and making decisions about college-bound migration. Since most Japanese universities ask students to select their majors upon entering HEIs, the relevant data are now available on request. The results of research on college-bound migration in Japan could have implications for countries with similar higher education systems (in Asia or Europe, for example). In other systems, including those in the USA, students select a major after entering an HEI; nevertheless, they may have study plans for specific fields that influence their migration decision. Capturing regional differences in college-bound population flows by field may highlight a need to review the appropriateness of educational opportunities and resource allocation by geographic location. Selectivity might also be influential. The effect of HEI quality on college-bound migration has been confirmed in previous studies, including recent research in the USA (Faggian and Franklin 2014), Korea (Ma et al. 2017), and Italy (Ciriaci 2014). However, this has yet to be confirmed in relation to the effect of academic field in Japan. Gender is also related to academic field and selectivity. In Japan, male students usually have higher enrollment and migration rates than their female counterparts (Hozawa 2014; Sasaki 2006); this could be related to the composition of members in each academic field or differences in HEI selectivity. First, male students dominate hard sciences such as physics and mechanical engineering, while female students dominate the humanities, home economics, and health.Footnote 1 Gender is also related to HEI selectivity in Japan since the natural sciences departments of HEIs with higher selectivity are usually larger than their arts and humanities departments. In light of the above, this study investigated the determinants of college-bound student flows, including academic field, institutional selectivity, and gender, along with other socioeconomic factors. The present study focused on interprefectural migration in terms of regions’ aggregate characteristics rather than students’ personal attributes or the institutional attributes of HEIs. The study also considered which regions attract more students and what attracts highly skilled labor forces. This research was specifically interested in what attracts college-bound students to particular regions since this attraction causes the redistribution of human capital and eventually leads to economic development in the region. In Japan, the uneven regional distribution of HEIs also has an effect on college-bound migration (Yoshimura 2008). The main data for analysis were Japanese national-scale mezzo-level data spanning 2003–2014, provided by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). These data include the number of first-year college students and their prefectures of origin by HEI department. If students are not from the prefecture of origin, they are usually regarded as migrant students. This is not necessarily the case, however. For instance, students might not be able to commute when home and university are in different parts of the same prefecture, as in Hokkaido, Japan’s largest prefecture, which is roughly as large as the US state of South Carolina. Meanwhile, students may commute beyond a prefectural border, especially in the organized transportation networks of metropolitan areas. Thus, although interprefectural college entrance is not a perfect index for student migration, it is the only available data for analyzing the national-scale college-bound migration of students in Japan. Students are defined in this study as those who enroll in either a 4- or 6-year bachelor’s program as first-year students in any public or private HEI targeted by MEXT for national statistical surveys. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the study background based on the previous literature and introduces the research questions. Section 3 explains the model and data, and Sect. 4 summarizes the results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",

Boarnet,Xize Wang,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This study investigates the relationship between polycentric urban structure and household-level travel behavior. The decentralization of population and employment has made many once monocentric metropolitan areas more polycentric (Giuliano et al. 2007). There is a large literature studying the relationship between urban form and travel behavior. However, the effect of a polycentric urban structure on passenger travel has not been widely explored. The literature on urban form and travel behavior has documented that the association between employment access and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has one of the largest magnitudes among land use variables, with an elasticity of VMT with respect to employment access ranging from − 0.05 to − 0.31 (see, e.g., Ewing and Cervero 2010; Salon et al. 2012). Since VMT is highly correlated with the level of greenhouse gas emissions, employment access variables have a potentially important policy role in sustainable urban development. Yet employment access variables in the research literature have not differentiated between whether drivers have access to dispersed jobs or jobs that are clustered in an employment sub-center. Clustering jobs in employment sub-centers might create agglomeration benefits that will affect household travel demand. We hypothesize that agglomeration benefits (in both production and consumption) within employment sub-centers are valuable to households; thus, households that lack access to employment sub-centers may drive longer distances to access sub-centers, implying a weaker association between distance-based access to sub-centers and VMT. On the other hand, jobs that are centered will allow greater chaining of trips, implying that increased access to centered employment may reduce VMT more than increased access to non-centered employment. Overall, the net effect of access to employment sub-centers on VMT (relative to non-centered jobs) could be ambiguous. In this study, we separate centered and non-centered jobs in a traditional regression study of land use and VMT, to explore this question. We contribute to the literature by providing some of the first evidence about whether and how the association between employment access and VMT varies depending on whether households can access jobs in employment sub-centers or jobs that are not in sub-centers. California metropolitan areas have highly sub-centered employment patterns, and the state has emphasized policy approaches that link land use to vehicle travel. We examine whether all jobs matter equally for travel behavior, and whether access to sub-centered jobs is or is not different (in terms of the association with household VMT) from access to jobs that are not in employment sub-centers. Our study area is the five-county Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area (CSA)—Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties. In this study, we use detailed data on employment from the National Employment Time Series (NETS), matched to geocoded firm locations, to identify employment sub-centers in the Los Angeles CSA. We then use the most recent travel diary survey for the region, the 2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS), to measure household VMT, again matching the household’s residence to their geocoded location. In addition, we modify a standard land use—travel behavior regression to include, as explanatory variables, measures of access to jobs that are inside and outside of employment sub-centers. In order to examine questions of causality, we use access to historically significant places and transportation corridors to serve as instrumental variables for the access to jobs inside and outside of the contemporary employment centers. We use Tobit regressions to correct for the skewness of the distribution of household VMT because 25% of surveyed households have zero VMT on the survey day. Our study shows that the access to jobs outside employment sub-centers has a larger association with household VMT than access to jobs within sub-centers. In addition, access to jobs inside smaller employment sub-centers has a larger association with household VMT than access to jobs in larger employment sub-centers. These findings show that the net effects between agglomeration benefits and trip chaining impacts are to make the elasticity of VMT with respect to access to jobs within sub-centers smaller than the elasticity of household VMT to access to jobs that are not within sub-centers. For local policy makers in the Los Angeles CSA, encouraging residential development in areas with higher access to non-centered jobs could be an effective method to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, local governments might encourage job growth outside employment sub-centers, especially outside large employment sub-centers.

D. Hewings,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Tax policies are an important tool in the regional competition for skilled migrants. In the USA, many states openly compete for business activities and high-skill workers by offering lower taxes. For example, in 2013, The New York Times (Stewart 2013) and Forbes (Gregory 2013) published articles that debated whether millionaire taxpayers had fled from states with high income taxes. The existing literature on tax-induced migration (TIM) has mainly focused on the estimation of the average elasticity of migration to taxes but has largely ignored the variance around these estimates. For example, if TIM has a threshold pattern where migrants respond only to tax differentials outside an “inertia range,” then small-scale fiscal adjustments might not attain the policy goal of skill attraction. This paper aims to fill this literature gap by investigating nonlinear effects of taxes on migration. Specifically, we applied a spline regression to the dataset of Moretti and Wilson (2017) and observe different nonlinear patterns in the effects of four types of taxes on scientist migration. We then use bin regression to confirm the statistical significance of observed marginal effect variations. The results suggest that personal income tax and research and development tax credit have threshold patterns in their effects on interstate migration and migration only occurred once certain thresholds in tax/credit gaps are met. The interstate gap of net-of-ATR and R & D tax credit need to be, respectively, greater than or equal to 4 and 10% points to induce migration. In contrast, corporate income tax has a linear effect on migration: a one-percent increase in tax differentials between two states leads to a fixed percentage increase in the migration flows between the two states, as described by an average elasticity. Meanwhile, investment tax credits have a stable effect on migration only when the destination state initially has higher credits than the origin state. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section two reviews the empirical tax-induced migration literature, while section three presents the theoretical frameworks of tax-induced migration using spline regression. Section four discusses the data, and section five presents the empirical findings. Section six concludes the paper.",1

Heywood,Bryan Weber,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Recent research demonstrates that “safe ride” programs, common to urban universities and hospitals, can reduce crime by providing taxi-like transport to students and staff (Weber 2014). Yet, safe rides are only one of a variety of transportation programs provided by urban universities. Moreover, implementation of one form of transit may have very different influences on crime when other forms already exist. As this makes clear, there exists a need for studies that evaluate the marginal contribution of transport programs that are added to the mix already being offered. This paper uniquely examines reported neighborhood crime as a major private urban university supplements a large existing safe ride program with a new dedicated and scheduled bus service along prime commuting routes.Footnote 1 We show that the advent of the bus service is initially associated with reduced use of the safe ride program. This raises the common concern that the bus service may concentrate potential victims and crime along its fixed routes as riders walk to, and wait, at stops. The major contribution of our paper is a series of difference-in-difference estimates, showing that such concern is unwarranted. The new bus service reduces crime in the campus neighborhood overall, and the largest reductions are actually along the bus route. This finding is important as it suggests that the new eyes on street along the route together with increased transit use overall (the sum of safe rides and the new bus service rides) more than makes up for any potential influence of substitution away from the safe ride program.Footnote 2 In turn, this provides two pieces of initial evidence to administrators and policy makers. First, it provides the only examination we are aware of focusing on university-provided bus service and showing its influence. Second, it shows that two different programs can be better than one in reducing neighborhood crime. In what follows, Sect. 2 motivates this study by putting it in the context of past research. Section 3 details the case study describing the university, its neighborhood, and its transit programs. This section also describes the collected data. Section 4 presents the methodology used to investigate the influence of the new student bus service on university neighborhood crime. The results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 provides a series of robustness checks, and Sect. 7 concludes and suggests further research.

Interactions are a feature of multi-tiered governments where each jurisdiction sets its own tax or spending level and thereby influences the other jurisdictions in their level of spending or taxation. It is particularly interesting for the light it sheds on the implications of public and decentralization policies at the local level. Fiscal interactions occur for three major reasons that have been widely discussed in the literature. The first is public expenditure spillovers, the second centers around fiscal competition, and the last factor is yardstick competition (Revelli 2005). A large body of literature focuses on tax interactions in particular, and most of it finds evidence for positive effects. Tax burdens in one jurisdiction are interdependent with those in neighboring jurisdictions. One of the first studies on tax mimicking in US counties identifies a positive interaction effect (Ladd 1992). Other studies on the US also point to positive coefficients (Case 1993; Besley and Case 1995; Frederiksson et al. 2004; Crowley and Sobel 2011). They investigate different tax variables such as sales tax, income or property tax, and total tax revenues. Similar papers focusing on the Eurozone are Büttner (1999, 2001), discussing all German counties as well as the municipalities of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Solé-Ollé (2003), investigating selected Spanish municipalities, Bordignon et al. (2003) on Italian municipalities, Feld et al. (2003) on French regions, and Feld and Reulier (2009) on Swiss cantons. All these studies find positive tax externalities in neighboring jurisdictions. Spatial interactions in the level and structure of expenditures have been given less attention in the literature than tax interactions. However, in the last two decades, they have become noticeably more important because local governments very often do not have large tax competencies, and hence spending decisions gain much more weight. Where interactions do exist, they are relevant for investment decisions by municipalities and may influence the design of public policies. Recent studies on spending interactions, such as Case et al. (1993), Redoano (2007), Št’astná (2009), Acosta (2010), Frère et al. (2014), Costa et al. (2015), Qu et al. (2016) and Fossen et al. (2017) come up with ambiguous findings. Comparability between these papers is limited. Only a few of them set their sights on municipal expenditure interactions between total expenses and non-earmarked subcategories at a local level, examples being Case et al. (1993), Št’astná (2009), Costa et al. (2015), or Fossen et al. (2017). Other authors explicitly examine single subcategories such as public health spending only (Yu et al. 2013). As interactions are expected to be stronger at municipal-government level than at higher levels, this lack of research results is remarkable. Accordingly, an initial aim of the present paper is to investigate empirically whether expenditure interactions exist at the municipal level in NRW, in particular in non-earmarked subcategories. From a theoretical point of view, local governments spend most of their money on guaranteeing the provision of public goods and services. These are not limited to the residents of the jurisdiction that supplies them, a fact referred to in the theory of pure public goods (Samuelson 1954) as “non-excludability.” As predicted by the Tiebout model of local public goods, governments provide public goods financed by local revenues. Residents are mobile, and in order to maximize utility, they will gravitate to those jurisdictions that enable them to profit from an optimal amount of public goods in conjunction with favorable tax rates (voting by feet) (Tiebout 1956). Jurisdictions will therefore be competing for mobile factors. Such theories suggest that local governments compare themselves with neighboring municipalities so as to stay competitive, under the proviso that they cannot limit domestic public goods and services to their own residents.
 In the New Economic Geography (NEG) framework, hump-shaped agglomeration rents (Wang and Zeng 2013) may cause the results for the provision of public goods to differ from those found in classical competition models. NEG researchers Andersson and Forslid (2003) and Baldwin and Krugman (2004) state that such agglomeration rents do exist and develop a stylized model of economic geography. In contrast to a basic tax competition model (BTCM) (Wilson 1999), they focus on varying factor mobility costs or trade costs, and find that lowering those may result in higher taxes being chosen in the case of tax competition among governments. Baldwin and Krugman (2004) assume imperfect monopolistic competition and love for variety, which lead to agglomeration economies. Companies move to the region that provides the highest level of profit for them. Hence, they would be willing to bear a higher tax in order to be in the core-region that benefits from agglomeration economies. On that basis, agglomeration creates rents for mobile factors. In this paper, too, agglomeration rents are important for asymmetrical regions because an agglomerated region may as well decrease the amount of public goods without losing mobile factors to the periphery. The reason is again that companies and employees gain extra profits from agglomeration economies, as predicted by NEG and may thus accept lower public goods provision (cf. Baldwin et al. 2003, chs. 15 and 16). To the best of my knowledge no study so far has considered spatial expenditure interactions in the context of agglomeration economies, as predicted by the NEG framework. I claim that the combination of expenditure interactions at local levels and agglomeration rents may be of relevance and should therefore be examined in order to test the predictions from the NEG. In this paper, I study the impact of agglomeration on the reaction function, i.e., the parameter that indicates whether the expenditure levels determined by a government have any effect on neighboring expenditures. In jurisdictions with agglomeration rents, the slope of the reaction function should flatten, according to the NEG framework. To date, there are few studies that have looked into the impact of agglomeration forces in the context of fiscal interaction, and those that do so concentrate on tax rates or economic promotion with regard to firm foundations only (Fréret and Maguain 2017; Wittstock 2018). These studies find that the sensitivity of tax rates or spending decreases with increasing agglomeration forces, i.e., the slope of the reaction function is reduced for attractive jurisdictions. This paper thus investigates empirically whether high- or low-regime agglomeration municipalities are less or more responsive to horizontal expenditure interaction. The best measure of agglomeration economies is not obvious. I use population density, as it is both readily available and informative (other agglomeration indices are also applied) (Ciccone and Hall 1996; Hill 2008; Charlot and Paty 2010; Briant et al. 2010). One of the possible mechanisms underlying interactions is yardstick competition. Should yardstick competition be responsible for interactions, the reaction function would decline as the municipal electoral margin increases—another hypothesis that is tested in this paper. As pointed out both by Costa et al. (2011) and Costa and Carvalho (2013), agglomeration economies can reduce the pressure from yardstick competition. Expenditure interaction in these municipalities is expected to be lower. The ambiguous results produced by the literature discussed above and the existing research gap are reason enough to empirically analyze expenditures in the light of spatial interactions. As a phenomenon, expenditure mimicking in general and especially in agglomerations has important policy implications for the design of fine-tuned public policies and the identification of geographical disparities. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, and highly relevant, I study the effects of agglomeration on the intensity of public expenditure interactions. In contrast to previous studies on agglomeration and fiscal interaction, I shall not examine the effect of agglomeration on equilibrium tax rates but on expenditures across local jurisdictions. Studying the German case is also particularly interesting because German municipalities have a high degree of autonomy in planning their expenditure. The municipalities of NRW act within the same constitutional framework, thus simplifying the identification of fiscal interactions. Secondly, another contribution this paper makes is to focus not only on total expenditures but also on a complete set of non-earmarked expenditure subcategories in the German municipalities of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). The literature has only focused on parts of expenditure subcategories (at the level of municipal, state and federation) and as suggested by theory and the literature, the reaction functions can vary for different expenditure subcategories. It is entirely possible that the expenditure subcategories will reveal that complementarity and substitutability neutralize each other or lower the total interaction effect (Case et al. 1993; Costa et al. 2015). Especially at municipal level, knowledge on fiscal interactions in different expenditure subcategories is still limited. A third contribution of the article is the exploration of yardstick competition as a possible explanation for expenditure interactions. In my empirical analysis, spatial regression models are used to study fiscal interactions. This puts it in line with studies referred to earlier that either use an instrumental variables (IV) or the maximum likelihood (ML) model. In the main specification, I use a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) in a panel framework. The panel data set spans 7 years from 2009 to 2015 in the municipalities of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). I test a large set of different spatial weighting matrices, also in assessing the robustness of my results. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section addresses theoretical considerations on fiscal interaction. The data is described in Sect. 3. Section 4 specifies the empirical model, endogeneity issues, and the spatial weighting matrices. After that, Sect. 5 presents the results. Section 6 discusses subsequent robustness checks, and Sect. 7 concludes.",8

LeSage,Daniel Hendrikz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Chan (2018) argues that the assumption of Gaussian homoscedastic disturbances in conventional Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) models may be restrictive. He develops a family of extended BVAR specifications that allow for: (1) non-Gaussian errors that are Student t-distributed, (2) heteroscedastic errors that allow for time-varying volatility, (3) serially dependent (or moving average) errors. In addition, his extensions allow for error distributions that exhibit combinations of these alternative assumptions. An advantage of assuming Gaussian homoscedastic disturbances in BVAR models is that simple regression methods can be used for estimation of the model parameters, making these models easy to estimate and forecast. The work by Chan (2018) utilizes Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for estimation that take more time than ordinary least-squares estimation. However, a focus of his work has been computationally efficient approaches to estimating the models that incorporate non-Gaussian disturbance structures. In addition, Chan (2018) has provided freely available MATLAB code to produce estimates and forecasts for these models. The regional BVAR forecasting literature has previously focused exclusively on models that assume Gaussian homoscedastic disturbances. One stream of literature has relied on a ridge-type (Minnesota) prior applied to vector autoregressive model coefficients to produce a BVAR has been used to improve forecasting accuracy of macroeconomic time series, Doan et al. (1984), Carriero et al. (2016), Koop and Korobilis (2010), Karlsson (2013). In these models, the prior means for parameters used in the BVAR are centered on a ridge-type shrinkage model. Shrinkage of the coefficients toward zero emphasizes the first own-lag of the dependent variable and de-emphasizes longer time-lags of the dependent variable and all other variables and time-lags. This approach seems to work well when forecasting VAR models that incorporate a large number of macroeconomic time series (Carriero et al. 2016; Koop and Korobilis 2010; Karlsson 2013). Another approach that has appeared in the literature was motivated by LeSage and Pan (1995) who argued that a ridge-type shrinkage prior does not hold the same intuitive appeal when it comes to forecasting regional time series, where we observe co-movement of economic activity between nearby regions. This has resulted in a number of alternative proposals for prior parameter distributions that are capable of exploiting co-movement of regional time series. Early attempts to modify the Minnesota prior took an approach that imposed the prior means more loosely for nearby regions, where loose imposition of the prior means was achieved by increasing prior variances to place more emphasis on the sample data and less emphasis on the values set for the prior means. LeSage and Pan (1995) used large prior variances for spatially contiguous regions that allowed for nonzero posterior estimates for coefficients associated with time-series variables from neighboring regions. For interindustry time series, LeSage and Magura (1988, 1990, 1991) took this same approach for regional data relying on input–output relationships to specify large variances for coefficients on industry-related time series. Other work in this vein includes Rickman and Miller (2002), Rickman et al. (2009), Partridge and Rickman (1998). A more straightforward approach to tackling the problem that the zero prior means specified for coefficients by ridge-type priors are not appealing for regional time series is that introduced by Krivelyova and LeSage (1999). They use a random-walk averaging prior, which they label RVAR. For ease of reference in the sequel, we will label this the spatial prior. Their prior specifies a prior mean of (1/m) for the coefficients on (growth rates) variable vectors from the m neighboring regions. This prior emphasizes spatial dependence in contrast to the ridge-type prior that emphasizes time dependence on own-region lagged values. LeSage and Cashell (2015) examine forecasting performance of a large VAR model that contains quarterly time series for all 48 lower US states, plus the District of Columbia.Footnote 1 They report an improvement in forecast accuracy for the states when using the spatial prior in place of the ridge-type (Minnesota) prior.Footnote 2 We extend this regional forecasting literature by evaluating the forecasting ability of the BVAR models recently introduced by Chan (2018) that allow for alternative specifications for the model disturbances that relax the assumption of a homoscedastic Gaussian distribution. Our exploration is carried out for both the ridge-type prior distributions and the spatial prior distributions assigned to the parameters. The impact of spatial versus non-spatial prior distributions on forecast accuracy (measured by mean absolute percentage error MAPE) is relatively small. In contrast, the impact of allowing for alternative non-Gaussian model disturbance specifications is large, resulting in improved regional forecast accuracy (lower MAPE) as well as improved forecast precision (measured by a lower standard deviation of the forecast errors). Our comparison of forecasting accuracy centered on state-level economic activity, as measured by a (seasonally adjusted) monthly index of Coincident Economic Activity produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which was available for the period from January 1980 to December 2017. We produced out-of-sample 12-step-ahead forecasts for the 48 states over two different 36-month time periods (2012–2014 and 2015–2017) for 8 models. We will use the labels shown in Table 1 for the 8 models explored here, with a more detailed description of each model set forth later.Footnote 3 For now, we simply note that 7 of the 8 models in Table 1 reflect non-Gaussian disturbance structures. Forecasts were produced using estimates from models based on both spatial and non-spatial prior distributions, resulting in 663,552 individual monthly forecasts. One could analyze this large number of individual monthly forecasts in a number of different ways. We have chosen to analyze the accuracy of our forecasts to emphasize the following comparisons: (1) Gaussian versus non-Gaussian models, (2) spatial versus non-spatial priors, and (3) variation in performance over two time periods (2011–2013 vs. 2014–2016). A summary of our findings regarding forecast accuracy and precision at the 12-month-ahead forecast horizon is that: Non-Gaussian models produced more accurate forecasts (lower MAPE) in 28 of the 48 states during the 2012–2014 period and in 47 of 48 states during the 2015–2017 period, for the case of the non-spatial prior. Non-Gaussian models produced more accurate forecasts (lower MAPE) in 32 of the 48 states during the 2012–2014 period and in 46 of 48 states during the 2015–2017 period, for the case of the spatial prior. Non-Gaussian models produced more precise forecasts (lower standard deviation in the forecast errors) in 36 of the 48 states during the 2012–2014 period and in all 48 states during the 2015–2017 period, for the case of the non-spatial prior. Non-Gaussian models produced more precise forecasts (lower standard deviation in the forecast errors) in 44 of the 48 states during the 2012–2014 period and in 46 of 48 states during the 2015–2017 period, for the case of the spatial prior. These findings suggest that regional forecasting might benefit greatly from use of the new family of non-Gaussian disturbance models introduced by Chan (2018). In the next section, the spatial and non-spatial ridge-type prior distributions for the coefficients of the vector autoregressive models are described. We note that this is our only methodological contribution, since estimation and forecasting for the models with non-Gaussian disturbance specifications were fully developed in Chan (2018). We also describe members of the family of non-Gaussian BVAR model specifications. Section 3 describes the forecasting experiments and analyzes results.",3

D. Hewings,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economic systems are increasingly built on interdependencies; the processes of estimating, interpreting and accounting for changes in these interdependencies have generated a number of different techniques and approaches. The recent profusion of studies directed at trade in value added (see, for example, Steen-Olsen et al. 2016) illustrates some of the important changes that have characterized the changing geography of trade linkages at the global level. The present paper explores the structural transformation of a single economy (the Chicago metropolitan region) with a particular focus on the changing interaction between sectors, a perspective that has once again become a major topic for economic analysis (Berthold et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016). Earlier work (Hewings et al. 1998; Romero et al. 2009) had explored the nature and strength of changes in the degree of intermediation within the Chicago region and found that while the region as a whole was hollowing out (a decline in the degree of intermediation in production), a small set of interactions was increasing in intensity as a result of a process of functional fragmentation. What is needed, therefore, is an approach that stresses the systemic complexity of economic structure and one that can also be used to revise and extend established paradigms in economic theory (Schweitzer et al. 2009). Thompson (1965) considered that the evolution of the economy’s structure transformation is logistic, with a slow accumulation of interaction effects characterizing the early period before a takeoff into an accelerated period of growth. As the economy reaches maturity, the deepening of the interactions slows down. It is here that for the most part, the empirical evidence ends. Jensen et al. (1986, 1988), in a series of papers, explored the ways in which development would be accompanied by an essential deepening of the intensity of interaction between sectors and proposed the development of a taxonomy of economies based on their economic structure as manifested in the structure of the input–output connectivity. However, their analysis and progress in this area have been hampered by a dearth of data, especially a time series of input–output tables. The metropolitan economy of Chicago has experienced a significant transformation in its economic structure over the past 30 years. It represents an exemplar of an older economy whose domination by manufacturing has been replaced by a much more diversified economy. Israilevich and Mahidhara (1991) noted that there had been an important exchange; at a seven-sector aggregated level, firms were becoming less dependent on sources of manufactured inputs produced in Chicago and more dependent on services that were being produced in the metropolitan region over the period 1970–1990. Schindler et al. (1995) also found that during 1970s and 1980s, Chicago’s economic structure changed dramatically with services coming to dominate both output and employment. It is possible to argue that the case of the Chicago economy presents one stage of a series underlying the processes of complexity development in a metropolitan region (see Sonis et al. 1997 for fuller explanation). To produce an economic photograph of the changes in the Chicago region, annually, for the period 1975–2011, Sonis and Hewings (1998) explored the nature of these structural changes; the resulting picture, at the nine-sector level of detail, revealed a hollowing-out process. Drawing on the limited empirical and theoretical contributions that are available, these studies employed aggregated industrial sectors (seven or nine sectors, respectively), and thus, they provided only an aggregate view of structural change; what these movements in composition do not reveal is whether there have been any underlying changes in the internal-to-the-region exchange among sectors. The processes of structural change had become more complicated, requiring alternative, complementary tools to be applied to provide a more complete picture of the changes (Romero et al. 2009). In the present paper, hierarchical feedback loop analysis developed by Sonis and Hewings (1988, 1991) is employed. The innovation is to explore the use of this methodology to trace and interpret structural changes in a single regional economy over time (1995–2010). The methodology can be viewed as a complement to other approaches to the measurement of structural change with the distinguishing feature that it highlights subsystems of linkages that are extracted in a hierarchical fashion. By examining the intensity of change within each feedback loop, the methodology can help to identify some of the changes caused by spatial and functional fragmentation of production (see Romero et al. 2009) with the former likely to see a decrease and the latter an increase in intermediation. By enhancing the analytical toolbox, a more complete overview of the process of economic development, manifested through changes in economic structure, can be presented. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic elements of the hierarchical feedback loop approach. Section 3 briefly describes the derivation of Chicago input–output tables using the Chicago region econometric input–output model (CREIM). Section 4 presents the feedback loops of the Chicago economy over the period of 1995–2010 and with some interpretive analysis. The fifth section concludes with some summary remarks.",1
62.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,06 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-019-00911-4,Does related variety affect regional resilience? New evidence from Italy,June 2019,Giulio Cainelli,Roberto Ganau,Marco Modica,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The 2008 Great Recession—which affected all European regions, although with different intensity—prompted interest in the concept of regional resilience, which refers, from an evolutionary perspective, to a region’s capacity to react positively to a short-term external shock or disruption (Simmie and Martin 2010; Martin 2012). With different European regions reacting differently to the same external shock, several attempts have been made to identify empirically the main determinants of this regional resilience heterogeneity (e.g. Fingleton et al. 2012; Martin 2012; Modica and Reggiani 2014; Bristow and Healy 2018; Faggian et al. 2018; Fratesi and Perucca 2018; Cainelli et al. 2019). Among the drivers identified, one of the most important appears to be the region’s current industrial structure and, in particular, its level of related diversification (Boschma 2015). As it is well known, the concept of related variety, which has been widely discussed and investigated during the last 10 years (Frenken et al. 2007), stresses that what matters it is not the level of productive diversification per se, but the presence of diversified domains allowing complementarities to be exploited across different industries. These complementarities arise from the existence of shared competencies and depend on the cognitive proximity among local actors (Nooteboom 2000). In spite of the fact that the concept of related variety, and the ways through which it can be measured, have been criticised (e.g. Ejermo 2005; Bishop and Gripaios 2010; Brachert et al. 2011; Desrochers and Leppälä 2011; Wixe and Andersson 2017), it is widely employed in many empirical studies. These works generally identify a positive effect of related variety on the economic performance of firms and regions, regardless of the country analysed or the econometric methodology adopted (e.g. Quatraro 2000; Cainelli and Iacobucci 2012; Cainelli et al. 2016; Lazzeretti et al. 2017). Despite the relevance of the notions of related variety and industrial relatedness for economic geography and regional economics, the analysis of their impact on regional resilience is scarce. This is surprising given that, according to the evolutionary approach to regional resilience (Boschma 2015), industrial relatedness seems to play a relatively important role with respect to the short-run ability of regions to absorb an external shock. The few studies that focus on this issue find a positive effect of related variety and industrial relatedness on regional resilience, that is, they confirm the “shock absorbing” ability of related diversification. In fact, these characteristics of an industrial structure seem to exert a positive effect on local resilience since skills, capabilities and technologies can be reallocated more rapidly across industries, thus improving the ability of a local system to adjust to an external shock (Cainelli et al. 2019). The contribution by Sedita et al. (2017) is of particular interest for the Italian case. They employ an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) econometric strategy and confirm that related variety has a positive effect on local resilience measured as the growth rate of the employment after the 2008 Great Recession. The present paper develops this kind of analysis in two directions. First, regional resilience is defined following the approach proposed by Lagravinese (2015), who proposes an index which captures the ability of a region to “resist” to an adverse shock with respect to the rest of the country. Thus, resilience is not identified simply with local employment growth, but rather with the ability of the local system to react to an exogenous shock—in this case, the 2008 Great Recession. A value of this resilience indicator lower than zero means that the local system is highly sensitive to an exogenous shock, while a value greater than zero indicates a highly resilient local system. Second, the empirical analysis, performed at the Italian local labour market (LLM) level, employs spatial econometric techniques in order to provide a more accurate picture of the related variety–resilience relationship. The empirical results, obtained through the estimation of Spatial Durbin Error Models (SDEM), suggest that LLMs characterised by a higher level of related variety have shown a higher capacity to adapt to the Great Recession over the 3-year resilience period 2010–2013, while not over the 1-year resilience period 2012–2013. In other words, the analysis partly identifies related variety as being a shock absorber. These findings are strongly linked to the recent debate on the Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3). In fact, related diversification at the regional level is one of the key concepts underlying this European regional strategy, which assumes that new productive and technological specialisations can arise only through a dynamic process that moves from a set of related industries. In this sense, the results presented in this paper—which emphasise the role played by related variety in reinforcing the capacity of a region to resist to an external shock—confirm the relevance of industrial relatedness in fostering new regional development patterns by exploiting vertical and complementary relationships with the pre-existing activities of a region. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The second Section discusses the related literature; the third Section describes the dataset and the econometric methodology adopted; the fourth Section presents and discusses the empirical findings; the fifth Section concludes the work.",36

This interest was largely motivated by recent empirical literature on economic growth showing that regional disparities in the productivity levels represent one of the key determinants of the income differences and inequality (Dettori et al. 2012; Easterly and Levine 2001; Caselli 2005; Rice et al. 2006, among others). The lion’s share of productivity research has tended to take either a regional-level (macro-level) approach, focusing on the characteristics of ecological units such as cities and countries, or a firm-level (micro-level) focusing on the characteristics of the firm. At the regional level, several explanations of the productivity gap have been put forward, but the key role appears to be related to intrinsic differences among regions such as infrastructure, human capital, and levels of research and development (Krugman 1991; Romer 1990; Lucas 1988; Moretti 2004; Ciccone and Peri 2006; Bronzini and Piselli 2009; Andersson and Lööf 2011; Glaeser et al. 2002). At the firm level, scholars argue that firm-specific characteristics (age, size, type of economic activity, human capital and internal R&D), and industrial structure or external variables (knowledge spillovers, specialization, diversity, competition) explain firms’ performance (Audretsch and Feldman 2004; Henderson 2007). Some recent studies propose an alternative approach that allows micro-levels and macro-levels to be modeled simultaneously in order to explain the differences in the total factor productivity (henceforth TFP): It is the so-called the multilevel or the hierarchical model (e.g. Aiello et al. 2014; Fazio and Piacentino 2010; Raspe and Van Oort 2011). By using multilevel modeling, it is possible to explain the differences in the TFP by providing a clear distinction between firm and region-specific effects. In addition, it is possible to show how contextual effects translate into individual behavior. Fazio and Piacentino (2010) argue that multilevel modeling can also reduce the ambiguity surrounding the agglomeration-firm performance relationship and address regional, sectoral and cross-level heterogeneity. Raspe and Van Oort (2011) believe that “existing single-level methodologies can be problematic and that alternative methodologies (such as multilevel analysis) provide a useful empirical framework to address potential ecological measurement fallacies”. If micro- and macro-factors affect productivity and interact with each other, their contribution can be properly measured only via a multilevel analysis that can solve the micro–macro-problem known as “ecological fallacy” (Robinson 1950) or “cross-level fallacy” (Alker 1969). If one of the relevant dimensions (individual or regional) is omitted, estimations of the determinants of TFP are bound to be biased. In this paper, we use an unbalanced panel of more than 2843 Tunisian manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2004 to estimate how much of the observed firm-level performance due to firm-specific characteristics. In addition, we test how regional and sectoral characteristics affect the productivity of firms. In this respect, Tunisia provides a very relevant context to examine these issues. Indeed, Tunisian economic activities are characterized by large inter-regional and inter-sectoral productivity gaps. Nearly 56% of the total population and 92% of all industrial firms are concentrated in the three largest cities: Tunis, Sfax and Sousse. These three coastal towns, which form the core of economic activity, represent 85% of the national GDP. Moreover, large productivity gaps exist across sectors (Marouani and Mouelhi 2016). By considering the interaction of micro-data at the firm level and macro-data at the regional and sectoral levels, we are able to control the individual, regional and sectoral heterogeneity for the evaluation of firm-level productivity. We can also overcome the endogeneity and multicollinearity problems so critical in empirical studies that rely on aggregate data only to investigate the relevance of the socioeconomic context for economic activity (Fazio and Piacentino 2010). Moreover, the multilevel analysis allows the inclusion of macro-level (regional and/or sectoral) exploratory variables which otherwise would be absorbed by the fixed effects. In addition, the multilevel analysis, by using a single equation model, exploits the structures of data and properly addresses the issue of error correlation across firms that operate in the same region and in the same sector. Most previous studies in Tunisia tend to analyze productivity either at the firm level or at the regional level. For example, Baccouche et al. (2008) use a firm-level data to examine the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and total factor productivity (TFP) in Tunisian manufacturing sectors during the period 1998–2004. Amara and Thabet (2012) and Thabet (2015) test the impacts of the local industrial structure (specialization, diversity, competitiveness and the firm’s size) on the aggregated added value for five industrial sectors among 138 delegations of the coastal areas of Tunisia over the period 1998–2004. Amara and El Lahga (2015) have recently used a sample of manufacturing Tunisian firms to distinguish between the effects of own firm’s characteristics (direct effects) and average characteristics of their neighbors (endogenous and contextual effects) on its output level. Marouani and Mouelhi (2016) separately use sectoral and firm data to analyze the dynamics of sectoral productivity growth in Tunisia and assess the contribution of structural change to these dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, our study is among the first in Tunisia to consider micro- and macro-interaction to examine the productivity of manufacturing firms.Footnote 1 The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly conduct a comprehensive literature review in the field of predicting and understanding the determinants of TFP as well as a short description of the economic geography of Tunisia in Sect. 2. We then present the data and the methodology employed to estimate the contribution of each micro-level and macro-level factor on the firm-level TFP (Sect. 3) and an overview of the main results in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes with some policy recommendations.",8

In particular, it tests what characteristics of the local school market were correlated with independent primary levelFootnote 2 school entry in 1992–2000, with respect to aspects such as the family background of the local student population, the local political majority, and the quality and density of the existing neighbourhood schools. The 1992 reform introduced practically free entry, including for for-profit companies, and thus introduced strong market incentives into the education sector. As it gave rise to the entry of a large number of independent schools, it provides an excellent opportunity to study the location decisions of private providers in a mixed market setting. This paper makes two main contributions: (i) It provides descriptive evidence on the geographical pattern of a dramatic independent school expansion, by analysing what local characteristics were correlated with a higher likelihood for independent school location.Footnote 3 (ii) It carefully assesses the sensitivity of the results to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP),Footnote 4 i.e. it investigates if the regression estimates are sensitive to the type of spatial aggregation employed. This is done by making use of highly detailed geographical information to construct a set of alternative definitions of local school markets, and by investigating if the estimated parameters are sensitive to gradual changes in the local market definition, thus providing an informal test of the MAUP.Footnote 5 The MAUP is, I would argue, in general not sufficiently addressed in the literature outside the domain of economic geography. For example, previous studies on school locations in general tend to make use of the spatial units that are readily available, such as school districts, zip codes, or census tracts in the US education literature, or SAMS areas or municipalities in the Swedish context, without much discussion of whether or not this is the appropriate level of aggregation.Footnote 6 With the increased accessibility of geo-coded data, as well as sufficiently powerful software,Footnote 7 there is scope to take this issue more seriously, for example by using tailor-made local units, and this applies to all studies using spatially aggregated data. The main results of this study suggest that the likelihood for independent school entry was correlated with the local student population density as well as with the local student family background. In particular, the independent school entry probability was higher in locations where students were of high-educated family background and was lower in locations, where a large share of students had at least one Swedish-born parent. There was also some indication of a lower likelihood for independent school entry in municipalities with a local left-wing political majority, although this result was not robust to changes in the outcome time period. The above-mentioned results were robust to the various alternative and flexible definitions of local school markets. For other variables, such as the local income dispersion, average GPA, and voucher level, the definition of the local market, however, had a substantial impact on the results. This underlines the importance of accounting for the MAUP in studies using spatially aggregated variables. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives a brief overview of the Swedish independent school reform, Sect. 3 provides information on the data variables, and Sect. 4 describes the MAUP and the spatial aggregation measures. Section 5 presents the results, and Sect. 6 concludes.",3

Empirical and anecdotal evidence has shown that crucial competitive variables as quantities and prices of offline retailers have changed as a consequence of the competitive threat of online retailers (see for instance Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000; Brown and Goolsbee 2002; Chevalier and Goolsbee 2003). A crucial strategic variable of traditional retailers is spatial location. As argued by Aguirregabiria and Vicentini (2016), location is a key for traditional retailers’ success. Therefore, it is likely that traditional retailers react to the competitive threat of online retailing by modifying their location. For example, as argued by Guo and Lai (2017), “it is observed that numerous physical retailers have moved into urban areas, close to highly dense populations” (p. 439) due to online competition. However, as reported in Kotkin (2001), others believe that online competition would induce traditional retailers to locate mainly in suburban areas (see, for example, Dixon and Marston 2002 and Li 2010). However, the theoretical analysis of location choices of traditional retailers competing with online retailers is still scant nowadays. Foncel et al. (2011) and Chu et al. (2012) consider a location-then-price game where one traditional retailer competes with one online retailer. At the best of our knowledge, the case of more than one traditional retailers is considered only by Guo and Lai (2014, 2017), both adopting the Hotelling (1929) framework. In particular, Guo and Lai (2017) consider n traditional retailers and one online retailer in a game with simultaneous choice of location and price, under linear transport costs. However, in order to get an equilibrium, some specific assumptions are needed in their model, namely heterogeneity of traditional retailers in terms of production costs and uncovered market due to low consumers’ willingness to pay. On the other hand, Guo and Lai (2014) consider competition between two traditional retailers and one online firm, and, in line with the consolidated tradition in spatial economics (see for instance D’Aspremont et al. 1979), they consider a location-then-price game with quadratic transport costs. Guo and Lai (2014) argue that the only possible equilibrium is such that the traditional firms occupy unconnected regions of the market and do not locate at the endpoints of the Hotelling segment. Therefore, the online firm causes the duopolistic firms to be finitely differentiated. Unfortunately, the analysis in Guo and Lai (2014) is incomplete. Indeed, the location-then-price equilibrium derived in Guo and Lai (2014) is not robust to location deviations. In particular, we show through a numerical counterexample that a traditional firm has the incentive to deviate from the supposed location equilibrium in order to generate a different market structure that guarantees higher profits. Since deviation is profitable, an equilibrium with unconnected regions of the market does not arise when two traditional firms compete with one online firm in a location-then-price game with quadratic transport costs. The rest of this note proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the model as in Guo and Lai (2014). In Sect. 3, we show that the model assumptions are not sufficient to support the result in Guo and Lai (2014). Section 4 concludes.",2

Most notably, exposure to excess pollution drives up human health risks (Atkinson et al. 2010; Hu et al. 2017; Pascal et al. 2013), causing the increased incidence of morbidities and mortalities associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (OECD 2016; WHO 2016). According to a recent estimate, 12.8 billion years of life in global total or 1.8 years of life expectancy on average could be saved if the entire planet met the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline level of 10 µg/m3, given in annual mean particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations (Greenstone and Fan 2018). Such direct health damage from PM2.5 exceeds the risk imposed by other conventional factors, such as smoking, unsafe water/sanitation, conflict/terrorism, and alcohol/drug abuse (GBD 2013 Risk Factors Collaborators 2015). The estimates may go up even further if indirect costs associated with efficiency loss from service-biased resource allocation are also taken into account (Matus et al. 2012; World Bank and IHME 2016). Air pollution in East Asia has brought increasing public attention given its magnitude and the number of its potential victims. In 2017, for example, annual mean PM2.5 levels in East Asia and the Pacific were 40 µg/m3, exceeding the WHO guideline level by a factor of four (Fig. 1). The region also accommodates > 1.3 billion urbanites or around a third of the world’s urban population, surpassing any other global region by a huge margin. High ambient pollution levels combined with a heavy concentration of urban population make East Asia highly vulnerable to pollution-induced welfare damage and have revealed the need for imminent and consistent policy interventions. In fact, worsening air quality has recently been pointed out as a great threat to sustainable growth and urbanization in many countries within the region. In China, for example, welfare loss from excess PM pollution alone is estimated to reach 3–9% of its historic gross domestic product, which has led to increasingly stringent pollution regulations during recent periods (Zhang et al. 2017). Although a large share of such pollution-induced damage remains local, it is not just an issue of a particular country. Instead, it has a regional dimension, as pollution does not necessarily respect political boundaries, causing cross-border externalities. In particular, PM and ozone, accounting for a large fraction of health damage, are typical transboundary pollutants, whose impact studies need to incorporate the regional dimension into their analysis (Yamashita and Honda 2018). Source: created by the authors from the World Development Indicators Database PM levels and population by global region, 2017: a annual mean PM2.5 levels; b total and urban population. Many pollution impact studies have focused directly on human health dimensions, but ripple effects arising from the pollution-health nexus can reshape broader aspects of our lives and societies. For example, urban air quality has arisen as a key determinant of individual housing/job location choices in China, and tends to alter aggregate leisure/recreational preferences (Chen et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2018; Poudyal et al. 2013). Such changes can have substantial market impacts on cities and regions, and these impacts may be traced with revealed preference for clean air, whose premium is partly reflected in market prices, such as real-estate property values (Zheng et al. 2014). However, the impacts largely involve non-market dimensions, as well, requiring a more comprehensive economic analysis (World Bank and IHME 2016).",3

S. Kim,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The people of Korea are under great risk with continuous exposure to highly concentrated particulate matter (PM). PM concentration levels in Korea are one of the highest among OECD countries (second out of 34 countries) and became a major social and political issue by setting record of high concentration rates in recent years. It has been a pressing environmental and health concern due to increasingly higher levels of fine dust particles (PM10) and microfine dust particles (PM2.5). These PM pollutant concentrations are higher particularly during the winter season because PM pollutants are carried by the wind from China, where they are a byproduct of heat produced from coal-based power plants. Air circulation within the Korean Peninsula is slow during the winter and spring, which also contributes to increasing PM concentrations. The Korean government is greatly concerned with how to resolve the problem and clean the atmosphere. However, the main causes of PM concentrations in Korea are still controversial. The media and general population still believe that pollution created in China that carries over to Korea is the main cause of increasing PM levels. However, a recent evaluation team from NASA, which visited Korea in 2016, discovered that that foreign sources account for only 48% of the pollution, whereas domestic sources account for 52% (Interagency Coordination 2017). Because of increase in foreign influence on PM concentration in Korea, Korean government set joint reduction targets for reducing air pollution as well as joint research and cooperation with China. South Korea proposed the exchange of information on air quality and relevant forecast technology, along with a joint study on soil pollution in mined areas. South Korea and China recently have agreed to set up a joint early warning system related to fine dust (The Korea Times 2019). Korea is a favorable market for diesel engine vehicles. The tax rate on diesel fuel is relatively low compared to gasoline because diesel engine vehicles are more efficient than gasoline engine vehicles. It is well recognized that diesel engines produce significant amounts of PM compared to gasoline engines. In the Seoul Metropolitan Areas (SMA) in Korea, where a large number of diesel engine vehicles are registered and operated, diesel engine vehicles are responsible for 23% of the total PM emissions. Other sources in SMA include construction machinery and logistics, 16%, industrial sites, 14%, air conditioning and heating, 12%, organic solvent, 10%, and power plants, 9% (Kwang 2018). Nationally, 38% of PM emissions are sourced from industrial sites, 16% from construction machinery and logistics, 15% from power plants, 11% from diesel engine vehicles, 5% from air conditioning and heating, and 5% from dust scattering (Fig. 1) (Kwang 2018). Foreign sources include China and North Korea which account for, on average, 30–50% of PM emissions annually (Interagency Coordination 2017). PM2.5 Emission by source The Korean government announced “The 2nd Atmospheric Environment Comprehensive Plan” in April 2016 and “The detailed plan for implementation of special measures for PM” in 2017. These plans were prepared through interagency coordination to prevent the problems brought by PM. According to the detailed plans, 87% of the budget geared toward the PM problem is concentrated in the transportation sector, and 79% of the transportation sector budget is now assigned for green vehicle supply and infrastructure expansion (Interagency Coordination 2017; Park et al. 2018). However, the diesel policy plan has not been promoted sufficiently due to conflicts of interest among the ministries and disparities in their positions regarding the decision. There are policy inconsistencies among the ministries in Korea, including the Ministry of Environment (MOE), the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF), as revealed in their directives to control diesel engine vehicles. The MOE believes that diesel engine vehicles are the major source of the concentration of PM, and they are trying to promote more restrictive regulations. However, the MOTIE is cautiously approaching new diesel engine vehicle regulations by considering their effect on the automotive and oil-refinery industries. The MOE also has a conflict with the MOSF with respect to diesel tax regulation. The MOE insists that the tax on diesel should be raised. However, the MOSF is resisting an increase, anticipating possible serious criticism from the working class population, which is highly dependent on diesel engine vehicles and fuel. In October 2017, the MOCIE and the MOE organized a “Ministerial Policy Council” to enhance mutual understanding and strengthen cooperation. However, control measures that were developed have not been implemented effectively due to continual disagreement and conflicts of interest among the ministries. Understanding the thoughts and perspectives of policy makers on environmental problems is important. It is necessary for the government to identify ways to pursue common goals and to minimize conflicts among ministries in order to enhance policy coherence and efficiency. This understanding will ultimately alleviate public anxiety in an era of continually increasing PM emission and concentration. The objective of this study is to address current PM problems in Korea and classify the specialists’ (government officials and researchers) opinion with respect to the policies and management direction related to PM policy for diesel fuels and vehicles. The Q-methodology and systems thinking approaches are employed to analyze the specialists’ subjectivity, perceptions, and their causal relationship for PM policy for diesel fuels and vehicles. These methods are helpful in categorizing the specialists’ interests and in understanding the differences between their positions. A series of interviews with the specialists from various government institutions were conducted for the analysis. These specialists are highly involved in promoting government policies. It is important to gather their perceptions and opinions in order to understand the direction of government policy on diesel fuel and their efforts in improving the PM problem.",1

Fiscal decentralization is often claimed to be positively associated with economic growth through improved public sector efficiency, and this potential pro-growth link has motivated the decentralization drive in Western countries (Bahl and Linn 1992). Decentralization can improve inefficiency in public finance in several respects. First, demand for public services can substantially differ among municipalities, depending on their demographic, cultural, geographical, and various socioeconomic conditions, and failure to reflect such subnational heterogeneity may increase inefficiency in public finance (Musgrave 1985; Tiebout 1956). Second, increased space for local governments has a market rationale, as they are in a better position than the central government to identify local needs and make a timely response (Rosen and Gayer 2014). Third, increased tax choices under a decentralized system can improve efficiency of public resource allocation by mitigating the preference revelation problem (Oates 1972). Finally, a decentralized fiscal environment can reduce the soft budget constraint, encouraging local governments to be more active at revenue generation and be more rational in public spending (Brennan and Buchanan 1980). Also, increased local competition can potentially increase the chance of innovation in public sector programs. However, empirical evidence in support of such a positive decentralization–growth causal link is not robust. A substantial body of literature has explored this topic in various empirical settings, but their answers seem to diverge. Many studies find pro-growth effects of fiscal decentralization, but others find anti-growth effects or fail to find any significant relationship. Such conflicting results may suggest that two opposite forces work around the decentralization–growth nexus, and their interactions determine the direction and magnitude of the net effects. For example, fiscal decentralization can overly reduce central capacity for public interventions, which may then lead to increased macroeconomic instability and weakened bases for growth (Tanzi 1996). Also, a decentralized fiscal structure may not always guarantee pro-growth effects if public service provision is subject to scale economies or if local governments themselves are not well prepared to take full advantage of the system (Prud’homme 1995). It is thus plausible that the decentralization–growth relationship is not direct when the particular political or socioeconomic conditions that each country confronts, or some detailed aspects of the public finance system, intervene between the two variables. For example, primary motivations for fiscal decentralization vary across countries, which may result in different economic effects. In general, fiscal decentralism in the West has gained public support as a means to public sector reform, particularly in the face of economic crises, such as the Great Depression or the oil shocks of the 1970s. Fiscal decentralization in this context tends to aim at improving economic efficiency in the public sector. In other parts of the world, however, its emergence has somewhat different backgrounds. In South Korea (Korea, hereafter), for example, fiscal decentralization has arisen as part of the political reform toward local autonomy in the mid-1990s, which was pushed ahead as a reaction to three decades of military dictatorships. It thus has relatively weak economic motivations. Then, the question is whether the pro-growth effects can also be found in such a context as Korea’s, where fiscal decentralization is not directly intended as an efficiency promoter. In this study, we test whether a conventional decentralization argument positing pro-growth effects is valid in Korea’s context. So far, the literature on the Korean case is sparse, while the case specificity based on potential indirect causality, as briefly mentioned above, makes it hard to directly apply existing findings from other cases to the Korean case. We thus are motivated to fill this gap, enriching the existing decentralization literature. For hypothesis testing, we first construct Korea’s province- and city-level panel datasets and then conduct an extended Granger causality test using the datasets.",5

In most developing countries and regions, transportation infrastructure investment has been planned to enhance economic vitality. The question of how to make the most effective use of transportation investment in the promotion of economic growth has become a crucial item on the planning agenda of urban and metropolitan planning regions. The transportation studies and economic geography literature reveals the close interaction between transportation investment and economic performance (Wetwitoo and Kato 2017; Kim et al. 2017; Diao 2018; Sun and Cui 2018). For example, changes in accessibility and transportation cost can affect the magnitude and regional distribution of the benefits provided by economic activity (Alonso 1964; Aschauer 1990; Fujita et al. 1999; Holmgren and Merkel 2017; Jia et al. 2017). Though the economic effects of transportation investment have been examined at some length (Achour and Belloumi 2016; Chen and Vickerman 2017), the impact of transportation investment on economic growth is still a matter of debate. The economic benefits conferred by transportation investment depend on local socioeconomic conditions and are sensitive to methodological issues. For instance, the net benefits associated with transportation investment depend on economic potential and geographic variation, and the most substantial benefits are likely when transportation investments are motivated to bridge a regional accessibility gap or to alleviate economic disparity (Chen and Haynes 2017). However, the economic impacts of transportation investment may prove illusory (Melo et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2017) or unclear due to a variety of contextual or methodological issues in different regions (Deng 2013). Thus a better understanding of the effectiveness of transportation investment under various constraints is still much needed. On the one hand, it usually takes several years to construct and operate transportation infrastructure before the improved transportation system generates measurable impacts on regional economies. On the other hand, the economic effects of transportation investment could be subject to different geographic and socioeconomic conditions. In China, for example, regional development is unbalanced and highly regionalized (Diao 2018). Eastern China has an excellent record of economic development and transportation benefits from substantial investment in multimodal services. However, China’s central and western regions are progressing much more slowly and from a lower base with many out-migrants moving to the large coastal cities of Eastern China. Due to potential externalities, the spillover effects of transportation investments may be substantial as investment benefits in one region spread to neighboring regions. Démurger (2001) argued that “as a key differentiating factor,” transportation infrastructure has expanded China’s inter-regional growth gap: narrowing the urban and rural disparity in Eastern China while enlarging it in Central and Western China. To capture these regional spillovers, transportation investment–economic development research needs to consider the joint impacts of panel data and spatial correlation. Recent spatial panel data model (SPDM) development provides a new opportunity to re-assess the regional economic impacts of transportation infrastructure investment (Belotti et al. 2016). This opportunity is especially relevant at this time because massive investment in transportation infrastructure is anticipated under China’s 13th and 14th Five-year Plan ending in 2025. This paper will employ several spatial panel data models to examine the multi-level temporal–spatial effects of provincial-level transportation investment in China from 1997 to 2015. By doing so, this paper addresses three important issues. Will the unprecedented scale of transportation investment in China reach its potential to promote economic growth? Second, since the geographically based analysis cannot avoid the challenge posed by spatial autocorrelation (Meng et al. 2018), how would the relationship between transportation investment and economic development change if the effects of spatiotemporal heterogeneity could be incorporated? Third, what are the implications of the above findings for the promotion of economic growth through transportation investment? The answers to these questions will show the multi-level effects of transportation investment on economic growth and provide economic development policy insights for China and beyond.",12

Evidence from the Mariel boatlift,December 2019,Seung-hun Chung,Mark D. Partridge,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Studies have long found that the average human capital level is one of the most important factors for city and regional growth (Bilbao-Osorio and Rodríguez-Pose 2004; Cheshire and Magrini 2000; Glaeser and Saiz 2003; Shapiro 2003; Simon and Nardinelli 2002). Cities with initially high human capital levels have grown substantially faster than others. Such cities also have experienced faster wage and rent growth. Thus, two important questions are: (1) whether cities with high average levels of human capital increase their human capital faster than cities with low average levels (and vice versa), and more directly related to our study, (2) can a city’s human capital intensity be permanently or at least persistently altered? If increases in a city’s average human capital tend to accelerate its future growth of human capital, then growth differentials in population, wages, and rents between cities with high and low human capital levels will increase. The growth trajectories across cities and regions will diverge, which has important policy implications because without perfect mobility, people residing in human capital poor regions would suffer. Despite the importance of the question, few studies have examined whether shocks to a city’s average human capital level can permanently change its level over time. Berry and Glaeser (2005) used a deep lag variable as an instrument and found that the average human capital level in cities has diverged. Lee (2016) finds similar results to Berry and Glaeser (2005) when using an education program as a natural experiment. However, using a similar method as Berry and Glaeser, but with more control variables, Betz et al. (2016) find that a city’s average level of human capital is not statistically associated with its future growth in human capital, but rather is positively linked to the size of the city. Other studies have examined the migration of skilled workers directly (Kerr et al. 2017; Faggian and McCann 2006; Venhorst 2013), but do not examine aggregate outcomes and feedback effects. A related literature relates to equilibrium models in which the most prominent is the spatial equilibrium model (SEM) that generally predicts that after an exogenous shock to a region’s equilibrium, the region would eventually return to its equilibrium growth path. That is, while there is debate as to how fast the adjustment may take place, the notion is that aggregate outcomes such as total employment or population are not affected in the long run (Partridge et al. 2015). For example, Davis and Weinstein’s (2002) seminal paper finds that Japanese cities that were victims of massive Allied bombing during World War II had effectively returned to their long-run growth path within twelve years after the war. Brakman et al. (2004) found similar findings for Germany after the war. Such findings are prevalent in the literature for a host of other shocks such as military base closings (Partridge et al. 2015). However, the SEM has much less to say about whether other regional characteristics remain on the same equilibrium trajectory after an exogenous shock. For example, do demographic shocks such as the Mariel boatlift have permanent effects on a region’s skill composition that could have long-term implications for its economic welfare by affecting average wages? In this paper, we analyze whether shocks to a city’s skill composition has permanent, or at least persistent effects to its future skill composition. The most important potential obstacle for such a study is endogeneity in that unobserved factors might influence both the present and future levels of human capital. For instance, long-term local government policy might influence trends in skill composition. To address this issue, we use the synthetic control method (SCM), which allows us to construct a “synthetic” control group for the treatment (Abadie et al. 2010), in conjunction with a natural experiment.
 Our treatment group is the Miami metropolitan area, which received a disproportionate share of refugees from the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Most Cuban refugees from the Mariel episode were young and unskilled (Borjas 2015; Card 1990). It is widely accepted that this event was exogenous and that these refugees migrated to Miami due to proximity to Cuba. Another advantage of using the boatlift as a natural experiment is that we can also use results from previous research to perform hypotheses as to the mechanisms behind changes in Miami’s skill composition. We find that the Miami metropolitan area experienced a much slower increase in average human capital than the comparable synthetic control city after the Mariel boatlift. The result implies an influx of unskilled people may lead to slower skill aggregation. These results suggest that shocks to human capital can have permanent effects on future levels of human capital, at least in the context of immigration shocks. We use a variety of data and assumptions to show the robustness of this result.",4

The recent rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to suggest that production automation by AI and computers will proceed to the point that many jobs may be in danger of disappearing. According to Frey and Osborne (2017), about 47% of jobs are at risk of computerization. Widespread automation will change the content of people’s jobs considerably, leading to alterations in both the labor market and society as a whole that “have the potential to disrupt the current livelihoods of millions of Americans” (Executive Office of the President of the USA 2016). In particular, automation has resulted in wage inequality and job polarization, including wage and employment rises in the top and bottom of the income and skill distribution and a decline in the middle of the distributions (Autor 2015). While a number of studies have explored these phenomena theoretically and empirically in several countries (Autor et al. 2003; Goos and Manning 2007; Autor and Dorn 2013; Michaels et al. 2014; Autor 2015), focusing on the extent to which automation affects national labor markets, the degree to which automation changes the population composition of local labor markets has been underexamined. For instance, Autor and Dorn (2013) and Accetturo et al. (2014) show that job polarization will occur in local labor markets that introduce automation widely. Autor and Dorn (2013) further test the implications from their model empirically. The recent study conducted by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) shows that exposure to robots negatively affects employment and wages across local labor markets in the USA and that the effects vary by such factors as education level. However, although they find that automation changes the occupational composition of local labor markets, the migration decision in response to automation is not well examined.Footnote 1 The directional migration model focuses on gross population flows as opposed to net changes in the share or the net population growth of each occupation, thereby allowing researchers to examine the occupational composition change through migration more directly. The present study bridges this gap in the literature by analyzing how automation has influenced US interstate migration in the twenty-first century. In particular, using migration flow data classified into two skill groups and data classified into five major occupational groups, we examine how automation is changing the composition of local labor markets in the USA. The previous literature on internal migration has studied the determinants and outcomes of migration on local labor markets (Greenwood 1997; Molloy et al. 2014), finding that the determinants include amenities, housing markets, and local labor market conditions (Davies et al. 2001; Greenwood and Hunt 1989; Plantinga et al. 2013; Sasser 2010; Zabel 2012). Many empirical studies have focused on internal migration in the USA, where mobility has been high historically. However, mobility has started to decline since the 1980s, as explained by Molloy et al. (2014), Pingle (2007), and Modestino and Dennett (2013). In addition, several studies have focused on the migration of high-skilled workers whose human capital contributes to economic growth. For example, Fu and Gabriel (2012) find the importance of human capital concentration, especially of high-skilled migrants, for economic growth in destination regions in China. To the best of our knowledge, however, the effect of technological change in internal migration has not thus far been studied. This is the major contribution of the present study. Following previous research on migration flows, we employ the conditional logit approach to examine migration decisions. This approach verifies whether people migrate to a state with a higher automation level than the origin state ceteris paribus. To measure the level of automation in each state, we calculate the employment share of highly automated occupations. The degree of automation for each occupation is obtained from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), which is the primary occupational database in the USA. These valuable data, which have not thus far been used to study automation, provide direct information that is usually difficult to measure. This dataset thus enables us to consider how automation affects local labor markets more precisely. In the first analysis, annual migration data at the interstate level from 2004 to 2016 are used to examine the extent to which automation affects migration flows. It is shown that people migrate to states with more automation in skilled occupations and less automation in unskilled occupations. In the second analysis, we use interstate migration flow data from 2004 to 2016 classified into several subgroups. We find that both skilled and unskilled workers move to states with more (less) automation in skilled (unskilled) occupations. The data classified into five occupational groups also show that most workers move to states with more (less) automation in skilled (unskilled) occupations. However, the effect of automation in unskilled occupations is less significant and it does not affect the migration decisions of those in particular occupations (production, transportation, and material moving occupations). Throughout the analyses, the results imply that automation in skilled (unskilled) occupations has a complementary (substitution) effect. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the literature on the economic theory of automation. Section 3 describes the model, and Sect. 4 presents the data on the degree of automation by occupation. Section 5 reviews the data on migration flows and the other variables. Section 6 presents the results, and Sect. 7 concludes.",2

Latino- and Hispanic-owned businesses (LOB)Footnote 1 are of particular interest because the number in the USA increased 46.3% to 3.3 million in the 5 years between 2007 and 2012 (Bernstein 2016). The total number of all the US firms increased only 2% during the same period, to 27.6 million. Receipt growth rate for LOB similarly outpaced that of all firms (Bernstein 2016). Despite the calls for promoting ethnic-owned business as a local development strategy to create income, employment, and alleviate poverty (McKernan and Ratcliffe 2013), little is known about the contributions of Latino-owned business to total economic performance or convergence at the local level in the USA, or how their impacts may spill over into nearby regions. Although some studies have examined the impact of LOB at the local level (Patacchini and Zenou 2012; Zhu et al. 2014), there are few attempts to comprehensively examine the overall impact of LOB in the USA that also incorporate regional convergence considerations. The effects of LOB may be different by type of community. In rural areas, LOB farm service providers may reduce incomes for agricultural laborers, but could make communities more attractive with stronger tax base if LOB service sector activity repurposes empty storefronts found in many American small towns. In urban areas, in contrast, the presence of Latino contractors could speed urban renewal by reducing construction costs. Furthermore, LOB may have impacts on local capital accumulation, either positively, via investments such as the $1M or more required by the EB5 visa program, which targets, among other types of places, rural areas, or negatively, via remittances, which currently run in excess of $2B per year to Mexico alone (Bernal 2017). Informing policy regarding the role of newcomers or minorities in the local economy may also hinge on a better understanding of how impacts vary by type of community. This article assesses the impact of LOB employment share in urban versus rural areas and associated spillover effects, while controlling for local business owner characteristics. We use restricted access federal data and a spatial Durbin error model (SDEM) estimation procedure to explore regional convergence and measure the effect of Latino-owned businesses on own and nearby county economic performance. The results show that LOB employment share generally has a significant and positive effect on local growth, but has a negative total effect in rural areas. Significance varies by growth measure, but the results indicate that there may be an opportunity to improve rural economic growth by increasing support systems for LOB in rural areas. The results demonstrate the power of the SDEM to illustrate how convergence interacts with socioeconomic trends but varies by type of place. The article proceeds with Sect. 2 summarizing relevant literature. Section 3 develops the hypotheses. We develop a new empirical specification, adding spatial spillover effects to Deller et al.’s (2001) expanded Carlino-Mills structural growth equations. We also describe the restricted access data we use to estimate in the model. Section 4 summarizes the empirical results, while Sect. 5 concludes.",4

An empirical analysis of EU for 1997–2012,December 2019,Marie-Line Duboz,Nathalie Kroichvili,Julie Le Gallo,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"The 2004 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development annual investment report (UNCTAD 2004) was entitled “The shift towards services.” While the service sector accounted for only 25% of world foreign direct investment (FDI) in the early 1970s, by 2001 it was drawing in 58% of FDI. More than ten years later, the shift toward investment in services was continuing. In 2012, services accounted for 63% of world FDI stock, almost two and a half times the share of manufacturing (26%) and nine times the lowly 7% share of the primary sector (UNCTAD 2015). Several reasons have been put forward (UNCTAD 2004) to explain why services are a “key sector driver of global FDI flows” (Jones and Wren 2016, 2). First, FDI there reflects the development of the tertiary sector in developed economies as in transition economies and developing economies. Second, FDI is the main way to supply non-tradable services to foreign markets. Third, the liberalization of the service FDI regimes has incentivized countries to react by expanding their service production abroad. Fourth, cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in services have become a ready way for multinational firms to enter foreign markets. The following factors should also be added: Advances in information and communication technology make services more tradable and the growth of global value chains favors the internationalization of services related to manufacturing (UNCTAD 2015). The European Union (EU), where outward FDI flows increased by 57% and inward FDI flows by 90% in 2011, is largely concerned by all these elements. Services made up by far the largest contribution to both outward (62%) and inward (87%) FDI stocks for the EU-27 with the rest of the world at the end of 2011 (Eurostat 2015). For many years, the empirical FDI literature has focused on the manufacturing sector. One question has been to identify the determinants that attract FDI in this sector. Numerous studies have analyzed the role played by factors such as market potential, wages, taxes and agglomeration economies in the host countries of the FDI (see Arauzo-Carod et al. 2010, for a recent survey). Then again, many contributions have sought to identify the geographical choice of foreign firms.Footnote 1 Since FDI has expanded more quickly for services than for goods and has increased faster than international trade in services (Eurostat 2015), the literature on FDI location choice has begun to turn toward the services sector. As with the manufacturing sector, some papers have first considered the investment determinants in the services sector.Footnote 2 However, few papers to date have addressed the question of the geographical choice of foreign firms in services: This is the case with the paper by Casi and Resmini (2014) that addresses the fundamental question of whether it is regions or countries that compete to attract foreign investments in the primary sector, as well as in the manufacturing and services sectors in the EU. This question is particularly relevant for services. While the EU is highly attractive for FDI in services and for very different countries, it is not a single block. It currently comprises 28 countries (at least until the UK leaves), which are very dissimilar in terms of demography, geography or per capita wealth. FDI is not evenly distributed throughout the EU: Some countries receive far more FDI than others. Understanding the reasons why multinationals prefer to invest in one place rather than another is very important for policymakers who believe that these firms can positively affect local economic development. Accordingly, if they want to attract FDI, they have to know what the main determinants are that guide investors’ location choices and what the best spatial scale for public policies is: national or regional. Is it the performance of a country as a whole that matters more to the foreign firm? Or is it the performance of a region with respect to the country? Or both? By performance, we mean here the ability of a country, resp. a region, to perform better than other countries, resp. regions within a country, in terms of the characteristics at stake (relative characteristics). As on the one hand, national policies have difficulties impelling employment growth and, on the other hand, significant European funds are spent on preventing uneven regional development, the answer to this question is very important. Our paper aims, then, to supplement the studies of the determinants of service FDI distribution across EU regions by Casi and Resmini (2014), Crescenzi et al. (2014) and Jones and Wren (2016)—which deliver contrasting results—by empirically exploring what it is that attracts service FDI. More specifically, we investigate the respective role of country and regional performances in determining location decisions concerning service FDI in the EU. This allows us to compare the spatial determinants of the location of service FDI with what we already know about those in the manufacturing sector. We add to the literature in three different ways. First, our study goes farther than previous studies of service location determinants as it provides a refined conception of services. We focus on private service activities within the secondary or tertiary sectors, where services can be an input for some activities (support services) or an output for others. This excludes the primary and the tertiary public sectors, which are specific and require separate analysis. It means that our unit of analysis is not the service sector but the service function, which allows us to encompass in the study service FDI by manufacturers (e.g., in R&D) and not just those by service providers. Moreover, among service providers, it is interesting to distinguish between those delivering services to other companies only (business services) and those supplying services to both households and business customers, since their location might be driven by different determinants. Second, our study contributes to improving the empirical literature on service FDI spatial determinants since it is based on a long period of time (1997–2012) thanks to the European Investment Monitor (EIM) database developed by Ernst and Young, which provides the exact location of each investment project and information on service FDI for different sectors in the EU-28. Third, we base our modeling strategy on a dynamic panel Poisson model, which enables us to deal explicitly with the count nature of the explained variable. Moreover, our long time period means we can include temporal autoregressive effects to account for inertia in location choices of service FDI. Some of our results are consistent with previous studies dealing with the spatial determinants of service FDI. In particular, they show, in line with Casi and Resmini (2014), that both country-level performances and regional ones are considered by foreign investors in service activities when making their location decisions. However, we point out that the interplay between regional and national determinants cannot be clearly established and may vary widely with the sectors in which service FDI is made by companies and also with the groups of countries. Thus, the business services sector is close neither to the industrial sector nor to the other services, whatever the kind of country, and cannot be considered as a single entity with respect to FDI location in services. A similar conclusion can be made regarding the location of a region within the EU: Depending on whether or not it belongs to the most attractive group of countries for service FDI, the combination of regional and national performances under consideration is not the same for investors. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the spatial determinants of FDI and on the methodological choices in studies dealing with such an issue. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 introduces the econometric methodology and provides a description of the status of the selected variables. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 highlights our main conclusions.",4

Cultural capital as a source of human capital: evidence from Italian regional data,February 2020,Alessandro Crociata,Iacopo Odoardi,Pier Luigi Sacco,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Whereas human capital is an intangible asset that takes a central role in contemporary economic theory, the same cannot be said of cultural capital. The role of education and skills acquisition in the generation of economic value is hard to deny and is now part of the conventional wisdom (Hanushek and Woessmann 2008). However, the idea that mere participation in cultural events contributes to economic value creation seems less obvious, and is certainly far less investigated. Generally, cultural participation is meant as a form of leisure, whose effect on economic value added is identified with direct expenditure in admission tickets and indirect expenditure in related activities such as outdoor dining, hotel stays, and purchase of souvenirs—that is, a component of aggregate demand (Heilbrun and Gray 2001; Bedate et al. 2004). Culture can also possibly work as a positive modifier of perceptual environmental dimensions such as city image (Richards and Wilson 2004) and amenity (Silver 2012), but again without any major supply-side effects. The view that confines cultural experiences to pure (albeit sophisticated) leisure is backed by influential neuroscientists such as Steven Pinker, who considers culture a sort of “cheesecake for the mind” (Pinker 1997). However, recent developments in cognitive psychology and neuroscience indicate that cultural experiences as common as reading a novel, or making music or simply listening to it, may have relevant effects on brain plasticity and consequently on cognitive function (Särkämo et al. 2016; Oatley 2016), with considerable adaptive value for various aspects of human cognition. Little of this debate, though, has migrated into the economics literature, where analyses of the economic consequences of “culture” generally refer to the differential impact of socio-ethnic backgrounds (Guiso et al. 2006). Recently, however, the issue of culture-led development has gained attention in the regional science discourse, sparking a growing literature on the so-called cultural turn (Amin and Thrift 2007), moving from the basic yet questioned assumption that the cultural and creative economy is a major force shaping knowledge-based economies and is conducive to sustainable regional development with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion (Pratt 2004; Scott 2004; Boix-Domenech and Soler-Marco 2017; Crociata et al. 2018). Fully deploying cultural/creative skills as a developmental driver for local economies is often problematic (Comunian et al. 2010, 2011) and calls for an adequate regulatory framework (Sacco and Crociata 2013). The purpose of this paper is to connect the two concepts of human and cultural capital by investigating the economic effects of cultural participation—and, consequently, of cultural capital—in terms of its impact on human capital.
 Our analysis takes place at the macro-regional level and is based upon Italian regional data. The regional focus is justified here, as the socio-economic contribution of human capital in relation to variables such as cultural capital is quite relevant at the local level, with marked territorial differences. An emphasis on human capital is found in many studies on economic growth, where the contribution of education and training at the regional level is well investigated (Gennaioli et al. 2013; Crespo Cuaresma et al. 2014), and connected to the role of educated workers (see Shapiro 2006, for the USA; Vandenbussche et al. 2006, for OECD countries). Theory and empirical evidence suggest that the multifaceted nature of human capital contributes to long-term regional economic performance (Crescenzi et al. 2016), partly explaining local divergences in economic growth patterns (Démurger 2001). Such differences are particularly important in the case of the Italian North–South dualism. In fact, the role and impact of education (Di Liberto 2008) and human capital endowment is far from homogeneous across Italian regional economies (Abramo et al. 2016). As for cultural capital, forms of production and consumption of cultural goods and experiences tend to be place specific (Scott 2000; Santagata 2002; Storper and Scott 2009), again reflecting significant differences at the regional scale. The regional dimension of culture relates to local collective learning processes. Cultural assets are the product of place-related knowledge and social exchange and may represent a key factor of smart specialization and local competitiveness. Individual learning processes are, consequently, place specific (and culturally driven) to a significant extent, and the corresponding individual actions reflect spatial relations among the places of exchange, production, and consumption of cultural goods and experiences. The spatial dimension of culture represents therefore a powerful vantage point to interpret both the territorial and the knowledge-related dimensions of local development (Mommaas 2004; Sacco et al. 2008; Russo and Van der Borg 2010). Local levels of cultural participation may have an educational valence (Sherman 2006), and vice versa human capital may play a role in both the imagination and appreciation of cultural goods and experiences (Towse 2006). This intuitive complementarity has never been really explored in the economics literature, though, also in view of the relatively marginal position of cultural economics in the current panorama of economic theory and applied economics. Cultural participation and its effects have practically no role as a developmental factor in mainstream economic thought. Only recently a few contributions have appeared. Bucci et al. (2014) present an endogenous growth model where cultural and human capital plays complementary roles as main growth drivers. Tramonte and Willms (2010) measure the impact of cultural capital on educational outcomes, by introducing an interesting operational definition of cultural capital and highlighting inter-country differences in the relative effects of its so-called relational and static forms (see below). The present paper sits somewhat at the crossroads between a traditional cultural economics approach to cultural capital (Throsby 1999), and the new stream of research that investigates the effects of cultural capital on non-cultural spheres such as health or the environment (Grossi et al. 2011; Sacco et al. 2012; Crociata et al. 2014, 2015; Quaglione et al. 2017). Our main research question is the following: does cultural capital, via cultural participation, affect the formation of human capital? To address it, we develop an empirical analysis based upon a two-stage least squares regressions on Italian regional data for the 2004–2014 period. Bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the Italian regions, we consider two macro-regions, namely North Central and South,Footnote 1 representing two relatively homogeneous contexts (Brida et al. 2014) with different social and economic characteristics. The Northern and Central areas are the most socio-economically developed of the country, whose richer regions have an average income almost twice as big as that of some Southern regions (see Odoardi and Muratore 2019). The North versus South divide reflects into local features that are well captured by a panel data analysis within a regional framework. We find that the relationship between cultural and human capital is significant but complex. There is an interesting parallel between the social criticalities affecting the impact of cultural participation upon well-being in low access contexts, as discussed in Tavano Blessi et al. (2016), and those negatively affecting the relationship between cultural and human capital. In contexts with low cultural participation, the latter turns out to be less beneficial on some individually and socially relevant dimensions. This result makes a case for cultural policies fostering higher levels of cultural participation, not as mere forms of audience development, but as social platforms for innovative educational, welfare or social cohesion policies (Sacco et al. 2018). Our contribution is therefore twofold: we expand the empirical literature on the educational effects of cultural capital and we contribute to the literature on the factors influencing human capital accumulation, focusing upon a relatively neglected one such as cultural participation. The paper is divided into six sections. Section 2 presents a brief discussion of some relevant literature. Section 3 presents and discusses the estimation methods and the econometric approach used in the analysis. Section 4 presents the data and a first descriptive analysis. Section 5 presents and discusses the main results. Section 6 concludes. A brief technical “Appendix” closes the paper.",9

However, in contrast to the findings of their pioneering empirical work, the magnitude of this inverse relationship seems to vary considerably across countries (see, e.g., Nijkamp and Poot 2005). Based on their empirical findings, Blanchflower and Oswald argued that the responsiveness of wages to local unemployment is not affected by differences in the labor market institutions of countries. However, later studies have shown that local wage responsiveness is contingent on labor market institutions. Indirect evidence is based on less elastic wage curves in countries with more centralized wage bargaining systems, such as those in Nordic countries (Albæk et al. 2000; Nijkamp and Poot 2005), and union workers (Card 1995; Barth et al. 2002), while more direct evidence is provided by studies illustrating that the slope of the wage curve changes based on the restructuring of the wage bargaining system and other labor market reforms (Devicienti et al. 2008; Cholezas and Kanellopoulos 2015; Daouli et al. 2017). Furthermore, prior studies provide evidence that the slope of the wage curve may vary across different regions of the same country. For instance, Turunen (1998) found that the size and significance of the wage curve slope of young workers vary across nine major geographical areas of the USA. Deller (2011) used cross-sectional regional data from the USA to show that wages are negatively related to local unemployment in some parts of the country, but in others, the wage–unemployment relationship is either positive or statistically nonsignificant. The within-country variation in wage curve estimates is somewhat puzzling: Because the local labor markets of a country typically share the same wage-setting mechanisms and other labor market institutions, the regional variation in the wage curve slopes calls for an explanation that relies on other factors. One potential explanation is provided by Longhi et al. (2006), who argued that within-country variation may arise from local monopsony power. Their reasoning relies on the assumption that the bargaining power of an employee is likely an increasing function of his or her outside job opportunities (i.e., job opportunities in firms other than the current firm). One important determinant of outside job opportunities is the employment conditions in the surrounding labor market. Due to higher mobility costs (job search, commuting and migration costs), job opportunities in distant locations are less relevant for the employee, and hence, the outside options are largely determined by the job opportunities in the local labor market. However, the job opportunities in the locality are partially contingent on the number of unemployed jobseekers as follows: An increase in the local unemployment level increases job competition and, consequently, reduces the outside job opportunities of the employees in the locality. Hence, a higher local unemployment level is likely to reduce the bargaining power of employees and decrease negotiated wages in high-unemployment regions. Outside job opportunities are typically also poorer in regions with a lower degree of economic agglomeration, such as in small cities and urban regions, because of the smaller number of potential employers. When employees have only a few (or, in the extreme case, none) potential alternative employers in the locality, their employers may have monopsony power over them, which they may take advantage of to negotiate lower wages. The monopsony power of employers is presumably particularly strong in remote low-agglomeration regions with high joblessness. Consequently, the wage curve relationship is more pronounced in these regions than in regions with a high concentration of firms and close proximity to neighboring regions. Using regional data from western Germany, Longhi et al. (2006) provided empirical evidence supporting the monopsony power hypothesis, which posits that the slope of the wage curve is larger in less agglomerated and more isolated regions. Consistent with the monopsony power hypothesis, other studies have illustrated that the magnitude of the wage curve relationship is contingent on the degree of urbanization, where the pay level is less responsive to local unemployment level in larger cities than in smaller cities and rural regions (Baltagi et al. 2012; Baltagi and Rokicki 2014). In this paper, we use worker-level panel data from Finland to test the monopsony power explanation of the variation in the regional wage curve. We argue that Finland provides an ideal case for analyzing local monopsony power because long distances between local labor markets create notable job mobility costs. Based on our results and conclusions reported by Solon et al. (1994), we argue that the use of regional aggregate data may partially explain why Longhi et al. (2006) found a more pronounced wage curve in less agglomerated regions. Solon and others argued that using aggregate data to analyze the cyclicality of (real) wages may introduce a composition bias, leading to the underestimation of the true procyclicality of wages. This composition bias arises when aggregate statistics fail to properly account for the changing composition of the workforce over the business cycle. If the size of the composition bias varies across regions with different degrees of economic agglomeration, using regional aggregate data to analyze within-country variation in wage curve slope may lead to incorrect conclusions. As discussed by Solon et al. (1994), a solution to the composition bias problem is to estimate worker-level wage regressions while including worker fixed effects. Thus, to account for composition bias in the analysis of regional variation in the wage curve relationship, we re-estimate the models estimated by Longhi et al. (2006) by using worker fixed effects specifications. Our results suggest that the greater responsiveness of the pay level to local unemployment conditions in less agglomerated regions disappears when we account for unobserved worker heterogeneity.",2
64.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,01 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-019-00968-1,New business location: how local characteristics influence individual location decision?,February 2020,Ismaëlh Cissé,Jean Dubé,Cédric Brunelle,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Since Schumpeter’s (1941) seminal work, the vital importance of new businesses (and especially small business) has been widely discussed in the literature, particularly in the context of the dynamics of local economic growth (Lee et al. 2004; Acs and Armington 2006; Glaeser et al. 2010a, b; Delgado et al. 2010; Andersson and Koster 2011; Qian et al. 2013). In fact, the creation of new businesses leads to job creation, stimulates wage growth and acts as a vector of innovation. As such, these newly created business influence productivity patterns and contribute to wealth creation, which is true for small-/medium-sized cities as well as large cities (Baumol 2002; Daunfeldt et al. 2013; Colombelli 2016; Audretsch et al. 2015). It is worth noting that the path to business creation is highly dependent on the regional context and the local characteristics (Karlsson and Dahlberg 2003; Müller 2016). From a theoretical perspective, early research in spatial economics explains the choice of a business location primarily by optimisation behaviour that involves either (1) minimising the costs of moving inputs and outputs or (2) minimising the production costs (including wages and capital), which results in maximising potential profit (Capello 2014). The emergence of the new economic geography (NEG) in the 1990s (Krugman 1991) and the literature on agglomeration economies (Marshall 1890; Jacobs 1969; Porter 1990) has widely discussed the key role played by spatial concentration in the location choice of economic activities and in the creation of new business (Rosenthal and Strange 2003, 2010; Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009; Artz et al. 2016; Capozza et al. 2018). There are multiple factors that affect the creation of new business within large cities or metropolitan areas. These include agglomeration economies, human capital and urban size, and they are primarily factors that favour urban development (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). For example, large cities act as “nursery cities” by attracting more entrepreneurs because of the local demand, and the need to experiment and learn new processes (Duranton and Puga 2001). It has long been recognised that the diversity and openness of a city attract more talent (human capital), which in turn stimulates creativity and innovation (Jacobs 1969). Yet, recent studies show the potential limits of agglomeration economies in terms of competition, congestion diseconomies, higher land rent and wages (see Sato et al. 2012; Plummer and Acs 2014). Few studies have investigated the instigation of development of sparsely populated regions using new firm creation and spatial concentration (Gaigné and Goffette-Nagot 2008; Renski 2008; Delfmann et al. 2014; Artz et al. 2016). Yet, it is worth noting that Silicon Valley, the well-known example of how spatial concentration may affect start-ups, was not located in such a densely populated area at first glance. Thus, there is reason to believe that in the main cities of sparsely populated areas, a natural spatial concentration of some economic activities also takes place as that occurring in large cities. Certainly, this phenomenon occurs to a lesser extent in the case of the main cities in sparsely populated areas than in large cities/metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, these main cities remain major players in the economic development of sparsely populated areas. This paper aims to study the location decisions of new business establishments in a sparsely populated area to investigate the role that the characteristics of their local economic environment play in such a pattern. To achieve such an aim, a discrete choice model based on local indicators (e.g. the relative concentration of economic activities) is developed to evaluate the role of such characteristics in the new business establishments’ location decision according to their main economic activity. Secondly, based on the estimation results, the probability that a new establishment in a given economic sector will be located in a given city, according to its size and its local characteristics, is calculated to investigate the type of business establishments that is more likely to locate in such cities. The case study is conducted on the Lower St. Lawrence (LSL) region, which is a sparsely populated area and a typical Canadian nonmetropolitan area in the province of Quebec. The analysis uses spatial establishment-level, micro-data, pooled over time (2008–2014) for new establishments that make their first appearance in the region. The conceptual framework is based on the theoretical economic model of random utility maximisation (RUM) (Alamá-Sabater et al. 2011; Dubé et al. 2016) which is pivoted on the concept that a given new establishment will decide to locate in a certain location that provides an optimum profit, i.e. where the maximisation of expected profits or the minimisation of cost is achieved (considering the characteristics of the local economic environment). A distance-based measures (DBM) method is used to build indicators that measure the spatial concentration of the establishments on a radius of 1250 m. The results of a multinomial logit model reveal that the location choice of new establishments is sector-specific and remains sensitive to the local environment. The location decisions of new establishments in the primary sector are predominantly dependent on the availability of space and natural benefits, which are usually more abundant in a rural area. The location decisions of new establishments in the service sectors are, on the other hand, strongly dependent on the proximity to main regional cities and intermediate demand. And finally, the choice of location of a new establishment in the manufacturing sector is mainly and positively influenced by co-location (specialisation) effects. The remainder of the paper is divided into six sections. The second section is a review of existing literature in order to formulate the hypotheses to be tested in the empirical application. The conceptual framework and methodology are presented in the third section. Fourth section presents the case study and describes the data and variables used in the model. The results are presented in the fifth section and are furtherly discussed in the sixth section. The conclusion offers a few insights on the paper’s main findings and their implications for future research in the seventh section.",11

Obviously, countries differ in terms of institutions, culture, stability, and so forth, which determine for a large part the international differences in economic performance. However, wealth and income are sometimes even more dispersed within countries than across countries. To illustrate this, Fig. 1 shows the dispersion of relative regional GDP per capital across European countries. Source: Own calculation based on Cambridge Econometrics (2015) GDP per capita across Europe in 2007—mean EU27 = 100. European income seems to be concentrated within large metropolitan areas (most notably—the capital cities) such as Paris, London, Luxembourg, Oslo, and Stockholm. Apart from this urban–rural divide, large differences are present as well between subnational regions. The most well-known example is the North–South division within Italy, but these differences can as well be noticed within almost all other countries in Europe. Most notable examples are Spain (North–South division as well), France (with a relatively poorer central area), the UK (where a North–South divide is, albeit less notable, visible as well), and Germany (with the former division between East Germany and West Germany). Thus, some regions within countries are significantly more successful than others—even when faced with similar national institutions. What makes these regions economically successful? This is perhaps the most crucial and complex research question for both regional policy makers and regional scientists to answer. Policy makers would like to have policies able to steer regions to success, and regional scientists are especially interested in the (nature of the) determinants that drive this success. At the heart, this research question deals with the absolute and relative location advantages of regions.Footnote 1 A strongly related research question deals with the exact nature of economic performance and how to measure it. To do so, endowment levels should be taken into account. In the economics literature, this can be reflected by the use of regional production functions (see, e.g. Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008; Basile et al. 2012). Given the size of production factors, such as labour and capital, regions should attain a certain production level, but usually produce suboptimal. The distance between the optimal and actual production level is usually measured by technical (in)efficiencies and, stochastically, modelled by a stochastic frontier approach. There is already a sizeable literature dealing with benchmarking regions using regional technical efficiencies modelled by a stochastic frontier approach (see, amongst others, Driffield and Munday 2001; Brock 1999; Puig-Junoy 2001; Puig-Junoy and Pinilla 2008; Alvarez 2007; Otsuka 2017).Footnote 2 This literature usually deals with the relative (sectoral) performance of regions, and this is the approach this paper takes as well. The production factors are then usually constituted of the aggregates of various forms of labour (high skilled and low skilled) and capital (both physical and human) within a region. However, taking only local endowments into account boils down to an absolute location approach: it does not matter where the region is located with respect to its neighbours. However, the relative location of the region matters as well as regions are intrinsically connected to each other in networks formed by trade, knowledge spillovers, commuting, and migration (Thissen et al. 2016). It is crucial to control for this spatial dependence as omitting it might lead to bias—at least in the estimation of technical efficiencies (Anselin 1988). The literature that combines spatial dependence and stochastic production frontiers is, although relatively recent, already sizeable. Most studies employ a parametric approach, and the enumeration that follows is definitely not conclusive. One of the first parametric studies was Barrios and Ladado (2010), who uses an iterative back-fitting algorithm to find consistent parameter estimates although they do not allow for correlation between the technical efficiency and spatial dependence structure. Pavlyuk (2010) uses as well a parametric approach, but does not report how he estimates consistently both the spatial dependence process and technical efficiencies. Fusco and Vidoli (2013) and Vidoli et al. (2016) separate out the error term in a spatial lag structure and technical efficiencies, with an application to the Italian wine sector. Kinfu and Sawhney (2015) apply a spatial stochastic frontier analysis to maternal care in India. Glass et al. (2013) decompose productivity growth using a spatial autoregressive model, whereafter Glass et al. (2016) extend the analysis to a spatial panel setting. Finally, Jiang et al. (2017) apply a fixed effects stochastic frontier model to energy efficiency in Chinese Provinces. In addition, there is a smaller literature that resorts to a Bayesian approach and simulation techniques, i.e. Schmidt et al. (2009), Areal et al. (2010), and Tsionas and Michaelides (2016). A specific feature that applies to most of the studies above is that they model the spatial dependence and efficiency processes separately (see, e.g. Fusco and Vidoli 2013). Then, as I will argue below, the error term is by definition multivariate as it is a combination of a normal and truncated normal distribution, where one of them or even both are multivariate due to the involved spatial correlation structure, which makes estimation cumbersome. In contrast, this study applies a alternative approach firmly rooted in the statistical literature. Using a relatively straightforward skew-normal distribution approach, I show how to combine a spatial error structure with a stochastic frontier model, that is, (1) straightforward to estimate, (2) able to combine spatial dependence and a frontier model in a single error term, and (3) produce consistent estimates. The latter is shown by a simulation study, where—although all parameters are consistent—it is clear that the parameter measuring technical inefficiencies is very inefficient (i.e. large standard errors) with small amounts of observations. Skew-normal distribution is not often applied in the econometric stochastic frontier literature with as notable exception Chen et al. (2014), although they are looking at fixed effects panel models instead of spatial dependence models. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces the concept of regional technical efficiencies and discusses some measurement issues. Consecutively, it treats the modelling (and its associated estimation) of technical efficiencies in two ways: a mainly econometric and a more statistical one.Footnote 3 The last subsection deals with the introduction of spatial dependence in stochastic production frontiers. Section 3 provides simulation results to indicate the performance of the proposed estimation methods, within small and realistic samples as usually encountered when benchmarking (European) regions. Section 4 provides an application of spatial stochastic frontier modelling and gives an estimation of the average technical efficiencies of European NUTS2 regions in the period 2000–2010. The last section concludes by indicate how in the proposed framework, more complex spatial dependence structures can be incorporated in stochastic frontier models. Estimation of these models, however, requires complex multivariate likelihood or simulation techniques.",4

It reached 75 million downloads (Android and iOS included) in only 19 days. One month later, the total number of downloads was more than 500 million. It was the most downloaded iOS application worldwide in 2016. During the Game Developers Conference held in San Francisco in March 2017, Niantic’s founder and chief technology officer revealed the game had been downloaded over 650 million times. In May 2018, the total number of downloads had reached 800 million, and the total number of monthly users was 147 million worldwide (the highest peak since the game’s launch).Footnote 2 The concept of this free-to-play game is to capture and collect virtual creatures called Pokémon with a cell phone. The player also has the ability to battle their own creatures with others in arenas, with the objective of becoming the arena master. The creatures may be placed anywhere in public locations such as streets, parks, and buildings. The player may observe their location on a local map before walking to certain places to capture the creature. Because creatures appear temporarily at a given location, they can be captured only during a limited time. It is important to note that capture by one player does not prevent another from capturing it as well. For this reason, creatures present the characteristics of a public good (i.e., non-rival and non-exclusive good). Catching Pokémon is one primary way players can progress in the game. Collecting the existing 488 creatures is one objective for players. In addition, when players collect creatures, they earn experience points (called “XP”) that permit them to make their creatures more powerful. The collection of Pokémon is made possible by using items, such as Poké Balls or incense (which catches or attracts them). These items are available in particular places called Pokéstops that players have to visit in order to obtain them.Footnote 3 These places are very useful to players because they permit them to receive items essential to capturing Pokémons, potions for healing them after battles in arenas, and even XP. Pokéstops also permit players to increase their chances of finding Pokémons, because the apparition frequency is higher in such places. As a result, a strong Pokéstop density in a territory is seen as an important advantage for players. For all these reasons, a Pokéstop might be considered as a recreational amenity for individuals (for those interested in the game) in the same way as a green space, a playground, or a sporting facility. Various empirical works have already shown access to public amenities such as parks and recreational facilities, and social and cultural services may be beneficial to a resident’s well-being and life satisfaction (Gidlöf-Gunnarsson and Öhrström 2007; Shields et al. 2009; Ambrey and Fleming 2014; Carrus et al. 2015, etc.). As a result, areas which include diversity and concentration of amenities are more likely to see important population growth and attract highly educated individuals (Hunter et al. 2005; Carlino and Saiz 2008; Frenkel et al. 2013). However, the geography of these various amenities reveals some disparities between and among territories (Neckerman et al. 2009; Dahman et al. 2010) that are often linked to socioeconomic characteristics of inhabitants (Moore et al. 2008; Billaudeau et al. 2011; Duncan et al. 2013, etc.). Even if Pokéstops represent a small subset of virtual recreational amenities among a variety of others, we want to assess their geography and determine whether correlations exist between their location and socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhoods where they are found. Indeed, in the USA, some newspaper articles and research papers have shown that there are more Pokéstops in White-majority neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods, and it has been strongly argued that the application has increased socio-spatial segregation.Footnote 4 In the French situation, no empirical research has been released. Only a Le Monde newspaper has shown that Pokéstops are more abundant in urban rather than rural areas, and that their location does not seem to be linked to income criteria.Footnote 5 If so, it is important to provide explanations of Pokéstops geography in French cities because if the phenomenon is associated with spatial inequalities, a better spatial distribution could have a positive effect on an individuals’ well-being. In addition, recent studies have shown Pokémon GO to have positive effects on the physical well-being of players (Althoff et al. 2016; Wong 2017) and a small yet positive effect on local businesses associated with it (Pamuru et al. 2018). Finally, as this particular recreational amenity might have consequences on life satisfaction, public health, or even economic activity, it seems necessary to highlight the underlying mechanisms involved in order to determine the positive policies or regulations. The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, we studied the spatial distribution of Pokéstops in neighborhoods in the whole French department of Loire-Atlantique and more specifically in the Nantes metropolis. Focusing on this large territory allows us to compare situations in large and small cities, but also in urban and rural areas. We used explanatory spatial data analysis (ESDA) to reveal spatial patterns of this particular amenity and the presence of local clusters, or spatial dependency phenomena. Secondly, we used spatial econometrics models to explain spatial disparities in the accessibility of Pokéstops. These models allow us to assess the role of various local characteristics of the observed geography, but also to consider problems of spatial autocorrelation and/or spatial heterogeneity. Results of our models reveal strong disparities between neighborhoods located in the Nantes metropolis and others. It appears that determinants of these observed disparities may vary according to whether an individual is located in a rural or urban area. Location of Pokéstops does not seem to be correlated with population characteristics, but rather with local amenities such as historical monuments, shops, or green spaces. The remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows: After presenting the potential links between access to amenities and well-being, the first section focuses on research analyzing the role of a neighborhoods’ socioeconomic composition. We also review recent publications that study the impact of Pokémon GO on its users and on local business. The second section describes the data and variables retained for the analysis. The third section presents results of the ESDA and descriptive statistics for the department of Loire-Atlantique. The fourth section describes the estimation strategy, and the final section describes the results of our different models.",2

Most analysts agree that Brexit will have momentous consequences for the UK and (remaining) EU economies, but there is very minimal analysis at the regional scale, and analysis typically fails to account for interconnectivity at the regional level. Some regional impact studies have been carried out by Dhingra et al. (2017a, b), Los et al. (2017) and McCann (2018), and the current paper complements or contrasts with this research by applying a state-of-the-art dynamic spatial panel data model, in which a pan-European approach is adopted involving the majority of EU regionsFootnote 1 and all UK regions. This modelling approach is ideally suited to capturing the impact of spatial interconnectivity of the European regions and projecting the long-run consequences of Brexit across EU and UK regions, thus enabling comparison of the impact on both sides of the Channel and the Irish Sea. To this end, we use the dynamic spatial panel data model and prediction equation recently introduced into the literature by Baltagi et al. (2018) and applied in different contexts by Fingleton et al. (2018) and Fingleton and Szumilo (2019). The model assumes that employment in a given region depends on the levels of production and investment within that region, as shown in the basic economic model which underpins the estimating equation, and it also depends on demand coming from all the regions of the EU and UK, as determined by interregional trade flows. Additionally, the model proposes that employment levels in any regional are closely linked to employment levels in the region in the previous period and on employment levels in trade-connected EU and UK regions in the previous period. Following this literature, a rational basis for the presence of spatial and temporal lags is introduced which more typically is ad hoc in the spatial econometrics literature. In addition, the model takes account of unobserved factors which also affect the level of employment. These are captured by region-specific random effects which are also spatially interdependent. An additional feature of the approach adopted is the way in which endogeneity is handled, with the application of internal instruments in the spirit of Arellano and Bond (1991), thus eliminating the often difficult search for valid external instruments. The focus of analysis is the so-called job-shortfall which could arise due to Brexit. In other words, the intention is not to forecast what happens to the actual levels of employment in each region, which would be the predicted change in the number of jobs, but to simulate what the impact of Brexit would be assuming no consequential responses such as jobs created by new trade links formed post-Brexit, changes to the UK’s competitivity and consequences for demand and employment due to changes in exchange rates and prices, changes to migration flows in and out of the UK, changes in the competitivity of firms if trade barriers are increased and regulations relaxed, and possible changes in levels of inward and outward investment and capital stock if capital relocates. Contemplating these and other possible consequences enhance uncertainty regarding what might be the actual change in the levels of employment in the UK regions, so in this paper the focus is on attempting to simulate the job-shortfall due to Brexit per se. Stated more explicitly, the empirical analysis bases the spatial interdependence of levels of employment across different regions on how closely they are connected in terms of trade. We assume that employment levels partly reflect demand for a given region’s good and services coming from the UK and EU regions. Naturally, since about \(50\%\) of the UK’s trade in 2019 is with countries outside the EU, demand coming from these non-EU countries will also affect the levels of employment. For both UK and EU regions generally, we assume that the non-EU component of demand is reflected by the levels of production and investment within each region. In this way, we have attempted to isolate the impact of reduced trade between UK and EU regions from the potential effects of changes in non-EU trade on employment. In the simulations, the non-EU trade flows and hence capital and output are assumed to remain at the same level as previously, thus leading to our focus on job-shortfall rather than job-loss or job-gain. Moreover, in an effort to make the simulations robust, simplifying assumptions are made regarding the impact of Brexit on trade flows between individual UK and EU regions, leading to a geography of the Brexit impact that is immune to changes in the actual level of assumed trade. More specifically, estimates are made of employment levels across \(N=255\) EU regions both with and without Brexit. The explicit drivers of employment are output and capital, which are approximated by Gross Value Added (GVA) and a function of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), respectively. Estimation is based on a viable data series over the period from 2001 to 2010. Data for 2011 and 2012 are not used in estimation but held for one- and two-step ahead prediction. Different assumptions can be made about post-2011 paths for GVA and GFCF, given that accessible data with the same geography are not available over the more recent period, although it has been found that these have relatively little effect on outcomes. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, the model is outlined, and the data described in Sect. 3. Section 4 summarizes the estimator, and Sect. 5 the resulting estimates. Section 6 focuses on prediction methodology, and Sect. 7 gives details of the method for simulating the Brexit effect. Section 8 gives the simulation results, and Sect. 9 concludes. The “Appendices” section give the theoretical basis of the estimating equation, provide details of the outcomes from alternative estimators, and summarize the Chow–Lin approach to obtaining an interregional connectivity matrix. The last section lists the references.",7

Nazarczuk,Stanisław Umiński,Tomasz Brodzicki,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The location of the economic activity has been subject to numerous theoretical and empirical analyses; however, the inquiry into the spatial distribution of exporters is a relatively new thread. The growing openness made the knowledge on the nature of the nexus between regional and foreign markets important for several reasons: the region’s vulnerability (sensitivity), particularly as regards the labour market performance; the assessment of competitiveness and—last but not least—the imperative of implementing efficient policies aimed at attracting the most competitive, productive and export-oriented firms. An increase in exports is often perceived as one of the principal goals of the economic policy, as part of the activities aiming to improve the internationalisation of regions. Spatial distribution of the exporters has been subject to infrequent scientific inquiry. Rodríguez-Pose et al. (2013), by concentrating on firm-level and regional features, have acknowledged the role of foreign ownership in the extensive margin of exports. Farole and Winkler (2014) have shown that firm-level characteristics are more important for exporting in non-core regions, while regional characteristics matter more in core regions. Cassey et al. (2016), Koenig (2009) and Koenig et al. (2010) have undertaken another aspect of exporters’ location, which is destination-specific externalities. According to their findings, exporters co-locate in order to reduce costs and share the risk. Greenaway and Kneller (2008) have investigated whether the co-location of exporters takes place in the same region or industry. The ownership characteristics seem to be a neglected aspect of exporting firms in prior research. Our approach supplements the above literature by directly comparing locational criteria of FOEs versus DOEs. To fill this gap, the heterogeneity concept is used with respect to both regions and firms. Regional heterogeneity is strongly determined by path dependency since the investment conditions in regions are influenced by path-dependently inherited business and entrepreneurial culture, infrastructure and quality of institutions. According to Mayer and Ottaviano (2008), the extensive margin of exports (number of exporters) should be increased in order to boost regional export base. An extensive margin has its regional dimension, given that exports do not come from an “undefined economic space”, but from concrete locations. Heterogeneous firms (Melitz 2003) locate in dissimilar regions. Foreign ownership constitutes another dimension of firms’ heterogeneity. Foreign-owned entities possess advantages, stemming from ownership (Dunning and Lundan 2014), experience in conducting activity globally, access to distributions networks and greater possibilities to internalise transactions. They are significantly more likely to export (Mayer and Ottaviano 2008). Their superior export position mainly stems from higher productivity, which according to Melitz (2003) is a driver of extensive margin of exports. The present study identifies the differences between the determinants of the spatial location of FOEs and DOEs, in particular the role of metropolis, the proximity to infrastructure and the consequences of historical factors (path dependency). The analysis is performed for the case of Polish local administrative units (LAU 1) observed over a number of years. The three hypotheses that have been formulated relate to the differences between FOEs and DOEs in locational preferences as regards the role of metropolis, infrastructure endowment and the role of path dependency: Agglomeration externalities, in the vicinity of metropolis and metropolitan areas, play a greater role in FOEs’ location decisions than in the case of DOEs. The proximity to infrastructure is more important in the locational decisions of FOEs, compared to DOEs. The observed differences in the present distribution of FOEs versus DOEs are to a large extent path dependent. Poland is an interesting case study as one of the largest transition states with significant regional heterogeneity that underwent two exogenous shocks related to economic transition itself followed by accession into the EU which affected its trade policy, trade intensity and directions as well as its economic structure and composition. The role of foreign ownership in the economy of Poland has significantly increased. The remainder of the paper is constructed as follows. The following section reviews the literature on the spatial agglomeration of exporters and formulates the hypotheses. Section 3 discusses the utilised data and methods and presents our empirical strategy. Section 4 establishes the most important stylised facts and presents and discusses the econometric results. The final section concludes the paper.",7

Location optimisation within and between Polish metropolitan areas,June 2020,Federica Rossi,Magdalena Dej,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Starting from the work by Laundhart (1885) up to the present day (Morkutė and Koster 2018; Mack and Wei 2018), the regional economics literature has produced numerous contributions on the locational patterns of firms. The current paper aims at evaluating firms relocation factors in post-socialist countries. In particular, we empirically investigate the destination choice of relocating firms at local level, by looking at the case of Polish metropolitan areas. Business relocation is associated with high impacts on the economy at the local, regional and global levels (McCann 2001). There is a flourishing strand of literature that concentrates on delocalisation at a global scale, focusing on various types of foreign direct investments (FDI) and on the diffusion of multinational corporation’s plants among countries (Lampón et al. 2015; Johansson and Olhager 2018a, b). The post-socialist countries also received attention in this debate (Meardi et al. 2009; Sass and Hunya 2014; Duboz et al. 2016). Firm relocation at the local/regional level is less frequently studied. However, finer spatial scales are particularly interesting in terms of different development among regions and in terms of real effects on local communities. Some recent works analyse firm relocation choices in the Netherlands (van Dijk and Pellenbarg 2000; Weterings and Knoben 2013; Kronenberg 2013; Morkutė and Koster 2018), in Switzerland (Bodenmann and Axhausen 2012), in the USA (Maryland state, Targa et al. 2006; De Prijcker et al. 2017; Mack and Wei 2018) and in Canada (city of Hamilton, Maoh and Kanaroglou 2007). Only a few studies based on empirical research at the individual firm level in post-socialist countries have been carried out. Indeed, in many countries, including Poland, official statistics concerning the scale of the relocation processes do not exist and gathering empirical data on relocation of firms is extremely time-consuming: this represents one of the main barrier for the analysis of the phenomenon. Concerning location choices of firms and destination decisions of relocating companies at local level, Poland represents a particular example, which deserves to be studied. Since 1990, when the economic liberalisation process started, Poland’s economy has quickly grown, with a peak in the GDP growth rate of 7% in 1995 and in 2007. Moreover, since joining the European Union in 2004, Poland has experienced increased interest from foreign companies seeking to invest in the country, in particular from Germany. The literature has focused on this theme and has produce a consistent empirical evidence on the international relocation processes of multinational companies, highlighting that the inflows of foreign direct investments are principally directed to the core cities of metropolitan areas. The 2018 report by the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology of PolandFootnote 1 indicates that in 2003 there were, on average, four firms with foreign capital per 10,000 residents in the country, while by 2016 this number had increased to significantly more than six. The process was particularly intense in the metropolitan areas. In particular, Mazowieckie Province, which includes Warsaw, was the foreign investment leader both in 2003 and 2016 (respectively, almost 10 firms per 10,000 residents and slightly more than 18 firms per 10,000 residents). In 2003, the total number of firms with foreign capital in Poland equalled about 15,000, employing about one million workers. By 2016, this number had increased to 26,000 firms with an employment level of 1.9 million workers. Moreover, Cieslik (2005a, b) highlighted the significant effect of the national border on the location of foreign firms. This dynamic business climate makes Polish metropolitan areas an interesting case study of location and relocation of companies (Dej 2015).
 As described above, previous studies took into account the national and the regional context of international firms’ relocation (Domański 2003; Pavlinek et al. 2009; Kapitsinis 2018). However, what about the local relocation within the country? Where do the firms already located in the territory (both foreign and native) go? Do they move within the core cities or to peripheral municipalities of metropolitan areas? Are the relocation dynamics in Polish metropolitan areas the same of the Western European countries? The paper aims at answering to these questions, focusing on firms located in five Polish metropolitan areas: Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz, Wroclaw and Poznan. These regions are selected for two main reasons: a practical one and a theoretical one. First, an official register on firms’ relocation does not exist in Polish public statistics. Therefore, we needed to circumscribe the study area, since it was impossible for us collecting individual data on all firms located in every Polish municipality. Moreover, we decided to focus our attention on metropolitan areas, since they are unique in terms of economic growth rate and economic process in general. Indeed, the economic processes have the greatest intensity in these types of geographical entities and there is a high concentration of companies. These areas are characterised by a high potential for innovation and play the role of strategic nodes, attracting both foreign and local investments (Domański 2003; Smętkowski et al. 2009b). Previous studies concentrate on the examination of new establishments’ location choices within metropolitan areas, since these territorial units are characterised by the most advantageous conditions for technological change, agglomeration economies and quality of life (Frenkel 2001; Arauzo-Carod and Viladecans-Marsal 2009; Hou 2016). However, as suggested by Pellenbarg (2010, p.41), “More research should be targeted to aspects of firm migration like relocation and firm performance, relocation and firm networks, relocation and satisfaction, relocation within cities”. Indeed, relocation processes within and among metropolitan areas were less studied. Only a recent work by Mack and Wei (2018) studies the similarities and the differences in the relocation behaviour of locally oriented and out-of-state businesses within the Phoenix metropolitan area in the USA. An issue to consider is why firms would undertake a costly relocation within or among metropolitan areas rather than move to municipalities outside metropolitan areas, in which production costs (e.g. salaries, real estates, etc.) are lower. If we consider that firms constantly monitor market competitiveness and compare their current location with others within metropolitan areas, relocation can be seen as part of a “location optimisation” process in order to improve their position in the market. As suggested by Pellenbarg et al. (2002), firm relocation could be defined as a particular form of locational adjustment to changes in markets, environmental regulations and technological progress. We can distinguish two forms of relocation: complete and partial migration. The first one implies the movement of an establishment from address A to address B; while, the partial relocation consists of setting up a new local unit, linked to the pre-existing one; it can be seen as a spatial expansion (Brouwer et al. 2004). In this paper, we take into account only complete relocation.Footnote 2 The paper is organised as follows: the next section presents an overview of the literature on firms’ relocation. The third section is dedicated to the description of the data, followed by the empirical strategy used. The fifth part highlights the main results and a brief discussion of them. Finally, some conclusions and future research ideas are presented.",6

Evidence from Barcelona, Lyon and Hamburg",June 2020,Carles Méndez-Ortega,Josep-Maria Arauzo-Carod,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Nowadays, the location patterns of firms in high-tech industries are receiving increasing attention by both academics and policy makers. This interest can be easily explained because, in developed and emerging countries, these activities are growing faster than national average and, consequently, new firms and jobs are being created. Nevertheless, these industries do represent not only an important source of economic growth through firms and jobs, but also a key challenge for the competitiveness of the areas generating and attracting high-tech firms. These high-tech industries contribute strongly to higher growth (markets tend to expand), they demand skilled labour, do not imply intensive land consumption and do not generate negative environmental effects (Berger and Frey 2016). There is extensive evidence of the importance of young skilled professionals such as computer programmers or software engineers, for high-tech firms (Autor et al. 2003). In summary, a greater specialisation in these industries is a desirable outcome for most of economies that can satisfy the locational requirements of these firms (but it is important to note that not all potential sites may be suitable). Broadly speaking, worldwide empirical evidence shows that such firms prefer areas with accessibility to the skilled workforce and dense network of high-tech firms (Baptista and Mendonça 2010) that typically correspond to urban environments and, more specifically, the cores of large metropolitan areas (Van Geenhuizen 2007). This location behaviour does not respond only to some kind of path dependence, but to the fact that knowledge spillovers are a key input for them and that these tend to cluster at urban cores. Despite of the relevance of high-tech industries as a whole, this paper focuses on a specific subgroup which has experienced a very dynamic trend in recent years and is hypothesised to continue this growth in a similar way over the next few years.Footnote 1 We refer to software and videogames (hereafter SVE) industries, which currently benefit from extremely high growth rates, contribute to myriads of new firms, hire very many of skilled engineers and tend to locate at urban cores (Lorenzen and Frederiksen 2008). Concretely, in 2010, SVEs represented 5.4% of world GDP (Dutta and Mia 2010). In addition to their high-tech profile, SVEs are considered to be amongst the creative industries, which are defined as those economic activities that use creativity as one of the main inputs and that provide tangible (or intangible) goods or services that may generate revenues from trade and/or intellectual property (UNCTAD 2010). In terms of the location patterns of creative industries, empirical evidence highlights their strong preference for the central areas of larger cities (Coll-Martínez et al. 2019). We selected three major European cities, Barcelona, Lyon and Hamburg, together with their metropolitan areas, as case study. These cities are of a similar size, share a common manufacturing heritage, are not capital cities and have put in place relevant city strategies which attempt to orientate economic activities around technology, mostly through ambitious urban renewal policiesFootnote 2 which have transformed previously low-income neighbourhoods into magnets of knowledge and economic activity generation, based on the attraction of high-tech firms and the endogenous development of local firms. The main aim of this paper is to explain how video games and software firms locate in urban areas, focusing on (i) their materialised preferences in terms of central versus peripheral locations and considering the role played by urban renewal projects and (ii) the agglomeration strategies of these firms (i.e. whether SVE’s firms tend to be located close to firms in the same industry or close to other creative industries). Our assumption is that, in addition to industry-specific characteristics that determine some external requirements by these firms (such as accessibility to skilled labour or specialised IT suppliers), there are some city-specific characteristics (e.g. urban policies, spatial distribution of economic activity) that also matter, and which shape the location decisions taken by these firms. However, due to space constraints, this analysis is outside the scope of the current paper. The novelty of the paper arises from its double dimension: (i) the spatial dimension, three different cities and metropolitan areas being considered in order to check whether agglomeration processes at industry level were shaped by urban specificities, and (ii) the technical dimension, four different methodologies (nearest neighbour index, Kernel densities, K-density functions and entropy index) being used, which jointly provide a better picture of location patterns. Our main results show that SVEs have clustered in and around the urban cores of these cities, in a process that has attracted many related activities, such as technical events (e.g. professional exhibitions, gaming conventions) and education programs at local universities. Interestingly, despite their similarities, these cities have some differences in location patterns. Although SVEs locate in the central areas of all three cities, the intensity of centralisation varies, firms in Hamburg being strongly agglomerated into central areas, a phenomenon which is weaker for Barcelona and especially so for Lyon. In all three areas, SVEs co-locate close to firms belonging to other creative industries as Radio and TV, and Video and film industries. Although the reasons behind that co-location are beyond the scope of this paper and are left for future research, it is reasonable to assume that there are not only shared location patterns amongst SVEs and firms from these industries, but also inter-industry linkages favouring spatial proximity.Footnote 3 The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews (i) the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of a firm’s location, focusing on the importance of this industry for these cities, and (ii) the case of Barcelona, Lyon and Hamburg from an historical and urban renewal strategic point of view. Section 3 describes the data and methodology. Section 4 introduces some descriptive statistics and discusses results and, finally, Sect. 5 presents the main conclusions.",7

Javier Casado-Izaga,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In cities all around the world, zoning regulations set the uses to which land in a municipality may be put, e.g., residential, commercial, light or heavy industrial, recreational, and farming. Zoning design is concerned, among other issues, with the health and safety of residents and with so-called fiscal zoning.Footnote 1 Due to negative externalities for the population of towns, heavy industry and some commercial activities are kept apart from residential and educational areas. However, light industry and commercial activities with few or no negative externalities may share space with some residential areas. This paper focuses on a subject that, to the best of our knowledge, has received little attention from the literature on zoning: How does partial ownership of local and neighboring firms affect the optimal zoning design of a municipality when zoning is used strategically? The literature on zoning has applied location models to analyze the effect of zoning city lands on firms’ profits, consumer surplus, consumers’ transportation costs, and social welfare.Footnote 2 For example, Lai and Tsai (2004) study asymmetric zoning: The left-hand part of a linear city is exclusively residential. Their zoning proposal may reduce the distortion in the total transportation costs of consumers and enhance social welfare. Chen and Lai (2008) study symmetric central zoning under spatial Cournot competition and show that zoning regulation can improve social welfare. Colombo (2012) analyzes a spatial non-discriminatory Cournot duopoly with a central zoning area that may be asymmetric. Finally, Bárcena-Ruiz et al. (2016) study an unconstrained duopoly where firms set mill prices. A regulator biased toward consumers allows the two firms to locate in a central area of the city, while a regulator highly concerned about firms restricts them to locations outside the city boundaries.Footnote 3 The papers cited above analyze the zoning design of a single city, but they do not study zoning of neighboring towns. Empirical evidence highlights the need to analyze the strategic interaction between local governments in neighboring towns. Evidence of the strategic use of zoning is found in towns located in the same country. Henninger (2015) states that regional shopping centers attract residents and sales tax revenue from neighboring cities.Footnote 4 Municipalities are widely observed to encourage the location of shopping centers near or well connected with their borders to attract foreign consumers. There is evidence of Norwegians going shopping to Sweden (Lorentzon 2011; Löfgren 2008). Similar evidence is found on the Dutch-German border (Spierings and van der Velde 2013), on the frontier between Mexico and the USA (Sullivan et al. 2012), and on that between Canada and the USA (Timothy and Butler 2005). Towns are run by city councils which are concerned with local welfare, so they may use zoning to push domestic firms, which have to observe urban planning regulations, into locating in specific zones of the town. This may increase local welfare, e.g., due to direct and indirect local employment, local tax collection, and spending by shoppers on travel and meals. As a result, the use of zoning in neighboring towns may have a strategic purpose. With regard to this issue, Bárcena-Ruiz and Casado-Izaga (2017, 2018) analyze the use of zoning as a strategic device for capturing economic rents from neighboring consumers and preserving local rents. Bárcena-Ruiz and Casado-Izaga (2018) study the use of zoning as a strategic device by the regulators of two adjacent towns that form a linear city. Each town is composed of a residential area and its surroundings, which have no residential use but where firms may locate. They consider that zoning costs are meaningful and show that both regulators zone their towns when the fixed zoning cost is low enough and decline to zone when it is very high.Footnote 5 Two symmetric equilibria coexist when the zoning costs take intermediate values. Bárcena-Ruiz and Casado-Izaga (2017) study the regulators’ incentives to zone two adjacent towns when firms can only locate in the residential area. In this setting, an equilibrium in which only one regulator zones its town emerges for intermediate values of the fixed zoning cost. The zoning regulations forbid the local firm to locate very far from the consumers of the neighboring town.Footnote 6 However, this literature has not considered how the nationality of the owners of the firms affects zoning decisions by regulators. The literature on zoning mainly considers competition between domestic firms. However, in the economic literature, it is well known that the nationality of firms plays a crucial role.Footnote 7 The partial ownership of a local firm by foreign investors may condition the regulators’ incentives to zone their towns and the optimal design of zoning. Cato and Matsumura (2017) mention other models in which “whether the private firm is domestic or foreign often yields contrasting results in the literature on mixed oligopolies. See Corneo and Jeanne (1994), Fjell and Pal (1996), Pal and White (1998), Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2005a, b), Heywood and Ye (2009), and  Lin and Matsumura (2012).” In our model, welfare comprises the surplus of domestic consumers and the profits obtained by local investors in both towns. As a result, who owns the competing firms is a relevant issue to keep in mind when designing optimal zoning. There is empirical evidence of foreign ownership of firms located in neighboring towns or countries. A 2003 research report called Foreign Investment: U.S. Border Towns,Footnote 8 points out that “Since the creation of NAFTA, cities located along the northern and southern borders of the United States have developed relationships with sister cities in Canada and Mexico, making free-trade across the border even easier.” It also argues that “NAFTA, which has created a powerful free-trade zone among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, has led to the establishment of some ‘sister-city’ relationships along the borders.” With regard to foreign investment, the report states that “Much of this foreign direct investment is concentrated in our neighbors to the north and south, Canada and Mexico.” Salcedo (2003) provides further evidence and points out that the structure of ownership of malls differs from one country to another. For example, malls in Eastern Europe are completely foreign-owned (partly by western European investors), but malls of the middle East are mainly domestically owned. In Argentina investment came from a neighboring country: Chile. Chilean mall developers are also active in other countries of South America.Footnote 9 This paper considers a linear city composed of two adjacent towns whose land is for residential use. Each town has a regulator which maximizes local welfare, which comprises the local consumer surplus and the profits obtained by local investors. We assume that in each town a percentage \(\alpha\) of the local firm is owned by local investors and the rest is owned by investors from the neighboring town. Local authorities are able to regulate the location of the firms within their towns, but prices are freely decided by the two firms. To maintain a structure of analysis close to the duopoly models analyzed in the seminal papers, we consider that only one firm operates in each town, though they can sell their products in both markets. Each regulator decides whether to zone its town or not, and zoning does not entail a fixed cost. In each town zoning may be used to achieve the optimal location of the local firm by limiting some urban area to residential use only. We consider that zoning defines two different areas: an area in which firms and consumers may share the same locations (both commercial and residential uses) and an exclusively residential area. Our results show that the incentives to zone one town, and the zoning constraints when applied, crucially depend on the percentage of the local firm owned by local investors. When it is high enough, both regulators zone their towns to push the local firm toward the frontier with the other market in order to gain some foreign consumers and to reduce local consumers’ transportation costs. So zoning constraints forbid the local firm to locate very far from its rival. For intermediate values of the percentage of the local firm owned by local residents, an asymmetric result emerges. In this case only one regulator resorts to zoning despite the symmetry in the percentage of ownership of the neighboring firms. This asymmetric result has been obtained before in the literature in a model of the same nature when only local profits matter, under the assumption that fixed zoning costs are meaningful (Bárcena-Ruiz and Casado-Izaga 2017). In this paper we do not consider fixed zoning costs, so the asymmetric result arises because foreign profits are significant.Footnote 10 Thus, it may not be attractive to zone the town when the rival does so, because then intense competition erodes the profits obtained by the firm from the other town. This plays an important role when the equilibrium involves zoning in one town only and the regulator which does not zone its town obtains higher social welfare than the other because foreign profits are substantial in comparison with local profits. Finally, for a low enough weight of local profits, all possible equilibrium configurations, applying zoning or declining to zone in each town, are possible because the objectives of the regulator and the firms are not in conflict. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 studies the regulators’ incentives to zone their towns or not. Section 4 focuses on some extensions of the model, and Sect. 5 draws conclusions.",3

The latter phenomenon is clearly influenced by long-term sectoral changes and may result either from an employment shift among activity sectors or from differential growth in labour productivity. In the neoclassical model of convergence, the sectoral structure is considered a factor of negligible importance; however, in the current literature on the subject it is usually included in the equations to be addressed (Paci and Pigliaru 1997), and many theoretical models suggest that economies specialising in high-technology sectors achieve greater increases in productivity (Lucas 1988). In this case, regional growth would be influenced not only by the initial situation of disparity but also by differences in sectoral structures, factor endowments, institutions, etc. (O’Leary and Webber 2015). In the same vein, various studies have reported that the unequal distribution of labour productivity may be related to significant differences at the sectoral level (Ezcurra et al. 2005). For example, the industry sector’s greater capacity to incorporate technological progress usually results in higher rates of productivity increase, which not only benefits this sector, but also generates positive externalities through increased efficiency, boosting the whole economy and strengthening growth (Grossman and Helpman 1993). In view of the key role played by the industry sector in technological change and in increasing productivity and income (Maroto-Sánchez 2010), together with the remarkable growth of the service sector in recent years and the productivity gains achieved in this area, we believe it useful to analyse the impact made by all branches of activity on productivity growth. Following the adhesion of Spain and Portugal to the European Union, their markets have become increasingly integrated (Manuel and Royo 2004; Castillo et al. 1998; Barrios and De Lucio 2003). However, notable differences persist in terms of labour productivity (Bover et al. 2000) and the economic performance of these two countries diverged between 2000 and 2007, due to differences in macroeconomic policy stability, educational attainment, fiscal consolidation and the erosion of their comparative advantage (Royo 2010). Throughout the EU, in fact, the expected convergence in productivity among Member States has not occurred, and the divergence between Portugal and Spain is a clear manifestation of this fact. While Portugal has experienced a major slowdown in productivity growth (Alves 2017), in Spain it has risen steadily since the outbreak of the financial and economic crisis in 2008. According to Puig and Sánchez (2018), certain elements are still preventing productivity from growing more markedly, in both countries, such as an overreliance on temporary workers, the persistence of wage structure rigidities, the presence of a high concentration of export-driven firms and the generally small size of companies. In the regions of Spain and Portugal (henceforth, Iberian regions), considerable differences remain in labour productivity, between regions and between sectors. Descriptive non-spatial analyses of recent developments in labour productivity have revealed disparities between Spanish regions (Ramos et al. 2010; Gómez-Antonio and Fingleton 2012; Buendía Azorín et al. 2015) and also between Portuguese regions (Ferreira-Dias and Silva 2004; Duarte et al. 2013; Peres Lopes 2004). These differences in productivity within the Iberian regions have been accounted for by reference to the role played by conditional factors such as the spatial component (Melchor-Ferrer 2018; Viegas and Antunes 2013) and the sectoral structure (da Silva 2011). By breaking down the structure of productivity growth in Spain, Portugal and the Iberian regions as a whole, taking into account the productive structure in each case, this paper analyses and characterises the underlying factors in each territory. In order to determine the impact of sectoral changes in this area, we examine the main features of labour productivity growth, sector by sector, within the Iberian regions during the study period (2000–2015). Shift-share techniques are applied to identify the strongest explanatory component of regional productivity growth, and the existence or otherwise of spatial autocorrelation is ascertained. If it is present, the components must be disaggregated at the sectoral level to identify the contribution made by each one to overall labour productivity growth. To this end, various spatial models are created, in which the explanatory variables are the sectoral component for six activity branches. Moreover, given the differential characteristics of Spanish and Portuguese regions, a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the explanatory power of the sectoral components in each case. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: section two describes the study method employed, focusing on the use of shift-share analysis to disaggregate productivity growth into its components, sector by sector. Because spatial autocorrelation may be present, a spatial component must be included in the model. The fundamental purpose of this analysis is to detect the main explanatory component and the presence (if any) of spatial autocorrelation and thus determine the contribution made to productivity growth by each sectoral component, and to identify any spatial feedbacks that may be generated in this process. In section three, the study variables, data sources and model specification are defined. This information is then used to conduct an exploratory spatial data analysis of labour productivity in the Iberian regions, to determine whether this variable is randomly distributed within the territory and to identify regional clusters of high and low productivity. In section four, an analytical model is constructed, using panel data regression for the clusters. From this model, the contribution made by the intra-sectoral component, for six activity sectors, is determined and the differences between the three regional groups are observed. In addition, the direct, indirect and total impact of each component on productivity growth is measured. The final section presents a summary of the main conclusions drawn.",6

One of the most significant issues is regional level matching efficiency, that is, how efficiently job seekers match with vacancies. Some studies find evidence of regional disparities in matching efficiencies by estimating the matching function, which represents the number of matches is determined by the numbers of unemployed job seekers and vacancies (Petrongolo and Pissarides 2001). Coles and Smith (1996) find that some regional demographic factors significantly affect the number of matches in their matching function, suggesting that matching efficiencies vary across regions, depending on the conditions in local labor markets. Indeed, Kano and Ohta (2005) explicitly reveal that matching efficiencies exhibit regional heterogeneity in Japan. They show that regional population density affects matching efficiencies. The data or specifications of these studies provide analyses under the assumption that regional matching efficiencies are static. In terms of the dynamic dimension, Ibourk et al. (2004) and Fahr and Sunde (2006) find that the regional heterogeneity of matching efficiencies is quite stable over time as well as that regional demographic factors affect the regional heterogeneity of matching efficiencies. Here, based on one stream of the literature, we can suppose that the regional heterogeneity of matching efficiencies could vary over time when exogenous shocks happen, although they do not focus on the regional dimension. Petrongolo (2001) and Sasaki et al. (2013) show that composition of unemployment determines matching efficiencies. Another study focuses on the relationship between exogenous shock and matching efficiencies. In the case of nationwide overall shock, Barnichon and Figura (2015) verify that the negative labor demand shock of the Great Recession deteriorated the matching efficiency in the USA through a composition change in unemployment with different search intensities. With regard to the effects of region-specific exogenous shocks on local labor markets, Belasen and Polachek (2009) reveal that in Florida, earnings increase in the regions directly damaged by hurricanes because out-migration, stemming from evacuation, reduces labor supply. At the same time, they find spatial spillover effects of hurricanes on neighboring regions. That is, an increase in labor supply through in-migration from the damaged regions decreases earnings there. The existing literature allows us to suppose that region-specific shocks could alter regional matching efficiencies through composition change in unemployment. Furthermore, such nature could have spatial spillover effects owing to labor migration. This paper examines the above conjecture using panel data on the Japanese public employment referral service. To answer our research questions, we adopt the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 as a region-specific exogenous shock. This earthquake generated a massive tsunami and a serious accident at a nuclear power plant, decimating the Pacific Coast area in northeast Japan. Before examining matching efficiencies, it is necessary to confirm whether the earthquake indeed affected the local labor market conditions, such as labor demand and supply. Thus, we also examine labor market tightness, that is, the ratio of the stocks of vacancies to the unemployed. Higuchi et al. (2012) show that the Great East Japan Earthquake increased labor market tightness, namely labor shortages, in some occupations. We focus on its regional dimension. To reveal the regional variation of the effects of the earthquake on labor market tightness and matching efficiencies, we investigate them by decomposing the disaster into the tsunami and nuclear disaster, and their combined effects. We utilize the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to identify the effects of the earthquake. We also introduce a model that explores the transition of the effects of the earthquake over time, rather than only before and after. Following Belasen and Polachek (2009), the models incorporate spatial spillover effects by setting two types of treatment groups for the direct and spatial spillover effects, namely the directly damaged regions and its adjacent regions. We find that the earthquake increases labor market tightness in the directly damaged regions and their adjacent regions. The reconstruction projects after the earthquake create large labor demand, resulting in labor shortages. Firms in the directly damaged regions and the adjacent regions face this demand for reconstruction. This is a pass of spatial spillover effects. Matching efficiencies in the damaged regions deteriorated. This result suggests that a composition change in vacancies as well as unemployment generated large search frictions. Furthermore, not only out-migration from the damaged regions but also widespread demand for reconstruction caused spatial spillover effects on deterioration of matching efficiencies. After a while, this tendency moderated, suggesting that the search frictions decreased. This is because the unemployed could match with vacancies by spending sufficient time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the indices of regional labor market tightness and matching efficiency. We then present the empirical models that identify the effects of the earthquake. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 presents the estimation results of the effects of the earthquake on labor market tightness and matching efficiency. Section 5 concludes.",5

The impact of R&D policy on regional technological diversification,August 2020,Lars Mewes,Tom Broekel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Regions continuously undergo structural change. New activities emerge and grow, while old activities shrink or vanish. The ability to diversify into new fields crucially matters for regions’ economic growth and resilience (Content and Frenken 2016). Consequently, regional diversification is at the focus of policy makers. For example, the current Smart Specialization Strategy of the European Union explicitly supports and encourages regional diversification strategies (Foray et al. 2011). However, the extent to which regional policy can actually influence such (long-running) developments is still an open question. In the current paper, we approach this question by focusing on R&D subsidies as one important tool of modern regional innovation policy and analyze its effect on regional technological diversification. In light of the contemporary research underlining the strongly path dependent nature of regional (related) diversification (Neffke et al. 2011; Boschma et al. 2013, 2015; Essletzbichler 2015; Rigby 2015; Balland et al. 2019), we are particularly interested in two questions: Firstly, is policy part and potential facilitator of such path dependencies? This question refers to the allocation of R&D subsidies, which may be used to support the diversification into new (related) fields that build on already existing development paths. Secondly, can policy intervene and alter the process of regional diversification, and if so, how? We argue that R&D subsidization can be useful and effective in this context. If designed in a suitable manner, such programs alleviate the risks associated with the exploration of new activities and simultaneously stimulate inter-organizational collaboration. Accordingly, they (partly) compensate for uncertainties inherent to diversification activities and stimulate the accesses and use of external knowledge at the same time. Put differently, they closely relate to and potentially impact processes at the heart of (technological) diversification. Our paper thereby fills a gap in the existing literature, as, so far, few efforts have been made to assess systematically the contribution of R&D policy to regional technological diversification (Boschma and Gianelle 2014). Moreover, most evaluations of R&D subsidization programs are restricted to the firm level (Czarnitzki et al. 2007; Czarnitzki and Lopes-Bento 2013), while attention has only recently been drawn to the regional level (Maggioni et al. 2014; Broekel 2015; Broekel et al. 2017). We support our theoretical arguments with an empirical investigation on the contribution of project-based R&D subsidization by the Federal Government of Germany to regional technological diversification processes. Firstly, we explore the extent to which the allocation of R&D subsidies supports unrelated or related technologies in regions. Secondly, we test if these R&D subsidies increase the chances of successful diversification in general and if they are rather conducive for related or unrelated technological diversification in regions. Thirdly, we differentiate between subsidies for individual and for joint research projects, as previous research showed that the two subsidy modes can have different effects (Broekel 2015; Broekel et al. 2017). Our empirical study builds on a panel regression approach utilizing data on 141 German labor-market regions covering the period from 1991 to 2010. Patent information is used as an indicator for technology-oriented R&D activities in regions and matched with subsidized R&D projects. Our empirical results confirm the path dependent nature of regional technological diversification, which is driven by technological relatedness. In addition, R&D subsidies are more likely allocated to related capabilities in regions, indicating the tendency of policy to be part of the path dependency in regional diversification. Our study confirms that R&D subsidies stimulate technological diversification in regions. The identified positive effects are particularly pronounced and robust in the case of subsidized joint R&D projects. We find that R&D subsidies for joint research projects are an appropriate policy that, to some extent, compensates for missing relatedness and hence facilitates diversification into unrelated technological activities. The remainder of the study is organized as follows Sect. 2 provides an overview of the existing literature on regional diversification and R&D policy. We describe our data and empirical approach in Sect. 3. The empirical results are part of Sect. 4. The paper concludes with a discussion of our results regarding their implications for regional innovation policy in Sect. 5.",13

Nevertheless, this kind of labor mobility has nowadays expanded to other industries such as construction (Öhman and Lindgreen 2003). These industries rely on shift systems in which a typical work schedule is compressed into fewer days, allowing the worker more consistent time off (and at home). From a macroeconomic perspective, LDC makes it possible to improve the adjustment between supply and demand in local labor markets, enhancing the mobility of the labor factor (Sandow and Westin 2010; Eilmsteiner-Saxinger 2011).Footnote 1 From a microeconomic point of view, LDC is a strategy that results in a worker finding employment more efficiently, due to the existence of imperfect information in the labor market (Manning 2003). Despite the benefits provided by this new flow of labor mobility, there is no literature that considers how this impacts the equilibrium of the labor market in the affected geographical zones. The aim of this work is to understand how commuters coming from different areas earn a different wage even when they have a similar level of productivity. Moreover, the present study shows that this difference is a direct function of the equilibrium wage in the commuter’s zone of origin (the source zone). Specifically, these differences are associated with the wage expectations that said commuters would obtain if they worked near home. These expectations condition their reservation wage, so that commuters coming from different areas will accept a different wage offer in order to work in a similar job within the geographical area that receives the commuters (the host zone). Therefore, a differentiating element in regard to the labor productivity of the commuter, such as where they come from, would be relevant to determine the wage that they would accept in these host zones. In this paper, we consider the case of Chile, a country that is widely recognized in the literature for the importance of LDC flows in its labor market (see, for example, Aroca and Atienza 2008; Jamett and Paredes 2013). In particular, during the last 25 years LDC has grown significantly as a new means of labor mobility, far surpassing internal migration in the north of the country and the metropolitan area, both the mining center and the economic capital of the country, respectively, which lend them a significant capacity to attract labor (Aroca and Hewings 2002; Aroca and Atienza 2008).Footnote 2 According to several authors, the principal factors for LDC in Chile are: (1) high salaries paid in extractive industries (mainly the copper mining sector) located in the north of the country and far from any big urban areas, (2) the high costs of living in the mining regions, (3) the reduction in the cost of transportation, and (4) the expansion of shift systems over the last 20 years (Aroca and Atienza 2008; Aroca and Hewings 2011; Jamett and Paredes 2013; Rodrigo and Atienza 2014; Paredes, Soto, and Fleming 2017). In this research, we identify an LDC worker by using two different methodologies: (1) someone who works in a region that is not their region of residence, i.e., interregional commuter (similar to Jamett and Paredes 2013).Footnote 3 And (2), someone who works in a different labor market functional area (LMFA) from the LMFA defined as their place of origin. We are able to complete this classification by following Berdegué et al. (2017), constructing 135 different LMFAs for Chile.Footnote 4 The latter methodology is relevant in the analysis since the regional administrative limits are not sufficient for providing a perfect delimitation for a single labor market, as in many cases this area could extend beyond regional borders (Casado-Diaz 2000). Consequently, the consideration of these two definitions allows us to improve the robustness of our analysis. This study proposes a theoretical framework to model the behavior of the commuter in the host zone. This will allow us to define an estimable equation in order to compare how the wage received by the commuter is conditioned by the expected wage that they would obtain in the source zone, as long as they decide to work in the latter. An empirical challenge that we have is providing each commuter with an expected wage in their place of origin. This is done by using the propensity score matching (PSM) technique, which pairs each commuter with an employed worker from their labor market of residence, assigning a wage to the commuter that the local worker perceives as the potential wage that would be obtained if they worked in their area of residence. The empirical results are robust and suggest a positive and significant relationship between the wage received by the commuter and the expected wage in their place of origin. These results show evidence of wage differences for the commuters that are not only related with the labor productivity and/or employment in the host zone, but also with the wage expectations they would have in their source zone. The paper is divided as follows: We begin by developing a theoretical model based on the job search theory. The model will be used to identify the impact of the labor conditions of the commuter’s source zone, in particular the wage that they would expect to earn if they worked there (according to the PSM), on the salary that they earn in a host zone. Next, we will lay out our empirical strategy, which is used to contrast this theoretical assumption, which we will later test using data provided by the New Supplementary Income Survey (Nueva Encuesta Suplementaria de Ingresos) for the period 2010–2017. Finally, we will review our conclusions.",6

A commonly accepted criterion to classify business services is the one based on their knowledge content, to distinguishing the so-called knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS), a subsector of the whole set of knowledge-intensive services (KIS), from the rest (non-KIBS). Key aspects of KIBS include innovation and agglomeration. KIBS (and the cities where they are located) are becoming increasingly instrumental in fostering innovation and the competitiveness of firms and countries. For a long time, research in innovation was concentrated on the manufacturing sector, in particular on high-tech industries. In recent decades, this situation has changed and interest in knowledge-intensive business services has grown. The focus on the link between services and innovation partly originates from the efforts of Western economies and the European Union to become knowledge-based economies (European Commission 2007, 2012). In this respect, KIBS are likely to be one of the main engines of future growth within the European Union. KIBS are of special interest because they are concerned with providing knowledge-intensive intermediate inputs to private (and public) organizations, a hallmark of competitiveness in the knowledge-based economy, and because of their particular production and innovation processes, which require close interaction with their clients and have the potential to spur innovation in other economic sectors. At the same time, the particular innovation process involving KIBS is one of the main determinants of their geographic distribution. In general, the geographic distribution of the economic activities depends on productivity gains due to agglomeration economies: one strand of literature documented (Duranton and Puga 2004; Henderson and Ono 2008; Jacobs et al. 2013) that KIBS are frequently located in more urbanized areas. In this paper, we analyse the geographic localization and productivity of KIBS firms in Italy, using both census data and balance-sheet data at the firm level. More specifically, we address the following two research questions: (1) to what extent does economic activity in the KIBS sector tend to be spatially concentrated in denser urban areas over and above the level observed for the entire set of tertiary activities? (2) Does an urban productivity premium exist in KIBS activity and if so, how does it compare with the urban productivity differential prevailing in the broader KIS sector and in the tertiary sector as a whole? The contribution of our work to the extant literature consists mainly in a novel evaluation of the urban productivity premium in the case of the KIBS sector that is based on a wide dataset at firm level. In this way we are able to analyse not only the average productivity differentials but also to provide some new evidence on the entire productivity distribution of KIBS firms located in urban and in remaining local labour market areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide detailed evidence on these features for the KIBS sector using a rich firm-level dataset. In a nutshell, we find that KIBS are frequently agglomerated in urban areas, where they attain significantly higher productivity levels (urban premium), larger than those estimated for other tertiary activities. Urban productivity advantages are strongly related to the local availability of human capital. Proximity to customers (as measured by forward demand linkages) also appears relevant, as are the cases of measures of labour market thickness and standard proxies of agglomeration economies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we provide an overview of the literature on KIBS and their impact on the innovativeness and productivity of regional economies. In Sect. 3 we provide some evidence on the level of urbanization and agglomeration of KIBS activities based on the analysis of Census data for the years 2001 and 2011. Section 4 describes the database utilized for the analysis of KIBS sector firm characteristics and performance, and some preliminary descriptive statistics are shown. Section 5 is devoted to the assessment of the average urban productivity premium in the KIBS sector. In Sect. 6 the results of Sect. 5 are complemented by an analysis of the productivity density in urban and non urban areas and the issue of firm sorting is discussed. In Sect. 7 we relate the productivity of urban KIBS firms to a set LLMAs’ structural features. Section 8 summarizes and concludes.",9

It has also been common place that the majority of such demagogues have built their political success on blaming immigration (and globalization) for economic insecurity, growing income inequality and the decline of the middle class. Prominent examples are Donald Trump’s campaign toward the 2016 US presidential elections or the “Leave” movement in the UK. Likewise, several parties in Europe, with a clear anti-immigration platform (e.g., France’s “National Rally” lead by Marine Le Pen, Italy’s “Five Star Movement” lead by Beppe Grillo and the “Alternative for Germany” right-wing party in Germany) have also seen their vote shares constantly increasing over the course of the last decade. Not surprisingly, xenophobic and racist parties have also become popular in Greece since the mid-2000’s, a pattern, however, completely different to the situation prevailing after the restoration of democracy in 1974. Much of that change can be attributed to the fact that Greece has been transformed from an emigration country, until the collapse of the Soviet bloc, to a net receiver of immigrants thereafter. According to Population Census data, the share of migrants over total population hardly exceeded 1% before 1991. Nowadays, however, migration figures in Greece are comparable to international levels. For instance, there are at least ten migrants for every 100 native-born individuals.Footnote 1 What is more, Greece enjoyed unprecedented levels of democratic stability and economic prosperity between 1974 and 2007. However, the outburst of the 2009 fiscal crisis in Greece disrupted abruptly this path. As a result, populists on all sides of the political spectrum have progressively gained important electoral support, with the radical-left “Syriza” eventually coming to power in January 2015. On the other hand, the right-wing populists “Independent Greeks” and the “Popular Orthodox Rally” along with the extreme-right-wing “Golden Dawn” have jointly received around 21% in the parliamentary elections in 2012. The latter even overtook the traditional center-left party, “Pasok,” becoming Greece’s third largest party in 2015. Existing mainstream studies on immigration, starting with the seminal work by Altonji and Card (1991), have mainly put a spotlight on the impact of immigration on local labor markets. Until the early 2000s, there was a consensus that the effects of immigration were negligible (see, e.g., LaLonde and Topel 1991; Pischke and Velling 1997; Card 2001). However, in a series of very influential papers Borjas (2003, 2006), changing the unit of analysis at the national level claims that immigration exerts large adverse effects on the earnings of the less-skilled natives. More recently, however, Ottaviano and Peri (2012) and Manacorda et al. (2012), refining Borjas’s approach disputed whether migrants are to the detriment of native-born workers.Footnote 2Footnote 3 Our study sits within the emerging literature examining the nexus between immigration and election outcomes in Western countries. Existing evidence from EU countries overwhelmingly suggests that immigration is positively associated with the electoral success of parties in the right end of the political spectrum (either moderate-right or extreme-right). For example, Mendez and Cutillas (2014), using data from Spanish presidential elections over the 1998–2008 period, have shown that African immigration is (modestly) correlated with natives’ support for anti-immigration formations. Otto and Steinhardt (2014) find a robust effect on the political success of xenophobic parties on city districts in Hamburg. Barone et al. (2016) reveal a positive relation between immigration and the vote share for the center-right coalition, headed by Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Halla et al. (2017) indicate that the political success of the right-wing “Freedom Party of Austria” is highly correlated with the presence of immigrants. Harmon’s (2017) study suggests that migration also caused a rightward shift in election outcomes in Denmark. Likewise, studies focusing on the USA (see, e.g., Mayda et al. 2018) have also shown that low-skilled immigration exerts a positive influence on the vote share for the Republican Party, especially in non-urban counties.Footnote 4 Another related strand of the literature emphasizes on the relation between ethnic diversity and preferences for the welfare state (see, e.g., Alesina et al. 1999, 2001; Luttmer 2001). These studies typically suggest that there is a negative linkage between these two variables. Our paper is also closely related to the literature examining public attitudes toward immigration (see, e.g., Scheve and Slaughter 2001; Gang et al. 2002). These studies have shown that the unskilled natives take a strong stand against laissez-faire immigration policies because of fears about increased labor market competition. On the contrary, Hainmueller and Hiscox (2007) find that negative sentiments toward migrants mainly stem from racial prejudice, which is more prominent among the less-educated natives. More recently, Card et al. (2012) suggest that opposition to immigration is mainly driven by concerns on the compositional effects of immigration on local communities. The main purpose of this paper is to complement the existing literature by investigating the impact of migrants on the electoral support for far-right parties in Greece. To that end, we focus on the vote share of “Golden Dawn,” “Independent Greeks” and the “Popular Orthodox Rally,” which arguably share well-documented right-wing extremism features, such as racism, xenophobia, and nationalism (see Mudde 1996). In stark contrast with most earlier studies, and to facilitate the interpretation of our main results of interest, we also report evidence on the relation between immigration and the vote share for the pro-immigration, radical-left Syriza. The main idea is to test whether immigration has the potential to split society into different camps. We address potential endogenous distribution of immigrants across regions (i.e., immigrants cluster into regions more “open” to ethnic diversity) by employing a shift-share instrumental variable in the spirit of Card (2001). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to empirically analyze the causal nexus between immigration and the support for political parties in Greece using such methods.Footnote 5 This study also attempts to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which native attitudes are shaped. Our findings can be summarized as follows: Our best estimates suggest that immigration increases natives’ support for right-wing parties. This result survives several robustness tests, including, among others, sample restrictions, alternative controls and different estimation methods. On the other hand, the radical-left party considered in this study appears to lose political support from voters as the share of immigrants increase. Importantly, we also show that our findings are immune to internal migration bias (i.e., we reject the conjecture that natives “vote with their feet” by moving away from regions with heavy immigrant concentrations). Lastly, our results indicate that negative sentiments toward immigration (as expressed in the ballot box) are mainly fueled by the presence of non-OECD migrants and the ones with 10 or more years of tenure in Greece. Interestingly, Chletsos and Roupakias (2019) find that these particular groups of migrants compete more heavily with natives in the Greek labor market, and thus, it is reasonable to assume that they might be perceived as an economic threat by the indigenous voters. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the estimation procedures and describes the data. Section 3 presents the results and a battery of robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper.",7

Natural amenities, mineral resources and nonmetropolitan county growth",December 2020,Dan S. Rickman,Hongbo Wang,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With its open spaces, mountains and frontier history the American West has long fascinated both the general public and academics alike. Adding to the interest with the region has been the dramatic shift in economic growth in the nation from the East to the West over the last hundred years (Nash 2018). The economy of the frontier American West is varied, including farms and ranches, oil, gas and other mineral resource extraction (Felix and Chapman 2017), manufacturing activity, and activity associated with the natural amenity attractiveness of the region (McGranahan and Beale 2002). This paper examines the rural American West economy in assessing whether there have been recent shifts in economic growth patterns in the nonmetropolitan counties of the eleven contiguous western states.Footnote 1 The primary focus of the analysis is the potentially changing economic growth role of natural amenities and the shifts in growth associated with mineral resource extraction. Natural amenities have long been associated with strong population and employment growth in the United States (Graves 1980; McGranahan 1999; Deller et al. 2001; Rappaport 2007; Rickman and Rickman 2011). Strong population growth also has been noted in retirement (Green 2001; Adamy and Overberg 2018) and recreation-based counties (Beale and Johnson 1998). But the majority of counties classified as retirement destinations or recreation-based by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture also have been categorized in the top quarter of all counties in terms of natural amenity attractiveness (McGranahan 1999). Most counties possessing high-levels of natural amenities and strong population growth in the latter part of the twentieth century are in the West (McGranahan 1999). Rising incomes and wealth, along with aging of the population fuel amenity-related migration (Graves 1980; Rappaport 2007). Rather than migrants responding to regional income differentials, amenity-based migration produces a negative relationship between price-adjusted wages and the presence of natural amenities (Roback 1982). Rising housing prices have been found to be the primary price response to natural amenity-based migration (Wu and Gopinath 2008; Rickman and Rickman 2011). The housing-price adjustments and any adverse effects on quality of life that occur from amenity migration though reduce the attractiveness of an area rich in natural amenities, feeding back negatively on growth (McGranahan 2008; Chen et al. 2009; Rickman and Rickman 2011). Likewise, rising temperatures, more severe droughts and longer fire seasons may be considered the new normal in the West with climate change (Gustin 2017), potentially reducing the attractiveness of high natural amenity areas (Mueller et al. 2009; Sinha et al. 2018). Many areas in the West also have been affected by mineral resource economic cycles in recent decades (Felix and Chapman 2017). Despite their favorable region of location, counties classified as mining-dependent in the West as a whole lost population during the 1990s (McGranahan and Beale 2002). After bottoming out at the end of 2003, national employment in the oil and gas sector dramatically increased over the next decade with the advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (Munasib and Rickman 2015). California, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming comprised six of the top twelve oil producing states in the nation in 2014 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Hackbarth 2015). Oil and gas extraction affects regional economies directly through the demand for labor, which can be reflected in changes in employment, earnings and population (Marchand and Weber 2018). Activity associated with oil and gas extraction can positively spill over to the rest of the economy through spending multiplier effects, or alternatively possibly crowd out other economic activity through higher input prices or harm to the natural environment (Munasib and Rickman 2015). The volatility of the mining sector has led many areas in the West to turn to outdoor recreation for economic growth (Traywick and Recht 2019). Therefore, we compare economic growth across recent periods for the nonmetropolitan counties of eleven states in the contiguous West. We focus solely on the West because of its general natural amenity attractiveness (McGranahan 1999), the presence of oil, gas and other mineral resources and the geographic heterogeneity of labor market effects from the presence of natural amenities (Partridge et al. 2008) and oil and gas resources (Munasib and Rickman 2015). We compare growth in the 1990s to that during 2000–2010 and 2010–2016. The 1990–2000 and 2000–2010 periods contain national recessions, while 2010–2016 lies entirely within a national expansion. The primary contribution of the paper is that we assess whether growth patterns shifted between the periods across the natural amenity spectrum and assess the volatile role of the mining sector in the nonmetropolitan American West economy. Using U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis aggregate data at the nonmetropolitan county level, we first examine the primary economic indicators of total wage and salary employment, population and per capita income to provide a broad assessment. We then examine the components of personal income to better understand the channels of growth influences. We account for other influences of growth such as industry composition, the position of the county along the urban–rural continuum as classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and demographic characteristics of the population. We find that growth slowed in the highest natural amenity counties compared to those lower in the natural amenity spectrum. Industrial composition significantly affected growth, with mining employment having its largest employment multiplier effects in the 1990s; more counties benefitted from oil, gas and mineral resource extraction though during 2000–2010. The results are robust to empirical model specification, including accounting for the potential endogeneity of mining sector employment, state fixed effects, and spatial dependence. We then use the 2012–2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates and spatial equilibrium theory to assess whether the slowing of growth in high natural amenity areas was attributable to factors such as reduced quality of life associated with growth or climate change. Our analysis suggests that it instead was capitalization of natural amenities into housing costs that slowed growth in natural amenity-rich counties as quality of life is estimated to be higher during the 2012–2016 period the further one moves up the natural amenity spectrum and the differences did not appear to be narrowing over time. Planners and policy makers should expect continued slower growth in areas with the highest levels of natural amenities and the highest housing prices. Counties in areas most adversely affected by climate changes such as longer and more severe droughts, extended wildfire seasons and temperatures rising beyond comfort levels, face potential reversals of economic fortunes. Mining sector employment may continue to have smaller multiplier effects than in the 1990s and likely will remain volatile. We conclude then that counties in the West that traditionally relied on natural amenities or oil, gas and other mineral resources for economic vitality may need to consider other place-based policies (Partridge et al. 2012) in the future. Section 2 examines the natural amenity growth patterns in the eleven contiguous states in the American West and discusses the underlying spatial equilibrium theory for the patterns. Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical model. Descriptive statistics and regression growth results appear in Sect. 4. Section 5 explores the reason for the convergence in growth across the natural amenity spectrum. Summary, conclusions and policy recommendations from the study follow in Sect. 6.",3

Empirical evidence for 70 countries,December 2020,Miguel Puente-Ajovín,Arturo Ramos,Fernando Sanz-Gracia,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The study of city size distributions has a long tradition in urban economics. Following Malevergne et al. (2011), this is an interesting research field for the following reasons: first, the study of the shape of the distribution can give information about its underlying growth mechanisms and processes; second, it yields important socioeconomic consequences; third, the upper tail is, by definition, very relevant in terms of population; and fourth, the better we can describe a distribution, the better we can predict its future shape and anticipate behaviors to come. This is especially important for city size distribution given that the world is becoming increasingly urban and “the future of humankind will be an urban one” (McGranahan and Martine 2014). In this context, according to the Northam (1979) curve, once a country reaches an urbanization rate of 30%, a fast and accelerated urbanization stage follows. Chronologically, the first density function to be considered, especially for the upper tail, was the Pareto distribution and a particular case of it known as Zipf’s distribution (Rosen and Resnick 1980). Parr and Suzuki (1973) proposed the lognormal density and Eeckhout (2004) developed a theoretical model that was based on it. Trying to conciliate these two approaches, Reed and Jorgensen (2004), theoretically, and Giesen et al. (2010) and González-Val et al. (2015), empirically, defend the so-called double Pareto lognormal (dPLN), featuring Pareto tails convolved with a lognormal body. In this context, Puente-Ajovín and Ramos (2015) consider the best model for some European countries to have Pareto tails and a Singh–Maddala body (tdPSM). Subsequently, Luckstead and Devadoss (2017) propose a variant of the dPLN (Pareto tails and lognormal body, PTLN) which performs better than the dPLN. Later on, Kwong and Nadarajah (2019) introduced finite mixtures of lognormal distributions (or, more generally, log-exponential power distributions, LEPs) in the study of city size distributions, which outperform the PTLN for India and the United States. Afterwards, finite mixtures of lognormal distributions have also been used by Bǎncescu et al. (2019) for Romania and Su (2020) for the United States. Against this background, in this study we try to test whether the result of Kwong and Nadarajah (2019) is applicable to other countries. To that end and to give robustness to the conclusions, we have considered a wide sample of 70 countries (see Sect. 3). We have estimated seven distributions, as follows: the lognormal (LN), the loglogistic (LL), the dPLN, mixtures of two and three lognormals (2LN and 3LN) and mixtures of two and three loglogistics (2LL and 3LL). The 3LN is the most representative distribution proposed by Kwong and Nadarajah (2019) and the LL was first proposed in Hsu (2012) (see also González-Val et al. (2015)) to study city size distributions, although it is widely used in other branches of economics (Fisk 1961). As far as we know, 2LL and the 3LL are used here for the first time to describe city size distributions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 describe the density functions that are considered in this study. Section 3 describes the choice and type of dataset. In Sect. 4, we present the empirical results. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Sect. 5.",7

Batabyal,Peter Nijkamp,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The study of urban and rural regions has been pursued by both development economists and regional scientists for quite some time. Using the lens of development economics, urban regions are generally dynamic, they exhibit relatively rapid economic growth rates, they are industrial, and they are frequently technologically advanced. In contrast, rural regions are often not as dynamic, they are commonly agricultural, they display slow economic growth rates, and they are technologically backward. This viewpoint explains why the early literature in development economics—see Lewis (1954), Sen (1966), and Dixit (1970)—was preoccupied with the study of the so-called dual economy. This notwithstanding, it should be noted that this traditional focus on dual development has changed greatly in the past few decades. Regional scientists, unlike development economists, have concentrated mainly on urban and rural regions in the developed world. Even though they have acknowledged that many rural regions in the developed world are primarily agricultural, for the most part, regional scientists have not analyzed rural regions as the supplier of resource flows to urban regions in a dual economy setting. Instead, Jordan et al. (2014), Hall et al. (2006), and Yamamoto (2008) have drawn attention to rural–urban differences in, respectively, education, health, and income. This concentration has led regional scientists to address questions concerning the sustainability of rural regions as independent beings in the face of ever increasing urbanization and the simultaneous rise of cities.Footnote 1 In turn, this concern with the sustainability of rural regions has now given rise to a literature on the nexuses between so-called leading and lagging regions where, predictably, rural regions are often the lagging regions.Footnote 2 Recently, researchers interested in the connections between urban and rural regions have begun to analyze the fact that many rural region residents choose to work in neighboring urban regions and vice versa even though such residents have to bear the attendant commuting costs. Matha and Wintr (2009) look at bilateral commuting flows across the border regions of four European Union nations and show that commuting time or distance and language differences have a significant impact on cross-border commuting. Examining data from India, Sharma and Chandrasekhar (2014) point out that rural–urban wage differentials are important push and pull factors in the decision to commute to work. Korzhenevych and Jain (2018) focus on the New Delhi area in India and note that although urbanization has led to the empowerment of women, it has also led to a rise of unsustainable commuting patterns from rural areas. Bosworth and Venhorst (2018) point out that rural to urban commuting gives rise to a scenario in which the relative level of urban wages outperforms rural wages even in the absence of residential migration. Finally, Ferreira et al. (2018) study the Lisbon metropolitan region in Portugal and contend that commuting not only affects regional and urban economies but that it also gives rise to significant economic and environmental costs. Given this review of the literature, we would now like to emphasize four points. First, even though the literature on urban and rural regions has studied aspects of commuting, this literature has not explicitly analyzed the idea that there is both a game-theoretic and a political economy aspect to commuting stemming from the facts that (1) the governments in urban and rural regions can be in competition with each other to attract workers to their region and (2) these majority elected governments seek to maximize net income in their respective regions. Second, the literature has recognized—see Beeson et al. (2010)—but not analyzed how wage taxation can influence commuting between an urban and a rural region in a political economy setting. Third, our paper breaks new ground in the regional science literature because it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to present a theoretical analysis of the combined impacts of commuting costs and wage taxation on workplace choice. Finally, we believe that our “combined impacts” analysis shows how the traditional linear city model that has been used frequently by regional scientists and urban economists can be expanded in ways that permit researchers to examine the effects of additional variables that have traditionally received insufficient attention in the literature. Given the first two points in the preceding paragraph, our objective in this paper is to analyze the impact of wage taxation on the workplace choices of and the commuting costs borne by individuals in an aggregate economy consisting of an urban and an adjacent rural region.Footnote 3 Section 2 describes the theoretical framework in which the aggregate economy under study is inhabited by a continuum of individuals who are uniformly distributed with a total mass of one. These individuals choose to work in either the urban \(\left( U \right)\) or the rural \(\left( R \right)\) region. The wage is higher (lower) in the urban (rural) region. There are ad valorem taxes \(\tau_{U}\) and \(\tau_{R}\) on the wages that are paid to the region in which work is performed. Section 3 assumes that individuals work in the region in which their after-tax wage net of commuting cost is the highest and then computes the equilibrium number of workers in each region.Footnote 4 Section 4 supposes that the rural region’s median voter works in the urban region, determines the Nash equilibrium in taxes, and then asks whether either of the two regions ought to tax or to subsidize the wage. Section 5 assumes that the rural region’s median voter works in the rural region, ascertains the Nash equilibrium in taxes, and then shows that it is optimal for the urban and the rural region governments to subsidize the two wages. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes and then discusses one way in which the analysis contained in this paper can be generalized to the case in which there are not just two but \(n > 2\) regions in the aggregate economy.",6

Audretsch,Maksim Belitski,Georg Eichler,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The economic geography literature has long focused on understanding the sources and mechanisms of variations in entrepreneurial growth cities and regions to design regional economic policies (Andersson et al. 2019). However, existing approaches to bestow entrepreneurship are often limited to regional institutional changes (Audretsch et al. 2018; Boudreaux and Nikolaev 2018) and the role of knowledge (Tsvetkova and Partridge 2019) and cultural characteristics (Fritsch and Wyrwich 2014; Fritsch et al. 2019). Simply creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurs by promoting innovation, regional specialization (Andersson and Larsson 2014) as well as high quality of institutions (Charron et al. 2014; Chowdhury et al. 2015) is often insufficient and time-consuming. Other regional policies are also limited: improving the productivity (van Praag 2007), attracting skilled labor (Kenney and Patton 2005), facilitating innovations systems (Fritsch 2001) and entrepreneurial ecosystems (Isenberg 2010; Stam 2015; Audretsch and Belitski 2017), investing in social capital (Westlund and Bolton 2003; Bradley et al. 2012; Andersson et al. 2016) and stimulating market demand (Sato et al. 2012). The extent literature on entrepreneurship and regional development has focused on contexts and the role that regulation and cultural institutions play in facilitating entrepreneurial activity (Boschma and Fritsch 2009; Tabellini 2010) and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition (De Carolis and Saparito 2006; Radosevic and Yoruk 2013). However, there is a paucity of knowledge how entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and knowledge transfer can happen in a heterogeneous context and the role that communication strategies play to regional entrepreneurship. Very little is known about how ethnic heterogeneity affects entrepreneurship and the institutional arrangements affecting entrepreneurship (Churchill 2017). The purpose of this study is to explain the mechanism of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition in heterogeneous contexts, as well as to further explore the relationship between bilingualism and regional entrepreneurship in a multicultural region. We use social phycology and communication accommodation theory (CAT) with the idea that speakers adjust (or accommodate) their speech in order to create and maintain positive individual and social interactions as well as demonstrate mutual identities and interests. The paper focuses on subregional units of analysis (districts), contrasting the prevailing approach which studies the effectiveness of context at a regional (Szerb et al. 2013; Rothstein et al. 2013) and country level (Autio et al. 2014). The choice of our analysis follows the belief that regional and subregional differences matter more than national ones. (Charron et al. 2014). This study makes two contributions to regional economics and entrepreneurship literature. Firstly, using the social phycology and communication theory perspective (Gudykunst and Kim 1992; Gallois et al. 2005; Gallois and Callan 1997; Miller 2002; Soliz and Giles 2014) we explain how bilingualism can facilitate entrepreneurial activity with a focus on multicultural regions. Secondly, we use longitudinal data to empirically examine the effect of changes in regional bilingualism on new firm formation and density expanding Churchill’s (2017) argument on the role of linguistic fractionalization on entrepreneurship. In addition, we argue that the relationship between bilingualism and entrepreneurship is nonlinear (Audretsch et al. 2018). We define bilingualism as the ability to speak at least two languages and should not be mistaken for a form of social capital (Westlund and Bolton 2003; De Carolis and Saparito 2006; Andersson et al. 2016) or localized cultural resources (Qian et al. 2013). This study offers three major findings. Firstly, bilingualism is an important antecedent of regional entrepreneurship, with an increase in a share of bilinguals by one percent increases start-up rates by 0.06 percent and start-up density by 0.08 percent. Secondly, we use a unique indicator for bilingualism, such as the number of residents who passed A-level bilingual test, and demonstrate that higher share of bilinguals increases entrepreneurship activity directly as well as facilitating relative growth of entrepreneurship activity compared to other regions. Thirdly, the extent of bilingualism in a region serves as a conduit in new ideas and may increase the ability to communicate knowledge more effectively (Feldman and Zoller 2012; Andersson et al. 2016). The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the role of language in regional entrepreneurship. Section 3 describes the South Tyrol case study. Section 4 presents the data and empirical method. Thereafter, Sect. 5 shows the results and a series of robustness checks. And finally, Sect. 6 discusses main findings and concludes.",

In general, regional forecasting models do not explicitly take into consideration structural changes in the economy. Most such tools (Brandsma et al. 2015; Varga et al. 2020), in fact, are based on long-run theoretical equilibrium conditions, translated into vector autoregression (VAR) relations, which, while based on solid theoretical grounding, fall short of a sound toolbox to assess off-equilibrium variations.Footnote 1 Others, merging input–output (IO) tables with econometric tools, gain more insight into short-run employment fluctuations, at the cost of less interpretative power in long-run permanent changes (Masouman and Harvie 2018). Among regional econometric growth models, the Macroeconomic, Sectoral, Social and Territorial (MASST) model has evolved over the last decade to be a useful complement to VAR and IO methodologies in explaining structural relations among regional growth-enhancing factors and long-run regional growth paths (Capello 2007; Capello and Fratesi 2012; Capello et al. 2017). The MASST model is a regional econometric growth model built to simulate regional growth scenarios in the medium and long-run (typically, over a 15–20 years’ time horizon); it strikes a balance between quantitative forecasts as in standard VAR models and qualitative foresights as typically done in long-run scenario simulation exercises, producing what have been termed quantitative foresights (Capello et al. 2008). First, structural relations between explanatory and dependent variables in various national and regional equations are estimated over a long-run time span. Next, coefficients thus estimated are exploited for simulating likely future growth patterns, given internally coherent sets of assumptions forming regional growth scenarios. Despite the remarkable level of complexity of the model in its third generation, in which the number and the complexity of the effects of the 2007–2008 crisis have been taken into account (Capello et al. 2017), the important political and economic novelties mentioned above prompted structural advances of the model, with the aim to strengthen its structure. This paper aims at providing an in-depth discussion of the crucial advances brought about in the model. The first advance of paramount importance (technically speaking the easiest) was the need to update the database, with the goal to grasp the ways countries re-emerge from the crisis and adjusts their economies along new, never explored before, growth paths. In several regions, the economic landscape has been left changed for good. While during the crisis, increased competition from areas hosting de-localized manufacturing and tertiary activities left many EU and US regions with a persistent unemployment rate (Autor et al. 2013; Dustmann et al. 2014; Hoffmann and Lemieux 2016), a resurgence of manufacturing activities seems to be a new trend in Europe, driven by the new Industry 4.0 technological paradigm. Highly selective in terms of which countries and regions reap most benefits, the re-launch of manufacturing activities in Europe is neither geographically, nor industrially evenly spread: some sectors are under strain, while some, especially in more technologically advanced regions, are actually gaining (Capello et al. 2015; Groot et al. 2011). The new MASST4 model presents utterly new estimates of both the regional and national sub-models, based on a full panel structure for the national part of the model, and on a three-periods (pre-crisis; crisis; after-crisis) panel structure for the regional sub-model. The second advance of paramount importance is the strengthening of the merging between macroeconomic, national, trends, and regional ones. While prior econometric models focus on either macroeconomic or territorial aspects for explaining regional growth, MASST4 further merges these two conceptual branches, by broadening the scope of the endogenous territorial features of MASST3, and integrating them with macroeconomic aspects. In MASST, traditional territorial growth determinants simultaneously activate regional growth and mediate macroeconomic growth impacts. In other words, the effects of the crisis, and the ways out of the great contraction of different areas, are due to structural differences in regional development patterns, growth-enhancing factor endowments, all calling for sound toolboxes capable of differentiating otherwise space-blind effects in terms of different geographic areas. In MASST4, the crucial territorial growth determinants have been enlarged to embrace three important new political/economic trends that will influence future growth paths. The first new trend is of a political nature and refers to a major unexpected change in structural economic relations, that is hard to capture with standard regional econometric growth models. We refer here to the recent decision made by the UK to leave the EU (henceforth, for short “Brexit”). Following a much debated referendum held in the UK on June 23, 2016, UK decided to withdraw its membership of the European Union, which had been gained after a decade of negotiations starting in 1961 and ending only in 1973 with the UK’s admission to the European Union, together with Ireland and Denmark (UK and EU 2018). As often the case, this politically sensible decision has prompted several debates, both among academics (e.g., Chen et al. 2018; Bachtler and Begg 2017; Brakman et al. 2018) as well as among practitioners, with frequent rebukes on either side, too often thrown without sound research and solid methodological tools capable of interpreting the likely effects of similar decisions. What is nevertheless becoming clear is that the future will strongly be influenced by the scope and quality of such trends, and tools for scenario building cannot ignore the existence of such political decisions. The MASST4 model has been restructured for also modeling the effects of Brexit and of possible future increase in administrative, economic, and legal international borders within the EU (Capello et al. 2018a). The second trend refers to the role played by cities in stimulating national growth. Academics and policymakers debate on whether the presence of large capital cities, catalyzers of new and qualified activities, plays a role in driving countries out of the crisis, or whether the presence of such large economies, more directly hit by the crisis, and thus fighting the social costs generated by the downturn, prevents a full recovery at Country level (Parkinson et al. 2015; Capello et al. 2015; Dijkstra et al. 2015). MASST overcomes this debate and embraces the idea that the role of cities in the stimulating national economies lies in their ability to adjust to the new challenges. Therefore, the structural change of cities, in terms of functions hosted, in governance of local problems, in institutional quality (Peirò-Palomino et al. 2020), in cooperating with other cities, explains agglomeration economies, and their role in aggregate growth. MASST4 endogenizes agglomeration economies, which in the model depend on structural changes of local economies. The third trend calling for a more sophisticated toolbox is the paramount importance of the new technological paradigm (the so-called Industry 4.0 revolution) for the future of Europe. Over the past 20 years, Europe has been steadily deindustrializing (Drucker 2014; Rodrik 2016). However, recent evidence (Wink et al. 2016) suggests that, to a limited extent and under specific local conditions, this medium run trend may be reversing, in particular for high-tech industries that drive the fourth industrial revolution (Lee et al. 2015). The new paradigm, based on new knowledge developed in very limited hotspots and diffused on the basis of the presence of wise, advanced and forward looking adopters, able to change their organizational, managerial and economic structure around new and unprecedented routines, drastically changes the possibilities of competitiveness, increasingly depending on new modes of innovation and learning processes. Given the importance of the diffusion of the new technological paradigm on the future of countries and regions, the MASST4 model has been revised. The probability of a regional economy to go through a structural evolution in its innovation modes (Asheim 2012; Capello and Lenzi 2018; D'adda et al. 2020) is now included in the model. In the rest of the paper, we will explain in detail these advances. Section 2 synthetically describes the structure of the MASST model, with an emphasis on the advances in the structure of the most recent version of the tool. Section 3 discusses the advances in the national sub-model and highlights the major results obtained by the estimates in terms of structural changes taking place in the after-crisis period. Section 4 deals with the regional sub-model and highlights in particular the major novelties of this tool. These include the endogenization of dynamic agglomeration economies, the introduction of dynamic regional patterns of innovation, the endogenization of regional productivity, dynamics in manufacturing employment patterns, the way Brexit effects are simulated, and the introduction of a full panel structure. Section 5 presents an application of the MASST4 model to a Reference scenario, which beyond purely extrapolating from present long-run trends also takes into account the main structural changes taking place in the aftermath of the 2007/2008 economic crisis. Lastly, Sect. 6 concludes and discusses some possible further future developments of this class of models, while also highlighting possible implications of our work for regional policymakers.",8

Although some studies found that broadband was not an important contributor (Jayakar and Park 2013), a majority of research has documented a positive correlation or even a potentially causal relationship between broadband access/adoption and improvements in income and employment (Kolko 2012; Holt and Jamison 2009; Whitacre et al. 2014a). Other studies have shown that broadband matters for other areas of life as well, including civic engagement, housing values, and migration (Mossberger et al. 2012; Mahasuweerachai et al. 2010; Deller and Whitacre 2019). Most recent studies have relied on broadband-related variables that focus on general availability or adoption (or a combination of both). As a result, broadband differences that exist have often been overlooked, including: access to specific download or upload speed thresholds, the percentage of population adopting/using broadband at various speeds, or the percentage of the population not using broadband at all. Few studies have attempted to investigate the specific aspects of broadband that are most closely associated with economic growth or productivity; this in spite of the fact that cities and organizations are pushing for faster speeds and/or efforts to engage nonusers (Batty et al. 2012; Briglauer and Gugler 2018; Fifield 2016). Understanding the specific attributes of broadband that are associated with labor productivity would be a valuable contribution to the existing literature and could be of particular importance for the next wave of broadband policy measures. For these reasons, this study conducted a spatial cross-sectional analysis of county-level labor productivity in 2017 that includes 10 distinct broadband-related variables as the relationships of interest. In addition, the analysis tests whether these relationships are different for more rural locations. The findings suggest that measures of advertised speeds are largely insignificant, but that measures capturing the broader digital distress or divide in the county are more important for explaining productivity. They also suggest that the impacts are notably different in rural areas. While we use multiple econometric techniques to ensure the robustness of our results, we are up front that the relationships identified between these broadband indicators and productivity variables are not necessarily causal. The following section provides a brief literature review on broadband and its relationship with economic indicators as well as factors known to impact productivity. The data & methods section outline the data used as well as the statistical analysis conducted. The results section discusses the findings from the statistical analysis, while the last section highlights policy implications, limitations of the study, and future research opportunities.",14

Waldorf,Natasha T. Duncan,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Attracting high-skilled immigrants via skill-based selection is a pivotal part of immigration policy in many developed countries (Sana 2010; Duncan 2012), with the associated human capital gain expected to be beneficial for the host country’s economy (Drinkwater et al. 2007; Bound et al. 2017a, b). Indeed, a working visa program on the business side is an essential source of high-skilled labor supply for technology companies in many developed countries, especially in the US. Following recent suggestions of restricting H1-B visas in the US, many technology firms, including leading global companies, expect to be directly and negatively affected because they utilize the working immigrant program to transfer highly talented workers from outside the US.1 The extent of the immigration induced human capital gains depend on a number of factors, many of which are influenced by immigration policies. Aydemir (2011), for example, showed that Canada’s skill-based selection—the so-called point system—generates a more favorable human capital inflow than other systems such as family reunification systems. Some of the immigration induced human capital gains may be underutilized due to immigrant skills’ imperfect transferability across international borders, yielding less favorable labor market outcomes including lower wages (Mane and Waldorf 2013). In the US, human capital gains of skill-based immigration are even structurally underutilized because US immigration policy decouples employment authorization and admission permission for some visa categories.2 Most notably, the H-4 visa exemplifies these structural constraints on human capital utilization. The H-4 visa permits dependents of high-skilled immigrants3 with H-1B visas to join them in the US but excludes them from the labor force.4 Such forced exclusion has adverse consequences at two levels. At the micro-level, the—often highly skilled—dependents forego income and valuable work experience. At the macro-level, the imposed underutilization of human capital translates into productivity losses for the US economy. When assessing the economic impact of skill-based visa programs, the literature has—with a few exceptions (Lofstrom et al. 2013)—neglected the impact of high-skilled dependents without work authorizations. This paper, therefore, focuses on the adverse effects of structural brain waste associated with dependent visas in the US and addresses two broad sets of questions. The first set centers on the questions: what are the characteristics of H-4 visa holders who enter the US despite being denied work permits, and did these characteristics change over time? We find that the typical H-4 visa holder can be described as a young, highly educated woman who was born in Asia. Over time, we see changes in the composition of national origin, but the dominance of women in the pool of dependents is remarkably persistent. Second, we ask how human capital waste translates into productivity loss. We particularly focus on changes in productivity loss over time due to compositional changes in the pool of dependents. Two opposing forces are expected to shape changes over time. On the one hand, assortative mating combined with increasingly higher educational attainment among women suggests that productivity losses may rise over time. On the other hand, a dampening effect can be expected if high-skilled immigrants and their dependents become more likely to originate in countries with more traditional norms. More traditional norms are often associated with lower educational attainment and lesser labor force participation. That is, dependents from countries with more traditional norms and values may choose not to work even when granted work authorization. It is not a priori clear whether the net effect increases or decreases the productivity losses over time. Despite the potentially substantial economic impacts of immigration policies that decouple employment authorization and admission, a thorough investigation of these economic impacts is missing. The main reason for this gap is the poor data availability on the pool of foreigners authorized to live in the US but not authorized to work in the US. The American Community Surveys (ACS) provide very detailed information on foreigners’ socio-economic characteristics but not on their visa status. On the other hand, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) provide data on the volume of visas issued per year but withhold micro-level data on visa holders. And even the volume of visas issued is of limited value as there is no information on how long people stay in the US on a particular visa before they either return home or switch to a different type of visa. Therefore, this paper offers a conceptual framework for an investigation into the aggregate economic impacts of the immigration-policy induced brain waste. Moreover, acknowledging needed assumptions to identify the likely pool of H-4 dependents which mostly reflect spouses with immigrant workers brought by jobs from other countries,5 we demonstrate that the policy-imposed labor force exclusion leads to substantial losses of spouses’ earnings and substantial aggregate productivity losses for the US. This article is divided into four sections. Following this introduction is the background section with a description of US immigration policies for high-skilled workers and their dependents, including a brief discussion of the implicit gender biases. Next, we present the empirical analysis with subsections on the conceptual framework and research design, household arrangements, the pool of dependents, and the estimation of productivity loss. The paper concludes with a summary and a critical discussion of the results.",1
66.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,04 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-020-01018-x,Using the Moran’s I to detect bid rigging in Brazilian procurement auctions,April 2021,Ricardo Carvalho de Andrade Lima,Guilherme Mendes Resende,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Bid-rigging occurs when a group of companies participating in a public procurement establish cooperative agreements with each other to raise prices, divide the market or reduce the quality of goods and services that are purchased by the public administration. Considering that public procurement accounts for an estimated 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide on average, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2009), and the cartel overcharges by approximately 16% (Boyer and Kotchoni 2015), bid-rigging schemes can roughly result in economic losses of approximately 2.3% of GDP. In addition to the reduction in economic welfare resulting from the transfer of resources from society to cartel members, the practice also causes intangible damage to the economy. For example, cartelization tends to inhibit the entry of new, potentially more efficient competitors and, in addition, reduce incentives for innovations (as measured by investments in R&D), as evidenced by Günster et al. (2011). For these reasons, the detection of and fight against bid-rigging cartels have become a priority of antitrust authorities and anti-corruption agencies around the world. Relative to detection, public authorities may act in a reactive or proactive way. In the first case, the investigation is opened when an anonymous complaint occurs or when a cartel member makes a delation, which is a situation that materializes in leniency programmes. Although it is an efficient strategy, leniency agreements have the limitation of detecting only those cartels that are unstable and are close to breaking points such that successful cartels remain unscathed (Abrantes-Metz and Bajari 2012). Therefore, it is essential to use a proactive approach in such a way that public authorities are no longer dependent on external information to initiate a cartel investigation. An example of a proactive practice is the use of economic screens. Economic screens are characterized as statistical tests that seek to identify anomalous patterns in the distribution of economic variables (prices, costs, proposals, bids and market shares) that resemble non-competitive behaviour.Footnote 1 In the present paper, we use an economic screen that identifies the systematic correlation between bids to investigate the behaviour of a bid-rigging cartel. More specifically, we follow the methodology that was recently proposed by Lundberg (2017) in which Moran’s I statistic is applied to the residuals of a bid regression to detect complementary bidding on public contracts. The proposed screen is applied to a supposed bid-rigging cartel that operates in the implantable cardiac device (ICD) market in Brazil. This bid-rigging scheme is being investigated by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and includes a partial leniency agreement involving a company that participates in the alleged collusion. The market covers the sector of implantable cardiac devices, which includes resynchronizers, pacemakers and accessory items such as electrodes and catheters. According to the investigative process, the cartel operated between 2004 and 2015 in all Brazilian territories and comprised a group of four companies, twenty-nine individuals and two industrial associations. There is a vast empirical related literature that implements different types of economic screens to detect cartel behaviour in public procurement. One tool that is traditionally employed is the variance screen. It is expected that the variance of the bids’ distributions will be lower in the presence of bid-rigging cartels. According to Imhof (2017), the idea is that by establishing collusion, cartel members exchange information and coordinate their bids to reach a minimum contract value, which tends to be higher than the contract value in the case of competition. This practice restricts the possible universe of bid values (truncates the distribution) and, consequently, reduces the variance. Abrantes-Metz et al. (2006) have shown that after the collapse of a bid-rigging cartel that supplied seafood to Philadelphia’s military installations in the 1980s, the average price of the products decreased by 26% and the standard deviation increased by over 260%. The studies of Imhof (2017) and Imhof et al. (2018) that investigated bid-rigging cartels that operated in the road construction sector in Switzerland also apply the variance screen as one of the stages of cartel detection, claiming that this statistic is easy to implement due to the few data requirements and the low level of complexity in its calculation. In sealed-bid procurement auctions, companies submit their bids simultaneously so that bid values are only revealed at the end of the auction and on a specific date. Commonly, the public administration establishes the company that gives the lowest bid value as the winner of the auction. In this way, if there is no coordination between the firms, individual bids will not be conditioned on competitors' bids. Therefore, it is expected that the bids will be independent of each other after the control of the observed information. This condition—known as the conditional independence hypothesis—was initially established by Bajari and Ye (2003) to characterize a distribution of bids that are to be generated by a model with competitive bidding. A set of empirical studies sought to detect bid-rigging cartels by analysing the interdependence between the bids. Jakobsson (2007) tested the validity of the conditional independence hypothesis for asphalt-paving procurement auctions in Sweden by applying the spearman rank correlation to pairs of bids. Aryal and Gabrielli (2013) developed a two-step procedure using the Bajari and Ye (2003) approach and a structural model was applied to asymmetric first-price auctions that compares bidder costs in both collusion and non-collusion scenarios. More recently, the conditional independence was analysed using spatial statistical tools, allowing the hypothesis to be tested in a more flexible way by not limiting the tests to pairs of bidders. Bergman et al. (2019) used spatial econometric models and Lundberg (2017) applied Moran’s I statistic to detect whether there is systematic correlation between the bids of a group of companies that were accused of operating an asphalt bid-rigging cartel in Sweden from 1995 to 2001. In addition to a smaller variance and interdependent bids, another common characteristic of bid-rigging cartels is the rotation of winners. The rotating behaviour of a cartel consists of the artificial exchange of the winning bidder in procurement auctions that are frequently conducted by public administrations. The study of Ishii (2009) analysed this behaviour in a detailed way. Using data from the public procurement auctions of Naha city (Japan) for consulting services, Ishii (2009) showed that the variable that measures the favour exchange score of a particular company in repeated auctions positively affects the win probability at a future auction. This evidence suggests that there was a bid-rigging cartel operating based on favour exchange with a rotational scheme. Imhof (2017) and Imhof et al. (2018) also proposed a graphical analysis of the bids that allows one to check the existence of rotating behaviour in pairs of competing companies. Considering this empirical literature on economic screens being applied to bid-rigging cartels, we intend to contribute in two ways, i.e. (I) by applying a methodology that allows one to test the conditional independence hypothesis in a more flexible manner in relation to previous studies and (II) by analysing the behaviour of an investigated bid-rigging cartel that operated in the Brazilian market for implantable cardiac devices using a novel and public database. It should be noted that, to our best knowledge, there are not any empirical studies that employed economic screenings to investigate bid-rigging in Brazilian procurement auctions. Most of the screens have been applied to detect price-fixing cartels operating in the fuel station sector (see, for example, Ragazzo and Silva 2006; Vasconcelos and Vasconcelos 2005). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief description of the supposed bid-rigging cartel that operated in the ICD market and describes the main rules of Brazilian procurement auctions.

Efforts to improve the education system are justified by the various benefits education provides in both the individual and social fields. Among the benefits for individuals are greater opportunity within the labor market and the capacity to generate future income (Murnane et al. 1995; Murphy and Peltzman 2004; Menezes-Filho 2001). In turn, society benefits from the country’s economic growth and development, more specifically from the decreased likelihood of unemployment, reduced crime, improved health levels and increased productivity (Hanushek and Kimko 2000; Barros and Mendonça 1997; Bishop 1989). Although efforts by the Brazilian government have resulted in educational advances in terms of years of schooling, children's access to schools and a slight increase in student achievement (Soares et al. 2016), Brazilian students still score below the OECD average and the goals set in the National Education Plan (OECD 2019; Soares and Alves 2013). Hence, studies using Brazilian data have sought to identify the main determinants of educational achievement, focusing mainly on school performance (Alves and Franco 2008; Alves and Soares 2013; De Andrade and Soares 2008; Brooke and Soares 2008; Franco et al. 2007; Reynolds and Teddlie 2008) and socioeconomic background (Alves and Soares 2009, 2013; Lee 2008). Studies have also analyzed the effects of per-student public expenditure on education (Amaral and Menezes-Filho 2008; Carreira and Pinto 2007; Diniz 2012; Fernandes 2013). In general, the findings from the literature, in which various methodologies and databases are adopted, indicate that, when the characteristics of the student and family background are controlled, school characteristics have little impact on student achievement (Menezes-Filho 2007; Machado et al. 2008; Soares 2005). The study by Vernier et al. (2015) shows that when school performance is analyzed in a more aggregated way, in addition to the socioeconomic issues of students, the characteristics of teachers, principals and the school also have an impact. Furthermore, the authors find that the region to which the student belongs also affects their school achievement, highlighting the importance of space. Despite the decentralization of the Brazilian educational system that occurred in the 1990s (Da Mota 2008), with which most of the responsibility for primary education was attributed to municipalities, few studies take municipalities into account when studying student achievement. Among them, Ceneviva (2010) and Leme et al. (2009) measured the effect of municipal management on student achievement and Soares and Alves (2013) analyzed the effect of schools and municipalities on the inequality of the educational results. Studies that investigate the effect of human capital in the neighborhood are commonly found in the literature. Such studies focus on assessing how performance and economic growth are influenced by the performance of nearby localities (Easterly and Levine 1995; Moreno and Trehan 1997; Ramos et al. 2010; Rosenthal and Strange 2008; Moretti, 2004; Beeson and Montgomer 1993). Case and Rosen (1993) provide evidence to show US government spending is positively affected by neighboring states. Spatial technological interdependence has also been explored by Ertur and Koch (2007). Most of the Brazilian empirical studies related to the spatial effect of human capital have focused on the relation with economic growth, productivity and wages of the neighboring regions (Silveira Neto 2001; Magalhães et al. 2005). Research quality and innovation spillovers (Anselin et al. 1997) as well as the university–industry linkage (Garcia, Araujo and Mascarini 2013) have also been analyzed. Notwithstanding the importance of human capital in the context of regional disparities and the significant amount of research that has sought to understand the determinants of school performance in Brazilian education, there has been little effort to investigate the distribution and spatial effect of educational quality. Hence, there is a lack of research regarding the effect of the quality of human capital in neighboring regions. Although the role of location has been explored from many perspectives, the role of spatial dependence on the performance of the Brazilian students requires further investigation. Given the importance of location, and recognizing that proximity facilitates the exchange of information and knowledge, the present study seeks to contribute toward filling that gap in the literature. Taking the hypothesis that the direct impacts of HEI on local school achievements is unknown (we supposed to be positive, if any) and that the spatial scale of the impact is even more difficult to predict, this paper tries to specify these issues decomposing the effects in the local and neighboring municipalities. Thus, the main aim is to investigate if the quality of higher education has any effect on the school student achievement. For that sake, we use spatial econometric models, which permit the study of externalities, thus allowing us to identify if the variables used in the model of a given region have spillover effects in neighboring regions. In this field, the noteworthy study by Ertur and Koch (2007) shows that the knowledge accumulated in a given country depends on the knowledge accumulated in neighboring countries. In estimating a model of technological interdependence, the authors found that the stock of knowledge in one country generates externalities that can cross national boundaries and affect other countries, and that this effect decreases with geographic distance. The authors attribute this spatial reflex to ‘learning by doing.’ Given the importance of Ertur and Koch’s study (2007) and considering that it focused on the stock of human capital, the present study seeks to contribute to the debate regarding the importance of the spatial dependence in educational quality by analyzing the proficiency scores of schools, a variable closely related to the quality of teaching. In addition to testing the effect of the quality of HEI on the performance of schools in local and neighboring municipalities, it is also important to test the potential autocorrelation with the socioeconomic and cultural particularities of Brazilian municipalities. The inclusion of these aspects is important due to the heterogeneities of size, family background, gender composition for, example. From the theoretical perspective, we adopted an educational production function which is used to identify the existing relationship between a series of inputs to the educational process and its product. We go further in comparison with previous studies by including the quality of higher education as an input. The importance of analyzing educational quality is highlighted in the studies by Hanushek and Kimko (2000), according to whom a good educational system does not only arise from the stock of years of study, but also from the quality of teaching. Thus, the present study proposes to carry out an analysis of the spatiality of education with a focus on its quality. That is, it seeks to investigate if the spillover effect of human capital stock identified by Ertur and Koch (2007) is also found in the quality of education in Brazilian municipalities. In addition, it seeks to establish if there is educational spillover through higher education, through better qualified teachers. In other words, whether higher education influences school education in the respective municipality and neighboring municipalities. The study has 6 sections. Following this introduction: Sect. 2 presents the data used and the descriptive statistics; Sect. 3 describes the methodology; Sect. 4 section details the methods adopted in the spatial matrix analysis; Sect. 5 discusses the results found; and finally, Sect. 6 contains the closing remarks.",2
66.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,15 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-020-01021-2,A regional decomposition of US housing prices and volume: market dynamics and Portfolio diversification,April 2021,Nikolaos Antonakakis,Ioannis Chatziantoniou,David Gabauer,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Investigating housing market conditions has gained much prominence over time, especially in the years that followed the global financial crisis (GFC). To a certain extent, the housing market (i) is closely related to developments in the business cycle (Leamer 2007), (ii) provides a channel for monetary policy (Mishkin 2007), and (iii) lies at the epicenter of research in relation to asset bubbles (Shiller 2014). In this regard, a thorough investigation of the factors that fashion developments within the housing market not only facilitates our understanding of the broader economy, but also contributes to effective policy decision making. In light of this rather versatile role of housing markets in economic developments, this study provides new evidence on housing market dynamics, in connection with four US regional housing markets, that is, Midwest, Northeast, South, and West, for the period between January 1990 and March 2019. More importantly, this study considers two different metrics of housing market conditions (i.e., both housing prices and transactions volume) and further investigates their respective interaction in order to provide both policy recommendations and portfolio diversification insights. Starting with the consideration of the interaction between different spatial units, existing literature has shown keen interest in identifying common trends or sources of influence across separate geographical regions. In point of fact, research in this field is being conducted at different levels of disaggregation (i.e., country level, regional level, city level, etc.), and typically, the overriding objective is to identify potential strong correlations between the housing prices (i.e., the most popular metric of housing market conditions) of different spatial units. In short, authors in this area purport to identify the underlying transmission mechanism (i.e., the ripple effect) that determines housing market developments and interrelations within a given geographical space. Recent examples of relevant studies that analyze the ripple effect include, among others, Miao et al. (2011), Barros et al. (2012), Payne (2012), Yunus and Swanson (2013), Brady (2014), Kallberg et al. (2014), Chiang and Tsai (2016), Füss and Zietz (2016), Pijnenburg (2017), and Antonakakis et al. (2018). All aforementioned studies provide useful insights in connection with the respective interrelations. What is more, it should be stressed early on that there is strong evidence that integration across different geographical areas has been intensified after 2005, that is, immediately before the 2006 prices peak and the subsequent collapse of the market. Turning to the interaction between housing prices and transactions (i.e., sales) volume, it should be noted that, although most studies in the field predicate their analysis merely upon one metric of housing market conditions (i.e., housing prices), there is also a rather scarce, strand of the housing market literature that further considers the interaction between housing prices and sales (i.e., transactions) volume. The rationale underpinning this choice of study is closely related to well-established research that focuses on the relationship between prices and volume in financial markets (see, inter alia, Bessembinder and Seguin 1993; Campbell et al. 1993; Chen et al. 2001; Statman et al. 2006). Arguably, the recent financialization of the housing market has clearly paved the path for analyses of this persuasion. Within the territory of this relatively scarce strand of the literature, Shi et al. (2010) conduct a study using urban area data on New Zealand and provide evidence that causality between the two metrics is rather evident in the long run, while the direction of the causality is from the volume toward price. What is more, Oikarinen (2012) making use of data for Finland provides empirical support to the argument that demand shocks are followed by a much more immediate response from sales volume, compared to that from prices. In addition, De Wit et al. (2013) investigate the relationship between prices and volume for the Netherlands showing that shocks in the mortgage rate will have an immediate impact on volume and a rather gradual impact on price. Finally, authors such as Tsai (2014) and Cook and Watson (2018) investigate this nexus for the UK housing market. More particularly, Tsai (2014) underscores that the long run relationship between the two metrics is rather constant, while Cook and Watson (2018) emphasize the volatility-reduction properties of transaction volume. With reference to the US market which is also the focal point of the present study, one of the most interesting academic articles concerning both metrics of US housing market conditions is that of Clayton et al. (2010), who predicating upon a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework and a large sample of US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the period 1990 to 2002 provide empirical evidence that both metrics are affected by developments in the labor, the stock, and the mortgage market, while the extent of that influence is also a function of the degree of elasticity of supply within each specific geographical area. Furthermore, Clayton et al. (2010) show that for the period under investigation there appears to be both positive correlation between the two metrics and bidirectional Granger causality (pointing out that prices cause short-run asymmetric effects and that volume has a short-run effect only in markets characterized by inelastic supply). More recently, Tsai (2018) applies the Diebold and Yılmaz (2014) framework to find that there is negative correlation between the two metrics, while Tsai (2019) utilizing a Granger causality framework shows that there is a lead–lag relationship between the two metrics only during turbulent periods. Apart from exogenous shocks that can be reflected upon the responses from both housing market metrics, other efforts aiming to further investigate the lead–lag relationship between the two involve monetary policy decision making and speculation. The influence of monetary policy on the housing market has been particularly underscored by Leamer (2015) who argues that monetary policy is indeed a key determinant of housing market developments and that the housing boom that ended in 2005 was in fact the result of the (unfitting) accommodative monetary policy that followed the business downturn of 2000–2001, expediting housing supply that would have otherwise been spread more evenly across time. Speculation in the housing market has been mainly investigated from a theoretical point of view. For instance, DeFusco et al. (2017) concentrate on the speculative character of transactions volume. More particularly, DeFusco et al. (2017) provide a theoretical model of the US housing market and suggest that large-scale fluctuations in transactions volume can be conducive to price bubbles, emphasizing the role of short-term investors. DeFusco et al. (2017) also argue in favor of a lead–lag relationship between volume and prices, whereupon volume fluctuations typically lead changes in prices. It should be noted that the presence of speculation in the housing market during housing market expansions that results in increased levels of transactions has also been reported in the theoretical work of Burnside et al. (2016). In retrospect, this study considers two different metrics of US housing market conditions, that is, housing prices and sales (or transactions) volume. We then utilize monthly data on four US regional housing markets, namely Midwest, Northeast, South, and West, for the period between January 1990 and March 2019. Our main research hypotheses are (i) that housing prices and sales volume interaction across the four regions of the study is indeed dynamic and changes over time and (ii) that the dynamic character of this relationship is instrumental for the development of effective diversification strategies. The contribution of the study is threefold. First, this is the first study to investigate housing market conditions, captured by price and volume, that utilizes a decomposed, region-specific, time-varying parameters (TVP) framework. Second, we thoroughly investigate the interaction of both metrics over time and across regions and reach valuable conclusions for both policy makers and risk managers. Third, we provide preliminary evidence from a portfolio diversification exercise in order to highlight that the dynamic relationship across the regions under investigation could in fact provide opportunities for hedging. As far as the connectedness method is concerned, the TVP framework substantially improves the standard rolling-window approach to spillover analysis [i.e., in the spirit of Diebold and Yılmaz (2014)], since there is no loss of observations, no need to arbitrarily set the rolling-window size, and the results are not sensitive to outliers. Monte Carlo simulations given by Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017) provide further evidence regarding the added value of the particular approach. In turn, we employ the connectedness decomposition methodology introduced by Gabauer and Gupta (2018). The adoption of this particular approach offers further insights in the dynamics of both, across regions (i.e., single-metric analysis) and across metrics (i.e., cross-metrics analysis). Considering policy makers and risk managers, our approach allows for attaining a better understanding (i) of the specific conditions that are conducive to a lead–lag relation between the two metrics and (ii) of the extent of integration across regions (that may not necessarily by adjoined). Main findings show that the lead–lag relationship between price and volume depends on the broader economic conditions. That is, during turbulent economic periods, sales volume drives developments in the US housing market, while housing prices drive sales during more tranquil periods. Considering the second issue, results are suggestive of the fact that the South appears to be a persistent net transmitter of both prices and volume housing market shocks, while the Northeast, a net receiver. However, all four regions may eventually assume any of the two roles depending on the time interval, signifying that linkages are neither merely constrained between adjoining geographical areas, nor time invariant. Our findings are relevant for policy makers and regulators, as well as risk managers investigating potential portfolio diversification opportunities. As a final step in our analysis and in order to provide evidence of the potential for portfolio diversification opportunities, we consider four distinct portfolio techniques, that is, the hedge ratio (HR), optimal bilateral portfolio (OBP), the minimum variance portfolio (MVP), and the minimum correlation portfolio (MCP). Respective portfolio techniques are evaluated by their performance according to the hedging effectiveness and Sharpe ratio indicating that combinations of US regions within the same portfolio result in superior performance. In turn, this is suggestive of the fact that finance professionals such as portfolio managers but also investors should strongly consider the dynamic relationship across US regions which is thoroughly presented and explained in this study and purport to reflect this when making investment decisions and create portfolios. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect.  2, we present the data and the adopted empirical method. Then, in Sects. 3 and 4, we present the findings of the study and discuss the relevant market and portfolio implications. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the study.",4

In this context, urban agglomeration dynamics sustained by the inflows of rural migrants has been considered in the literature as one of the main factors boosting the process of urban development, alongside drivers such as capital accumulation and quality of the institutions (Rodriguez-Pose and Zhang 2019; Jixiang et al. 2015; Henderson and Wang 2007; Henderson 2003; Black and Henderson 1999). Although several studies investigated the push and pull factors affecting migration mechanisms from rural to urban areas,Footnote 1 as well as the characterization of both urban (Henderson et al. 2019; Bo 2019; DaMata 2007) and rural (Cui et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2018; Cheng et al. 2016) hierarchies, few analyses in the regional science literature have considered the connections between the rural sector and the process of urban development (Brueckner and Lall 2015; Ward and Brown 2009). Particularly, some of the more recent studies analyzing the impact of migration on the processes of urban agglomeration and growth have focused mostly on the city-level dynamics of output production and productivity (see, e.g., Lee 2015; Jixiang et al. 2015; Posada and Moreno-Monroy 2017; Arcalean et al. 2019), refraining from characterizing the rural area and the modeling of rural-to-urban migration.Footnote 2 As a result, despite the substantial body of research on the causes of migration underlying the rural labor supply, little is known on the linkage between the latter and the process of city development; thus, key questions on what socioeconomic factors determine urban hierarchies in the process of urban development, and how they do so, remain largely unaddressed (Ward and Brown 2009; Xiangchun and Sasaki 2008). An exception is Brueckner’s study (1990), which models the relationship between rural-to-urban migration and urban agglomeration by providing a spatial characterization to both the urban and the rural areas.Footnote 3 For this, Brueckner adopts some of the standard assumptions in the Alonso–Muth–Mills model, introducing a city center [or central business district (CBD)] around which the urban and the rural areas develop according to a concentric pattern. The author then relies on the classical hypothesis of rural–urban income differentials triggering migration,Footnote 4 and introduces urban and rural land rents as equilibrating forces; specifically, the latter are used to proxy for the increases in the cost of living with increased proximity to the city center, which influences the migration decision. Eventually, the level of urban agglomeration results to be inversely related to the rural–urban income ratio. Two subsequent contributions of Brueckner and Zenou (1999) and Brueckner and Kim (2001) extended this work by including the urban unemployment rate in Brueckner’s (1990) monocentric-city model as an additional equilibrating driver of rural-to-urban migration. Ultimately, the contribution of these studies is to describe the linkage between urban and rural economies from a spatial perspective, and providing a characterization of both the city and the countryside to analyze the processes of rural-to-urban migration and urban agglomeration. Partridge and Rickman (2008) highlight that it is important to consider the distance of the rural labor supply from the urban area in order to examine the impact of rural migration on city agglomeration. In this perspective, the inclusion of spatial variables (land rents) whose effect on workers’ income is modeled as a function of the distance from the CBD allows to overcome the simplistic assumption of considering the city and the countryside as mere abstract locations. The spatial characterization introduced in these studies is in fact borrowed from a prominent strand in the urban economic literature which since the seminal contributions of Alonso (1964), Muth (1969) and Mills (1967), models the size and structure of the urban environment from a spatial standpoint.Footnote 5 Nevertheless, despite their noteworthy contribution to the literature, these spatially characterized models of rural-to-urban migration have some limitations. First, they focus solely on the effect of migration on urban agglomeration, but do not investigate the effect of the relationship between agglomeration, and hence migration, on urban growth. In addition, these models are static in nature, i.e., they predict the fixed shares of the eventual urban and rural populations, but ignore the different paces of long-run city growth and urban agglomeration to which the urban economy could converge at the steady-state level (Brueckner and Lall 2015).Footnote 6 Second, these models overlook the important relationship between city growth and the spatial distribution of economic activities in the surrounding rural areas captured by agglomeration benefits and radiation effects (Jin-li 2003); such effects include all those positive urban externalities (or productivity spillovers) exerted by industrial, technological, and educational activities, which are propagated by the city to the surrounding countryside (Asher et al. 2019; Duvivier 2013). These spillovers have been proven to exert a positive effect on rural workers’ incomes, with those rural areas closer to the city reaping higher benefits compared to more remote regions (Duvivier 2013; Partridge and Rickman 2008). The empirical literature suggests that urban productivity spillovers can spread to nearby rural areas in several ways; for instance, through productivity opportunities for rural firms able to access urban input markets, and through access to rural output markets by urban firms (Junjie and Gopinath 2008). Additional dissemination channels involve diffusion of urban innovations leading to reduced rural-to-urban transport and commuting costs (Kilkenny 1998; Partridge 2007), expansion of urban credit markets and better financial services provision in rural areas (Haggblade et al. 2007), promotion of urban touristic activities in the countryside (Dai 2017), etc. In light of the above, the aim in this paper is to overcome the shortcomings of previous studies by developing a refined rural-to-urban migration framework to examine the effect exerted by the rural labor supply (and its underlying migration drivers) on the processes of urban agglomeration and city growth. To do this, we extend Brueckner’s (1990) model and combine it with the features of agglomeration and city growth highlighted in the urban literature to develop a dynamic spatial model of rural-to-urban migration, which provides a spatial characterization of both the rural and the urban areas. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, in order to provide a more solid characterization of the link between the urban and the rural areas, we draw on Brueckner (1990) by additionally taking into account the presence of an urban productivity spillover besides rural land rents. Building on the findings in the empirical literature, we posit that the positive effect of the spillover on workers’ incomes increases with proximity to the city. In addition, we analyze the nexus between urban agglomeration and rural-to-urban migration comparing two different migration scenarios, namely unplanned versus planned migration, to assess whether our modeling of the spatial relationship between the urban and rural areas has an impact on the level of optimal urban congestion in these two scenarios. Subsequently, we adopt a dynamic perspective to examine the relationship between migration and agglomeration with urban development, drawing on the hypotheses in Fujishima (2013), Duranton and Puga (2004), Bertinelli and Black (2004), Black and Henderson (1999) and Zhang (1994). These studies build on classical endogenous theories of urban growth (see Lucas 1988) and assume that human capital accumulation and urban agglomeration are two major forces driving city growth. In particular, we follow Duranton and Puga (2004), Black and Henderson (1999) and Zhang (1994) to model the process of human capital accumulation in the urban area, which increases in  proximity to the city center; then, as in Fujishima (2013), we consider the effect of negative congestion externalities in the city provoked by an excessive degree of urban agglomeration. Finally, we follow Bertinelli and Black (2004) to study how the urban growth process evolves over time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we outline the model, discussing the spatial properties of the urban and the rural areas. Then, we analyze the optimal levels of urban congestion conditioned by the impact of the spatial variables of rural land rents and urban productivity spillover, distinguishing between two scenarios of unplanned and planned rural-to-urban migration. Subsequently, we study the long-run dynamic process of city growth conditioned by human capital accumulation and level of urban agglomeration. Finally, Sect. 3 concludes the paper.",1
66.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,21 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-020-01029-8,Regional subsidies and interregional labor movement,June 2021,Daisuke Matsuzaki,Yoshiyasu Ono,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A majority of Japan’s local regions, including prefectures, cities, towns, and villages, receive lump-sum grants and subsidies from the central government. These grants can be allocated as direct lump-sum transfers to the region’s natives or as subsidies that stimulate local economic activities and immigration. A typical example of such grants and subsidies is tax allocation grants (chiho kofu zei). In 2019, the Japanese government distributed approximately 16.2 trillion yen of tax allocation grants across numerous local regions. Each region is given discretion to determine how the funds are spent.Footnote 1 The choice between lump-sum transfers to the regions’ natives and stimulation subsidies has a critical impact upon local welfare. Therefore, in this study, we examine if native households in a recipient region are better off when lump-sum transfers are replaced by stimulation subsidies. We adopt a two-region, two-factor, two-commodity model, in which a subsidy-recipient region produces only one commodity, while in a donor region, two commodities are produced. Each region may experience full employment or some unemployment, with workers able to migrate between regions in pursuit of higher utility. The welfare of native households in each region is contingent on the factor intensity of the local industry and the employment conditions of the two regions. Welfare is affected by the subsidies through changes in terms of trade, interregional migration, and local employment. We examine the welfare effects of a subsidy replacement on various combinations of employment conditions and factor intensity as both factors vary depending on region and period in Japan. This analysis may also apply to interregional subsidies and transfers that exist in many other countries. The equalization subsidies literature has explored the welfare effects of regional subsidies in the context of interregional migration. For example, Flatters et al. (1974), Boadway and Flatters (1982), and Wildasin (1986) focus on negative externalities attributable to the congestion of local public goods and explore migration subsidies that promote the optimal interregional allocation of households. Albouy (2012) extends Boadway and Flatters’ model by introducing household income heterogeneity. However, these studies ignore unemployment. By contrast, our study examines the welfare effects of replacing direct transfers with subsidies promoting local employment, production, and immigration on the recipient and donor regions under a variety of employment conditions. Harris and Todaro (1970) were the first to model the combination of local unemployment and interregional migration. Their model is based on an economy with a rural and an urban area. Both areas specialize in different commodities. The rural area achieves full employment, whereas the urban area faces unemployment due to wage rigidity. Their results indicate that urban job creation leads to higher urban unemployment (the Todaro paradox). The authors further analyze the effects of urban employment subsidies and immigration restrictions on social welfare. Several studies have since extended the Harris–Todaro model by introducing factors including perfect or imperfect capital mobility, labor market monopsony, land market, urban pollution, corruption, and microeconomic foundations on wage rigidity (i.e., efficiency wage and search matching) and have explored the validity and extensions of the model (e.g., Bhagwati and Srinivasan 1974; Corden and Findlay 1975; Nakagome 1989; Raimondos 1993; Brueckner and Kim 2001; Sato 2004; Basu 2004; Choi and Yu 2010; Tawada and Sun 2010; Pi and Zhou 2015). Our analysis differs from the Harris–Todaro model literature in three ways. First, while the existing models focus on social welfare, our model considers local development and regional welfare distribution.Footnote 2 Second, we account for unemployment in both the recipient and donor regions because in Japan, unemployment in recipient regions tends to be more severe than that which exists in donor regions. We consider all combinations of unemployment and full employment in the two regions. Finally, rather than assuming perfect specialization in both regions, we hypothesize that the recipient region produces only one commodity, while the donor region produces two commodities, and hence, the Heckscher–Ohlin mechanism works. In this setting, replacing a non-distortionary lump-sum transfer with subsidies to stimulate economic activities creates a terms-of-trade effect in addition to an employment expansion effect in one or both regions depending on the employment conditions.",

It is connected with a loss of qualified labour force, decrease in consumption, suboptimal use of housing and city infrastructure, decrease in investments and many other negative effects (see e.g. Kühn and Liebmann 2012; Silverman et al. 2012; Moss 2008; Schilling and Logan 2008) resulting in a limited development potential, which can further strengthen the out-migration. Some large cities, such as Hong Kong (DeGolyer 2008) and Beijing (Anderlini 2013), report out-migration driven by environmental factors. Emerging empirical body on environmental migration suggests that pollution is a significant predictor for international and interregional migration flows (Šulák 2019; Li et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2017; Xu and Sylwester 2016; Hsieh and Liu 1983), but its role for a city out-migration is understudied. Therefore, this article aims at providing new evidence on the importance of pollution for potential out-migration from large cities. The research design and data employed in this article provide it with some features that make it advantageous and different from the other studies: First, data on the working population of Ostrava, Czech Republic, are employed in this article. Ostrava is the third largest city in the country (292,681 inhabitants in 2016) that suffers from both (a) highly polluted air (Fig. 1) and other environmental damage connected with the presence of heavy industry and its mining history (health issues of Ostrava’s inhabitants connected with the adverse natural environment are discussed in Dostal et al. 2013 or Šrám et al. 2013), and (b) net out-migration every year since the fall of communism in 1989 (Rumpel et al. 2013; Rumpel and Slach 2012); it lost − 4.5‰ of its population every year during the last decade, compared to other Czech regional cities reporting net migration ranging from − 2.3 to + 7.7‰ of their population (CZSO 2018). Analysing data from a large industrial city makes findings presented in this article highly relevant to cities facing similar problems (for instance Beijing and Hong Kong with even higher levels of pollutionFootnote 1 have already been mentioned). Moreover, the focus on working population further increases their importance, as employees and self-employed individuals represent a crucial factor of economic development of any city. Air pollution in the Czech Republic. Source: CZHI (2016), authors. Note: Selected pollutants, usually with serious health effects, illustrate relative air quality in Ostrava. For information on other pollutants, such as PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, benzene and heavy metals, see CZHI (2016) Second, focus on migration intentions makes it possible to assume only one probable causal relationship, despite applying cross section analysis in this article. It can be rationally expected that the pollution affects the migration plans of individuals, not vice versa. It can be noted that the causal relationship is not obvious when real migration behaviour is used, as pollution may lead to migration (see the next section for literature review) as well as migration to pollution (this causality is discussed by both theoretical and empirical literature; see Zhang 2019; Pan and Zhou 2013; Ma and Hofmann 2018, 2019; Price and Feldmeyer 2012; Squalli 2009, 2010). Moreover, migration intentions represent not only an important signal for decision-makers, but also a statistically significant predictor of real migration behaviour (see Lu 1999; DeJong 2000; Van Dalen and Henkens 2013; Chort 2014; Kley 2017; Gödri and Feleky 2017 for evidence), which further support their use as a dependent variable. Third, this article examines the role of environmental quality not only on binary migration decision to stay or leave, which is a dominant approach in empirical body on this topic, but it distinguishes different migration strategies and estimates the impact of pollution on each of them. This provides an additional contribution to earlier studies on this topic. Fourth, as the migration decision is, according to the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991), determined by a number of subjective factors, this article focuses on an influence of subjective perception of environmental quality on different migration strategies. Although objective data on pollution are limited at the level of a city, the predictive power of subjective and objective measures of environmental quality on migration intentions is discussed as well. It shows that the predictive power of different measures differs across migration strategies, which provides useful information for designing environmental research in future. In addition, employing subjective measures of pollution is rare in the research on environmental migration (Lu et al. 2018 represents the only article, which authors are aware of) and thus this paper represents a contribution to the literature on this understudied topic. Sensitivity of the out-migration strategies to natural environment satisfaction among different groups of labour force is another topic examined in this article. The contribution of this article consists namely in providing the first rigorous evidence on the role of environmental quality in city out-migration intentions from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in considering different migration strategies and measures of pollution bringing deeper understanding of environment-driven migration. This knowledge, together with evidence from China, may have strong implications for a development and environmental policy of many large cities. In addition, this article provides also relevant information for designing future research on this topic. Migration and its determinants have been intensively examined for many decades due to their impact on population dynamics, structure of labour force and economic development. Early studies focused mainly on the role of economic factors. They suggest that migration is driven by its costs and benefits approximated by differences in wages and unemployment between origin and destination regions (Pedersen et al. 2006), geographical distance, migrants’ networks (Pedersen et al. 2008), social capital (Huber and Mikula 2019), cultural and linguistic distance (Adsera and Pytliková 2015) or psychological costs such as loss of friends and fatherland (Massey et al. 1993). Later, attention was paid to the effect of institutions and political factors, e.g. immigration and labour market laws (Ortega and Peri 2012), institutions reforms (Guzi and Mikula 2018), civil liberties or violent conflicts (Naudé 2009, 2010). The research has also paid more and more attention to environmental factors, such as environmental degradation, weather-related crop failures (Feng et al. 2012), sea level rise, extreme weather (Cai et al. 2016) and natural disasters (Mueller et al. 2014). However, there is still relatively small empirical body on environmental pollution and its effect on migration. Xu and Sylwester (2016) examined a relationship between air pollution (approximated by PM2.5) and international migration from low- and middle-income countries to OECD countries. They showed that pollution is a significant, although not dominant, factor as to why people migrate, especially in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe. Evidence on interregional migration in the Czech Republic is, however, somewhat ambiguous. Fidrmuc and Huber (2007) found no statistically significant relationship between air quality (approximated by a sum of solids, SO2 and NOX per km2) and willingness to interregional migration in 1998. On the other hand, Šulák (2019), using data from years 1993–2015, found high statistical significance of different approximation of air quality (PM10, CO, SO2, NOX and their average) on real migration between Czech regions. A similar discrepancy can also be found in the case of interregional migration in USA. Cebula and Vedder (1973) identified cold temperature as a significant predictor of migration in USA in the period 1960–1968, but not air pollution (approximated by particulate matters). A decade later, environmental and social factors (see Liu 1976 for their definitions) were identified as the most important determinants of interregional migration in the both short and long term (Hsieh and Liu 1983). Growing importance of environmental factors for individuals’ well-being over time (explaining the significant role of pollution in later studies) or relatively small differences in air pollution within one country (explaining its insignificance) may represent a possible explanation of these results. However, the analysis in this article suggests that the motivation behind migration decisions (and its changes during business cycle), as well as the operationalization of the ‘migration’ and ‘pollution’ employed in the empirical studies can also represent factors affecting the significance of environmental quality on migration. On the other hand, the empirical literature provides clear evidence from China, where air pollution represents a serious problem. Particularly, the most polluted cities, such as Beijing (Anderlini 2013) and Hong Kong (DeGolyer 2008), report an exodus of highly educated labour force and big difficulties with recruiting international experts caused by unfavourable environmental conditions. A survey carried out in Hong Kong (DeGolyer 2008) suggests that approximately 8% of inhabitants are planning to leave the city or seriously considering moving due to air pollution, especially those with more education, skills and money. Brain drain is not, however, the only cost of air pollution. Health problems and premature deaths, frequent absence at work, medical costs, lost productivity from unreported illness and subjectively perceived discomfort represent some others. Li et al. (2017) proved that air pollution (approximated by PM2.5) is a highly significant determinant of interregional migration in China. The same conclusion was made by Chen et al. (2017), who found out that migration of women and educated people is more sensitive to air pollution (approximated by PM2.5 and SO2). In addition, Quin and Zhu (2018) showed that a decrease in air quality leads to an increase in online searches on ‘emigration’ next day. All these articles employ a level of different air pollutants for measuring air quality. However, the perception of the same environmental pollution differs among individuals, due to differences in their information on pollution level (Stigler 1961), awareness of its negative impact on health, personality traits, etc., which may lead to different migration decisions. This is reflected by behavioural models applied to migration. One of them is the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991, 2011), which postulates three independent determinants of intention to migrate: (a) attitude towards migration representing subjective evaluation of its costs and benefits, (b) subjective norms representing social pressure connected with migration (these two factors correspond to the theory of reasoned action; see Madden et al. 1992) and (c) perceived behavioural control over migration (this factor is compatible with Bandura’s concept of self-efficiency; see Bandura 1986). The intention, together with a control over the action, then determines the real behaviour (Fig. 2). Despite the fact that the mediation effect of migration intentions between attitudes, subjective norms and migration behaviour was empirically confirmed by Gödri and Feleky (2017), many scholars avoid discussing migration intentions as they consider them to be an unreliable approximation of migration behaviour (Constant and Massey 2002). Indeed, the time gap between decision-making on migration and the relocation allows imperfect consistency between migration intentions and behaviour due to changes in the initial conditions or limited financial, psychological and other sources for the migration (i.e. limited control over the action described by the theory of planned behaviour). However, empirical studies confirm theoretical assumptions of the theory of planned behaviour about the causal relationship between migration intentions and behaviour, as they proved migration intentions to be a highly significant predictor of real migration behaviour for both internal and international migration (see Chort 2014; Van Dalen and Henkens 2013; DeJong 2000; Lu 1999; Kley 2017; Gödri and Feleky 2017). To illustrate, Gödri and Feleky (2017) report 72.0% and Van Dalen and Henkens (2013) even 90.7% consistency between an individual’s migration intentions and behaviour. It suggests that migration intentions represent a useful indicator of potential migration, i.e. migration not restricted by a lack of sources, job opportunities in the destination region or other factors, having strong influence on a real migration. Theory of planned behaviour as applied to environmental migration. Source: Ajzen (1991), adapted by authors As the theory of planned behaviour is often used in research on health-related behaviour (e.g. Conner et al. 2003; Sheeran and Taylor 1999; Nguyen et al. 1997; Ajzen and Driver 1992), environmental psychology (Masud et al. 2015; Koger and Winter 2010; Stern 2005) and migration (Li 2019; Kley 2017; Gödri and Feleky 2017; Van Dalen and Henkens 2013), it is applicable also in the research on environmentally driven migration (Van Dalen and Henkens 2013). It can be noted that the health belief model, representing another behavioural model relevant for environmental migration, identifies similar predictors of migration as the theory of planned behaviour. According to the health belief model, environmental migration can be explained by the perceived threat stemming from living in a polluted area, perceived benefits and barriers connected with migration, factors triggering migration behaviour and confidence in ability to migrate (see Groenewold et al. 2012 for details). The empirical literature based on these theoretical frameworks confirms that the subjective perception of environmental quality (Van Dalen and Henkens 2013) or pollution-related health risk (Lu et al. 2018; Groenewold et al. 2012) represents statistically significant migration predictors. Moreover, there is also indirect empirical evidence supporting the importance of subjective factors for environment-driven migration, as air pollution determines an individual’s life satisfaction (Welsch 2002), which subsequently affects migration intentions and behaviour (Lovo 2014; Chindarkar 2014; Ivlevs 2014; Simpson 2013; Blanchflower et al. 2007). This brief overview shows that psychosocial factors belong to the research on environmental migration (concluded also by Groenewold et al. 2012), but are still understudied. Therefore, this article aims to provide evidence on the relationship between subjective perception of environmental quality and out-migration intentions for a large industrial city (controlling for common socio-economic migration determinants). Data from a questionnaire survey on satisfaction with life in Ostrava, Czech Republic (gathered during the period from 3rd to 19th February 2016) are employed in this paper. The survey was performed as a part of preparation of the strategic development plan of the city of Ostrava for years 2017–2023, and its sample size, after purging from incomplete and unreliable responses, was 6807 observations. (See online Appendix for definitions and descriptive statistics of all variables used in this article; questionnaire and source data are available at http://fajnova.cz.) As this paper investigates the relationship between perceived environmental quality and migration intentions of qualified and productive labour force from Ostrava, attention is paid only to respondents (a) with a permanent residence in Ostrava, (b) who reached at least secondary vocational education (ISCED 3C/EQF 3), (c) are employees or self-employed, and (d) are between the ages 18 and 64. The focus on these respondents stems from their crucial role for a development of the city and the need to understand motivation lying behind their migration intentions to prevent their real out-migration.Footnote 2 The sample employed in this paper consists of 3845 observations corresponding to 3.70% of Ostrava’s employed and self-employed population. As the sampling weights were applied, i.e. each observation was weighted by the inverse of its probability of being sampled in order to reach the identical structure of the sample and the relevant population according to the last Population and Housing Census (data provided by the Czech Statistical Office), the sample is representative according to sex, age, educational attainment and employees/self-employed status, including subsamples based on these characteristics. These data were used for an estimation of binomial and multinomial logit models explaining a probability of planning to move out of Ostrava by subjective perception of different aspects of the city, life situation (incl. expectations about the future) and objective characteristics of respondents; see Eq. 1. The dependent variable is approximated by a plan of respondents in 10 following years to (a) not move or move within the city (this option is used as a reference category), (b) move out of Ostrava, but within commuting area, i.e. up to 30 min of travel by car to reach city borders, (c) move outside Ostrava’s commuting area, incl. moving to other country. It is obvious that the first migration strategy, i.e. maintaining the status quo, is the most advantageous for the city of Ostrava. On the other hand, the last one is connected with a permanent loss of productive labour force, decrease in consumption, negative changes of population structure and consequent change in demand for social services, especially in the case of migration of young and highly educated individuals or families with children, a decrease in municipal budget, suboptimal use of housing and city infrastructure, decrease in investments, etc. (see e.g. Kühn and Liebmann 2012; Silverman et al. 2012; Moss 2008; Schilling and Logan 2008), which limits the development potential of the city. Migration to Ostrava’s surrounding area (migration strategy B) represents a middle course consisting in a change of dwelling place, but maintaining the possibility to use the labour market, services and other advantages of Ostrava. In that case, the negative consequences of out-migration on a decrease in labour force and consumption are only partial, as some individuals or family members still participate in the municipal economy, while the others are borne fully. It enables us to examine not only the intentions to move out of Ostrava (migration strategies B and C are merged), but also the factors affecting the selection of particular migration strategies, which was missing in earlier studies. It can be noted that the city of Ostrava represents 90.2% of population of a related NUTS 4 region, and thus the out-migration from Ostrava corresponds well to interregional migration at NUTS 4 level (it makes the results comparable with findings of Fidrmuc and Huber 2007; Šulák 2019). A relatively small perimeter of Ostrava’s commuting area raises questions on (a) necessity of participation in Ostrava’s economy connected with the number of other opportunities for work, study and leisure time activities within this area, which determines an extent of adverse effects of out-migration and thus the rationality of analysing the migration strategy B in this research, (b) potential relevancy of pollution for ‘short-distance’ migration decision. As the city of Ostrava represents the centre of an urban agglomeration, there are six other large towns (20–75 thousand inhabitants, approximately 300 thousand inhabitants in total) in its commuting area, which offer sufficient opportunities for life, study and work. Therefore, even migration to the surrounding area can represent significant losses for Ostrava and limits for its further development. The relevancy of environmental quality for short-distance migration stems from the presence of heavy industry in the city of Ostrava causing high concentration of air pollutants and soil contamination in some districts of the city, damages connected with its mining history and higher level of noise nearby highroads. Even migration within the city can significantly reduce the exposition of an individual to pollutants (e.g. migration between the most and least polluted districts can reduce the annual concentration of particular matters by 1/3 and carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene by ¾; CZHI 2016). Therefore, it can be assumed that the short-distance migration represents a relevant strategy for people with ties to Ostrava City, who prefer living as far from the main sources of pollution as possible. The survey showed that 21.15% of respondents expressed their plan to move out of Ostrava in following 10 years (12.87% to commuting area and 8.27% outside of commuting area), which corresponds well to 17.97% of inhabitants who left Ostrava during last 10 years (CZSO 2018). Knowledge of factors increasing the propensity to move is, therefore, crucial for understanding reasons lying beyond migration flows from Ostrava. Subjective assessment of the city was done in two steps: First, respondents were asked to express their satisfaction with Ostrava City in general on a scale of 0–100% (answer ‘no opinion’ was not allowed). After saving their answer, they were asked to express their satisfaction with its particular characteristics. Only characteristics potentially related to migration intentions or behaviour (see previous section for a review of empirical literature) are further considered. They are: housing market (mean satisfaction 59.8%), work opportunities (46.8%), safety (42.6%) and natural environment (28.8%); the mean satisfaction with the city of Ostrava is 65.0%. It can be noted that answers ‘no opinion’ were treated as missing values and were replaced by the variable means calculated for corresponding respondents’ groups defined by sex, age, educational attainment and employee/self-employed status, as statistically significant differences in satisfaction with natural environment and other city characteristics were found across these groups (95.8% of observations had no missing values, 3.4% of observations had 1 missing value, and 0.8% of observations had 2 missing values; no observations with more than 2 missing values were used for the estimations). Does satisfaction with the above-stated aspects represent a relevant approximation of the city environment? The value of Cronbach’s alpha (0.73) suggests that these variables measure the same construct. In addition, the exploratory factor analysis identified only one underlying factor with eigenvalue higher than 1 (the factor explains 55.44% of the total variance of satisfaction with the city aspects), which correlates with the overall satisfaction with Ostrava City (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.5776). These results support the use of these variables as an approximation of urban environment. Not only the city characteristics, but also the actual life situation of the respondents, approximated by employment and housing, is important for their migration intentions. Therefore, respondents were asked to state their labour market status (employee or self-employed) and express expectations from their career development in the following 3–5 years period. The positive career development (14.65% of respondents) was approximated by promotion (employees) or hiring new employees (self-employed persons), neutral development (61.91%) was approximated by no significant changes, and negative development (5.14%) was connected with dismissal (employees) or significant reduction in employees (self-employed persons). As these categories were connected only with the current career path, an additional category ‘change’ (18.31%) was defined for individuals, who expect voluntary leave from current employer or closure of the business. Respondents provided also information on the type of their current housing. It can be noted that the type of housing is significantly related to the satisfaction with it, as owners of houses and flats were more satisfied (mean level of 82.11% and 76.99%, respectively) than respondents living in rental housing (64.98%). Although information on satisfaction with current housing is available for all respondents, the types of housing are used. This decision was driven mainly by a possible impact of the city environment on the satisfaction with current housing, although its correlation with satisfaction with particular aspects of the city was relatively low. All empirical models in this article were checked for a specification error (link test), multicollinearity (VIF statistics) and goodness of fit (Hosmer and Lemeshow’s goodness-of-fit test). In addition, the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption (tested by Hausman–McFadden test) was checked in the case of multinomial logit model. However, the definition of the dependent variable itself allows us to assume migration alternatives as independent (see McFadden 1974), even when there are doubts about the relevancy of IIA tests (see e.g. Cheng and Long 2007; Fry and Harris 1996, 1998). The stability of estimations was further supported by a check for empty and small cells.",4

The presence of spatially nonindependent observations causes serious problems in quantitative analysis, since the sample contains less information than a counterpart with independent spatial elements, and, moreover, the concept of the random sample is violated, as Schabenberger and Gotway (2005) have indicated. Therefore, any conventional statistical inference will produce unreliable results, unless spatial dependence is incorporated to the model, as it happens in time-series data with time autocorrelation. For this reason, a spatial sample should be considered as a realization of a spatial process and not as a random sample, as in time-series analysis. The traditional Box and Jenkins (1976) methodology for time-series analysis has been extended to spatial analysis as an effort to model spatial dependence between observations of the same variable. Likewise, spatial correlograms and spatial partial correlograms are constructed, using the Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation coefficient or some other measures that have been proposed as presented by Cliff and Ord (1981), to identify the most adequate spatial generation mechanism of an observed dataset. However, diagrams may often be unable to identify correctly the underlying mechanism producing in that sense confusing results, as in time-series analysis, where this issue of selecting the best fitted model is addressed by several information criteria. Hence, it will be very interesting to examine and evaluate the performance of the three most often used in practice information criteria in spatial analysis, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan and Quinn information criterion (HQC), in terms of selecting pure spatial processes. Indeed, the behavior of these criteria has been investigated thoroughly in the literature for time-series processes and regression models but not for spatial models, if you exclude the studies of Hoeting et al. (2006) and Lee and Ghosh (2008) in which they considered geostatistical models, i.e., models used for point-referenced geostatistical data that incorporate the dependence applied to a covariance function that determines the relationship for observations at different distance locations. Using a Monte Carlo analysis, this study finds that these information criteria can successfully contribute to spatial modeling, although their overall behavior depends not only on the sample size but also on the magnitude of the spatial parameters of the true generating processes. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 depicts the most important spatial processes that will be considered for the simulation analysis and presents the three aforementioned information criteria. Section 3 describes the design of the simulation analysis and discusses the results. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 4.",2

One factor influencing economic performance is the evolution of the industrial structure toward more knowledge-intensive activities, including the so-called cognitive cultural economy (Scott 2014). Western economies and specifically the European Union are making efforts to become knowledge-based economies. To design appropriate urban policies that attract or strengthen knowledge-intensive industries, it is a prerequisite to identify local pre-conditions that are conducive for knowledge-intensive business foundation and growth processes. In modern economies, the State constantly intervenes in technological development and the allure of high technology has sparked several policies to create or initiate innovativeness in peripheral areas or regions to upgrade the technical capability of local firms. There are numerous different cases in which the public sector enters into relationships with private corporations; the only significant distinction is in their apparent efficacy and the methods employed.Footnote 1 The observation that within a number of countries, employment in a wide range of industries is geographically localized, together with evidence that such concentration appear to generate productivity spillovers, has led to debate about whether there is a role for policy in promoting cluster development.Footnote 2 Often, innovative activity occurs inside industrial clusters and tends to stimulate the formation of new businesses, leading to ongoing growth in entrepreneurial activity. Virtuous cycles of growth result as the number of producers’ increases and local growth accelerates, leading to deepening of localized increasing returns and intensification of agglomeration. Several theories have been proposed to explain how knowledge-based regions emerge: the regional version of the product cycle theory, the long wave theory, the theory of flexible production and specialization, the industrial districts theory, the innovative milieu theory, and the network approach theory (Sternberg 1996). Each theoretical approach has specific strengths and weaknesses; nevertheless, none succeeds in explaining, in unambiguous terms, the source of a high-tech region’s development. An “eclectic” theory that combines convincing aspects of the abovementioned theories may offer the best approach to the problem (Hall 1990). Generally, studies on entrepreneurship and industrial dynamics pay little attention to the role of location (Scott 1995; Parker 2005). During the past decade, the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (Acs et al. 2009; Audretsch et al. 2006) suggested that, ceteris paribus, the entrepreneurial activity tends to be significant where knowledge endowments are high. New firms will begin using un-commercialized knowledge from other firms and universities. A new firm that uses external knowledge can leverage its capital knowledge by standing on the shoulders of giants (Audretsch et al. 2006). This paper analyzes the preeminence of the conventional theory of agglomeration to explain cluster formation by estimating the role of two sources of intra-metropolitan knowledge spillovers on companies’ location choices. We test for the relevance of two types of knowledge spillovers, those that spillover from other firms, determining the distance threshold for them to operate, and those stemming from research universities. The disagreement on the spatial range of knowledge spillovers and their impact on new business locations is due to limitations in the theory of linkages between space, firms, and data availability (Raspe and van Oort 2011). Most prior work in the industrial location literature uses areal measures of location based on administrative boundaries which are exogenously and arbitrarily defined. If knowledge spillovers operate via face-to-face contacts, its geographic scope could be limited, and even the municipality may not be an appropriate geographical unit to capture them. For analyzing the role of knowledge spillovers on firm’s location, we need tools that are not constrained by the arbitrary delimitation of space as the geographical span of these agglomeration effects do not align with the scope imposed by administrative boundaries. The growing availability of large databases enables researchers to introduce methods that analyze the spatial distribution of firms using microdata, so that the exact geographic coordinates of each firm are relevant information in the analysis. Methods based on Markov (“Gibbs”) point processes provide a regression framework that takes point-referenced data as input and constitutes a tool for detecting highly localized knowledge spillovers. We estimate a reduced form of a firm birth model to test for a significant association between knowledge spillovers and high-tech firms’ locations. We use the geocoded point location of the firm as the outcome variable and covariates are defined on continuous geographic space. Consequently, results do not embed arbitrary scale-effects that may be present in models based on area-based data. We analyze the location choices of firm births for the period 2000–2016 of two groups of high-tech firms based on the Eurostat classification: (1) high-technology manufacturing (HT-M); (2) medium–high-technology manufacturing (MHT-M) and (3) high technology in knowledge-intensive services (HT-KIS). A distinct advantage of focusing on new entrepreneurs and their determinants is that they are less constrained by previous decisions and provide better information on the role and magnitude of agglomeration effects than the location choices of new plants by existing firms does, as these choices are influenced by the locations of these firms’ existing establishments. The main contribution of the paper is assessing two issues not resolved in the literature related to the geographic spread of knowledge diffusion. We statistically verify the importance of spatial interaction between knowledge-intensive firms in the same industry and the existence of university knowledge spillovers. Our findings suggest that the dominant role that universities play within technology policy needs to be reconsidered. Results denote that the main source through which firms benefit from knowledge spillovers is through proximity to firms in the same industry and not from universities. Assuming that universities function as knowledge centers around which innovative firms cluster, seems unrealistic. From a policy perspective, this paper provides insight to determine endowments that local jurisdiction needs to favor for the development of high-tech firms spatial concentration.",4

Beltrán Tapia,Alfonso Díez-Minguela,Julio Martinez-Galarraga,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Nightlight satellite imagery has evidenced the uneven spatial distribution of population and economic activity (Chen and Nordhaus 2011; Donaldson and Storeygard 2016). Within economics, understanding what drives the location of economic activity has long been debated. In short, the spatial concentration of people and firms arises from the interaction between first nature advantages and agglomeration economies (Beeson et al. 2001; Glaeser 2010; Michaels et al. 2012; Henderson et al. 2016; Desmet and Rappaport 2017).Footnote 1 However, while location fundamentals appear to have been more relevant in pre-industrial societies, industrialisation and structural change have radically changed this. As industry, and then services, grew in importance, so did agglomeration economies which, in turn, widened existing disparities.Footnote 2 In any case, the literature has repeatedly stressed the inertia and relevance of the past in the distribution of population (Davis and Weinstein 2002, p. 1276). Having said that, whether initial size is a good predictor of long-term population growth is basically driven by the experience of the largest cities. The Spanish experience perfectly illustrates this point (Fig. 1). Although the level of population in 1877 accurately predicts the one observed in 2001 when all municipalities are considered, the explanatory power of initial size decreases dramatically when the largest cities are excluded from the analysis. In this regard, recent research has shown that the effect of initial size on subsequent growth not only greatly varies across the whole distribution, but it also evolves over time as structural change intensifies (Michaels et al. 2012; Desmet and Rapapport 2017; Beltrán Tapia et al. 2018; Cuberes et al. 2019). Population in 1877 and 2001 (in thousands) If the fortune of the majority of locations is thus far from being determined by their initial size, what other forces may explain the changes in the spatial distribution of the population? Recent research has stressed the role played by the spatial interactions with other locations (Fujita et al. 1999; Dobkins and Ioannides 2001; Black and Henderson 2003; Redding and Sturm 2008; Partridge et al. 2008; Cuberes et al. 2019). In this regard, the presence of neighbouring towns and cities may not only positively affect population growth by increasing market size, but also limit it through competition. Therefore, we should aim at understanding how these counterbalancing forces evolve over time, especially associated with the reduction in transportation costs and the growing relevance of agglomeration economies (Bosker and Buringh 2017). This study relies on a large dataset on Spanish population between 1877 and 2001 in order to assess how the effect of initial size and neighbouring locations has evolved over time, thus stressing the role of history in understanding the spatial distribution of the population. Although location fundamentals accounted for most of the spatial disparities in population in pre-industrial Spain, these differences increased from 1900 onwards once second nature factors grew in relevance (Ayuda et al. 2010; Beltrán Tapia et al. 2018). Instead of focusing on first nature characteristics, we then look at the role played by agglomeration economies and the spatial interactions between entities. By exploiting the panel structure of the data (comprising 8106 municipalities over 12 time periods), the empirical analysis effectively controls for first nature characteristics and is thus able to isolate the effect of initial size and existing neighbouring urban locations on local population growth. Our results show that initial size is mostly negatively related to subsequent population growth, except in the 1960s and 1970s when this relationship becomes positive. Likewise, a location’s growth rate crucially depends on the existence of neighbouring urban locations. Nearby cities limited local population growth in the late nineteenth century. This negative effect persisted, but at a diminishing rate, until 1950. Interestingly, the influence of neighbouring cities became increasingly positive from then onwards, especially during the 1970s. The changing role of neighbouring locations, from competing between each other up to the mid-twentieth century to begin benefiting from their mutual coexistence from then onwards, is associated with decreasing transportation and communication costs and wider structural changes in the economy. Taken together, these results suggest that, rather than within the largest cities, agglomeration economies take place within clusters of cities in response to increasing congestion costs and improved transportation and communication technologies. Our findings also closely align with recent research for US locations that finds that, while proximity to large urban centres was negatively associated with growth between 1840 and 1920, this relationship became positive from 1920 onwards (Cuberes et al. 2019). This study presents several advantages over the previous literature. Firstly, instead of focusing on cities above a certain population threshold, it employs all Spanish municipalities. It thus avoids survival bias by not only considering those locations that have been relatively successful, but also those that did not grow enough to reach that threshold or those that declined and fell below that figure. In this regard, understanding the overall spatial distribution of the population is not possible if cities are treated as islands, especially as we move back in time when a large fraction of the population lived in rural areas (Desmet and Henderson 2015, p. 1463).Footnote 3 Secondly, considering the effect of neighbouring cities is crucial because cities have increasingly tended to cluster near other cities (Dobkins and Ioannides 2001; Partridge et al. 2008). If their presence is not considered and local population is correlated with the existence of other nearby locations, the estimated coefficient on initial size would be capturing the effect of neighbouring locations and therefore would be biased. Lastly, by adopting a long-term perspective (1877–2001), this article traces how the relationship between agglomeration economies and the spatial distribution of the population has evolved over time as transportation costs and other structural changes affected agglomeration economies and congestion costs. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. While Sect. 2 provides the theoretical background, Sect. 3 presents the data, and Sect. 4 explains the methodology and reports the results of the empirical analysis. Section 5 discusses our findings, and Sect. 6 concludes.",5

However, it is also true that interest in the attitudes of European citizens towards the EU has been renewed as a result of recent threats to the European integration process, namely the spread of Euroscepticism and the rise of populism and neo-nationalism in several member states. Anti-European rhetoric have included messages that emphasize the pernicious effect of European institutions and regulations on the performance of national and regional economies. In this scenario, the economic context could have had a significant influence on the citizens’ attitudes towards the EU. Specifically, people living in areas with a dynamic economy could have been less affected by messages that blame the EU for poor economic prospects. Conversely, the discontent of people in declining places, hit with greater intensity by the Great Recession and with little resilience, could have led them to be less favourable to the process of European integration. Against this background, this study hypothesizes that sustained economic growth (in absolute and relative terms) in the region influence the attitudes of its citizens towards the EU. This hypothesis is tested in an interesting period, 2007–2016, characterized by the socioeconomic turbulences caused by the financial and sovereign debt crises, the accession to the Union of Central and Eastern European countries, with levels of income per capita well below the EU average, and the above-mentioned rise of anti-European rhetoric. The study contributes to the literature about the effect of the economic situation on public attitudes towards the EU by placing in the foreground the subnational heterogeneity in attitudes and emphasizing the role of growth in the medium–long term. In turn, it adds to the recent empirical literature on the Geography of Discontent by focusing on the impact of local growth on the citizens perception of the EU (instead of in the anti-EU vote). Furthermore, the study provides novel evidence on the hypothesis of a separate impact of regional growth on EU sentiment depending on the region’s initial economic situation. The first challenge faced by the study is the calculation of aggregate indicators of public attitudes towards the EU for a set of regions in the 28 EU member states. Two traditional indicators are obtained by aggregating the micro-level data from different Eurobarometer surveys: one based on support for the process of integration, as a measure of the view of the current and future benefits of belonging to the EU, and another on trust in the EU, which aims to capture the people’s assessment of how the European project is managed. In a second stage, regional data on these indicators are merged with that of regional growth and economic convergence to test the hypothesis of the study. The results suggest that growth in the region stimulates support for and trust in the EU. Such positive impact of growth remains significant and sizeable after controlling for several economic characteristics of the region. However, the impact of growth on attitudes towards the EU is not the same in all regions. The effect on support and trust is more intense in regions with levels of income per capita above the EU average. In fact, there does not seem to be a significant growth effect on trust in the EU for regions below the EU average income. The evidence also points to noteworthy differences in the impact of economic convergence on the two indicators. Whereas there are significant effects on support of converging/diverging to the EU economic standards, the estimates reject any significant effect in the case of trust in the EU. These results thus confirm the importance of considering different dimensions of public attitudes towards the EU. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related literature on the determinants of public support for the EU and that on the factors behind the Geography of Discontent is briefly summarized in Sect. 2. The dataset and variables used to compute the regional indicators of public attitudes towards the EU are introduced in the third section, which also includes a descriptive analysis of regional disparities in support for and trust in the EU. Section 4 sketches the empirical strategy followed to assess the validity of the hypotheses of the study, whereas the results are discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

The country has one of the most fiscally centralized multi-level governance systems in Europe, with a historic pattern of underperformance in governance indicators (Kaufmann et al. 2013) and clientelistic practices (Lyberaki and Tsakalotos 2002). Despite this, little is known to date as to how the political alignment of upper- and lower-tier governments and the electoral business cycle affect municipality finances and vertical networking dependency (Chorianopoulos 2012) among these Greek government tiers. Central to our analysis is the mayor of each municipality, the contact person between the voter and the central government. He/she is physically the closest person to the voter and the one who can effectively lobby (Borck and Owings 2003) or mediate central government attempts to engage in electoral politics (Bracco et al. 2015). The outcome of this relationship is hypothesized to be larger government grants flowing into politically aligned municipalities. Hence, we analyse the effect of a mayor’s political affiliation on a municipality’s annual budget. Beyond the direct transfers from central government to municipalities (in the form of grants), we adopt a more holistic approach for considering the local budget by analysing the indirect effects on the remaining two sources of local funding (own revenues and loans). Simultaneously, we consider at which stage of the electoral cycle these effects take place, with the expectation that electoral politics will be more prevalent in the run-up to national and local elections. Distributive politics represent a resource misallocation problem in many countries. It can challenge the equity, efficiency or countercyclical targets that are used to justify public policy intervention (Musgrave 1959) and may have long-lasting growth prosperity and inequality (Livert and Gainza 2018; López et al. 2017; Luca 2018) as well as quality of governance (Brollo et al. 2013) effects. Consequently, several studies examine distributive politics in different countries and regularly find that electoral considerations do play a role in the allocation of government resources either to ‘core’ or to ‘swing’ voters (Golden and Min 2013). Multi-level governance systems and the time to the next election add new dimensions on examining how resources are misallocated in order to influence election outcomes. Politically aligned tiers of government may improve the efficiency of distributive politics practices (Bracco et al. 2015). This in turn draws more funds into a locality with significant implications for vertical intergovernmental dependency and the financing of non-aligned local governments (Chorianopoulos 2012; Solé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro 2008). Engagement in such tactical distribution of resources may in turn be influenced by the stage of the electoral business cycle since incumbent governments are expected to be more active in clientelistic practices in the run-up to elections (Veiga and Veiga 2007). Given its centralized political landscape and its prominence among the underperforming European democracies in corruption and perceived government efficiency measures, electoral considerations in Greek intergovernmental financing have been largely unexplored. This study aims at filling this gap by focusing on both the total municipal revenues and their disaggregation into grants, loans and own revenues in Greece. The empirical estimation benefits from exogenously determined, simultaneous local elections and by using a novel panel data set that combines electoral results in national (parliamentary) and local elections, as well as local authority finances for the period 2003–2010. This allows us to observe changes of political affiliation at both layers of government. Moreover, applying a fixed-effects econometric model, we neutralize the effect of unobserved time-invariant differences between municipalities and focus on the effect of mayors’ political affiliation at different stages of local and national electoral cycles. It contributes a new dimension to existing studies (Lambrinidis et al. 2005; Rodríguez-Pose et al. 2016a, b) by investigating the roles of political alignment and the national and local electoral business cycle on municipality financing in Greece. It uses intergovernmental transfers at a more granular level than NUTS 3 regions (municipality level), which are decided annually and are not subject to the significant lags observed for investment funding. By using this approach, we can identify whether political alignment and the electoral cycle are significant mediators in the allocation of intergovernmental grants. Additionally, the paper offers an insight into how the 2008 crisis has affected distributive politics as the country entered one of its most turbulent (politically and financially) periods of its recent history. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a paper is addressing the significance of these factors simultaneously in the Greek context using a fixed-effects approach. Our findings suggest that there is a substantial misallocation of government grants towards politically aligned municipalities and are novel in finding this happens in the run-up to both national and local elections. This increases the vertical dependency of local on national government (Chorianopoulos 2012; Psycharis et al. 2016), and, even though the crisis appears to have reduced this type of resource misallocation, it calls for a change in municipality financing policy. It adds to the existing debates on decentralization and dependence (Balaguer-Coll et al. 2010) and argues that, irrespective of efficiency gains, moving away from intergovernmental grants could help minimize pork-barrelling diseconomies. The results are confirmed by a range of robustness tests and are relevant to similar fiscally centralized, multi-level governance systems as well as the relatively recently reformed Central and Eastern European countries, which suffer from comparable government inefficiencies. The paper is structured as follows. Section two reviews research on the mediators of distributive politics. This is followed by an outline of the evolution of the local government structure in Greece since the 1970s, as well as the data and methodology. Section five discusses the results of the econometric examination before the final section presents the conclusions and avenues for further study.",2

There are at least two theoretical reasons why such interactions may exist: inter-jurisdictional tax competition and yardstick competition. In theories of tax competition, which builds on Tiebout (1956) and Mirrlees (1971), local jurisdictions compete for a mobile tax base, in this case, individuals and their incomes, using a (low) tax rate as their primary tool. The theory of tax competition predicts a local tax rate that is below the socially optimal level possibly leading to a race-to-the-bottom in the provision of local public services, i.e. local governments tend to lower their tax rates resulting in under-provision of local public services. However, the conclusion that tax competition reduces taxes below a socially optimal level could be challenged if taxes are too high from the outset or if they finance an inefficient provision of (public) services or projects that could be provided more efficiently by other sectors. In yardstick competition, it is information rather than individuals that crosses borders as voters use information about taxes and spending levels in other jurisdictions as a yardstick for measuring the competence of their own incumbent politicians. By observing and comparing policies in neighboring jurisdictions, voters can update their understanding of their incumbent politicians as being either good or bad where bad politicians extract rents while in office. Regarding local income taxes, the likelihood of re-election depends on the relative tax rate in neighboring jurisdictions. In short, bad politicians set tax levels low enough so that voters cannot distinguish them from good ones. Thus, the likelihood of re-election depends on the income tax rates in neighboring jurisdictions. The theory of yardstick competition was first expressed by Salmon (1987) and predicts increased efficiency in the political system through better informed voters.Footnote 1 Even though there are theoretical arguments for the presence of horizontal interactions, testing for the existence of such interactions remains an empirical issue. Evidence in favor of horizontal interactions has been found in many different settings: US states (Case 1993; Besley and Case 1995); the metropolitan areas surrounding Boston (Brueckner and Saavedra 2001) and Barcelona (Sollé Ollé 2003); non-metropolitan districts in England (Revelli 2001, 2002); Swiss cantons (Feld and Reulier 2009; Schaltegger and Kuttel 2002; Parchet 2019); and Dutch (Allers and Elhorst, 2005), French (Leprince et al. 2007; Agrawal et al. 2020a), Italian (Bordignon et al. 2003), Belgian (Heyndels and Vuchelen 1998), Swedish (Edmark and Ågren 2008) and German municipalities (Büttner 2001; and Hauptmeier et al. 2012). A few studies, such as Lyytikäinen (2012), Isen (2014) and Baskaran (2014), found no evidence of strategic interactions in local tax policies across Finnish municipalities, local governments in Ohio or the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, respectively. As the causes of interaction give rise to diametrically different policy implications, many authors have tried to discriminate between tax and yardstick competition. However, this is far from easy. As shown by Brueckner (2003), Agrawal et al. (2020b) and others, the causes of interaction give rise to similar reduced forms and spatial reaction functions. Nevertheless, many studies point in the direction of yardstick competition. For example, Case (1993) showed that tax rates are only influenced by the tax rates in neighboring states when the governor is eligible to be re-elected. Besley and Case (1995) found that the likelihood of a US state governor being re-elected decreased as state taxes rise, and increased in the event of tax increases in neighboring states. Revelli (2002) concluded that tax increases diminished the popularity of incumbent politicians, while tax increases in neighboring districts raised their popularity. Schaltegger and Kuttel (2002) found that tax mimicking depended on the political setting, and Bordignon et al. (2003) found that business property tax mimicking only existed in cities in which mayors were seeking re-election and were not backed by strong majorities. Sollé Ollé (2003) showed that tax mimicking was stronger in municipalities in which most of the ruling parties were smaller and in which right-wing parties ruled, as well as during election years. Edmark and Ågren (2008) found strong evidence of a spatial correlation in tax rates but weak evidence of tax competition effects in the setting of tax rates. In the empirical literature, the spatial lag model (see the seminal work by Anselin 1988) is frequently used to identify and test for interactions in local taxes. As the tax rate of neighboring jurisdictions are by construction endogenous in the reaction function, inference is often based on either maximum likelihood (ML), instrumental variable (IV) or general methods of moments (GMM) estimators. In the IV and GMM setup, other characteristics such as income, demographic structure or political preferences of neighboring jurisdictions are often used as instruments for the neighboring jurisdiction's tax rate. However, this hinges on the crucial assumption that these variables only explain the local tax rate in neighboring jurisdictions and can be excluded from the second stage of the regression in which the tax rate of ""our"" jurisdiction is explained. Gibbons and Overman (2012) argued that this assumption most likely does not hold. First, the characteristics of neighboring jurisdictions might have a direct effect on the tax rate of a given jurisdiction. Second, the tax policies of neighboring jurisdictions are likely to have a direct effect on their own demographic structure, income levels and other characteristics. Finally, a spatially correlated omitted variable might influence both the characteristics of neighboring jurisdictions and the tax rate of a given jurisdiction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, Driscoll and Kraay (1998) have shown that the presence of even modest spatial dependence can impart large bias to OLS standard errors when Ν is large. In this paper, we use both the time and space dimension in our data to construct instruments for neighboring jurisdictions tax rates to avoid the critique put forward by Gibbons and Overman (2012). Based on a data set covering 289 out of 290 Swedish municipalities between 2003 and 2016 and in contrast to many previous studies (Chirinko and Wilson (2017) being one exception), we argue that the influence of the tax rates of other municipalities is delayed one period. We also elaborate with different definitions of neighbors. In contrast to Edmark and Ågren (2008), who have also analyzed Swedish municipalities, we control for potential persistence in tax setting behavior. In other words, the own tax rate lagged one period is included in the model. Vertical interactions due to tax base sharing (Andersson et al. 2004; Devereux et al. 2007) or provision of complementary public services (Aronsson et al. 2000) are controlled for by including the county tax rate. The explicit modelling of both horizontal and vertical interaction processes can help avoid mistaking the omitted variable correlation for an actual expenditure spill-over. Our main results suggest that when introducing persistence into the empirical model, much of the horizontal correlation disappears. Also, even when not controlling for previous tax rates, we only found limited evidence of horizontal interactions. However, we found that a relatively large neighbor compared to other neighbors (in terms of population) has a stronger impact on its neighbor's income taxes than a relatively small municipality. To some extent, this is in line with the results presented by Lundberg (2014). We also found weak evidence of a positive correlation in local personal income taxes across jurisdictions with similar political preferences. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: The next section provides some background to the Swedish situation and tax setting procedure at the local level. Section 3 presents an empirical specification, definition of neighbors and econometric issues, followed by a description of the data set in Sect. 4. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. The paper ends in Sect. 6 with concluding comments.",2

Vonortas,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper characterizes heterogeneous configurations of entrepreneurial ecosystems and important dimensions thereof. These dimensions refer to characteristics that are common across different ecosystem setups and others that vary from locality to locality. Such performance creates a kind of hierarchy whereby factors deemed most important across many ecosystems are ranked higher than factors with more specific relevance to one or few ecosystems. We adapt classic models of entrepreneurial ecosystems and empirically investigate the extent to which different localities within a large region (State of São Paulo) of an emerging economy (Brazil) follow a uniform ecosystem configuration and why, or why not. Our primary target is to suggest an empirically validated model of entrepreneurial ecosystems’ profiles that can be consulted by policy decision makers in guiding future initiatives targeted at fostering such ecosystems.
 Knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship (KIE) stands for a group of small, innovation-driven firms that not only achieve high levels of competitiveness, but that also positively affect aggregate capabilities in the systems in which they operate (Malerba and McKelvey 2018). Nonetheless, these firms still lie at the margin of innovation systems’ approaches (Ács et al. 2014; Autio et al. 2014; Zahra et al. 2014). An important recent development has been the growing attention to ecosystems of entrepreneurship (EE), offering a more effective framework to address the interplay between individual and contextual dimensions (Audretsch and Belitski 2017; Alvedalen and Boschma 2017; Stam and Spigel 2016; Fischer and Nijkamp 2018). This is encouraging given that KIE is highly connected to the systems in which it is embedded, presenting higher levels of systemic interactions than other cohorts of small firms (Malerba and McKelvey 2018). These connections are fundamentally local, relying on the neighboring availability of knowledge, institutions, resources and demand (Stam 2009; Isaksen and Trippl 2017; Fischer and Nijkamp 2018). As a consequence, we observe a spiky geography of such entrepreneurial ventures and significant regional asymmetries in the context of both developed and developing countries (Ács and Armington 2004; Florida 2005; Pan and Yang 2019; Fischer et al. 2018a, b). Nonetheless, empirical research has dedicated attention primarily to individual ecosystems’ elements, rather than looking at the complex character of these structures (Hayter et al. 2018; Roundy et al. 2018). Also, in our view, literature often offers inadequate guidance by focusing too much on anecdotal evidence from outstanding outliers, such as Silicon Valley and Route 128 (Nicotra et al. 2018; Stam and Spigel 2016). The resulting policy implications tend to neglect that KIE is deeply embedded in local contexts and that these contexts can be highly heterogeneous across regions and countries (Radosevic and Yoruk 2013; Ács et al. 2017; Brown and Mason 2017; Boschma and Martin 2010). This is valid even among high-profile successful cases, which do not necessarily share similar trajectories (Saxenian 1994). Hence, the challenge of transferring successful ‘recipes’ from one place to another remains in the case of entrepreneurial ecosystems considering differences in areas such as culture, traditions, capabilities and networks (Malecki 1997a). Understanding the distinct characteristics, trajectories and interplay of relevant drivers of entrepreneurial ecosystems becomes a strategic matter in this debate (Etzkowitz 2019; Kantis 2018; Feldman 2005; Roundy et al. 2018). As cities face demands to become more involved in promoting knowledge-intensive businesses (Tiffin and Jimenez 2006), the need to comprehend the driving dimensions of successful entrepreneurial ecosystems becomes increasingly relevant (Fritsch 2019; Auerswald and Dani 2017; Spigel 2017). In this article, we build on the notion that ‘generic’ and comprehensive configurations of EE present only a limited understanding of their intrinsic dynamics. We extend recent research dealing with the idiosyncratic character of ecosystems’ profiles (Godley et al. 2019; Spigel 2017; Brown and Mason 2017) by going beyond representative case studies. Also, we argue that a hierarchy of ‘ingredients’ exist and that these elements can be combined in different ways as to generate entrepreneurial activity. Accordingly, the goals of this research are to: (1) identify the fundamental dimensions that cut across distinct ecosystems of entrepreneurship; and (2) assess the different forms these overarching conditions combine with other drivers to promote KIE activity.
 We gather insights from literature on business location and the dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems to develop a workable model for our research inquiries. Empirical data come from the State of São Paulo, Brazil. KIE is approximated using information from PIPE projects, a program funded by the State Research Foundation (FAPESP) that supports innovation-driven entrepreneurship in small companies (similar to the SBIR Program in the USA). The full dataset includes 1856 grants allocated across 135 cities in the State during the period 1998–2017. The methodological approach is developed around classic approaches of entrepreneurial ecosystems such as Isenberg’s (2010) and the empirical analysis uses qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) with fuzzy sets. This offers a novel way to address the configurational dynamics of EE, from the bottom up, complementing insights from case studies and traditional econometric assessments (Roundy et al. 2018; Stam and van de Ven 2019. Vedula and Fitza 2019). Findings suggest alternative ways to establish thriving ecosystems: The first configuration is entirely reliant on the availability of a competitive knowledge infrastructure (represented by research universities, innovation habitats, and presence of knowledge-intensive jobs), while the second key configuration combines elements from the knowledge context (innovation habitats and Human Development Index) with characteristics of the socioeconomic system (investment attractiveness in knowledge-intensive industries). Infrastructure, human capital, credit availability and population size (approximating agglomeration economies) make up a secondary layer of important attributes. At a higher level of detail, four variants of ecosystem configurations could be identified—albeit at a relatively marginal rate of differentiation. Our analysis offers insights on the geography of innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of an advanced region in an emerging economy. It thus helps filling a gap in terms of scant evidence on EE outside the USA and Europe (Hayter et al. 2018), an aspect of interest since EE dynamics appear to work differently in developed and developing contexts (Crescenzi and Rodríguez-Pose 2017). This is a critical feature for academics and policymakers, in view of the fact that ecosystems’ policies in laggard systems are often based on evidence from advanced contexts that do not face the same levels of resource scarcities, structural gaps and institutional voids as developing nations (Cao and Shi 2020). Hence, our approach contributes to the literature by both extending the incipient use of QCA techniques for the assessment of entrepreneurial ecosystems and shedding further light on the understudied context of emerging markets. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Sect. 2 contains the conceptual background of our assessment. Section 3 critically reviews the literature and argues for the need to identify EE’s leading dimensions, as well as to accommodate a more flexible understanding of entrepreneurial ecosystems’ configurations. Section 4 presents the method and the data. Section 5 presents the empirical findings. Section 6 discusses the results in light of the extant literature.

From worker productivity to shipping, even small changes in climate can cause significant effects (Dell et al. 2014). While the most explicit impact is on agricultural production, industries far removed from the direct effects of climate, such as finance, are also affected (Bouman and Jacobsen 2002). Natural disasters have the potential to cause long-run, if not permanent, shifts to local economies (Ewing et al. 2007). Despite a profusion of scholarship of the effects weather can have on society, the impact of normal climate variations on real estate value has not been thoroughly examined. Given that housing stock is the main store of wealth for millions of American households, the possible impacts are worth investigating.Footnote 1 To that end, this paper examines the impact that short-run weather fluctuations have on housing values. Using data provided by the Jefferson County Assessors Office of Jefferson County, Colorado, the assembled data set includes 185,000 sales from 96,000 properties. This is the universe of all single-family homes sold in Jefferson County between 1980 and 2013. The housing data have been combined with local weather data that includes temperature, precipitation, and snow variables. One of the main strengths of this data set is that it includes repeat sales from the same property. This allows the inclusion of property level fixed effects, which account for all time-invariant property characteristics and isolate within property sales price variation, plausibly identifying a causal impact of weather on housing prices. Using the 30–60-day period before the closing date as the presumed negotiation period, the weather can be determined during price negotiations. Although this 30-day window may not always be within the actual negotiating period, at worst this will cause an attenuation bias due to classical measurement error, meaning the true results could be even larger than those described below. While the property fixed effects account for all time-invariant variation at the property and neighborhood level, some properties undoubtedly change over time. Some will decrease in value, perhaps after falling into disrepair. Others will increase in value after home renovations or other price increasing enhancements.Footnote 2 In all cases, however, these changes will be orthogonal to temporary weather conditions. A house falling into disrepair or going through a renovation takes months, if not years, to plan and execute. Homeowners generally do not significantly change their home once it is for sale. Therefore, temporal changes to a property will not bias the results. The results indicate that local weather conditions when a house is on the market do have a small but statistically significant impact on housing prices. In the summer, precipitation has an effect, but the direction of the effect is dependent on temperature. When the weather is relatively cool, increased precipitation decreases price, while increased precipitation increases price when the weather is warm.Footnote 3 In the winter, colder temperatures are associated with a higher sales price. For every degree decrease in average monthly temperature, prices increase by an average of $255. While this is a small amount, it does mean that the housing market is affected by temporary weather conditions. The winter results are larger for more expensive homes and smaller for cheaper homes and are also larger for homes that are in the suburbs of Denver as opposed to the nearby foothills. This points to a possible mixed mechanism. In the winter, worse weather, in the form of cold temperatures, helps sellers. In the summer, it is not as clear what home buyers would perceive as good or bad weather, as rain in the summer is both necessary but at times inconvenient. It is possible that more rain during warm periods increases curb appeal, while rain during cool periods decreases curb appeal. In either case, this presents an interesting finding, as the underlying value of a property does not vary with short-term weather conditions. At the micro-level, the effects of climate and even normal weather variations can impact a substantial part of the economy. Much of the effect may be driven by a change in sentiment, especially when weather conditions are unpleasant (Baylis 2020). This change in sentiment can then alter human behavior, such as the propensity to commit crimes or attitudes toward the stock market (Kamstra et al. 2003; Goetzmann and Zhu 2005; Ranson 2014). Exactly how “bad” the weather has to be before affecting economic outcomes is up for debate. Some research has not found significant effects until temperatures at the extreme ends of the distribution are reached, while other scholarship has shown that even temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius can have an impact (Hancock et al. 2007; Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014; Graff Zivin et al. 2018; Heal and Park 2015). This same change in sentiment could also have an impact on the real estate market (Portnov and Akron 2014). While the determinants of housing value have been studied for decades, researchers continue to find new and interesting factors that affect prices (Rosen 1974; Bayer et al. 2016). Typically, one can divide the determinants of housing prices into two categories: property characteristics and neighborhood characteristics. Holding all else equal, houses with extra amenities, such as an extra bathroom or greater square footage, will sell for more (Palmquist 1984). Consumers may also care about a building’s energy efficiency (Chegut et al. 2019). At the same time, neighborhood characteristics can also play a large role in the price of a home. These include factors that are often crucial for home buyers, such as the quality of nearby schools (Black 1999). Other factors include the proximity of amenities and disamenities, such as airports, Superfund sites, wind turbines, and historical properties (Gayer et al. 2000; Vyn 2018; Affuso et al. 2019; Turnbull et al. 2019). Other, less salient, neighborhood characteristics also play a role, even if all home buyers are not aware of them. These include air quality, a recent mass shooting, or recent flooding (Chay and Greenstone 2005; Gourley 2019; Zhang and Leonard 2019). As the world continues to warm, this may also impact housing prices, especially for properties near ski resorts or other recreational amenities (Butsic et al. 2011; Galinato and Tantihkarnchana 2018; Semenenko and Yoo 2019). These property or neighborhood characteristics, however, are assumed to be unchanging or are examined before and after a one-time event that is not easily reversible.Footnote 4 Weather, on the other hand, continually varies. Buyers and sellers of homes have expectations for what weather will be like in a given location in January and in July, but are aware that large deviations can occur. Middle-term seasonal deviations have already been found to affect both housing prices and new house construction (Coulson and Richard 1996; Fergus 1999; Butsic et al. 2011). But what about temporary swings in temperature that are part of a typical season? Given that most home buyers plan to own their new property for years, if not decades, it seems peculiar that the weather when a house is for sale would make a difference in the final sales price. This paper establishes that there is, in fact, a small but statistically significant effect of weather on housing prices. This finding is worthwhile for several reasons. First, it contributes to the notion that home buyers and sellers, despite the use of professional real estate agents, can be influenced by factors that do not affect the underlying value of a property. Home buyers consider hundreds of attributes when deciding to purchase a home, and some that are not immediately obvious have an impact. Although the magnitudes are relatively small, home buyers and sellers should take into account temporary climate conditions when deciding on whether to make or accept an offer. Selling a home during a winter cold snap, for example, could increase the price of the home by thousands of dollars. Second, the impact of climate change is worth discussing. As average temperatures increase and extremely cold days occur less frequently, there may be a lasting impact on housing prices. As seen in the main results, cold weather increases the sales price of a property. The lack of cold days could, therefore, decrease prices going forward. The results from the winter specification indicate that if temperatures were to increase by 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, the stated goal of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the average home price would decline by $689 in the winter. The desertification caused by climate change in other areas could also impact the value of real estate. Third, the findings here provide evidence that temporal changes, along with spatial, need to be examined. There is some work in this field, but so far it is under-explored (Ling 2019). The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical framework underpinning the results. Section 3 describes the data used in the paper. Section 4 discusses the econometric approach. Section 5 provides the results. Section 6 concludes.",4

Aníbal Núñez-Carrasco,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Technological innovation in the business world has become a determining factor of competitiveness and is thus a key element of productivity growth in advanced economies (Buesa et al. 2010). However, from a global perspective, not all countries or regions have the same capacity for innovation, nor do all the factors that define the development of innovative processes affect different areas with the same intensity in relation to productivity growth rates. The well-known study by Griffith et al. (2006) used the structural model proposed by Crépon et al. (1998) to analyse the impact of technological innovation on labour productivity in four European countries (France, Germany, Spain, and the UK) from 1998 to 2000. They found significant differences between the factors related to technological innovation activities regarding their impact on the manufacturing productivity of companies based in these four countries. Their approach could be applied to regions within a country to investigate whether the impact of technological innovation activity on firm productivity differs according to their location, while taking all economic sectors into account. This relationship between location and innovation could be relevant because business R&D is generally located in the headquarters of companies in their countries of origin (e.g. Belderbos et al. 2011; Castellani and Pieri 2013; Narula 2002). The present study investigated this issue in the three most relevant Spanish regions according to their populations and contribution to the Spanish GDP. In Spain, differences in regional socioeconomic figures affect the way in which businesses approach technological innovation to achieve productivity improvements. As shown in Table 1, in the period ending in 2016, the three regions analysed comprised almost 48% of the Spanish population and jointly contributed more than 51% of the national GDP. However, the analysis of the remaining values shows clear differences between these three regions. Although Andalusia is the Spanish region with the largest population, it has worse figures in terms of per capita income, unemployment, labour productivity, and total factor productivity than those of Madrid, Catalonia, and the average values for Spain as a whole. In the period 1970–2007, the average total factor productivity in Andalusia was very similar to the national figure obtained by Coremberg and Pérez-García (2010). Furthermore, Andalusia only invests 0.91% of its regional GDP in R&D. In line with all the data of the series since 2000, the three regions analysed and Spain as a whole continue to show values well below the European average for 2016 of 2.03%, according to EUROSTAT. It is also relevant to note that the OECD (2011) categorized these regions into different classifications. Madrid and Catalonia were classified as industrial production zones, whereas Andalusia was classified as a non-S&T-driven zone (i.e. a region that is not driven by science and technology). These classifications function as a guide regarding innovation in these regions. Nevertheless, there are very high interregional differences in relative investment in R&D (Edler and Fagerberg 2017). As noted by Acosta et al. (2015), these differences are due to the Spanish regions developing different policies on innovation. However, it seems reasonable to assume that some other factors may also lead to differences in the way R&D investments translate into productivity figures in the Spanish regions. These other factors may include differences between Spanish regions in specialized products, the effect of the location of company headquarters and the location of production, or differences in price levels between the regions considered. Therefore, the basic objective of this study was to analyse differences between Spanish regions in company productivity due to the implementation of technological product and process innovations as defined by the Oslo Manual (OECD 2005). That is, we studied the economically most relevant Spanish regions regarding possible variations in productivity due to differences in business policies on innovation. To the best of our knowledge, this type of regional analysis has not been previously conducted for the Spanish economy and thus represents a novel contribution to the literature. The CDM structural model originally proposed by Crépon et al. (1998) was used to quantify the relationship between investment in R&D, technological innovation, and business productivity. In this case, and in line with the study by Griffith et al. (2006), we used data from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC), which uses the methodological framework established for the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) developed by EUROSTAT. In summary, this study is justified by the fact that there are structural differences and differences in innovation policies between regions that are likely to lead to significant variations in innovation-associated productivity. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The next section presents a brief review of the scientific literature in this field, followed by the methodology section. We then introduce the database used and provide a descriptive analysis of this database in Sect. 4. The econometric results obtained are presented in Sect. 5, followed by the main conclusions and economic policy recommendations based on these conclusions.",2

Ferreira Neto,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Place-based policies target designated areas and/or specific groups of people within this area. Theoretical reasons to support place-based policies include agglomeration economies, knowledge spillovers, and the spatial mismatch hypothesis (Glaeser and Gottlieb 2008; Neumark and Simpson 2015). However, the result of these policies is still mixed. For instance, Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) argue that place-based policies have little success, and there is a high cost associated to their success level. Some thorough review of place-based policies and their impact are provided by Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008), Neumark and Simpson (2015) and Kline and Moretti (2014). Given the mixed results of such policies, a detailed analysis of particular ones is necessary. Cultural districts are designated or certified areas by a state or local government, offering one mechanism to promote economic development and community revitalization through arts and culture. So far, most evidences of the benefits of cultural districts are qualitative and anecdotal (National Assembly of State Arts Agencies 2017). Nevertheless, there has been a growth of nearly 1500% in the number of CDs around the USA, from 40 in 1995 to over 600 in 2017. In this paper, instead of addressing what are the benefits associated with a cultural district, I take a step back and focus on why some states decide to adopt such place-based policy. More specifically, I investigate the determinants of cultural district laws diffusion across the US states in the last couple of decades. Currently, there are 15 states in the country with a cultural district law, with the year of establishment ranging from 1998 to 2015; further, some states have as low as zero cultural district such as North Dakota and Montana, to as high as 75 in Louisiana, according to the Americans for the Arts organization. A policy brief by National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (2017) lays out the following outcome goals of cultural district laws: attracting artists and cultural enterprises to a local community, encouraging business and job development, addressing both urban and rural needs, establishing tourism destinations, preserving and reusing historic buildings, enhancing property values, and fostering local cultural development. However, they also point out that available evaluation studies are limited. In the past few years, there has been an increase in production of such studies, mainly by local and state agencies.
 Even though the study of the arts and culture are not new nor scarce in the literature (Blaug 2001), the study of cultural districts is more recent and has been growing in the last decade (Cooke 2008). Cooke and Lazzeretti (2008) provide a collection of essays covering the systematization of a theory of cultural districts to empirical analyses and case studies, laying the ground on the state of the art on the research of using and managing cultural resources to generate local development. However, as argued by Cinti (2008), cultural districts are ultimately “policy instruments” that are used to “enhance cultural assets and promote urban regeneration.” Markusen (2006) argues that location decisions of artists depend on local nurturing of artists through dedicated spaces and organizations as well as the existence of artist-employing firms. Thus, cultural districts should help in this decision by coordinating artistic entrepreneurship, and through the agglomeration of these workers. Likewise, the economic growth from artists stems from import-substituting consumption activities for residents and tourists. Frost-Kumpf (1998), in turn, argues that Cultural Districts provide employment, attract residents and tourists to the city, complement adjacent businesses, enhance property values, expand tax base, attract well-educated employees, and beautify and animate cities, providing descriptive data to corroborate these claims.
 Although these descriptive data provide some support to the expected impact of cultural districts, there is still little empirical evidence of such. In terms of gentrification, Grodach et al. (2014) find mixed results for artistic activity, such that fine arts are linked to revitalization processes with a positive correlation between commercial arts and gentrification. Schuetz (2014) finds that new art galleries in New York locate in high amenity and affluent neighborhoods. Noonan (2013) note a positive impact on property values in the host and adjacent neighborhoods of cultural districts, as well as suggestive results of displacement. Also, Noonan (2013) reports positive impact in terms of employment and income.
 More recently, Breznitz and Noonan (2018) evaluate the importance of cultural districts and arts schools to explain arts and media-related local job growth and find evidence that cultural districts have only a local and concentrated effect. Portillo and Wagner (2020) use a difference-in-difference strategy to evaluate the effect of cultural districts on residential properties from Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. Their results show that houses within the cultural districts sell for a 15% premium. The existence of a cultural district, however, does not depend on a state law, since local governments can also designate such areasFootnote 1. According to the American for the Arts 46% of such districts are not in states with a cultural district law. Nevertheless, there is an increasing policy-making role of state arts agencies. Thus, the first question that emerges is: what are the determinants of state cultural district laws? Moreover, what are the mechanisms driving the diffusion of cultural district laws among US states? According to the policy literature (Shipan and Volden 2008), three hypotheses can explain the policy diffusion: government competition, imitation, and learning. Exploring the difference in timing of cultural district laws implementation by each state, and differences in industrial and socio-economic characteristics of each state, it is possible to examine the determinants of such cultural district laws. The results suggest that the geographical competition and imitation mechanisms help to explain the diffusion of cultural district laws across states. Once tax incentives are taken into account, governments also seem to be influenced by other similar states in terms of industry mix. The remainder of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 introduces some cultural district statistics in the US; Sect. 3 discusses the policy diffusion mechanism literature and raise the hypotheses to be tested; Sect. 4 presents the data and econometric model used; Sect. 5 describes my main results; and, Sect. 6 concludes.",2
67.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,12 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-021-01046-1,"The urban–rural divide in radical right populist support: the role of resident’s characteristics, urbanization trends and public service supply",August 2021,Jonna Rickardsson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The trend of urbanization continues to permeate throughout the world causing differences between urban, non-urban and rural areas to accelerate. Recently, these differences have shown to have strong influences on election outcomes, with a large overrepresentation of voters in rural areas over urban areas in favor of candidates like Marie Le Pen (Politico 2017) and Donald Trump (Cramer 2017), and issues such as Brexit (Beckett 2017). In Sweden, not only did voter support for the Sweden Democrats differ between urban areas and non-urban areas (Mellander et al. 2014), but confidence in the national Swedish government also differed (Arkhede and Oscarsson 2016). The research examining this urban–rural divide in voting behavior is limited. As a converse effect of urbanization and agglomeration, non-urban areas are subject to (1) higher unemployment rates, (2) lower education and (3) lower income levels. They also tend to have (4) lower shares of immigrants. These four factors are what the majority of prior literature on radical right populist support has found to relate to voting behavior (see, for example, Antonucci et al. 2017; Hobolt 2016; Lee et al. 2018; Rydgren and Ruth 2011, 2013). Since these determinants of far-right support vary substantially between urban and non-urban areas (e.g., in terms of the composition of urban and non-urban populations), one might not be very surprised by an urban–rural divide in far-right populist support. But do these socioeconomic determinants, alone, adequately explain the variation in support for the populist radical rightFootnote 1 across urban and non-urban regions? Or, alternatively, does depopulation and its cascade of consequences relate to support for these parties even when individual characteristics and immigration are controlled for? As people increasingly leave rural places, total demand decreases, which sequentially results in weaker labor markets and shutdowns of important public and private services (Bjerke and Mellander 2016). Recently, shutdowns of public establishments and services in non-urban areas as well as increasing geographical inequality have received great attention in the public debate in Sweden. While the income tax rates generally are higher in non-urban municipalities, the availability of services is lower. The lower access to public services in declining rural areas could be a contributing explanation for the map of populist support and political dissatisfaction. Therefore, this paper also tests whether availability of—and satisfaction with—public services is related to far-right populist support. This paper examines the relationship between urbanization, proxied by (1) an urban versus non-urban categorization of Swedish municipalitiesFootnote 2 (approximately equivalent to an American county) and (2) population growth, and voting behavior by combining survey data on individual characteristics and register data aggregated on municipalities. The following three questions are asked; (1) Are urban status or urban trends related to support for the Swedish far-right populist party, the Sweden Democrats, when controlling for individual characteristics of the voter and immigration? (2) How does availability of public services relate to the urban–rural divide in support for the Sweden Democrats? And (3) Do the relationships between population growth, public services, and support for the Sweden Democrats vary between urban and non-urban municipalities? The findings in this paper show that the relationship between urbanization proxies and support for the Sweden Democrats weakens substantially when controlling for individual characteristics of voters, but that voting behavior still varies significantly between urban and non-urban municipalities and with population growth. Hence, the findings in this paper establish that the urban–rural divide in support for the party cannot be fully explained by variations in population composition in terms of, e.g., income, education, unemployment. There are additional factors linked to urbanization (and conversely, to depopulation of non-urban areas) that explain the party support gap between denser and less dense areas. When controlling for immigration, the relationship between urban status and support for the Sweden Democrats weakens further and becomes insignificant. A higher share of immigrants in the region significantly decreases the likelihood of casting a vote for the Sweden Democrats, and urban areas have higher shares of immigrants than rural areas. The relationship between population growth and Sweden Democrat support stays significant and negative when immigration is added to the model, suggesting that population trends and regional development matters more than urban status for resident’s likelihood of supporting the Swedish radical right. Considering public service supply (e.g., school services, health care services), the relationship between Sweden Democrat support and urbanization trends either reduces substantially or becomes insignificant. A larger supply of (and satisfaction with) public services decreases the probability of voting for the Sweden Democrats substantially. It is, however, difficult to establish a causal link from access to/satisfaction with public services to voting for the populist far-right, since the level of public services provided may be both a cause and a result of depopulation and economic decline (the bias decreases, however, since economic factors like income and unemployment are controlled for). Nevertheless, the results suggest that public services play an important role for far-right populist support, especially in non-urban areas. These results are indications that the role of public services and shutdowns of public establishments on far-right populist support needs to be further examined using better identification strategies. This paper contributes to the existing strand of literature in numerous ways. While there is a growing number of studies examining the determinants of populist support, none of them looks at the relationship between urbanization and voting behavior explicitly nor do they consider the potential role of public services. This paper emphasizes that the urban–rural divide in far-right populist support not only arises from immigration or economic factors such as employment status and income, but that other regional characteristics, like public services, which vary between urban and non-urban areas (or growing and shrinking areas), also matter. During the last fifty years, far-right populist parties have increasingly reemerged and gained an expanding electoral support across Western Europe, as well as in other parts of the world (e.g., Canada and Australia). While far-right parties have long had only marginalized support in Sweden, in recent years the anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, has received increasingly strong electoral support and parliamentary seats. The Sweden Democrats is the Swedish version of the more global phenomena of radical right and populist parties growing (see, for example, Dal Bó et al. 2018; Dehdari 2018; Oskarson and Demker 2015, Rydgren and Ruth 2011, 2013, Strömblad and Malmberg 2016). The party received 2.9% of the votes in the 2006 election, 5.7% of the votes in the 2010 election, and 12.9% of the votes in the 2014 election, an increase by 126% over the previous election. The Sweden Democrats are now Sweden's third largest parliamentary party. With its roots in former right-wing extremist and racist parties (Rydgren 2010), today the party presents itself as a nationalistic and conservative party (Sverigedemokraterna 2017). The party is critical toward the “multicultural” society, which it considers threatening to the national heritage and the Swedish culture (Sverigedemokraterna 2017). Therefore, the party advocates severely restricted immigration. Additionally, the Sweden democrats wants Sweden to renegotiate its EU-membership for a more EEA-like (European Economic Area) membership. Sweden consists of 290 municipalities that vary substantially in terms of area, population density and population growth. The support for the Sweden Democrats increased in all municipalities between the elections 2010 and 2014, but there is a large variation in election support for the party across municipalities. The vote outcome for the Sweden Democrats in the election 2014 varied between 5.3% and 29.9% amongst the Swedish municipalities. The geographical distribution of the party’s vote outcome is illustrated in Fig. 1. The darker the red color in Fig. 1, the higher the vote support for the party in the 2014 election. The variation in population size stretches from small rural municipalities with fewer than 3000 inhabitants to dense metropolitan areas like Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö with more than 300,000 inhabitants. Figure 2 illustrates the population density in 2014 for Swedish municipalities (quantiles), where a darker blue color represents municipalities with a higher population density. Support for the Sweden Democrats (%) 2014 Population density (quantiles) 2014 In Fig. 1, it is clear that the highest support for the Sweden Democrats is found in the municipalities in the very south of Sweden (the province of Skåne). The lowest support is found in the North and along the coastlines and in the municipalities around the two largest cities in Sweden (Stockholm and Gothenburg). Comparing Figs. 1 and 2, we can see that the lighter red areas in Fig. 1, which indicate high support for the Sweden Democrats, are most often matched by darker blue colors in Fig. 2 (low population density). Hence, municipalities that have a higher population density support the party to a smaller extent. Although this pattern is less clear in the very south and in the north, in the middle of Sweden (defined as shown in Fig. 3 in “Appendix”), where the great majority of the Swedish population resides (approximately 80%), it is a quite clear mapping. In the SOM-institute’s survey data (explained more in depth later), approximately 15% of the respondents who answered that they voted for the Sweden Democrats in 2014 do not consider the party their favorite one (based on the question: which party is your favorite party?). Five percent of the Sweden Democrat voters prefer the Social Democrats (the largest left-wing party in Sweden) and four percent of them prefer Moderaterna (the largest right-wing party in Sweden). Furthermore, 38% of the Sweden Democrat voters in the survey do not consider themselves to be convinced supporters (while 37% of the Sweden Democrat voters consider themselves to be somewhat convinced supporters, and 25% convinced party supporters).",13

The internationalization of economic activities has led to the formation of GVCs (Gereffi et al. 2001) and, accordingly, global regionalism (Baldwin 2011) whereby production processes are sliced up and located worldwide. It is well-accepted that MNEs have managed their GVCs by locating different functions in different parts of the world depending on their competitive advantage. MNEs’ cost-saving strategies have led to the offshoring of the most labor-intensive production functions to low-cost economies. Offshoring has hollowed out many previously regionally based manufacturing (and related) sectors in advanced economies (Bailey and De Propris 2014; Hewings 2008; Nakamura 2010) and MNEs have progressively moved GVCs away from their domestic productive ecosystem, leading to a gradual dissipation of the local technological know-how, operational capabilities, and specialized skills (Pisano and Shih 2012).
 A wave of new technologies (Ross 2016; Marsh 2013) is transforming the way firms organize production inside the factory and along the value chain; indeed, companies will be able to organize their activities more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently by utilizing advanced information analytics (Lee et al. 2015), automation, robotics, sensoring, cloud technology - to mention only a few (for an overview, see: Frank et al. 2019). This new manufacturing model is referred to as I4.0. The adoption of I4.0 technologies (Brakman et al. 2015) offers companies in high-income regions the chance to reinvigorate and anchor manufacturing sectors by allowing them to enter viable market niches (Merlin-Jones 2012) and re-shore (Bailey and De Propris 2014) parts of their value chains (that is, move  activities back to their home economies). A host of new technologies (OECD 2016) ranging from a variety of digital technologies to new materials and to new processes has increasingly impacted on business models of MNEs. Nowadays, companies create greater value by integrating products with the provision of digitalized services (Neely 2008; Parry et al. 2012). The increasingly dovetailing of manufacturing and high-value service functions, through processes of servitization, is fundamentally changing the nature of products, firms’ business models and the modes of consumption from ownership to use (Vandermerwe and Rada 1988). Accessing and adopting such new technologies (and the competences and services attached to them) will have major implications for  the strategies and performance of MNEs. In this article, we explore the extent to which MNEs can rely on resources that can be found either in-house or within their value chain- albeit global- and on resources that are pooled in the local context in which they are homed.
 The objective of this paper is to understand what drives the performance of MNEs as they balance internal, locally embedded and international determinants, in particular in a context  in which they are challenged by an emerging new manufacturing model, called I4.0. As MNEs constantly operate on multiple spatial scales, the present work explores the relative importance of and balance between three determinants of MNEs performance: (i) MNEs’ internal operations and R&D capabilities; (ii) reliance on local external economies and co-location with high-value service and technological competence; and, (iii) reliance on resources accessible from their global value chains. To investigate these issues, the article draws together the international business literature on the location choices and global value chains of multinational firms, that in the field of economic geography on the importance of place and agglomeration economies, and finally, the emergent literature on technological change and I4.0. We collected primary data in 2017 with an online survey administrated to top managers of MNEs in Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK). We selected companies operating in four advanced manufacturing industries, namely: biotech (e.g., Semta 2009), engineering (e.g., European Commission 2019; Probst et al. 2013), fashion (e.g., Bontoux et al. 2017; Probst et al. 2013), and new materials (e.g., UK Government 2017; Singh et al. 2015). These manufacturing sectors were chosen because their production processes have been the object of intense cross-border fragmentation in the 1990s and early 2000s, and are now the object of robust policy initiatives at the national and EU levels (see, for instance, the European Task Force for Advanced Manufacturing) given their contribution  to the EU’s overall productivity and real income growth (European Commission 2013). We analyzed the interplay between firm-based, place-based and global drivers leading to a high level of firms’ performance, via a fuzzy sets/qualitative comparative analysis (henceforth fs/QCA, Ragin 1987). The fs/QCA is a methodology able to detect different combinations of conditions that are necessary and sufficient to obtain the same outcome (Grandori and Furnari 2008). The article will proceed as follows. The next section will frame the article in the current literature and formulate the hypothesis which is tested in Sect. 3, where the methodology, the data and the model are presented. Section 4 discusses the results and Sect. 5 offers some concluding remarks.

Nichols,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Gambling in various forms is increasingly being legalized to generate additional tax revenue by state and local governments faced with the unpopularity of increasing traditional taxes, such as income, sales, or property tax (Price and Novak 2000; Walker 2009). Past research has shown that introducing new forms of gambling to an area could have negative effects such as cannibalization of the market currently served by casinos (Phipps et al. 2020; Walker and Jackson 2008) and the spread of problem gambling behavior (Dowling et al. 2005; Holtgraves 2009; Walker 2009). More centrally to this study, gambling as a taxation instrument may be regressive, particularly when it is more available (Anderson 2005; Borg et al. 1991; Suits 1977). Several studies have found that state lottery expenditures, a form of gambling that is widespread across many communities, are regressive (Borg and Mason 1988; Hansen 1995; Price and Novak 2000; Combs et al. 2008) and occur disproportionately among minority populations (Cook and Clotfelter 1993; Hansen 1995; Price and Novak 2000). This study examines how another recent form of widespread gambling, Video Gambling Terminals (VGT), correlates with poverty rates and other sociodemographic characteristics of local areas in Illinois. Is the concentration of, and expenditure on, VGT gambling greater in more disadvantaged neighborhoods? Answering this question is important in order to better understand where the burden of this new tax base potentially lies and is the major objective and contribution of this paper. As of 2017, 40 states have legalized VGTs (also called slot machines, or electronic gaming machines, or EGMs) of which 24 have VGTs in commercial casinos and 28 have VGTs in tribal casinos. However, only 10 states have VGTs in non-casino establishments and, of those states, Illinois has by far the most machines, even surpassing Nevada (28,271 versus 18,719, respectively). While there are 10 casinos in Illinois, there are over 6000 non-casino establishments with VGTs spread all across the state, making VGT gambling much more accessible than slot machines in casinos, and Illinois an ideal case to study the tax burden of VGT gambling based on the sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods generating the most revenue and with the highest machine density. Legalized gambling is typically adopted to create additional tax revenue; however, the burden of that taxation is less clear and in need of research (NGIPC 1999; Anderson 2005; Chhabra 2007; AGPC 2010). This study focuses on the burden of VGT gambling as related to the geographical characteristics of gambling establishments. If VGT gambling is similar in nature to lottery, then we expect to see greater expenditure and density in more socioeconomically disadvantaged communities with lower income. Similarly, communities with lower tax revenue are more likely to be interested in new potential revenue streams and would seek to maximize that revenue by encouraging machine density and spending. These communities may also have lower income. It is also plausible, of course, that higher-income neighborhoods demand more services that require increased tax revenue, making density and expenditure greater in these neighborhoods. Thus, VGT density and revenue are likely to vary by the sociodemographic and economic conditions in a community, but the direction of this variation is not clear, a priori. Identifying that correlation is a major contribution of this paper. Illinois presents a unique combination of pervasive VGT use and detailed revenue and location data that, to our knowledge, no other US states offer. Unlike Illinois, Nevada does not report VGT revenue or number of machines by establishment. Analysis of VGT activity and neighborhood characteristics is therefore not possible for Nevada. However, it is important to note that we do not have data on individual gamblers, nor do we know for certain which individuals are actually playing VGTs or their income level, but given the widespread diffusion of VGTs compared to casinos (see Figs. 1, 2, and 3), it seems like a reasonable assumption that people are likely to play the machines that are in their neighborhood and that the sociodemographic characteristics of the neighborhood are representative of the individual players. Number of VGTs across Illinois in 2017 Number of VGTs per capita across Illinois in 2017 Expenditures on VGTs per capita across Illinois in 2017 The next section provides some institutional background on the spread of VGTs in Illinois and reviews other relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data used in our analyses. In Sect. 4, we present the methods of our analysis. Section 5 presents our results, followed by Sect. 6 which contains concluding remarks and possibilities for future research.",3
67.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,03 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-021-01049-y,Which travels farther? Knowledge or rivalry?,October 2021,Kyriakos Drivas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"How knowledge diffuses across space is one the most studied topics in innovation economics. The landmark study by Jaffe et al. (1993) approximated knowledge flows via patent citations; their findings showed that despite its intangible nature, knowledge flows are constrained by geographic distance. Several scholars since then have examined additional proxies of knowledge flows; these include paper citations (Belenzon and Schankerman 2013), inventor mobility (Breschi and Lissoni 2009), co-inventorship (Morescalchi et al. 2015) and patent transfers (Drivas et al. 2016) among others. Regardless of the proxy, these studies find a strong localization effect; in other words, entities are more likely to benefit from knowledge from within their region’s peers than outside.Footnote 1 Note that studies have focused on various levels of regional analysis including national and subnational units. This large interest of measuring the geographic reach of knowledge spillovers is well-justified. The strong localization of knowledge supports the view that regional clusters will promote innovative activity, entrepreneurship and thereby economic growth (Jacobs 1969; Glaeser et al. 1992). Follow-up studies have refined the composition of knowledge spillovers through the lens of geographic proximity to further examine their contribution (Fischer et al. 2008; Antonelli et al. 2011; Eriksson 2011; Kolympiris et al. 2011). However, bringing firms geographically closer together does not only induce knowledge spillovers; it also generates rivalry. Rivalry can have positive and negative implications for economic growth. On the one hand, Porter (1990) argued that strongly competitive specialized industries can be the drivers of regional growth. Competition will advance imitation and push firms to deliver innovation at a higher rate. On the other hand, dating back at least as early as Chinitz (1961), rivalry can have negative implications; by comparing the cases of New York and Pittsburgh argued that high industry concentration can impede knowledge spillovers and therefore growth. In a more recent study, when Malmberg and Maskell (2002) reviewed the literature on spatial clusters they found mixed evidence on the positive role of knowledge spillovers. They posited that a main reason for this ambiguity in the literature is the lack of conceptual consideration of market rivalry.Footnote 2 Unlike knowledge spillovers however, we know little over the geographic reach of market rivalry. Even though its overall net effect on regional growth can be heterogenous across regions, to date the extent of localization has not been examined in a large scale. Perhaps more importantly, a comparison between market rivalry and knowledge spillovers can provide substantial insights on these two forces of regional innovation. The paper aims to provide a geographic comparison of these channels in a large scale. While for knowledge spillovers, there are metrics that can be used in a large scale, the same is not true for market rivalry. In this paper, trademark oppositions are proposed as such metric. Firms invest substantial effort and money to create brand equity which in turn creates value added for their offerings leading to higher margins and increased market share (Keller 1993). Even for an average firm this process is crucial in terms of business strategy. Crass et al. (2019) estimated that investments in brand equity can translate in hundreds of thousands of Euros for the median firm in Europe.Footnote 3 Trademarks can help protect these investments by protecting either the firm’s name or a differentiating attribute of its products/services is the trademark. A major milestone toward registering a trademark is for the office to publish the application. At that point, competitors can assess whether the published trademark application overlaps with their existing trademark. If they believe it does, then they have the option to file for opposition over the application and, if successful, stop the application from being registered. This task of opposition reveals the rivalry between two firms that are competing for the same market share or claim the same brand for different products. It shows that the two firms are actively engaging in two non-mutually exclusive activities. First, the one firm has created a product/service that is very similar to the competitor thereby instigating the opposition by its competitor. Second, the latter competitor actively engages in opposition, which in many aspects resembles litigation, to stop its competitor from launching the product/service in its current form. Either of these two activities indicate explicitly the rivalry between the two firms. In the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), the office in charge of examining and registering trademarks with EU-wide coverage,Footnote 4 opposition is an integral part of the trademark application process and far from a rare event. In fact, approximately one in every seven trademark applications are opposed at least once. In raw numbers, of the approximately 1.4 million applications filed during 1996–2016, a little more than two hundred thousand applications have been opposed (see Sect. 4). We provide further detailed discussion in Sect. 2 to highlight the importance of trademark oppositions for firm strategy, their economic significance, and more importantly, their use as a proxy for market rivalry. Equipped with this new metric, the objective of the paper is to compare the localization of knowledge spillovers, approximated by patent citations, to market rivalry, approximated by trademark oppositions at the regional level. In doing so, we examine the heterogeneity of the geographic reach by product classes, technology fields and firm size. The baseline analysis takes place at the country level. It employs trademark oppositions from the EUIPO and patent citations from the European Patent Office (EPO). The study period is twenty-one years (1996–2016). Results show a strong within country effect for both knowledge spillovers and market rivalry. However, the home bias is substantially larger for knowledge spillovers. While there is heterogeneity by sector and firm size, the core result remains consistent. To delve further on the localization effect, we proceed at the subnational level by focusing on NUTS-3 regions for a subset of twenty European countries. The primary motivation for this additional analysis is the empirical literature that examines regional growth at smaller geographical units (Panzera and Postiglione 2014; Mazzola et al. 2018). Similar to the country-level analysis, results show a stronger within NUTS-3 home bias effect for citations vis-à-vis oppositions highlighting that even at this finer geographical level knowledge spillovers are denser than rivalry. These results may be specific to EU and the nature of the data at hand. For instance, as the study by Bacchiocchi and Montobbio (2010) showed while EPO and US patents’ citations share similar characteristics in approximating knowledge flows, there are still significant differences between the two. Therefore, given the data availability of patent and trademark data from the United States Patent Trademark Office (USPTO), we perform a similar empirical comparison for the USA. Further, the US analysis can provide insights whether the difference in localization holds at a national level in addition to the international level studied with EPO and EUIPO data. As with the EUIPO, opposition information for each relevant trademark application is compiled from raw xml data. Patent citation data are computed from USPTO as well. Next, a similar empirical analysis for trademark opposition and patent citation flows at the State- and county-levels is performed. USPTO has certain characteristics that substantially differentiate it from EUIPO: it is a national office and its opposition rate is significantly smaller than EUIPO’s due to the former’s different opposition procedures. Despite these differences, the home bias effect, either within the State or county, is again stronger for knowledge spillovers than market rivalry providing further robustness. This paper contributes to the important literature of knowledge spillovers and economic growth. Knowledge spillovers contribute to innovation. Market rivalry however can have both positive and negative effects. In any event, its role is crucial in regional growth. However, we know little over its geographic localization, especially in comparison with knowledge spillovers. We show that entities within a region will exchange more knowledge than engage in rivalry. Therefore, even in instances where rivalry can have negative effects our findings show that overall firm interactions are likely to be positive. It therefore provides support for the majority of the literature that shows positive effects of firms clustering geographically close. However, to the extent that rivalry is also strongly localized, it should be taken under consideration and closely monitored, especially in cases where evidence has shown to hinder innovation and entrepreneurship. Given the novelty of the market rivalry metric, Sect. 2 discusses in detail trademark opposition and provides stylized facts over its economic significance. Section 3 outlines the econometric specifications in all four levels of regional analysis (country, NUTS-3, US State and county). Section 4 discusses data construction and summary statistics. The tedious data compilation steps are outlined in Appendix A. Section 5 outlines the results from the econometric estimations for all regional levels. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",3

Accurately estimating in-migration probabilities for specific destinations is therefore important to understanding subnational demographic processes (Smith et al. 2013). Flows of migrants and changes in these between origin and destination communities are, in many cases, more important than changes induced by fertility behaviours (Willekens 2016). Consequently, accurately plotting age profiles of migration to destinations is important to understanding demographic changes and in projecting future migration flows between specific origins and destinations (Rogers 1975, 1986). It is also the basis for comparative work on migration across regions and nations, as well as projecting how these might change over time (Bernard and Bell 2015). Place-to-place flows are commonly used as the empirical basis for estimating destination-specific internal migration in Australia. Source data are invariably from the 5-yearly Census of Population and Housing from which the demographer can, in theory, pair origins and destinations at fine-grained geographic levels to provide age-specific migration profiles (ABS 2016). Nevertheless, in spite of the commonalities exhibited in the shape of migration profiles across countries and internally [for example, as demonstrated by Rogers and Castro (1981)], the heterogeneity of age-specific migration flows to specific destinations and the imperfectness of census data in accurately depicting underlying profiles remain as ongoing concerns for demographers (Baffour and Raymer 2019). For census data, one of the most significant issues is the temporal point-in-time capture of movements which negates moves that occurred between the temporal capture points. Specifically, for Australia two questions are included in the census to determine where the respondent lived five years ago and one year ago. These are compared to the current place of usual residence, also provided by respondents, and coded to determine whether a migration event has occurred subsequent to one or five years ago. Standardised geographic frameworks are applied to isolate the spatial specificities of the migration event and these feed into population estimates by age and gender (ABS 2019) as well as projection processes. While important to demographic analysis, the point-in-time capture of migration is limited (to one- and 5-year intervals) and masks underlying dynamicism in the flows and age profiles for migration to and from specific destinations. Not least, the absolute number of migration events is under-captured by an unknown amount since an individual may undertake multiple moves within the one- or 5-year interval, aside from the ones captured at those points in time (Courgeau 1973). This is pertinent for understanding migration in Australian because, during their life course, Australians undertake more moves on average than residents of other developed nationsFootnote 1 (Bell et al. 2015, 2017). The one- and 5-year intervals for census migration data also creates problems for demographers seeking to compare or convert across time or areas. For example, absolute numbers of migration flows captured by the 1-year variable and multiplied by five are generally significantly larger than captured in the 5-year variable. This difference is due to multiple moves made by individuals during the longer period (Rees 1977). Demographers call this the “1-year/5-year” problem, reflective of variations between migration probabilities collected over one- and 5-year intervals and hindering direct comparisons between the two. To address this issue, some demographers favour migration ratios, the probability of migrating to a particular destination conditional on out-migrating from a given origin, for their relative stability in derivation from point-in-time intervals (Rogers et al. 2003). Studies have demonstrated further weaknesses exist in census migration data including in the accuracy of destination migration which is captured for infants born within the transition interval (Rees et al. 2000) and for older migrants (Wilson and Terblanche 2018; Wilson 2020). In addition, age and gender profiles in census migration data for more rural and remote destinations are known to be more volatile, partly as a result of the issues above and combined with temporal unpredictability due to their relatively small populations (Peters et al. 2016). As a key input to modelling, the cumulative impacts of deviations from the underlying age profiles for migration are to reduce the accuracy of comparative migration metrics and their inputs to other forms of population modelling like projections. In theory, some of the shortcomings in census data might be overcome through application of administrative datasets capturing migration. However, in Australia at least, while the landscape of unit record administrative data provision for such purposes is improving, there are currently no nationally consistent datasets (with sufficient coverage and longitudinal scope) for application to this purpose. Consequently, demographers continue to develop methods for generating accurate destination-specific profiles from noisy and incomplete data (Rogers et al. 2010). A growing number of studies for modelling and smoothing migration profiles are evident (for example, Rogers et al. (1978), Rogers and Castro (1981), Rogers and Watkins (1987), Congdon (2008), Wilson (2010), Bernard and Bell (2015), Wilson (2020), Dyrting (2020)). The basis for attempts to estimate smooth origin–destination-age-specific migration intensities are counts of movers by destination from an origin population, both of which are available by single year of age from census data. Modelling migration involves a multinomial process within which smooth intensities can be estimated using a number of methods. Willekens (2008), for example, utilised the maximum likelihood method which Hachen (1988) highlighted can be approached from either a competing-risk perspective, where out-migration is estimated separately for each destination, or from a generation–distribution perspective (Rogers et al. 2002), where out-migration and migration ratios are estimated separately. Both approaches have been used to prepare inputs to models for projecting subnational populations (Campbell 1996; Nash 2020). P-splines are a powerful tool for smoothing and have been applied to estimating mortality (Currie et al. 2004; Camarda 2012; Gonzaga and Schmertmann 2016), and the generation component of out-migration (Dyrting 2020). Our aim here is to extend the method to more accurately smooth the distribution component of migration than methods currently employed. Our approach is motivated by Rogers et al. (2002)’s observation that, while migration probabilities are strongly age-dependent, migration ratios are less so. On this basis, the problem of separating signal from noise, which all smoothing methods seek to solve, should be more effective for ratios than for probabilities. In the next section, we give a review of transition-style migration probabilities and ratios and summarise the problem of removing irregularities in the age profile through smoothing. In Sects. 3 and 4 we introduce the multinomial model and the P-spline method applied to ratios, demonstrating its solution by iterated linear regressions. In Sect. 5, we apply the method to smoothing the distribution component of interstate migration for Australia. In Sect. 6, we illustrate how it can be combined with a method for smoothing the generation component of out-migration to smooth destination-specific migration probabilities. In Sect. 7 we show how the method can be used to directly compare ratios for 1-year and 5-year migration intervals.",1

Santos Cruz,Aurora A. C. Teixeira,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The UN General Assembly has declared 2021 the International Year of Creative Economy for Sustainable Development.Footnote 1 Creative economy and Creative Industries (CI) have been recognised by public policy authorities all over the world as a “significant sector and a meaningful contributor to national gross domestic product” (UNCTAD 2018, p. 3). Although the definition and boundaries of CI are not clear cut and no consensus has yet been reached (see Galloway and Dunlop 2007; Cruz and Teixeira 2015a, b), CI are, in general, considered as a (growing and) key segment of the knowledge economy, primarily dedicated to the creation of high value-added goods and the production of artistic, cultural, knowledge-based, technological and media outputs, which are mainly distributed through worldwide and/or digital networks, that act as the means to reach distant markets and facilitate the customisation of demand (Mossig 2011; Pratt and Hutton 2013). The relevance of CIs has been lengthy stressed in the political agenda of the European Union (European Parliament 2016; EU 2018; Amann 2020) as they are inter-related with other industry sectors, contribute to for the cultural, digital and smart specialisation of cities and regions, and promote social development and employment sustainability even in the face of economic downturns (UNESCO 2013; Cunningham and Swift 2019; Tao et al. 2019; Towse 2019). Additionally, over the past decade, the academic and political debate on industrial location has gradually come to highlight the geography of knowledge-intensive services and the clustering of ‘soft innovation’ and creative activities as drivers of regional growth (Cooke and De Propris 2011; Pratt and Hutton 2013; Ghio et al. 2015; Serrano 2020). The choice of where to locate a firm is one of the most vital steps of the starting up process, determining the success of the firm’s current and future activity (Alamá-Sabater et al. 2011) as well as the vitality of the region where that firm is located (Li et al. 2016). Notwithstanding the scientific and policy attention in CIs, it is not yet clear what are the main location determinants of CIs and how these location decisions have change in face of the 2007–2008/2008–2009 global financial/economic crisis. Given the increasing perspective that the economic growth potential of CIs is higher than that the remaining industries, “promot[ing] labour productivity through increasing the level of technology” (Tao et al. 2019: 143), and generating positive regional social returns (Falck et al. 2018), and being more resilient over the recession than other sectors of activity (Cooke and De Propris 2011; De Propris 2013; Gabe et al 2013; Andres and Round 2015; UNCTAD 2018), it is imperative for regional policy design and for evaluating the efficacy of local-based policies regarding the CIs to scrutinise and disentangle which factors matter the most for attracting new CIs firms single out the ones that mostly contribute to regional and sectoral resilience (Escalona-Orcao et al. 2018). The sever impact of the 2008–2009 economic crisis and its associated austerity measures have caused an unprecedented wave of business insolvencies and economic downshift in most advanced economies (Cooke and De Propris 2011; Martin 2012; Pal et al. 2014; Skålholt and Thune 2014; Capello et al. 2015), affecting particularly European countries and Southern European regions (Landini et al. 2015). This is even more relevant when there is a high correlation between the firms’ resilience factors and the regions where they are located or created (Audretsch and Dohse 2007; Martin 2012; Capello et al. 2015; Peric and Vitezic 2016). A relatively small number of studies has concentrated on the effects of the crisis on high-tech, knowledge-intensive and creative sectors (e.g. Mina 2014; Rozentale 2014; Andres and Round 2015; Khal and Hundt 2015; Seman and Carrol 2017). This essentially descriptive and exploratory literature suggests that CIs have shown higher resilience than more mature, traditional manufacturing sectors and lower-order services activities. Additionally, some descriptive evidence was gathered that CIs have reconceptualised their geographical and location factors, tending to concentrate or (re)locate in urban centres and regions providing institutional conditions and sources of resilience for them to cope with the crisis (Cooke and De Propris 2011; Donald et al. 2013; Godrach and Seman 2013; Pratt and Hutton 2013; Andres and Round 2015). It is therefore relevant to analyse, involving a large number of newly created firms, whether from the pre-crisis (2005–2007) to the economic downturn (2008–2012) period the importance of traditional CIs location determinants (e.g. creative capital, technology/ innovation, diversity, tolerance, quality of life) increased or decreased vis-à-vis more resilience-based CIs factors (e.g. agglomeration and localisation economies, intersectoral complementarities with other sector activities, human capital, social capital, local rents and public amenities, and regional public policy support). In this context, two main research questions are put forward: (1) Did the determinants of the location decisions of CIs change from the pre-crisis period to the 2008–2009 period and afterwards?; (2) Did the location determinants of CIs shift towards more resilience-based factors? To respond to these questions, we resort to a Count Data model approach (e.g. Arauzo et al. 2010; Manjón and Arauzo 2010; Liviano and Arauzo 2014), based on highly detailed data on 6332 firms and 308 municipalities from a unique, official, linked employer–employee dataset, the present study provides a thorough analysis of new firm formation in CIs before and over the period of 2007–2008 financial and economic crisis. In particular, it intends to understand in what way regions have provided the necessary conditions to preserve these industries’ entrepreneurial dynamism and contributed to their resilience during the economic downturn. Section 2 reviews the most recent literature on the determinants of CI industrial location, relating them with the firms’ and regions’ resilience factors. Section 3 presents the methodology followed.

In fact, given the obvious cost of mobility and housing, for example, the existence of large urban agglomerations is difficult to conciliate with the presence of rational agents without the presence some benefits from the spatial concentration of activities and people (Puga 2010; Duranton and Puga 2014; Thisse 2018). Dynamic cities are generally viewed as engines of economic growth (WDR, 1999). In spite of these findings, two associated branches of empirical investigation in spatial economics focused on urban economic agglomeration gains and structure are still subject to dispute. First, despite the recent contribution by Duranton and Puga (2004) in formalizing the micro-foundations for urban gains (via sharing, matching, and learning), the debate about the particular empirical relevance of each of these channels is still inconclusive (Krugman 1991; Andersson et al. 2007; Di Addario 2011; Wheeler 2008; Overman and Puga 2010; Abel and Deitz 2015; Lychagin et al. 2016). Second, apart from some evidence about particular sectors (Leslie and HUallacháin BÓ, 2006; Arzaghi and Henderson 2008; Klier and McMillen 2008), not much evidence has been found to understand the general patterns of spatial distribution of activities within urban centers (Kolko 2010; Billings and Johnson 2016; Silva et al. 2019). Treating the spatial environment as a continuum of points, recent proposed measures of location patterns of activities represent an opportunity for new advances in knowledge about the location patterns of cities. Specifically, Duranton and Overman (2005) and Marcon and Puech (2009) proposed measures of spatial location of activities based on distance between agents (firms or workers), the so-called distance-based measures, which are not susceptible to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), as happens with the traditional measures of concentration, proposed, for example, by Ellison and Glaeser (1997). Mainly when applied to urban spaces, where the segregation of land use is common, the new measures allow obtaining much more reliable information about the distribution of economic activities. Research using continuous measures to document the concentration of productive activity is, however, still relatively scarce. This can be explained by the fact that the measures demand detailed information about firm or job location, necessary for geocoding the data. Nonetheless, the literature is growing steadily. Duranton and Overman (2005) reported levels of concentration of manufacturing activities in the UK, Nakajima et al. (2012) and Inoue et al. (2019) did the same for Japan, Vitali et al. (2013) considered a set of European countries, Behrens and Bougna (2015) explored the case of Canada, and Aleksandrova et al. (2019) investigated the Russian case. Note that most of these works focus on analyzing manufacturing location patterns. Considering service and manufacturing sectors in Germany, the main results of Koh and Riedel (2014) showed that 71% of manufacturing and 97% of services had a significant geographic concentration. For France, Barlet et al. (2008) detected 94% of French service sectors as being localized. Applying specifically the measure proposed by Duranton and Overman (2005), Méndez-Ortega and Arauzo-Carod (2019) recently showed that the specific sector of software and video games in the metropolitan regions of Barcelona (Spain) and Hamburg (Germany) tend to located near the core of their respective urban centers. These findings suggest that services may be more concentrated than manufacturing, especially in large cities (Kolko 2010). Although Brazil’s very high urbanization rate, evidence about the patterns of location of economic activities in Brazilian cities is almost nonexistent. The investigations about spatial concentration and patterns of location of economic activities in Brazil present two clear characteristics: the works are based on traditional measures that are sensitive to the MAUP and they rarely study location patterns in an intra-urban context (Silveira Neto 2005; Resende and Wyllie 2005; Lautert and Araújo 2007; Almeida and Rocha 2018; Rocha et al. 2019). To the best of our knowledge, the recent work of Silva et al. (2019) for the Recife Metropolitan Region is the only exception. In the current investigation, we intend to attenuate this lack of information and contribute to the emergent empirical literature about distance-based measures of location patterns of economic activities in urban areas. Specifically, the objective of this paper is to provide evidence about the patterns of spatial location of service activities in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), the largest urban agglomeration in Brazil and one of the biggest in the world. In this task, we use geocoded data of formally registered firms and jobs and the nonparametric method developed by Duranton and Overman (2005) to obtain more reliable information about the location patterns of economic activities in the SPMR. Note that by dealing only with service activities, we produce more reliable counterfactuals, since the statistical significance is obtained by simulations of potential locations using the universe of economic activities. Besides this, the focus on Brazil’s biggest metropolis allows considering a higher number of service activities, since some activities are not present, for example, in the Recife Metropolitan Region investigated by Silva et al. (2019). In addition, since the SPMR is richer and has a higher share of formal firms (with taxpayer registration) in the economy than the Recife Metropolitan Region, we are also able to reduce potential problems associated with the omission of informal firms. Our results indicate that 88.89% of the service sectors studied have significant spatial location patterns. These results are in line with evidence found for other countries with continuous measures (Koh and Riedel 2014) and also for Brazil with more limited measures (Domingues et al. 2006; Maciente 2013). Using cumulative density functions (CDF) for distances between pairs of firms, we also show that activities with an identified pattern of location generally present a higher probability of having firms located at shorter distance from each other and that most of these firms belong to three group of activities: FIRE (finance and real estate), IT-related services, and high human capital-based services. Additional results also identify the dimension and the location of spatial clusters of activities belonging to these three groups. Finally, we also find that both the location patterns of activities and the degree of proximity or agglomeration are positively associated with human capital, the degree of product differentiation, and the degree of inter-sector dependence of activities. In addition to this introduction section, the paper is organized in four more sections. In the next section, we present the characteristics of our area of study and the dataset used. In the third section, the empirical strategy is presented. The last two sections present the results and discussion and the final comments, respectively.",3

The United Nations system claims to base its actions on the idea of a governance that “promotes equity, participation, pluralism, transparency, accountability and the rule of law, in a manner that is effective, efficient and enduring, (…) advances development, by bringing its energies to bear on such tasks as eradicating poverty, protecting the environment, ensuring gender equality, and providing for sustainable livelihoods.” (UNDP 2014), and the World Bank sees good governance as “the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies” (Kaufmann et al. 2009). At the same time, the scholarly literature has recurrently focused on the relationship between formal and informal institutions and economic development, unveiling their historical role in shaping countries’ and regions’ current economic performance or their importance for the effectiveness of public policy (Acemoglu et al. 2001; Rodrik et al. 2004; Tabellini 2010; Rodríguez-Pose 2013). Despite the growing interest in the role of the quality of institutions in enhancing social welfare and promoting local development, there has been little research so far on whether the ability of a polity to express a good government—the agathòs dimension from the Ancient Greek culture that the title of this paper refers to—can help preserve the richness, beauty and value of cultural heritage—the kalòs dimension of a local community. Indeed, as a form of cultural and territorial capital, heritage stores or gives rise to cultural value that fosters the identity of places and the cohesion of communities, but also contributes, in combination with other inputs, to the production of goods and services that generate economic and social impacts (Throsby, 1999; Camagni and Capello 2013). Similarly, cultural heritage is an asset owning public good characteristics (Serageldin 1999; Peacock and Rizzo 2008), whose protection requires the contribution and coordination of several private and public actors, as well as the design and implementation of appropriate public policies and regulations. For historical reasons, cultural heritage is particularly relevant in Europe and its conservation and support have become major policy issues in the last decades, with local governments and stakeholders playing an increasingly active role in promoting heritage sites for culture-led development strategies (Van Balen and Vandesande, 2016). The question we address here is if the quality of sub-national institutions throughout Europe is an important ingredient for the protection and promotion of heritage. More specifically, we use an index of the quality of government across European regions to account for institutional heterogeneity and investigate how this measure is associated with the inclusion of new heritage sites into the UNESCO World Heritage List, an event that we consider as a proxy of regional authorities’ and stakeholders’ ability to support cultural heritage as a factor of regional competitiveness. In doing so, we take a regional perspective by combining a novel dataset on UNESCO World Heritage designations of European regions for the period 2010–2015 with region-level data on quality of government institutions gathered by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg. Moreover, since we deal with territorial units whose spatial location might have potentially important implications, we make explicit use of spatial econometric methods in investigating the determinants of inclusion in the UNESCO List. The main results of our empirical analysis can be briefly summarized as follows. First, after controlling for several factors at both regional and national level, the chances of a region having a heritage site inscribed in the UNESCO List in a given year are estimated to be positively associated with the quality of the government of the region, particularly when measured in terms of control of corruption and of quality of public services provided. On the other hand, as far as inter-regional interdependencies are concerned we find no significant spill-over on a region from the stock of World Heritage in surrounding regions. At the same time, the number of regions in a country turns out to have a weakly significant negative impact on a region’s success in site inscription, pointing to within-country competition between regions for nominating and inscribing sites in the World Heritage List. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it addresses the effect of the quality of institutions on a novel dimension of regional performance. The quality of government has been found to affect regions’ performance along several dimensions, namely the capacity to innovate, the effectiveness of regional policies, the return to investment, the presence of small and medium-sized enterprises in the local economy, and the attractiveness of regions to migrants (Rodriguez-Pose and Di Cataldo 2015; Rodriguez-Pose and Garcilazo 2015; Ketterer and Rodríguez-Pose 2015; Nistotskaya et al. 2015; Crescenzi et al. 2016). We contribute to that literature by unveiling how the quality of regional government is associated with the capacity to protect and promote cultural heritage at the local level through the inscription process into the World Heritage List. Indeed, while suggestive of the existence of a genuinely causal impact of the quality of regional government on its performance in the protection of cultural heritage, the lack of truly experimental circumstances in our research design implies that this evidence should only be considered as a first step in the investigation of the hitherto unexplored ability of good government to best preserve regional patrimony. Secondly, the paper is connected to the emerging literature on political, economic and institutional determinants of World Heritage designations (Bertacchini and Saccone 2012; Frey et al. 2013; Parenti and De Simone 2015; Bertacchini et al. 2016). Factors such as a country’s income level, economic power, tourism specialization and active involvement on the World Heritage Committee sessions have been found to have an impact on the likelihood for a country to have sites included World Heritage List. While these studies use data at the country level, we contribute to this literature by providing new evidence as to whether the same factors hold at the European subnational level. The final novel contribution of this paper is to go beyond the conventional country-level analysis of UNESCO World Heritage site allocation and attribute the existing heritage sites across the over 200 regions of Europe—the geographic area hosting the highest share of World Heritage designations in the world—by employing their unique GIS coordinates from the UNESCO World Heritage Center Database. This makes it possible to study for the first time the local determinants of their inscription as well as to test for inter-regional spillovers and spatial dependence patterns. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relationship between the quality of institutions and heritage preservation and promotion through UNESCO designations. In Sect. 3 we show the spatial distribution of World Heritage sites across the European regions, while in Sect. 4 we introduce the empirical models and discuss the results of the econometric analysis. Section 5 concludes.",
67.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,26 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-021-01057-y,“To be or not to be” located in a cluster?—A descriptive meta-analysis of the firm-specific cluster effect,December 2021,Nils Grashof,Dirk Fornahl,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The co-location in regional clustersFootnote 1 is an economic reality that characterizes most developed economies in the twenty-first century. According to the European Cluster Observatory, just within the European Union (EU) there are 2.000 statistically relevant clusters that employ nearly 40% of the European workforce (Brown et al. 2007; Festing et al. 2012; Nathan et al. 2013). In view of conspicuous examples, such as Silicon Valley, the concept has become popular among politicians who are motivated to foster cluster initiatives in order to write a similar success story for their region. Therefore, many cluster initiatives receive financial support from national governments, the EU and other public institutions. For example, since 2005 the German government has launched several programmes with a total volume of 1.391 billion € to foster clusters in Germany (EFI 2015; Festing et al. 2012). Given the already substantial financial support of cluster activities, it is reasonable to assume that scientists have identified a consistent positive cluster effect on the success of companies within a cluster. However, the scientific results about the firm-specific cluster effect are indeed highly contradictive (Malmberg et al. 2002; Martin et al. 2003). While authors such as Borowiecki (2013) as well as Basant et al. (2011) find evidence that companies located in clusters have a higher productivity than companies outside clusters, other researchers come to different results, ranging from negative performance effects (Pouder et al. 1996) to rather mixed effects (Knoben et al. 2015). This inconsistency in the empirical results prevents general conclusions about the firm-specific cluster effect,Footnote 2 particularly with regard to the actual effect direction (Fang 2015). According to Frenken et al. (2015), one of the main challenges for future research lies in reconciling the contradictory empirical findings and thereby working towards closing the research gap on the alleged effect of clusters on firm performance. We respond to this call by integrating previous empirical results, thereby answering the following research question: Does being located in a cluster influence firm success? More specifically, we investigate whether the still prevalent assumption in the scientific literature and among policy-makers that clusters are a beneficial location for firms is unconditionally true or whether doubts about the alleged positive effect of clusters on firm performance are reasonable. In order to answer this research question adequately, we conduct a descriptive meta-analysis of the empirical literature on the firm-specific cluster effect. A descriptive meta-analysis is an appropriate methodical approach in this context, because it is a meaningful way of combining empirical studies with contradicting results (Fang 2015). Yet, up to now, studies have employed a meta-analysis procedure only on the regional level (e.g. De Groot et al. 2007; Melo et al. 2009) and not in the context of firm-specific cluster effects. One important exception is the recent work by Fang (2015). However, this article differs from Fang (2015) in several important ways, for example, its explicit focus on the firm level, its scope of considered performance variables, its extensive literature collection based on four publication databases, as well as a more precise selection process that controls for, among others, a similar cluster understanding across the considered studies. As such, this article follows a clearer and more comprehensive approach to investigate the effect of being located in a cluster on firm success. In general, our results indicate a tendency towards a rather significant positive cluster effect on firm success. But at the same time, we also find evidence for heterogeneity across the individual studies considered in our descriptive meta-analysis, suggesting an influence of moderating variables. By identifying several variables from different levels of analysis (micro-, meso- and macro-level) that directly or interactively moderate the relationship between clusters and firm success, we conclude that, contrary to conventional thinking, being located in a cluster does not automatically lead to positive performance effects, but instead it rather depends on the specific conditions. By providing an answer to the underlying research question through reconciling the contradictory empirical results, the paper not only provides a comprehensive overview that enriches the understanding about the alleged effect of clusters and serves as a crucial stepping stone to closing a still ubiquitous research gap, but also fulfils a practical demand by informing companies as well as policy-makers so they can gauge the concrete firm-specific effects of cluster initiatives. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The second section introduces the theoretical background, highlighting the theoretical debate about cluster (dis-)advantages and establishing an adequate working definition of a cluster by reviewing the corresponding literature. The third section describes the applied methodical approach and data. Thereafter, the fourth section presents the empirical results. The paper will end with some concluding remarks, including limitations to this study as well as promising future research directions.",8

Classical explanations focus on the factors driving firms to become multinational. The Ownership-Localization-Internalization theory (see Dunning 2001) explains firms’ motivation as an effort to internalize transaction costs and reap the benefits of externalities stemming from strategic assets. A large alternative strand of empirical literature builds on trade theory. In this context the drivers of FDI activity are the need for larger sales markets, cheaper source markets, and the willingness to reach a technological frontier (Markusen 1995). Following empirical international economics literature, FDI flows are usually captured within the context of a bilateral spatial interaction model framework. The main advantage of this approach is that it specifically accounts for the role of origin- and destination-specific factors, as well as intervening opportunities. For an overview on the determinants of FDI activities and the location choice of multinationals, see Basile and Kayam (2015), Blonigen and Piger (2014), or Blonigen (2005). Due to the scarcity of data on FDI activities on a subnational scale, the vast majority of the empirical literature focuses on country-specific FDI patterns. A subnational perspective, however, would allow for in-depth decomposition of the spatial patterns of FDI flows, since FDI sources and destinations are not uniformly distributed within a country, but tend to be spatially clustered. Multiple studies focusing on regional investment decisions of multinational companies (Crescenzi et al. 2013; Ascani et al. 2016a; Krisztin and Piribauer 2020) emphasize within-country heterogeneity of FDI decisions, which can exceed cross-country differences. However, a major gap in the literature is that regional level studies only focus on the destination of FDI decisions, and largely neglect to account for origin-specific factors, as well as intervening opportunities in a subnational context. However, a simultaneous treatment appears particularly important for providing a complete picture on third-regional spatial interrelationships in both source- as well as destination-specific characteristics (Leibrecht and Riedl 2014). Moreover, neglecting to take into account both origin, destination, and third region effects, can lead to biased parameter estimates (Baltagi et al. 2007). The present paper aims to fill these gaps by focusing on subnational FDI flows in a European multi-regional framework and explicitly accounting for origin-, destination-, as well as third region-specific factors. In this paper, we make use of subnational data from the fDi Markets database, which reports on bilateral FDI flows, with detailed information on the source and destination city. This can be compiled to multiple dyadic format, that is each region pair appears twice, corresponding to FDI flowing from one region to the other and vice versa. A specific virtue of the database is that it distinguishes FDI flows by their respective business activity. This allows us to contrast the impact of origin, destination, and third region effects across multiple stages of the global values chain. Origin- and destination-specific third region effects are captured in our empirical model in two ways. First, the model specification contains spatial contextual effects by means of spatially lagged explanatory variables (see Regelink and Elhorst 2015). Second, we moreover employ an econometric framework in the spirit of Koch and LeSage (2015) and LeSage et al. (2007) which captures spatial dependence using spatially-augmented random effects. When adopting a subnational perspective, it is crucial to control for spatial dependence, as its presence in regional data is well documented (LeSage and Pace 2009). Even national-level empirical applications clearly document the presence of spatial spillovers on FDI activities. An influential example is the work by Blonigen et al. (2007), who analyse the determinants of US outbound FDI activities in a cross-country framework, while explicitly accounting for spatial dependence among destinations. Further studies which document the presence of spatial issues amongst bilateral (national) FDI activities include Pintar et al. (2016), Regelink and Elhorst (2015), Chou et al. (2011), Garretsen and Peeters (2009), Poelhekke and van der Ploeg (2009), or Baltagi et al. (2007). We therefore employ a spatial augmented Bayesian Poisson specification on the pan-European subnational level which aims at dealing with both orgin- and destination-specific characteristics. Estimation is achieved using work by Frühwirth-Schnatter et al. (2009), allowing us to deal with high-dimensional specifications in a flexible and computationally efficient way. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed spatial interaction model, which is augmented by spatial autoregressive origin- and destination-specific random effects, intended to capture spatially dependencies, as well as so-called third region effects. Section 3 details the FDI data, the considered determinants, as well as our selection of regions. In Sect. 4 we assess the determinants of European interregional FDI flows across different stages of the global value chain. The analysis is performed using information on FDI dyads covering 266 NUTS-2 regions in the period 2003–2011. Section 5 concludes.",

This new business model is characterised by the peer-to-peer (P2P) economy, whereby providers and clients interact directly, without an intermediary. In contrast to traditional hotels, the accommodation sector in the sharing economy provides various advantages to users, such as cost savings, familiarity (Möhlmann 2015), the desire for closer contact with the local community (Tussyadiah and Pesonen 2016) and social interactions. This type of business model also provides extra income for hosts (Karlsson and Dolnicar 2016). These advantages have caused Airbnb’s offering to undergo exponential growth over the 10 years this company has been in operation. Nowadays, Airbnb lists more than 6,000,000 accommodations around the world (Airbnb 2019). This phenomenon has attracted the attention of researchers, who are developing studies on the implications of Airbnb on the traditional economy and the strategic response in the hotel sector (Zervas et al. 2017; Li and Srinivasan 2019). One of the most relevant research topics in this regard is the determination of Airbnb’s listing prices. There have been reports that Airbnb hosts lose about 50% of additional revenue due to inefficiency when pricing (LearnAirbnb.com 2015). The main idea behind this result is that hosts are confused when setting their prices (Hill 2015). In order to overcome this situation, Airbnb has created tools for hosts to improve their pricing process (Airbnb 2019). Nevertheless, these approaches provide price approximations but do not identify the most relevant factors that condition Airbnb’s accommodation offerings. To shed additional light on this topic, researchers have developed studies based on listing characteristics from Airbnb’s webpage registers (see Gibbs et al. 2018 or Lorde et al. 2019, among others). We have found a few of them that consider not only internal accommodation conditions, such as price, number of beds or amenities, but also external characteristics (Eugenio-Martin et al. 2019;. Ki and Lee 2019; Lopez et al. 2019; Chica-Olmo et al. 2020). These studies examine the effects of the geographic proximity of Airbnb’s listings to tourist sites on prices, finding significant results for these distances. Nevertheless, they define tourist sites without considering consumers’ preferences. Given Airbnb’s virtual characteristics and the relevance of social media as a marketing tool promoting tourist cities (Fantani and Suyadnya 2015), we hypothesize that consumers’ preferences—evaluated through social media—to different tourist sites will have significant impact on Airbnb’s listing prices in each examined territory. Thus, our hypothesis is that information from social media should be included as an additional factor in the determination of Airbnb’s prices. The purpose of our study is to test this hypothesis showing an empirical application where we measure and quantify the impact of social media on Airbnb’s prices. In particular, we chose Instagram as the representative social media platform. This social network provides relevant information about the main points of interest in the city, making it a marketing tool to attract visitors (Fantani and Suyadnya 2015). In addition, the information provided by Instagram allows us to include a specific weight (number of references) for each tourist site, quantifying consumers’ preferences. In this paper, we show empirical evidence about the role consumer preference plays in pricing by studying the impact of the physical proximity of Airbnb’s listings to the referenced tourist sites on Instagram. Our study explores the relationship between Airbnb’s price offerings and information from social media about the city of Barcelona (Spain), estimating a micro-territorial hedonic model. The number of beds offered on Airbnb in Barcelona was 14,000 in 2019, which is equivalent to almost half the number of hotel rooms in that city (Sans and Quaglieri 2016). Furthermore, Barcelona ranks fourth in the Top 10 European Cities regarding the total number of beds and nights occupied by international tourists (Baudot 2015). Thus, given its relevance for the tourist sector, Barcelona is an excellent location to develop this empirical application. We collected data from Airbnb to get a sample of 14,273 registers in Barcelona in 2019. In addition, we applied a web scraping process to obtain the tourist spots referenced in Instagram and the number of their references. Apart from these, we used other auxiliary datasets to build control variables (see Table 1). With this information, we quantify the extent to which the geographic proximity of Airbnb’s listings to the tourist spots referenced in Instagram has an impact on Airbnb’s prices. To identify the causal impact of the information from social media on Airbnb’s prices, we apply spatial econometric techniques. In addition, we test the existence of nonlinearities on this model applying the nonparametric multivariate additive regression splines (MARS) technique. To perform our estimations, we regress against different subsamples established according to Airbnb’s characteristics: the kind of listing (private room or full apartment) and the host’s characteristics (professional or nonprofessional). In all our specifications, we include a set of control variables which take into account the particular listing and geographic characteristics of the surroundings of each evaluated accommodation. Our results show a negative and significant effect for the representative variable of the geographic distance of Airbnb’s listings to the tourist sites on Instagram. Thus, a shorter physical distance from Airbnb’s listings to Instagram referenced tourist sites increases prices. In particular for Barcelona, each additional 10% increase in the distance from Instagram tourist spots to Airbnb’s listings resulted in a 2.7% decrease in Airbnb’s listing price. In addition, this significant result is subjected to nonlinear behaviour, finding that each Instagram tourist point has, on average, a 120 m radius of influence. Thus, Airbnb’s listings included in these areas of influence will have their prices affected as a consequence of their proximity to these tourist sites. In order to provide additional robustness to this causal relationship, we computed the Granger causality test with significant results. Our results showed significant impact for the information on Instagram when it is included in a hedonic model to estimate Airbnb’s listing prices. This study provides additional evidence about the relevant role of social networks when accommodation offerings are examined, even when we consider accommodations included in the sharing economy. This knowledge may have strong implications for managers in the hospitality sector even more nowadays when the particular social and economic characteristics are changing the market of tourist apartments in Spain—and especially in the city of Barcelona. In this sense, a high percentage of Airbnb apartments are moving to the long-term rental market due to the reduction of the number of tourists. Therefore, the fact of identifying additional factors in the Airbnb’s pricing process is crucial for the players involved in the sharing hospitality market.",3

Politi,Enlinson Mattos,Eric Picin,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Understanding fiscal interactions at the local level is an important topic in the regional literature. The term fiscal interactions refer to situations where some jurisdictions, in general with geographical proximity, mimic each other in some policy strategy. Previous literature indicates that spatial interactions emerge from three main sources: tax competition, spillovers in public spending, and yardstick competition (Brueckner 2003; Revelli 2005). In this paper, we reconsider the issue of fiscal interactions focusing on the strategic behavior of governments regarding both business tax rates and infrastructure spending choices. In particular, we investigate spatial interactions for these two policy instruments using data on approximately 5,000 Brazilian municipalities over a seven-year period. Since previous work has suggested that tax interactions across localities increase competition for capital and lead to lower business tax rates (Devereux et al. 2008), it is important to understand how local infrastructure spending affects tax rate competition and whether these policy instruments exhibit any spatial correlations. To approach this issue, we build on the model of tax and input competition developed by Hauptmeier et al. (2012). The authors replace the budget constraint in the welfare function of government by the cost of public input provision and consider a congestion externality in this cost. This substitution allows them to obtain the optimal public input without using only capital taxes as the source of funding public provision. According to this model, governments can choose more than one policy instrument to compete for mobile capital and fiscal policy depends on both the average tax rate and public input spending in neighboring jurisdictions. It is important to note that fiscal interactions based on both public input spending and tax rate competition have been difficult to address so far for several reasons. First, while a large majority of the empirical literature finds an upward reaction function to be a strategic response to neighbors’ policies, this literature focuses on either tax competition (Besley and Case 1995; Revelli 2005) or public spending spillovers separately (Bruckner 2003; Redoano 2007). Just recently, some authors have focused on fiscal policy instruments as strategic complements (Hauptmeier et al. 2012; Hindricks 2008). A second reason for the limited empirical evidence on this topic is related to methodology. Previous work has tested for the existence of a spatial spillover effect based on the spatial lag coefficient of explanatory variables or on the spatial autocorrelation coefficient. Recently, the empirical literature has moved the focus to models with multiple interaction effects, to panel data, and to the marginal effects of the independent variables rather than the coefficient estimates of the interaction effects (Elhorst 2013). In fact, there is a growing empirical literature on spatial spillover effects. Recent work includes Fonseca and Llamosas-Rosas (2019), who investigate spatial dependence in foreign direct investment in Mexican states, and Langer (2019), who investigates spatial interactions for eight different expenditure subcategories in 396 German municipalities. In addition, Ho and Berggren (2020) evaluate local bank branch closures on new firm formation in 290 Swedish municipalities. All of these articles take advantage of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) in a panel data context and consider the impacts of changes in the explanatory variable on the dependent variable in its own economy (direct effect) as well in their neighbors’ (indirect effect). Similarly, in this paper, we explore the SDM method to investigate the interaction effects associated with public input spending on the business tax rate. In particular, using the SDM approach, we are able to disentangle the intentional (direct) and unintentional (indirect) effects of fiscal interactions and still control for time and fixed effects. Additionally, we use a dynamic specification to address both short- and long-term effects. As predicted in Hauptmeier et al. (2012), we find strong evidence that fiscal interaction is driven by both infrastructure spending and tax rate choices. More interestingly, the results indicate that communities respond to neighboring tax rate cuts by increasing their own public infrastructure spending, or concurrently, municipalities respond to an increase in neighboring public input spending by cutting their own tax rates. The main results suggest that an increase of one hundred Brazilian Reais (R$) in spending per capita on infrastructure in a particular municipality increases the jurisdiction’s own business tax rate by 0.26 to 0.74 percentage points. Moreover, if a particular jurisdiction increases its infrastructure spending by 100 R$ per capita, neighboring municipalities respond, on average, by cutting their business tax rates by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. We provide additional evidence using the SAR model for comparison. Importantly, we note that the cost of ignoring spatial dependence in both own and neighboring independent variables is relevant. We should note that there is one trade-off associated with this empirical strategy. Although by using the SDM, we are able to tackle spatial lags in the dependent and independent variables, as well as exogenous and endogenous spatial effects in a panel data setting, the SDM approach does not account for the potential simultaneity between the tax rate and public input spending. To circumvent this issue, we provide additional results using a cross-sectional generalized spatial two-stage least squares (GS2SLS) model, similar to Hauptmeier et al. (2012), which explicitly accounts for the simultaneity of the fiscal variables but does not control for the dynamics, unit, and time fixed effects. To discuss capital competition in Brazil, this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses some hypotheses regarding spatial interaction of public input provision and business tax rate based on previous literature. Section 3 depicts the empirical approach. Section 4 describes the Brazilian institutional framework. The results are shown in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 presents the conclusion.",1

Kohlhase,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"As the flow of individuals across country borders increases, women increase their participation in the labor force across many different sectors, and more elderly individuals stay in the labor force, firms and cities are likely to become more diverse in terms of their labor force. Given this background, the goal of our paper is to analyze the impact of the increasing diversity of the work force on new firm formation. Our paper contributes to the current discussions on the economic effects of a diverse labor force. The role of new firms for economic growth and development is well-documented. New firms contribute to employment growth, productivity growth, and innovations (Baumol 2002; van Praag and Versloot 2007). Moreover, Glaeser et al. (2015) show the positive relation between start-up employment share and long-term employment growth in US cities. Lee (2017) finds positive effects of new firm formation on employment and wages in the wider local economy, benefits that stretch beyond the new firms themselves. Given the importance of new firm formation for regional growth, and the increasing diversity of the labor force in cities, we are motivated to assess how diversity contributes to new firm formation. There are numerous studies focusing on how a diverse labor force in terms of an individual’s background, i.e., cultural diversity, effect new firm formation (Audretsch et al. 2010; Cheng and Li 2012; Lee et al. 2004; Niebuhr 2010; Rodríguez-Pose and Hardy 2015). Our paper extends the existing literature by not only examining cultural diversity but also adding the role of labor force diversity in terms of demography, education and occupation to the analysis of new firm formation. Thus, our paper contributes to the literature by adding more dimensions to the role of diversity. Our work here complements work we have done at the individual firm level on the role of diversity on firm survival (Backman and Kohlhase 2020). The empirical design uses an aggregate approach where the effect of diversity on the rate of new firm formation at the municipal level is analyzed.Footnote 1 The aggregate approach allows us to capture the effect of the external environment on the formation of new firms. Related work by Andersson et al. (2019) also looks at new firm formation across Swedish municipalities, but does not focus as we do on diversity. Our results show the importance of diversity at the local level: we find that diversity in terms of demography, culture and education have a positive association with the rate of new firm formation. All in all, the results highlight the benefits of having a diverse set of inhabitants in terms of background, age (experience), gender and education in terms of new firm formation. These relationships are likely to work through many channels. First, a more heterogeneous set of inhabitants may create an economic environment where ideas are created and transmitted. Second, a diverse population may create a tolerant atmosphere attractive to innovative and human capital-rich individuals. Third, the probability that any individual will see an economic opportunity as a profitable venture may increase if a region is comprised of many different sets of individuals. Fourth, by having a more diverse population more economic opportunities for niched services and products may be produced. We thereby argue that a heterogeneous external labor force is beneficial for the formation of new firms. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 covers the theoretical arguments for why diversity may influence new firm formation. Section 3 covers the estimation method, description of variables, and empirical results. Section 4 concludes the paper.",1

Rodríguez Puello,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"We aim to analyze how an exogenous economic shock, which presents a differentiated effect across the subnational units in a country, could impact on the schooling and labor force participation of youth, mainly in those territories more exposed to the shock. In this regard, the classic popular theory of human capital (Becker 1964) is a good guide to understanding the causal mechanism between an exogenous economic shock and the incentives for schooling. A shock that can temporarily alter the returns for schooling in the labor market could directly affect a young individual’s decision to either join the labor market or continue their education (Willis and Rosen 1979; Zarkin 1983). For this purpose, we examine the case of Chile between 2003 and 2011, experiencing that country a sustained increase in the market price of the minerals extracted there during this period. Chile is highly specialized in the extractive industry, being a large-scale producer of metals and the world's largest producer of copper and the third largest producer of molybdenum. Nevertheless, the mining activity is mainly concentrated in the northern regions, outstanding the case of Antofagasta where this activity represents approximately 50% of the GDP and 25% of the employment (OLAB 2016). Between 2003 and 2011, the commodity boom meant a sustained increase in the price of raw materials due toFootnote 1: (i) the impact of investor flow driving through speculation (Singleton 2013) and (ii) the rapidly growing demand of emerging economies, i.e., China, which increased its imports of raw materials to sustain economic development (Radetzki et al. 2008). The positive shock on raw material demand resulted in higher prices and significant economic growth in Chile, mainly in mining areas. The Chilean labor market was directly affected by the positive business cycle. During the price boom, Chile added approximately 1,000,000 new jobs,Footnote 2 growth that was concentrated in the mining sector, and particularly in the north of the country. CountiesFootnote 3 specializing in mining saw rates of employment exceed the national average. However, the increase in employment there was primarily in low- or medium–low-skilled positions, most of which were either directly related to the mining sector or indirectly by the positive impact that this sector generated over the salaries, boosting the internal demand, for example, construction—which is also an important sector for creating the necessary infrastructure to the mining activity—as well as retail, trade and other services (Rehner and Vergara 2014). Additionally, the salary boom had an impact in terms of its distribution on the labor market between skilled and unskilled workers in the territories more exposed to the shock. Pellandra (2014) studied the effect of the metal mining price boom on the Chilean labor market and specifically those provinces with high indices of mining activity. Most of the benefits in terms of higher local wages accrued to less educated workers, while the increase in prices and exports (of raw materials) in those provinces had a more modest effect on the wages of college educated workers. Therefore, such gains contributed to a larger reduction in skill premiumsFootnote 4 in the most affected provinces (by the metal mining price boom) compared to others. The aforementioned context makes Chile an interesting case. Some studies analyze the effects of exogenous economic shocks on the schooling within the context of an economic crisis at national level, but not considering the potential differences of the shock at a local level. Their results tend to be ambiguous; some studies show that a negative shock improves schooling enrollment as a result of the reduction of opportunity costs between education and work (Goldin 1999; Mckenzie 2003; Schady 2004). Other studies have found that when these shocks negatively affect household income, they result in youth preferring employment (Funkhouser 1999; Calero et al. 2009). This ambiguity is reflected in the work of Ferreira and Schady (2009), who found that the income level in each economy is important in understanding the increase/decline in schooling enrollment during a crisis. In rich countries they found that the lack of opportunities in the labor market for younger individuals encourages them to remain in education. In poorer economies there seems to prevail an income effect between schooling and joining the labor market, which produces a pro-cyclical pattern between schooling and growth. Thus, during times of crisis in countries where household income tends to decline, young people drop out of school in order to participate in the labor market and therefore minimize the shock’s impact on the family budget.Footnote 5 Much less is known on whether natural resource export booms have a negative effect on the schooling and working decisions of youth. Black et al. (2005) (hereafter BMS (2005)) carried out a leading study on the effects of the Appalachian coal boom on high school enrollment in Kentucky and Pennsylvania in the USA.Footnote 6 The coal boom increased the recruitment of workers in the mining sector and their salaries, most of whom possessed low educational levels. The shock reduced the value of education in the market and consequently discouraged high school enrollment. In their empirical analysis they found evidence that an increase of 10% in the salaries for low-skilled workers meant a decrease of approximately 5–7% in high school enrollment. Despite the significant evidence found by BMS (2005), the authors did not assess whether the decrease in high school enrollment during the shock produced an increase in the labor force participation of youth. Therefore, although it is expected that the shock will encourage young people to drop out of school, there is no direct evidence on whether this shock produced a direct incentive for them to participate in the labor market, motivated by changes in returns to schooling. We aim to address this knowledge gap by analyzing the Chilean case, also considering the different impact of the shock across counties.",1

Tsagarakis,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Over the course of the twenty-first century, anthropogenic intervention extended environmental damage and so substantially altering consuming and producing patterns to address the depletion of resources has become a priority (Bourdin et al. 2021). Growth in the global population will result in increases in natural resources demand and will pose unprecedented challenges (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2015; UN 2015). The recent Paris Agreement and the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) endeavour to reverse this situation. However, to achieve climate targets, the world needs a fundamental shift in economic values and procedures by policymakers, businesses, and consumers. This shift implies the gradual alteration of linear and circular economic models. Although the term circular economy seems new, in fact it is just reversion to both the way in which economic activities were traditionally organized (Boulding 1966), and in which nature is (already) self-organized (D'Amato et al. 2019). It is rooted in diverse theoretical backgrounds including environmental and ecological economics, and industrial ecology (Ghisellini et al. 2016). The full transition from the (current) linear to the (future) circular economy implies huge economic transformations in the way firms behave and interact with markets (Di Maio et al. 2017; Santa-Maria et al. 2021) and relevant stakeholders (Bertassini et al. 2021), as the difference between these two strategies is substantial (Dokter et al. 2021). Concretely, a linear system means taking whatever inputs are required, making new products, and generating waste that we simply dispose of into the environment. In a circular system, we reform the way in which we design our production system, reducing economic activities reliance on conventional and intensive emissions flows (Korhonen et al. 2018a) to minimize inputs, reuse materials, and recycle waste (Accorsi et al. 2020). The Circular Economy is becoming increasingly popular because, in the long-term, it is more efficient and more sustainable than the current linear model of take-make-dispose (Nikolaou and Tsagarakis 2021). On the contrary, the Circular Economy requires us to transform current organizational structures (Franco et al. 2021), which is a constraint in the short-term (Korhonen et al. 2018b). The transformations required to move from linear to circular also require new regional and urban governance (Obersteg et al. 2019) to balance firms’ expectations with the public interest (Calzolari et al. 2021). In this sense, regional issues are a key dimension of the Circular Economy (Silvestri et al. 2020) since, for instance, the circle structure of reusing, remaking, and recycling implies a close spatial connection among all these stages (Tantau et al. 2018). It would make no sense to try to achieve sustainable goals by recycling while wastes and intermediate inputs travel long distances (i.e., a strategy involving awkward environmental externalities). So spatial proximity is required, and this implies coordination and common governance (Mhatre et al. 2021). Consequently, regions and their policy institutions must play a key role in the circular economy (Ferreira and Matias 2021). As the circular economy is related to sustainability, specific policy actions are needed to engage economic drivers of production with social and technical ones in order to reconsider energy management for supporting circular principles (Van der Velden 2021; Farooq et al. 2021). In order to boost circular activities, current energy policies need to be revisited all the way from the microlevel (Kosmadakis et al. 2021) to the macrolevel (D'Adamo, et al. 2021), in order to improve efficiency (Yildizbasi 2021) and recovery (Bezirgiannidis et al. 2020), by redesigning all stages of production (Diamantis et al. 2021), from resource harvesting to disposal (Al-Mawali et al. 2021; Medeiros et al. 2021) and end-of-life practices (Jensen et al. 2020). Furthermore, policy interventions should be considered involving the effective energy interdependence of individual industries within the industrial ecology/symbiosis concept (Al-Thani and Al-Ansari 2021; Ipsakis et al. 2021). Fortunately, a growing awareness of climate change has promoted the way in which economic activities are organized worldwide (Henrion et al. 2021), moving from traditional linear economy models, passing through more efficient reduce, recycling, reuse, renew economy models (Montag et al. 2021) to current moves towards circular economy practices (where the final target is a zero-waste scenario). Circular Economy and Sustainability targets must be supported by public policies which have a regional dimension, which accord to a subsidiarity principle and which better match the externalities of economic activities by including environmental regional management and activities supporting entrepreneurship (Polverini and Miretti 2019; Johansson and Henriksson 2020). Unfortunately, most current Circular Economy policies lack this regional dimension. A clear example is that of transporting recycled materials around the globe to be transformed and reintroduced again into production processes and new products. Although this strategy may superficially seem acceptable and in accord with Circular Economy principles, it is not at all sustainable because of the carbon footprint generated (Dermine-Brullot and Torre 2020). Therefore, location matters and, consequently, there is room for Regional Circular Economy and Sustainability policies. It is difficult to imagine a Circular Economy structure which uses the current asymmetrically distributed manufacturing production and whose spatial value chain requires globally sourced components (Calzolari et al. 2021; Iacovidou et al. 2021). How, then, to reuse, remake and recycle if that implies huge movements of components and products produced in distant locations (Christensen 2021)? But if a more balanced spatial distribution of manufacturing activity is achieved, then it is much easier to implement Circular Economy principles thanks to the closer availability of manufacturing services (Di Foggia and Beccarello 2021). An analysis of firm location patterns in recent years shows a trend towards a more balanced distribution of manufacturing activity across countries and regions. This trend has been accelerated by the disruption generated by Covid-19 and lockdowns in many countries, which have shown vulnerabilities of certain strategic products (e.g., some medicines, masks and medical devices) and have highlighted the urgent need for more resilient value chains (Nandi et al. 2021). This has, of course, created several business opportunities (Corrêa and Corrêa 2021). Despite the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the current situation also provides a challenge for the implementation of Circular Economy principles as key guidelines for (regional) public administrations, in view of the huge transformations that have been conducted worldwide. In this regard, public opinion has become aware of the environmental weakness of pre-pandemic economic strategies, and of the urgent need to redesign them in the light of Circular Economy and Sustainability goals designed from a spatial point of view.",7
68.0,2.0,The Annals of Regional Science,28 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-021-01074-x,Social and economic determinants of materials recycling and circularity in Europe: an empirical investigation,April 2022,Ioannis Kostakis,Konstantinos P. Tsagarakis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The concept of “a new sustainable and” circular economy is not new as it has its roots in the post-war environmental movements (Winans et al. 2017). Economic growth was based on overconsumption of natural resources and energy, neglecting impacts on the environment and climate change (Dauvergne 2010). Professor Kenneth Boulding characterized economics as “cowboy economics,” questioning the assumption that the Earth’s) resources were unlimited. Back in 1966, he reported in his book that: “Earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited resources […], therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system” (Boulding 1966, p. 7). He indicated that as resources are reduced so is the spaceman’s life, unless methods of waste recycling and food generating were adopted.) This spaceship, known as Earth, is characterized by circular relationships in which everything is an input into everything else (Pearce and Turner 1990; p. 37). That prophetic theory, at that time, has inspired economic and social sciences to reconsider the assumption that economic wealth is not exclusively synonymous with social wellbeing but should be seen as just one of the pillars of welfare. New values were introduced which were regarded as essential and vital to human wellbeing as economic wealth. A term introduced in economic literature by Prof. Boulding, was “human betterment”. It is a time-variant process in which the human system is evaluated as superior or better today than yesterday. Environmental quality is a “value” of this betterment process. The increasing number of environmental risks launched a new movement of climate activism. An urbanizing population claims public space and will consequently create air, water and soil pollution combined with an increasing amount of waste generation. In addition, the fast rate of industrialization combined with the consumption of resources follows a lineal model path, “produce-consume-dispose” that cannot perpetuate in a sustainable future. This is well captured in the words of Professor Stahel “The ‘bigger, better, faster, safer’ syndrome for new goods that is the hallmark of the current industrial model won’t work in an era of greater scarcity and waste accumulation” (Lacy and Rutqvist 2016, p.17). The recycling of materials and circularity in general can be important drivers of environmental improvement and sustainable growth. The new European circular economy action plan gives ample attention to recycling and circularity activities (Friant et al. 2020). Recycling can be achieved in several ways, such as the placement of neighborhood containers, zone containers, green points or curbside recyclable waste bins (Gonzalez-Torre et al. 2003; Keramitsoglou and Tsagarakis 2013). However, recycling may be negatively associated with households’ utility maximization and positively with the quantity of goods consumed (Sterner and Bartelings 1999). On the other hand, circularity is an inflated term often used as a synonym of sustainability (Acerbi and Taisch 2020). The main goal of materials circularity is extending the lifetime of resources by retaining them within an economy decelerating their replacement and making waste a new source of energy rather than a disposable material. In other words, conventional recycling under the circularity principles contributes to the achievement of zero waste by revisiting production-consumption processes (Mhatre et al. 2021). This new closed loop process of a circular economy will lead to several eventual socioeconomic, business and environmental benefits (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2019). These benefits have been categorized based on the Triple Bottom Line—economic, environmental and socialFootnote 1 (Rosa et al. 2019) that can improve the quality of human life using new technology, new business models or new lifestyle models such as a sustainable manufacturing model (Garetti and Taisch 2012). However, it is essential to highlight that this process does not only have benefits such as the creation of new jobs, saving primary materials and lowering the carbon footprint in the environment. It also has a high cost that can be mainly attributed to the use of more technical and technologically advanced equipment involving the excess use of energy. Nevertheless, even if circular economy is still being formulated (Friant et al. 2020), the approach to sustainable growth is considered a promising and ideal concept that is expected to address several environmental issues such as resource scarcity, climate change and waste disposal. For instance, waste management capacity plays a prominent role in complying with circular economy goals (Di Foggia and Beccarello 2021). Moreover, it also contributes to the optimization of energy consumption, integrating of products data and information and reducing costs both related to product and production processes (Rocca et al. 2020). Our study used data on material recycling, circulation rates and demographic characteristic indicators covering the whole European Union. This social dimension can be an important parameter for the estimation of the performance assessment methods and indices of circular economy (Vinante et al. 2020; Sassanelli et al. 2019a,b). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to find exploratory variables for the circular economy indicator, a fairly recently established indicator which has only been reported by Eurostat since 2010. We performed our analysis based on demand side theory and trying to quantify associations between socioeconomic variables. Borrowing on the traditional framework of production theory (Becker 1965), we assume that consumers, public and private utilities do not demand more recycling and circularity for “direct consumption”; rather, they use them as inputs to obtain higher environmental quality and thereafter higher utility. Thus, environmental quality can be defined as a function of recycling and circularity demand that has the usual properties of curvature and differentiability. Findings could directly and positively impact on both the production process and organization (Acerbi and Taisch 2020). Empirically, panel data better provide micro-foundations for aggregate data analysis than cross-section or time-series analysis. A possible endogeneity issue was also accounted for in the models. The main purpose of the paper is to extend our understanding on the key social and economic factors that can determine the rate of recycling and circulation processes in the European Union. Generally, the study bridges the gap in the relevant literature since empirical studies indicating microeconomic factors of materials circularity rate research are, as far as we know, rather limited (Korsunova, et al. 2021). We believe our findings will be useful for applying environmental policies at a national, European, international and global level to pursue the transition to a circular economy. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. A snapshot of the interrelationship between materials recycling and circularity concepts is presented in Sect. 2. Section 3 introduces particular features of recycling and circularity rates in Europe. Section 4 presents the data used, the econometric methodology, and illustrates the empirical results. Finally, Sect. 5 discusses the concluding remarks and the possible policy implications.",8

High level of human capital plays a major role in the success of countries and regions. Education is an important factor of economic and also social exclusion in many dimensions. It also generates positive externalities—Rauch (1993) confirms that higher average levels of human capital in US cities influence higher wages. Dalmazzo and de Blasio (2005) criticize focusing exclusively on wages. They consider in addition rents and confirm the existence of human capital externalities. Only in recent years have empirical works appeared that verify the existence of a relationship between the convergence of income and convergence of human capital or education, which is different from using human capital or education as a conditioning factor explaining convergence. Wolff (2000) finds convergence of the levels of education between 24 OECD countries in the period 1950–1990 and confirms its impact on labor productivity convergence. Berry and Glaeser (2005) confirm the divergence of human capital between US cities and suggest that it is related to the decline of the income convergence process. This does not mean, however, that the convergence of human capital and income will proceed in the same way. Rattsø and Stokke (2014) discover a separate convergence of income and education for 89 Norwegian NUTS4 regions and do not find a statistically significant relationship between these two processes—the education level increases in large cities with a limited increase of income in these regions, while the fastest income growth is observed in regions with a relatively low and stable education level. However, the dynamics of the convergence processes of both phenomena are not formally compared to each other, due to the lack of appropriate methods for measuring the similarity of convergence processes. This paper fills the existing methodological gap and proposes methods of testing the similarity of convergence processes based on a distribution analysis. Educational reforms in Poland introduced in 1999 aimed at equalizing the educational opportunities (the quality of human capital) for students with differing socio-economic status. As a result, over the last two decades, Polish pupils have made significant progress in their educational performance, which is confirmed by international PISA surveys. Simultaneously, Poland has achieved a significant improvement of indicators related to income on a national level. Previous research shows that the educational reform in Poland led to the reduction of the spatial differentiation of educational achievements of Polish pupils (Drucker and Horn, 2016), while conclusions regarding regional income convergence in Poland are not unequivocal and depend on the analyzed regional level. The purpose of this article is to verify whether there is statistical relationship between the patterns of educational achievements convergence and income convergence processes in Poland on the regional (subregions, NUTS 3) and local (counties, LAU 1) level. The data on educational achievements are lagged because we compare the achievements of 15-years old pupils and the income of the working population proxied by personal and corporate tax revenues of the municipalities of their residence. The proposed methodology for comparing the convergence processes of two phenomena includes two alternative methods of the whole distribution analysis—transition matrices and their continuous equivalent—kernel estimators of conditional density functions. This article is innovative in several ways. First, we introduce a novel approach to measure the similarity of convergence processes of two phenomena and call it parallel convergence. The proposed methodology has more applications. It can be used to compare the notion of convergence of a single phenomenon in different periods, in different groups of regions, on different regional levels, to mention just few potential applications. Second, we address an important research question whether an impressive progress in educational achievements and income observed for Poland at the country level is accompanied by similar convergence patterns of both phenomena on the regional and local level. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes theoretical background, while in Sect. 3 the data is discussed in details. In Sect. 4 the concept of parallel convergence and the distribution-dynamics-based methodology of its testing are introduced. The convergence processes for income and educational achievements with the use of transition matrices and kernel density estimates are documented in Sects. 5 and 6 respectively. The relationship between exam-results convergence and income convergence is pursued in the Sect. 7. Concluding remarks are summarized in the last section.",

Contreras,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As early as the last century, scholars such as Knight (1921) and Schumpeter (1961) have highlighted the importance of microenterprise (ME) activity for innovation, growth, and ultimately for revitalizing local economies. More recent studies support the idea that MEs are key factors in economic development (Acs et al. 1999; Acs and Szerb 2007; Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2003; Robbins et al. 2000; Decker et al. 2014) MEs generate between 10% and 60% of total employment in developed economies and account for roughly 78% of the total number of firms, ranging from 52% in the Czech Republic to 95% in Greece. For that reason, policies that foster microenterprise formation become popular across governments. One of these policies are Microenterprises Support Programs (MESP) have become popular among economic development practitioners and policymakers seeking new opportunities to promote development (Acs and Szerb 2007; Acs and Virgill 2009; Armendáriz and Morduch 2010). The popularity of these firms stems from the belief that people may overcome poverty situations and eventually create more jobs and generate a positive impact on local economies. For that reason, many governments have implemented MESPs to support ME by either providing training or microloans. Despite its popularity, it is not clear whether the MESP has been effective in promoting greater microenterprise creation, with studies suggesting a weak or negative relationship between MESPs and microenterprise growth (Aroca and Hewings 2009; Zainol et al. 2017) Some potential explanations for this issue are the microenterprise definition and the unit of the geographic scale used for data aggregation. Measuring ME performance remains a difficult task for policymakers and researchers since, in the literature, there is no incontestable definition that is accepted (Iversen et al. 2008; Low 2009; Low and Isserman 2013). While in many countries MEs are defined by the number of employees (employment-based), some others use annual turnover (revenue-based) or a combination of both (Mixed). Therefore, the MEs definition and inconsistencies may raise issues regarding recipients for support programs, leading to distortion in the fund allocation process for a public policy. For instance, using the employment-based definition may define a firm as an ME and thus eligible to receive support, whereas the revenue-based criteria may exclude the same firm based on disproportionally high income. Even if the operational microenterprise definition issue is settled, there is still the problem regarding the spatial measurement of ME formation. Wong (2003) showed that the selection of a delineation of the areal units into which the data are aggregated may produce different measurement outcomes. In other words, a particular aggregation at a specific scale at can yield inconsistent measurement of the microenterprise participation on the labor market compared to another selection, making these outcomes only valid for that specific region (Openshaw 1984; Arbia 2012, pp. 8–22; Henderson et al. 2007). The impact of geographic scaling on economic performance is known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) (Openshaw 1984; Arbia 2012, pp. 8–22; Henderson et al. 2007). The MAUP problem directly affects the policy-making process since the proportion of microenterprise participation in the labor force is one of the variables used in resource allocation (e.g., training or financial initiatives) to foster microenterprise. In the case of the US, the county level for data aggregation is the most common spatial scale used in studies conducted on ME formation and policy effectiveness. The selection of the county level is merely practical; most of the publicly available data in the US on ME (especially census data) can be found only at that scale. However, private data sets such as The National Establishment Time Series Dataset (NETS) and ReferenceUSA (hereafter RefUSA) business listing database provide information at the individual establishment level and therefore afford a more flexible spatial delineation. Most of the existing research uses one unit of scale. In the case of the US, that is, the county-level data. Shifting from this level to a more aggregated (i.e., State) or less aggregated (census tract) provides insight on how the policy may have a different impact on ME formation. The data aggregating process may generate distortions by artificially changing the relative total employment used to calculate the proportion of MEs. The latter is crucial from a policy-making perspective since the formation of ME may impact the region’s employment growth by reducing the unemployment rate and, eventually, poverty alleviation. However, suppose that the microenterprise formation rate is incorrect due to the definition or use of geographic limits. In that case, policymakers may be making wrong decisions and, thus, having an undesired impact on the territory. Therefore, this paper will examine the relationship between selection criteria for the definition of ME and factors that may affect ME formation, such as the unit of the geographic scale used for data aggregation and ME definition. Hence, the research question is how the policy evaluation outcomes measurement are affected i) by the selection of a specific geographical scale (i.e., state, county, and census tract) and ii) by the use of different criteria for characterizing MEs (revenue-based or employment-based). Our hypotheses are:  The use of the different definitions will impact policy evaluation outcomes measurement. The shift of the unit of scale from a more aggregate to a less aggregate unit of scale will impact ME policy evaluation outcomes measurement. This paper contributes to the existing literature in twofold. First, ME formation is evaluated using revenue-based and employment-based definitions extending Rupasingha and Contreras’ Rupasingha and Contreras (2014) model using public and private datasets. Secondly, this paper examines also evaluates how microenterprise definitions and MUAP can affect policy evaluation outcomes. This research will assess this impact by providing an empirical evaluation of a microenterprise policy loan program (CRA small business loans) on ME formation using different definitions based on revenues and employment, and how the impact changes when it is evaluated at different spatial scales (state, county, and census tract level). The later would provide an empirical evidence whether the financing initiative allocation is impacting equally ME formation regardless of the ME definition.",4

Mamuneas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The spatial labour markets have experienced great volatility and uncertainty during the last two decades. The severe and asymmetric territorial impacts of the recent financial, political and health events across local labour markets, from the Great Recession to Brexit and the current corona pandemic crisis, have provided new stimuli to regional scientists to understand the varying ability of spatial labour markets to withstand, react and recover from exogenous shocks. Several methodologies have been developed to explore the resilience of regional labour markets to external perturbations, ranging from short-term responses to absorb an external shock (Giannakis and Bruggeman 2017a) to long-term adaptability to develop new growth paths (Pontarollo and Serpieri 2020a). The increasing use of the notion of resilience in analysing spatial labour markets performance, as in other fields of application, has brought more clarity on the definition of the concept, but no consensus has yet been reached (Boschma 2015). The theorization and subsequently the empirical operationalization of the resilience concept is still under development (Martin and Sunley 2015; Tsiapa et al. 2018). Local labour markets resilience features are usually measured in terms of employment growth rates, either absolute or relative, e.g., versus EU average (Lagravinese 2015; Giannakis and Bruggeman 2017b). Several studies suggest that labour productivity is positively associated with employment, i.e., higher labour productivity growth induces lower unemployment rates (Mortensen and Pissarides 1998; Miyamoto and Takahashi 2011). In this study, we conceptualize and measure the resilience of regional labour markets in terms of labour productivity growth, which is equal to regional economic output growth minus the labour input growth. The behaviour of labour productivity has been widely studied both across European regions (Cuadrado-Roura et al. 2000; Ezcurra et al. 2007) and within individual countries, e.g., across Italian (Giacinto and Nuzzo 2006), British (Gardiner et al. 2020) and Greek (Christopoulos and Tsionas 2004) regions. Filippetti and Peyrache (2015) assessed the role of the technology gap, capital deepening, exogenous technical change, and efficiency change in explaining labour productivity differences in European regions. Basile et al. (2008) analysed the relationship between regional unemployment, wages, and labour productivity differentials in Europe. Tsiapa et al. (2018) explored how EU regions’ pre-crisis path-dependence productivity changes influenced their resilience levels during the economic crisis period, 2008–2013. Our resilience concept compares the labour productivity growth rate of a regional labour market to the labour productivity growth rate of a reference regional labour market. Region-specific characteristics and growth paths before the onset of the economic downturn have been found to strongly affect the performance of spatial labour markets during and after exogenous shocks (Di Caro and Fratesi 2018). Our framework aims to consistently estimate the effect of pre-crisis conditions on the resilience of spatial labour markets, controlling for the effect of exogenous technological change and substitution of labour with capital. Various region-specific factors have been linked to the ability of spatial labour markets to resist negative exogenous shocks (Crescenzi et al. 2016). However, little research has been conducted on the role of industrial linkages and interdependencies in shaping spatial labour markets resilience capabilities. The industrial structure of a region has been considered a major determinant for the resilience of regional labour markets to external perturbations (Cainelli et al. 2019a). A major area of debate has been whether a diverse economic structure provides greater regional resilience to negative exogenous shocks than a more specialised structure (Martin 2012; Martin and Sunley 2015). However, precisely how a diversified or specialised regional economy reacts to recession strongly depends on the degree of direct and indirect sectoral interdependencies (Martin 2012). Input–output (IO) models have been applied in the regional resilience literature to analyse the interdependence of economic sectors and simulate how an exogenous shock propagates in spatial economies through supplies and sales linkages (Acemoglu et al. 2016; Galbusera and Giannopoulos 2018). However, most of the applications have been employed in individual countries. For instance, IO models have been employed to explore the resilience of regional labour markets to economic shocks in the Netherlands (Diodato and Weterings 2015), the UK (Kitsos et al. 2019), and Greece (Giannakis and Bruggeman 2017a). The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical model, which is based on the theory of production, for the operationalization and empirical measurement of regional labour markets resilience. Second, we empirically explore the relationship between a set of pre-crisis region-specific factors, namely, industrial interconnectedness, industrial concentration, agglomeration economies and human capital factors, and the ability of labour markets to resist and recover from the impact of exogenous shocks. Industrial interconnectedness indicators are not available at the regional level, thus we constructed regional input–output models to estimate sectoral backward and forward linkages across the European Union (EU) NUTS-2 regions.",6

Machine learning uses automated algorithms to discover patterns from data and enable high-quality forecasts, although the relationships between input data have not been widely studied. This is contrary to classic statistics and econometrics, which are designed to use formal equations, make inferences and test hypotheses to conclude on population having a sample, while forecasts are of secondary importance. ML often works similar to a black-box testing approach, not as an explicitly defined, commonly used statistical and econometric model. ML has three primary purposes: clustering of data into unknown a priori groups, classification of data into known groups based on a trained model and prediction. According to Google Ngrams, its current applications are found approximately ten times more frequently in text than those of econometrics, but still around seven times less frequently than those of statistics. In many research areas (such as epidemiology, geology, ecology and climate), it has become a standard, but this is yet to occur in the field of regional science. Spatial methods need spatial data. Recent assessment has found that around 80% of all data can have a geographic dimension, and much of these data can be geo-referenced (VoPham et al. 2018). Spatial information can stem from conventional sources such as regional databases in statistical offices, grid datasets and geo-located points. One can also easily gather data from Open Street Map and Google Maps (in the form of background maps, points of interest (POI), roads and traffic, for example), as well as from geo-referenced images (such as satellite photographs (Rolf et al. 2021), night light photographs and drone photographs), geo-tagged social media posts on Twitter and climate sensors. This type of data requires powerful computational methods due to its complexity, diversity and volume. Machine learning (ML) is the ability of a machine to improve its performance based on previous results. It is a part of artificial intelligence and can be divided into unsupervised learning, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, depending on the algorithms used. Deep learning, being a subfield of machine learning, uses neural networks for training the models. Big data is linked to data mining and knowledge discovery on large datasets by using machine learning techniques.Footnote 1 Machine learning algorithms can be implemented on ready-to-use data to obtain simple, self-standing machine learning forecast or used with workflow and data processing or even apply it to artificial intelligence, where decisions are made by algorithms.Footnote 2 The hermetic nature of the scientific communities may give the impression that ML methods are largely inaccessible to a wider audience. However, ML has a great potential in non-big data analysis in terms of its methods being used as supplements to spatial statistics and econometrics. The goal of this paper is to present a methodological overview of machine learning in the spatial context. Firstly, it outlines the nature of the information ML gives us, and concludes if ML is substitutive or complementary to the traditional methods. Secondly, it presents two ways in which ML has been incorporated into spatial studies—by using typical ML on spatial data and by developing new ML methods dedicated to spatial data only. Thirdly, it aims to promote the application of ML to regional science. The paper concentrates solely on the following selected ML methods: unsupervised learning, which is closer to traditional statistics and encompasses clustering, and supervised learning, which is closer to econometrics and encompasses classification and regression.Footnote 3 A general overview of these methods is presented in “Appendix 1” and their R implementation in “Appendix 3”.",21

However, empirical evidence on regional housing prices is mixed. While some studies have identified the long-term convergence of regional housing prices (Holmes and Grimes 2008; Meen 2002), others found that prices differ across regions (Abbott and Vita 2012, 2013; Holly et al. 2011). Recently, scholars have questioned whether absolute convergence and divergence exist across regional housing prices and instead favor club convergence (i.e., convergence in multiple subgroups). Evidence from a few developed countries, namely the UK, the USA, Spain, and Australia, support club convergence (Awaworyi Churchill et al. 2018; Blanco et al. 2016; Kim & Rous 2012; Montagnoli & Nagayasu 2015). The market-oriented reform of the Chinese housing system coupled with ongoing urbanization has resulted in a rapidly growing housing market. Since 2005, China’s housing market has boomed. For example, the average annual growth rate of housing prices in 2005–17 was nearly 9%—an increase of 3.7% over 1998–2004. In this, the interrelation of housing prices across regions played an important role (Mao 2016). Not only does the booming housing market pose the risk of housing price bubbles (Rong et al. 2016), but also differences in regional housing prices increase wealth disparities due to varying economic developments and geographical differences,Footnote 1 including access to amenities and restrictions caused by the household registration system, (i.e., Hukou2) (Gong et al. 2016; Mao 2016; Wen and Tao 2015; Zhang and Fan 2019). Facing the risk of overinflated housing markets and heterogeneity in housing prices across Chinese regions, the dynamic relationship of regional housing prices requires closer attention to prevent housing bubbles (Holmes et al. 2018), uncover disparities across regional housing markets (Alexander & Barrow 1994), and provide the foundation for regionally diversified and locally oriented adjustment policies. So far, only a few studies have identified a common equilibrium state across regional housing prices in China (Gong et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2016; Zhang and Morley 2014). For example, Mao (2016) found evidence for regional housing prices divergence based on the monthly panel data of 70 cities. Liu et al. (2018) examined structure convergence and indicated different orders of convergence across regional housing prices and that price transmission occurs from eastern to central and western China. However, club convergence has been poorly assessed in China. To address this knowledge gap, we adopted a recently introduced panel convergence test (Phillips and Sul 2007, 2009) to explore the transitional dynamics and individual heterogeneity of housing prices. First, we used housing price trends between 2006 and 2017 to analyze the pattern of convergence across the 70 major cities in China. Second, we investigated potential drivers of club formation by means of an ordered logit model (Blanco et al. 2016; Holmes et al. 2019). Our study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, it is among the first to explore the club convergence of regional housing prices in a developing country. Second, it provides new evidence regarding the formation process of the convergence of housing prices among regions in China. It allows the identification of groups of regions with similar housing price growth paths and growth trajectories per club. Third, it identified key drivers that explain the convergence clubs in regional housing prices. This paper is structured as follows.

A synthetic control approach,August 2022,Niklas Rudholm,Yujiao Li,Kenneth Carling,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"A new big-box retailer is often considered important for regional development because it attracts consumers from far away, and the claim that big-box retailers benefit regions has been supported by several studies (Ailawadi et al. 2010; Basker 2005, 2007; Daunfeldt et al. 2017; Han et al. 2018). The importance of big-box retailers for regional development is further supported by local authorities, which often spend considerable amounts of money to attract them (Daunfeldt et al. 2017). In this paper, we study the impact of big-box retail entry on labor productivity in durable goods retailing in affected entry municipalities, using IKEA entry into four Swedish municipalities, 2004–2007, as natural experiments. Labor productivity is measured as the consumer price index (CPI) adjusted sales per employee in each municipality compared to the national average. Municipalities with a productivity index number above 100 thus have a higher level of CPI-adjusted sales than we would expect given the number of employees in durable goods retailing in that municipality, and if the index value at the time of IKEA entry is close to 100, the change in the index can also be interpreted as the approximate change in productivity in percent. As such, the index is easy to interpret both when comparing levels and changes in productivity due to IKEA entry. Our study is focused on the entry municipalities as previous studies (Daunfeldt et al. 2017; Han et al. 2018) have shown that the impact of IKEA entry in Sweden is limited to the entry municipalities themselves. The studied big-box entry events consist of entry by IKEA itself and the establishment of a surrounding retail area comprising 20–30 other retail stores, approximately 2500 parking spaces, and in most cases convenient location of the retail area relative to major highways. We are therefore evaluating how all changes related to the establishment of the new IKEAs affected labor productivity in the entry municipalities and not only the effects of the IKEA store itself. Previous studies of how big-box retail entry in Sweden affects productivity (Håkansson et al. 2019; Han et al. 2018; Maican and Orth 2012, 2015) have one thing in common: they all focus on the impact of big-box entry on incumbent retailers in the entry regions. However, the largest impact on productivity in the entry regions is likely due to the big-box entrants themselves. For Walmart, Basker (2007) reported that the real value-added per worker was 40% higher than that of other US general merchandise retailers, and that Walmart alone was responsible for nearly half of the productivity growth in the general merchandise sector in the US retail market between 1982 and 2002. By considering the impact on incumbents rather than the total impact of big-box entry on productivity in the entry regions, previous studies likely underestimated the impact of big-box retail entry on productivity, a potential caveat addressed here. From an econometric perspective, the estimation of how big-box retailers might affect the local economies they enter is not easy. Previous studies often use difference-in-difference estimations, sometimes after first having tried to select control group regions with characteristics similar to those of the studied entry regions (e.g., Basker 2007; Daunfeldt et al. 2017, 2019; Håkansson et al. 2019; Han et al. 2018). However, difference-in-difference estimation might not be appropriate in this setting for several reasons. First, difference-in-difference estimation relies on the assumption that the treated and control regions would have experienced parallel trends in the absence of treatment, i.e., if no big-box retail entry had taken place, labor productivity growth would have been similar in the entry- and non-entry regions used in the difference-in-difference estimations. In previous studies (Daunfeldt et al. 2017, 2019; Håkansson et al. 2019; Han et al. 2018), this assumption has been investigated by plotting the pre-entry trends in the outcome variables for entry and control municipalities, and when found to be parallel, it was argued that these trends would have continued to be parallel in the absence of big-box entry. However, since the validity of this argument cannot be proved, it remains an assumption in these difference-in-difference models. Second, as demonstrated by Daunfeldt et al. (2017, 2019), IKEA does not enter Swedish municipalities at random, but rather after a deliberate process of finding the most profitable entry sites, something that might very well increase the potential problems with the assumption of parallel trends in the absence of entry. Third, the number of treated units is small, with only four Swedish municipalities having had IKEA enter their markets during the study period. These entry municipalities are very heterogeneous with respect to economic, geographic and demographic characteristics, making it likely that IKEA would have different effects in the different entry municipalities. To address these empirical challenges, and since the heterogeneity among the entry municipalities makes it reasonable to treat each IKEA entry as a separate case study, we use the synthetic control method (SCM) first employed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and then elaborated upon by Abadie et al. (2010, 2015). This method estimates the intervention effect by measuring the difference in the outcome variable of interest between the treated unit and a synthetic counterfactual unit. The counterfactual is created by weighing potential control units (i.e., municipalities without IKEA entry during the study period) such that the synthetic control unit’s outcomes and relevant covariates before the intervention have characteristics and trajectories similar to those of the treated unit. The SCM does not rely on the parallel trends assumption necessary for difference-in-difference estimation, and it also requires only one treated unit, making it possible to study the four IKEA entries in Swedish municipalities one by one. Since there is only one treated unit, and the post-treatment periods are often short in applied empirical work, statistical inference is somewhat of a challenge when using SCM. Abadie et al. (2010, 2015) suggested using placebo testing, which is performed below. However, we also use the nonparametric bootstrap methods suggested by Carling and Li (2017) to create confidence interval estimates of the effect of IKEA entry on municipal-level labor productivity in durable goods retailing in the entry municipalities. Finally, Carling and Li (2017) has also shown that, for a given number of post-intervention years, parametric estimators of the SCM clearly outperform the nonparametric estimators suggested by Abadie et al. (2010) in terms of statistical power, and thus, we also suggest three parametric growth curve models that can be used to estimate the effect of big-box retail entry on labor productivity in the entry regions, discriminating between the suggested models using the Akaike information criterion.Footnote 1 The results of our research indicate that the establishment of a new IKEA positively affects average labor productivity in durable goods retailing in three out of four entry municipalities in Sweden and that the size of the positive effect is related to the size of the new IKEA relative to the size of the existing durable goods retail sector in the entry municipalities. In Haparanda, the smallest studied entry municipality, average productivity, measured as consumer price index (CPI)-adjusted sales per employee, increased by 80%, while in Kalmar, the second smallest studied entry municipality, it increased by 8%. For the larger entry municipality of Karlstad, the increase in productivity was 4%, while in the urban entry into Gothenburg, no statistically significant increases in productivity were found. Here it should be noted that while the entries in Haparanda, Kalmar and Karlstad were the first IKEA in the region, Gothenburg already had an IKEA store established in 1972. As such, the results presented for Gothenburg refers to the effect of getting one additional IKEA store in a region that already has an IKEA presence. In addition to the productivity estimates, we also split the productivity index into a sales index and an employment index. The results from these additional estimations are presented in Appendix 2, and they show the same general pattern as for productivity, with the largest positive effects on sales and employment found in smaller, rural municipalities. However, contrary to the results for labor productivity, we find positive and statistically significant effects on both sales and employment also for the IKEA entry in Gothenburg, The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on big-box entry, while Sect. 3 presents a theoretical rationale for expecting IKEA entry to positively affect labor productivity in the affected municipalities. Then in Sect. 4, our identification strategy, i.e., the SCM, and the various methods used for statistical inference are presented. Section 5 presents the empirical results, while Sect. 6 summarizes and discusses the present findings.",1

This is the case of France who, through the Act of 17 August 2015 on Energy Transition for Green growth, displayed its ambition to be exemplary in the areas of energy system diversification, the deployment of renewable energy sources and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (French Government 2017). More recently, through the European Climate Law adopted in June 2021, the 27 European Union (EU) Member States committed to turning the EU into the first carbon–neutral continent by 2050 and revised upwards the GHG emission reduction target for 2030, from 40 to 55%, compared to 1990 levels (European Commission 2021). This issue has also attracted the attention of scholars. Until now, the wide body of the literature has been focusing on explaining the generation and adoption of green technologies (Jaffe et al. 2003; Horbach 2008; Kesidou and Demirel 2012). However, less attention has been dedicated to the fact that new technologies can be introduced in regions by new firms (Acs and Audretsch 1987; Audretsch et al. 2006; Corradini 2019; Colombelli and Quatraro 2019). This missing link is particularly problematic as there is increasing consensus on the key role that the new green tech-based firms may play in the transition process to a sustainable economy (OECD 2011, 2016; EC 2014; French Government 2017). For instance, the French Agency for Environment and Energy Management (ADEME 2018) programme supports the creation of innovative firms with a special focus on the development of green technologies. Thus, from a policy perspective, the identification of the regional capabilities that boost green technological entry may provide useful information on how to enhance the transition to sustainable and greener regions. Despite the increasing interest in the development of green technologies at regional level, there are still few scientific contributions which analyse the regional explanatory factors for the emergence of new green tech-based firms. To the best of our knowledge, Corradini (2019) was one of the first papers to address this issue across European regions. This study used the characteristics of patent applications to define the entry of new green technology-based firms and showed that the geographical distribution of green technological entry across European regions was unevenly distributed, evidencing the significant role played by the characteristics of the regional innovation system. Along the same lines, Colombelli and Quatraro (2019) provide evidence of the effects of the technological composition of local stocks of knowledge in the creation of green start-ups in Italian NUTS3 regions. Although the undeniable contribution of these studies, they do not account for the specific regional knowledge base in terms of regions’ actual capacity to generate green technologies. Recent findings in evolutionary economic geography (e.g., Boschma 2016; Grillitsch et al. 2018; Boschma et al. 2021) suggest the use of alternative approaches, such a thorough investigation in the actual role of related and unrelated diversification, to capture the distinctive regional traits of green technologies (Barbieri et al. 2016, 2020a, b; Dechezleprêtre and Sato 2017; van den Berge et al. 2020). Another missing link in this literature is the role that regional political support may play in the development of new green technologies as they may clearly have an impact on green technological entry and regional diversification (Costantini et al. 2015; Santoalha and Boschma 2021). The aim of this paper is to examine the regional factors for the entry of new green tech-based firms within a broad empirical framework adapted to the specific knowledge composition behind green technologies. We make several contributions to the economic geography literature on the development of green technologies. First, we provide evidence of the extent to which the balance between the accumulated local stock of inventions in green and nongreen technologies matters for the entry of new green tech-based firms. Second, we examine the importance of a set of knowledge indicators, such coherence and variety, that describe its internal structure of the regional knowledge base. Here, we try to go one step further by computing specific knowledge variety indicators by looking at the co-occurrence of technological classes to which green patents are assigned. This allow us to disentangle the certain degree of diversity of the local knowledge base in terms of the recombination of the diverse technological classes making up green patents—this is not possible with traditional knowledge variety indicators that consider the recombination of all technological classes. This application is particularly relevant since it will provide more insights of the actual regional knowledge recombination capabilities enhancing the green technological entry. Third, we examine the importance of population’s sensitivity to and support of environmental policies and regulations for green technological entry. Fourth, we introduce spatial autocorrelation techniques to identify spatial spillovers associated with the accumulated endowments of knowledge in the entry of new green tech-based firms. Finally, we provide evidence from the case of France, which is subject of increasing interest due to the regional heterogeneities of both sustainable development performance (Bonnet et al. 2021) and eco-innovative intensity (Galliano and Nadel 2015). For the period 2003–2013, we apply firm-level microdata on the entry of new green tech-based firms from the Bureau van Dijk DIANE Mercantil Register and patent information from the OECD REGPAT (2018) database to test the impact of regional knowledge capabilities and environmental political support on green technological entry across French départements (NUTS 3 regions). We find that the main determinants of the entry of new green tech-based firms are: (i) the combination of high levels of internal coherence with sufficient diversification into unrelated technological categories other than green and (ii) the regional efforts to reduce the environmental impact of economic activities. Applying spatial econometrics, we find a clear spatial path dependence, that is, the impact of knowledge spillovers mainly accrues within the département of entry. Our findings contribute to the development of regional policies (whether encouraging or discouraging) in respect of green technological creation and diffusion within and across regions. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical background of the article. Section 3 describes the data set and the variables used, while Sect. 4 presents the methodology and the econometric specification. Section 5 discusses the main results. Finally, Sect. 6 presents the conclusions and highlights the policy implications.",1

The resulting weakening of competition is associated with adverse economic outcomes such as less investment and innovation as well as lower shares of labour income in national income (Diez et al. 2018). Economic history reveals how periods of economic stagnation are related to decreasing competition. For instance, Crafts (2012) explains the relative economic decline of the British economy between the 1930s and the 1970s as a result of weakened competition while deregulation strengthened competition and reinvigorated productivity growth. In a similar vein, Alder et al. (2014) suggest that the demise of the Rust Belt in the post-war period is also attributable to a lack of competitive pressure in labour and output markets, and that the regional economy stabilized upon increasing competition intensity in the 1980s. In this study we will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence on the role of intraregional interfirm competition in regional development and policy by investigating regional-level strategic policy documents. To our knowledge, there is no study that systematically analyses this topic. We posit that given the positive impact of interfirm competition on productivity and innovation, regional development needs to consider if and how to support rivalry between firms. Empirically, the article focuses on regional innovation policy in Europe marked by the smart specialisation approach and specifically by regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3).Footnote 1 The article pursues three research questions (RQ): How important is competition (relative to cooperation) in RIS3 (RQ1)? What types of pro-competition interventions are proposed in RIS3 (RQ2)? How do RIS3 differ in the role accorded to competition and can differences be explained by the prevailing level of competition (RQ3)? The role of interfirm competitionFootnote 2 figures prominently in the industrial organisation literature and in the debate on new industrial policies (e.g., Landesmann 2015; Radosevic 2017) but less so in the discourse on regional development theories and regional economic or innovation policies. While competition intensity between firms in product markets is regulated by competition policy at the national and European levels, there are a number of factors beyond competition policy that influence competition intensity within nations and regions. Indeed, empirical studies suggest substantial differences in competition intensity between industries, nations, and regions (Koster et al. 2012; Plummer and Acs 2014; Eklund and Lappi 2019). In line with seminal contributions such as Jacobs (1969) or Porter (1990, 1998a), we argue that fierce regional competition between firms can be a powerful driver of productivity growth and innovation and that regional policy could use a number of instruments which aim to influence the degree of competition between regional firms. Still, competition is not the only phenomenon that drives innovation. In particular, cooperation between economic agents is of vital importance for regional development, as paradigms such as regional innovation systems emphasise (e.g., Asheim et al. 2011). Still, the importance of competition for driving productivity and innovation suggests that a policy narrative that overemphasises cooperation over competition, or what we call the cooperation bias in regional development, is one-sided. Rather, regional development thinking may benefit from rebalancing the relative importance of cooperation versus competition in formulating policy strategies and applying policy instruments (see also Newlands ﻿2003). Admittedly, reality is complex and shows a plethora of firm behaviour combining elements of both (Brandenburger and Nalebuff 1996). Nevertheless, for the sake of analytical clarity, in this article we follow a stylised dichotomy between competition and cooperation. The article is divided into four parts. The following section reviews theories on the role of competition in industrial and regional development. Next, the article introduces a conceptual framework for competition in regional policy, the methodology, and the sampling strategy. Then the article investigates a random sample of regional innovation strategies in Europe. The final section draws conclusions and proposes policy implications.",2

Henry Wang,Qihong Liu,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A prominent feature of the digital economy is the booming of platforms leveraging previously untapped supplies (e.g., taxi rides, apartments), supported by fast-growing mobile technology (smartphones with GPS capabilities and better/cheaper cellular service). Examples include Uber and Lyft for the ride-sharing market, and Airbnb and HomeAway for the short-term lodging market. These platforms serve two-sided markets with drivers (owners) on one side and riders (renters) on the other side. It is well known that some agents may multi-home in two-sided markets (e.g., a consumer may carry and a merchant may accept multiple credit cards). In the case of ride-sharing, a driver may drive for both Uber and Lyft, and a rider may use both companies’ apps and request a ride from the company that has a driver closer by. In this paper, we construct a simple theoretical model of a ride-sharing market that enables us to examine the welfare implications of multi-homing, in particular, how it affects the average wait/pickup time on both sides of the market. Given our focus on drivers and riders and to keep the model tractable, we abstract away from market dynamics of entry/exit by drivers and riders as well as pricing decisions by the platforms. With a fixed amount of driver hours and a fixed number of rides, both drivers’ and riders’ surpluses are determined by the average wait time (the time between a request and the actual pickup). We consider several settings and compare them pairwise. The benchmark setting is a monopoly platform and the direct comparison is a single-homing duopoly with two symmetric platforms. The amount of driver hours and the number of rides are the same in the two settings. However, the monopoly platform setting is more efficient since all riders experience less wait time and all drivers benefit from shorter pickup distance. This is quite intuitive. If we view the ride-sharing market as a matching market, the monopoly platform has a thicker market, improving the matching quality (the wait/pickup time). Next, we allow multi-homing and start with the setting where riders multi-home. Our results show that the more riders multi-home, the better off every agent will be. Multi-homing on the rider side improves the wait/pickup time so all drivers and the multi-homing riders are better off. Moreover, the multi-homing riders have a positive impact on the single-homing riders. This is because once a multi-homing rider is served, he/she is out of the system and the freed-up driver time shortens the wait time for all other riders. We then consider the setting where drivers multi-home. Relative to the single-homing duopoly, we find that multi-homing on the driver side benefits the riders, and the more drivers multi-home, the better off the riders will be. The impact of multi-homing on the drivers is more complex. The multi-homing drivers are unambiguously better off. They not only spend less time to get to riders, but also “steal” some rides from the single-homing drivers. While the singe-homing drivers enjoy shorter pickup times, they now spend more time idling because some of their rides have been stolen by the multi-homing drivers. We finally consider the setting where both riders and drivers multi-home. We find that the more drivers multi-home, the better off the single-homing riders will be. The multi-homing riders may or may not be better off. One of the earliest papers in the literature that explicitly considers wait time is Arnott (1996). Like in our model, the wait time in Arnott (1996) is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of idle taxis. The paper considers a single platform (thus no multi-homing or price competition) and focuses on social optimum. More recently, Bryan and Gans (2019) examine competition among ride-sharing platforms, and use a stylized model of wait time.Footnote 1 In our model, the wait/pickup time is derived from the interactions between drivers and riders; it is endogenously determined by the numbers of riders and drivers and the setting (i.e., which side multi-homes).Footnote 2 Our paper thus complements Bryan and Gans (2019) by providing an alternative (and more realistic) way of modeling wait time. Relatedly, Bai et al. (2019) also consider wait time, but do not allow multi-homing. Bernstein et al. (2021) assume that multi-homing occurs on the driver side only and all drivers multi-home. They also take into account system congestion (similar to wait time), but in the end reach a different conclusion that multi-homing does not improve efficiency. In contrast, in our model, multi-homing always improves efficiency because it thickens the market, in similar spirit as in Nikzad (2017). Our theoretical study is tied to the recent empirical works that focus on platforms in the new sharing economy. Cramer and Krueger (2016) investigate the efficiency of Uber by comparing the capacity utilization rates of UberX drivers and taxi drivers in several U.S. cities. Uber drivers do not need to drive around hoping to pick up passengers on the streets. Instead, after dropping off the previous passenger, they can wait for the platform to assign the next passenger. This makes them more efficient (in terms of capacity utilization rate), which Cramer and Krueger (2016) confirm. Several studies (e.g., Hall et al. 2016) have talked about surge pricing and how Uber uses it to adjust demand and supply in real time.Footnote 3 Cohen et al. (2016) also use surge pricing and individual level data to estimate demand elasticities at multiple points along the demand curve and then use these elasticities to estimate consumer surplus. Other studies explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms. For example, Berger et al. (2018) examine the impact of Uber on earnings and employment in conventional taxi services. The authors found that total employment expanded in the cities where Uber was introduced, and that declines in hourly earnings among wage-employed drivers were partially offset by increases in hourly earnings among self-employed drivers. Zervas et al. (2017) use the state of Texas data and found that Airbnb has a quantifiable and negative impact on the lodging industry’s revenue, especially for low-end hotels. Airbnb also has rich data of listings and researchers have used these data to study racial discrimination (Edelman et al. 2017) and user-generated ratings (Zervas et al. 2015). Our paper is also related to the general two-sided market literature. The seminal papers include Caillaud and Jullien (2003), Rochet and Tirole (2003), and Armstrong (2006). Some of these studies consider multi-homing and investigate its implications for competition as compared to single-homing.Footnote 4 The first implication of multi-homing concerns the same side agents. Under single-homing, when platform A signs up an extra agent, it means that platform B loses this agent, resulting in head-on competition between the platforms. In contrast, under multi-homing, when an agent joins platform A, it does not prevent the same agent from joining platform B, so each platform is competing with the outside option instead of head-on competition (see Liu and Serfes 2013). The second implication is that multi-homing also changes competition on the opposite side (Rysman 2009). To see this, consider agents on one side who single-home and join platform A only. For any agent on the other side who wants to reach these agents, his/her only option is also to join platform A. This gives platform A monopoly power over providing access to its single-homing agents. Considering a different aspect of multi-homing, our paper focuses on how multi-homing affects efficiency rather than competition intensity since we abstract away from price decisions by the platforms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we set up the model and analyze the benchmark setting (monopoly). Section 3 analyzes duopoly, covering single-homing, multi-homing on the rider side, multi-homing on the driver side, and multi-homing on both sides. We discuss the results in Sect. 4.",3

Inequality of opportunity and educational self-selection of interprovincial migrants in China,October 2022,Jiantao Zhou,Eddie Chi-Man Hui,Huiwen Peng,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economic returns are commonly considered the primary motivation for population migration (Kennan and Walker 2011; Sjaastad 1962; Zhu 2002). Nevertheless, individuals with different socioeconomic statuses gain different returns from migration; hence their migration motivations are different, which induces the self-selection of migrants. Borjas (1987) extended Roy’s (1951) model and proposed that high-skilled migrants tend to move to destinations with higher levels of income inequality (i.e., positive selection), while those with relatively low skills choose to live in places with lower levels of income inequality (i.e., negative selection), in pursuit of personal income maximization. Previous studies have investigated this theoretical framework empirically, measuring income inequality based on overall wage (Belot and Hatton 2012; Grogger and Hanson 2011), predicted wage by observable skills (Chiquiar and Hanson 2005), and return to education (Gould and Moav 2016). Nevertheless, the components of income inequality are complex and may exert heterogeneous impacts on migrant selection. Not only does self-effort under personal control affect income, such as personal choices on education, occupation, and working/learning hours, but social opportunities that are usually innate and entirely out of personal control affect income to a large extent, such as gender, race, and family background. Political philosophy scholars recognized the outcome inequality induced by uneven social opportunities as “inequality of opportunity (IOP, hereafter)” and the rest caused by varying degrees of personal efforts as “inequality of effort (IOE, hereafter)” (Rawls 1971; Sen 1985). According to their theory, these two components contribute to the vast majority of outcome inequality (such as income inequality in this paper). Previous studies have argued that IOP and low “intergenerational mobility” (one dimension of IOP) can result in resource misallocation, reduce human capital accumulation through intergenerational influence, and damage economic development (Chiu 1998; Galor and Zeira 1993; Marrero and Rodríguez 2013; Mejía and St-Pierre 2008; Sieg et al. 2020; Song and Zhou 2019). Considering that migration will also influence human capital accumulation, it is interesting and crucial to ask whether inequality of opportunity will influence population migration and, thus, human capital accumulation. Put differently, if one, endowed with poor social opportunities, faces a society with a high level of IOP, will he/she move to other regions with lower levels of inequality? To date, few studies have investigated the relationship between IOP and population migration theoretically or empirically, and this study aims to provide some evidence. This paper decomposes income inequality into two components, IOP and IOE, and examines their roles in migrant selection patterns, taking the internal migration in China as a case study. We mainly focus on the educational selection of migrants, as education is the most concerned skill that contributes the most to regional economic development (Lucas 1988). Based on the self-selection framework, we hypothesize that lower levels of IOP and IOE in destination increase migration incentives relatively more significantly for low-educated migrants. Then, employing the first wave of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey data in 2010, we measure IOP at the province-level based on the ex-ante approach by the parametric method. Finally, supported by the 2015 one percent population sampling survey data, we discuss the migrant selection in China and the effects of different inequality components. We find that low-educated people have higher probabilities of migrating from inland to coastal provinces during 2011–2015, which can be explained by the lower level of income inequality in migration destinations, to a large extent. Our results also demonstrate that lower levels of IOP and IOE in destination increase migration incentives more for low-educated migrants than high-educated migrants. Further results emphasize the heterogeneous effects between different migrant groups. Our paper makes at least two contributions to the literature. Firstly, this study contributes to the scant body of empirical research on the IOP, with most of that do exist focusing on how to measure at a national level (Checchi and Peragine 2010; Ferreira and Gignoux 2011; Lefranc et al. 2008). Beyond the status quo assessment of IOP, we explore its regional heterogeneity in a single country and analyze its consequences on population migration. As migration is essential to human capital accumulation, our analysis proposes another channel in how IOP influences human capital accumulation and, thus, regional economic growth. Secondly, this paper contributes to the empirical research on the relationship between income inequality and migrant selection (Belot and Hatton 2012; Chiquiar and Hanson 2005; Grogger and Hanson 2011). On the one hand, differing from previous studies focusing on overall wage level or predicted wage level, this paper discusses the heterogeneous roles of different income inequality components in migrant selection. On the other hand, existing studies mainly focus on international migration, while discussion regarding internal migration is still limited [the exception can be found in Abramitzky (2009), Bacolod et al. (2021) and De la Roca (2017)]. Because of lower migration costs and high mobility, internal migration enables us to study the relationship between income inequality and migrant selection without interference from migration restrictions in international migration. China provides a unique case to study migrant self-selection due to a high degree of regional disparity and large population migration in the past four decades. Even under the movement restriction of the unique household registration (hukou) system,Footnote 1 China is still experiencing the most massive population migration in the world’s history. Although previous scholars have investigated internal migration and migrants’ living conditions in China comprehensively (Shen and Liu 2016; Tao et al. 2015), attention to migrant selection remains limited. Studies discussing migrant selection in China mainly focus on rural–urban migrants or migration costs (Xing 2014; Zhou and Hui 2021, 2022). Unlike these studies, this paper investigates different income inequality components and self-selection of inter-provincial migrants, which is still unclear in the literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief literature review on the inequality of opportunity and develops a research framework to discuss its impact on migrant selection. The measure of inequality of opportunity is proposed in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes the empirical model design and data source used in the current study. Section 5 presents the empirical results, and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",

Evidence from Vienna, Austria",October 2022,Ulrich B. Morawetz,H. Allen Klaiber,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Capitalization of urban amenities impacts patterns of urban development and the associated distributional consequences across the urban income gradient (Hilber 2017). Residents are well known to sort into neighborhoods based on the provision of local amenities including schools (Brueckner and Joo 1991; Brunner et al. 2001; Brunner and Sonstelie 2003; Hilber and Mayer 2009; Ihlanfeldt and Mayock 2019), urban green spaces (Choumert 2010; Wüstemann et al. 2017) and public transport connections (Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001; Debrezion et al. 2007; Hess and Almeida 2007; Kahn 2007) among others. For residents, the increased demand for locations with high levels of amenities results in increased rents due to capitalization of amenities in housing values. With equal preferences for amenities, higher-income households outbid lower-income households in areas with higher levels of amenities. Banzhaf et al. (2019) label the long-run outcomes of this sorting process as environmental gentrification. In the absence of market regulation, Tiebout (1956) sorting suggests that residents will compete with each other for access to bundles of local amenities which vary across the urban landscape. Ellickson’s (1971) single-crossing condition is used by Epple and Sieg (1999), to demonstrate the implications for community structure that arise due to sorting. In this framework, they show how sorting will lead to a community ranking based on amenity levels that is increasing in preferences and income. This sorting result implies that in an unregulated real estate market incomes are increasing in the level of amenities provided. While Tiebout’s (1956) original motivation was to explain the optimal provision of amenities at the local level, Muth and Alonso (Alonso 1964; Muth 1969) were concerned with land prices and income distributions of cities with a dominant center and competitive land markets. In the following years, their theories were empirically tested and extended (Brueckner and Rosenthal 2009; LeRoy and Sonstelie 1983; Wheaton 1977) and it was realized that access to the city center is just one type of amenity comparable to the effect of air quality, crime or noise (Cuberes et al. 2019; Diamond 1980; Glaeser et al. 2008; Wu 2006). Specifically, the income distribution described by monocentric city Alonso-Muth type models is driven by commuting costs to the workplace. In these models, the location of workplaces is assumed to be in the city center. Model extensions allow workplaces to be located at multiple places across the city by letting households and firms compete for land (Fujita and Ogawa 1982; Lucas and Rossi–Hansberg 2002). Various equilibria (i.e., multiple location of workplaces) can, depending on commuting cost, result from such models. Such a polycentric city model can also be used to explain how commuting costs and amenities jointly explain the spatial income distribution: Gaigné et al. (2022) consider income sorting under heterogeneity in transportation costs across space and income as well as amenities unevenly distributed across space. In response to high rents and income sorting, many jurisdictions have instituted various forms of housing policies to ensure lower-income households can afford to live in areas with high levels of amenities (Chapelle et al. 2019; Diamond et al. 2019; Mense et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2017). As Cheshire and Hilber (2018) summarize, the prevalence of housing market regulations in European cities is significantly more common than that in the USA and varies significantly across regions. The exact nature of housing policies can take many different forms usually defined in the laws of countries or regions. Conceptually, one can distinguish demand side measures, supply side measures and direct regulation of housing transaction (e.g., rent control). There is some evidence from the literature how housing policies affect sorting. The most important demand side measures are housing allowances for renters and interest subsides for buyers. For the USA, it has been shown that housing allowances did not have a large impact on income compositions of neighborhoods (Ellen 2020). For example, Eriksen and Ross (2013) report from an experimental study that those receiving a voucher move to only slightly better neighborhoods. Feins and Patterson (2005) find that neighborhoods voucher recipients move to are not better off on average than the neighborhoods from which participants moved. Supply side measures can be grouped in municipality housing (also called social housing or subsidized housing) and (subsidized) limited-profit housing provided by cooperatives. In municipality housing, the city serves as a landlord and directly provides houses and can therefore set rents and decide who to rent the apartments to. Typically, social welfare considerations play a role in the decision of who is eligible for municipality housing. In limited-profit housing, the cooperative providing apartments is legally required to charge rents based on costs of construction and administration leading to limited-profits, which are often required to be reinvested into the community. The literature suggests that in countries with small municipality housing sectors, municipality housing can result in clusters of low-income groups (Borg 2019; Schutjens et al. 2002). The effects of such clusters depend on the neighborhoods where the municipality housing projects are located. In low-income neighborhoods, municipality housing can increase house prices and diversity, and in high-income neighborhoods, this can decrease house prices (Diamond and McQuade 2018). In countries with large municipality housing sectors, tenants in municipality housing (who are not necessarily poor) pay low rents, while the poor who cannot rent public housing (e.g., if they only recently moved to the city) face higher market-based rents which results in an insider–outsider problem (Giffinger 1998; Kadi and Musterd 2015). In the case of rent control, the government (or another administrative body) directly regulates rents (first-generation rent control or capped rents) or limits rent increase (second-generation rent control). To avoid limiting the incentives of investors, rents are typically regulated for houses built prior to a particular date (e.g., 1945) or for houses built with government subsidies. The specific form of rent control, and housing policy in general, differs substantially between countries (Arnott 1995). Rent control has been criticized as causing utilitarian welfare inefficiencies because as a consequence of rent control it is not the willingness to pay which determines sorting across the city (Chapelle et al. 2019; Diamond et al. 2019). Also, rent control has been shown to reduce mobility of households (Krol and Svorny 2005; Munch and Svarer 2002) which (in the short run) impacts sorting and welfare. The degree to which municipality housing, limited-profit housing and rent control influence sorting with respect to income will depend on the specific form these market designs take, the association between preferences and income, and the implicit rent in the market for amenities. Over time, and given there is no change in the provision of amenities, an equilibrium in sorting will emerge which determines the equilibrium income gradient as one moves toward amenities. In this paper we estimate how the equilibrium income gradient is influenced by local amenities (urban green space, metro connections and the distance to the city center) and how different forms of housing policies influence the equilibrium income gradient at the level of block groupsFootnote 1 using data from Vienna, Austria. Our empirical results show how the income composition of the population differs conditional on the rental market structure. In related work, Fessler et al. (2016) derive non-cash income implicit to housing policy and show that Austrian housing policy results in more equal incomes. While their work focuses on the income distribution in Austria as whole, our work focuses on the impacts of policy on heterogeneous sorting outcomes across space. The literature on local amenities has widely confirmed that sorting results in capitalization of local public goods in nearby property values (Abbott and Allen Klaiber 2013; Finney et al. 2011; Hobden et al. 2004; Jim and Chen 2006; Netusil et al. 2010). A particularly well-studied form of local public goods is the provision of green space. The literature on the effects of urban green documents their cooling ability (Klaiber et al. 2017; Morawetz and Koemle 2017; Žuvela-Aloise et al. 2016), reduced air pollution (Nowak et al. 2006) and improved heath (Engemann et al. 2019). The extent of capitalization is heterogeneous (Herath et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2017), depending on whether greenspace can be developed (Irwin 2002) and whether green space is privately owned (Cheshire and Sheppard 1995). There is also an interaction of green space with other amenities (Abbott and Klaiber 2010; Anderson and West 2006). In a sorting framework, Klaiber and Phaneuf (2010) demonstrate the existence of demographic heterogeneity in preferences for different types of urban green space while Walsh (2007) documents the role of sorting in response to land protection policies. Empirical studies from North America, Europe and Asia have analyzed the effect of rail stations (metro and train) on property and land prices. A meta-study found price effects between − 45% percent up to 100% with a mean of 8%. The effect was found to be higher in Europe than in North America and the effect of metro was found to be different from train (Mohammad et al. 2013). For Europe, only a few studies analyzed the effect of metro stations. In Warsaw (Trojanek and Gluszak 2018), Helsinki (Laakso 1992) and Vienna (Wieser 2006), a positive effect was documented. For the Atlanta region in the USA, it was shown that the effects of train stations on residential property values varies with distance from downtown and the median income of the neighborhood. In higher-income areas (away from downtown), positive effects are found mainly because retail infrastructure locates close to the stations, while in lower-income areas negative effects (crime, noise and parking lots) dominate (Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001). Similarly, for Buffalo, New York, effects of train stations on property values have been found to be positive only in high-income areas while they are negative in poor neighborhoods (Hess and Almeida 2007). In typical US cities, income increases with distance to the city center (Schuetz et al. 2018). In many European cities, however, this pattern is not observed (Brueckner et al. 1999; Chapelle et al. 2019; Cuberes et al. 2019). This is explained by historic amenities which include listed buildings, monuments, parks and the urban infrastructure from past times. It has been argued that the joint effect of these characteristics is more than the sum of its parts (Koster et al. 2016). Empirical studies from Europe confirm that housing prices are higher next to historical amenities (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010; Koster et al. 2016; Lazrak et al. 2014). In many cities, the historic city center also has a particularly dense infrastructure (restaurants, doctors, public administration) and many businesses locate in the city adding another amenity to the city center (Glaeser et al. 2001). Finally, distances to all other location of the city are shorter from the center. Proximity to the city center is consequently found to be one reason for income sorting (Kolko 2007). In this paper, we examine the impact of housing policy on income sorting associated with proximity to urban green space, public transit and proximity to city center. The results of this paper contribute three primary new insights to the literature on sorting. First, we demonstrate the applicability of the Tiebout sorting framework in an urban setting with housing policies covering a large share of the housing market. Second, we demonstrate that as the share of residents in houses subject to housing policies increases, there exists decreasing evidence of income sorting (i.e., a flatter equilibrium income gradient). Finally, we show how different types of housing policies (municipality housing, limited-profit housing, capped rents) lead to differing patterns of sorting across space. For policymakers, our results provide novel insights into the role of municipality housing, limited-profit housing policies and capped rents on the resulting income patterns. The results also help to understand how beneficiaries of public investments can differ depending on where the investment is placed: If houses next to an amenity are subject to housing policies, renters will benefit; otherwise, current owners (resident and absentee) will benefit. Such considerations may play a role when considering where to develop urban amenities and target funds for public intervention in the housing market. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the Vienna housing market and types of housing policies aimed at providing affordable housing to residents of different income levels. In Sect. 3, we present our empirical framework. Section 4 presents our primary results. Section 5 presents a discrete choice model as a robustness check and Sect. 6 concludes.",

These have been labeled as first and second natures of geography (Cronon 1991). A first nature of geography is an advantage created by nature of locating at a certain place (such as a natural harbor, a river, and so on), while a second nature of geography is an advantage created by human beings of locating there. from Berliant and Konishi (2000). The above quote acknowledges the twin forces in agglomeration. One is geographical factors shaped by nature. The other is agglomeration externalities determined by history. In the present paper, we discuss the relative impact of these two factors in determining the location of an urban center. Agglomeration externalities are the demand-pull factors. The geographical factors are essentially cost-push ones. Unlike “New Economic Geography” (NEG) literature, the focus is not whether agglomeration will occur but where it will occur. The salient features of the present endeavor can be listed as follows: Spatial network The paper assumes the pre-existence of a spatial network (e.g., waterways, roads, and highways or combinations of multiple routes) that connect different economic regions. Manufacturing production is mobile, and firms locate production in a particular region to maximize profit. Demand-pull factors Manufacturing production does not rely on a particular region; it can be produced anywhere. The transportation costs in the manufacturing sector lead to the urban center’s historical determinism. Manufacturing firms tend to agglomerate in areas where other firms coexist due to aggregate demand externality. The story is similar to that of NEG literature. Furthermore, the location choice may not be unique. Hence, multiple locations can emerge as urban centers. Cost-push factors Agricultural production is location-specific. When transportation costs exist only in agriculture, manufacturing firms’ location choice depends on how accessible various commodities are from the rural hinterland. Therefore, a particular manufacturing firm chooses a specific location irrespective of what other firms decide. Hence, the most central region is selected as an urban center. Creating an urban center because of the cost associated with transporting agriculture contrasts with NEG literature’s main theme. Scale economies We also illustrate that under demand-pull factors, without the presence of scale economies, agglomeration cannot proceed. However, when only cost-push factors exist, manufacturing firms are attracted to a particular location, even in the absence of scale economies. Therefore, scale economies become necessary only when the manufacturing sector incurs transportation costs. The present model combines insights from two different approaches in the literature. The first one, the NEG literature, grew out of the pioneering work of Paul Krugman that emphasizes scale economies and aggregate demand externality. The central theme of the NEG literature surmised by Krugman (1991, page 15) is as follows: “Given sufficiently strong economies of scale, each manufacturer wants to serve the national market from a single location. To minimize transportation costs, she chooses a location with large local demand. But local demand will be large precisely where the majority of manufacturers choose to locate. Thus there is a circularity that tends to keep a manufacturing belt in existence once it is established.” The second approach initiated by Berliant and Konishi (2000), Berliant and Watanabe (2018) emphasizes the accessibility of markets where production is location-specific. There are no scale economies in production. Unlike the NEG literature, where all markets are equally accessible, or a complete graph is implicitly assumed, these papers focus on when transportation costs are heterogeneous. The pre-existing spatial network in our model introduces heterogeneity. The NEG literature is built entirely on the second nature of urban agglomeration, while the literature on location-specific production emphasizes the importance of the first nature. In our model, aggregate demand externality can emerge when manufacturing production requires scale economies. On the other hand, the location-specific agricultural output and the presence of a spatial network expose the first nature or geographical advantages of a particular location. Therefore, both themes are present in the present endeavor. Only manufacturing goods incur transportation costs in our first model (demand-pull). Since scale economies require a large pool of workers, urban areas emerge as production centers of manufacturing goods. There is greater demand in the metropolitan area as a result. As intra-regional trade is costless, the aggregate demand externality induces monocentric equilibrium. The question is, which regions can become candidates for an urban area? We argue that aggregate demand externality and geographical factors become pertinent in selecting an urban manufacturing center. Therefore, history plays a role. In our second model (cost-push), the transportation cost for agriculture is positive, while manufacturing goods can be transported costlessly across regions. Therefore, there is no incentive to agglomerate to a specific region to lower transportation costs for manufacturing goods. In other words, there is no aggregate demand externality. However, since agriculture is heterogeneous, the nominal wage tends to be lower in regions with easier access to rural hinterlands. Hence, more central areas are preferred when cost-push factors are overriding concerns. As a result, the location choice is determined by geographical factors only; the role of history becomes muted. We now briefly describe the earlier works closely related to ours besides those already mentioned in the introduction. The list by no means is exhaustive. We also note where the current endeavor differs from the literature. Spatial Economics historically has evolved as a subfield of Economics. It began with the pioneering work of von Thünen (1826), and the impact of this classic work was felt mainly in von Thünen’s native Germany. Pioneers of this German industry location school included (Weber 1909; Christaller 1933; Lösch 1940). Isard (1956), through his translation of these works into English, helped create a separate subject called “Regional Science.” Recently, agglomeration economics had enjoyed broader dissemination due to Paul Krugman’s pioneering work on marrying aspects of an industrial organization with a spatial location in a general equilibrium framework that helped create a new subfield called the “New Economic Geography.” In the German industry location school, opinions are divided on why and how firms choose a location. The first school sees spatial choice as geographical possibilities and transport needs where history does not matter. In other words, the pre-existence of firms is immaterial in the choice of a location. According to the second school, the economics of agglomeration matters, and location choice is history-dependent. The NEG literature founded by Paul Krugman shares the second school’s opinion where history determines the location choice. The present framework focuses on when the monocentric equilibrium is determined by history and when geography becomes the sole cause of location choice. Therefore, it provides a platform for questions raised by the scholars above. The paper close to ours is Fujita and Krugman (1995). In their paper, the emergence of a centrally located city in the von Thunen model is endogenously determined. The space is linear, and they consider the stability of the pre-existing urban center in the middle. Agriculture is a homogenous good, while manufacturing is heterogeneous. Manufacturing firms at the center tend to remain at the center to lower transportation costs in manufacturing goods, while higher transportation costs in agriculture push these firms to the periphery. In contrast, in our context, the heterogeneity of agriculture and regional specializations induces manufacturing production to choose the central location. Hence, the source of agglomeration can stem from agriculture alone. Konishi (2000) modeled the emergence of hub cities because of geographical factors. In his model, the hub city is not a production center. To the best of our knowledge, Mori and Nishikimi (2002) is the first model to combine transportation networks and industrial agglomeration. In another paper, Mori (2012) illustrates how transport networks emerge due to scale economies in transportation, among other factors. Their main objective is to demonstrate how economies of transportation density can lead to agglomeration. As opposed to these earlier works, the present endeavor describes how location-specific production and the emergence of scale economies shape the choice of location in a spatial network. Berliant and Watanabe (2018) have applied random graph theory to explain cities’ size in a recent paper. Their paper concurs that the city size is positively correlated with the extent of accessibility through roads and highways. More specifically, the degree distribution in the transportation network explains the city size. Therefore, the spatial network and the city’s location play a vital role in agglomeration. Unlike our model, Berliant and Watanabe (2018) focused only on the links across urban areas; the rural-urban transformation was not discussed. Furthermore, our main aim is to illustrate how geographical advantage and historical determinism lead to urban growth. One of the central themes of the demand-pull model is path dependence or how the initial size of the city can determine future agglomeration. Beyond the literature in economics, path dependency has also been investigated under urban and regional science. For example, multiple equilibria emerge in the retail model of Harris and Wilson (1978) and the settlement formation model of Weidlich and Munz (1990). These papers also emphasize how initial conditions and dynamics of economic migration lead to agglomeration economies. In two ways, the present endeavor differs from these works: Our paper demonstrates when scale economies in production are required for agglomeration. The present endeavor also illustrates when path dependence or historical determinism becomes prominent and when it is not.",

Heywood,Dongyang Li,Guangliang Ye,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Dragone and Lambertini (2020) broke new theoretical ground showing an alternative resolution to the long-known problem that Hotelling's (1929) linear transport cost undermines the existence of a pure strategy subgame perfect equilibrium (d'Aspremont et al. 1979). They did so by assuming convex production costs while retaining linear transport cost (disutility of distance). They show that the price undercutting associated with Hotelling's duopoly is unprofitable and that a subgame perfect pure strategy equilibrium exists for sufficient production cost convexity. The equilibrium locations reflect the ""excessive sameness"" that Hotelling anticipated with collocation at the middle of the linear market. We uniquely examine the welfare consequences of a mixed duopoly under the same convex production cost assumption. This examination reflects long-standing interest in markets in which a public firm maximizes welfare even as a private firm maximizes profit (De Fraja and Delbono 1990). Despite convex costs, no equilibrium exists in the mixed duopoly. Yet, allowing for sequential location revives a mixed duopoly equilibrium. When the public firm locates first, the equilibrium mimics that of Dragone and Lambertini and the public firm is irrelevant. Yet, when the public firm locates second, it generates a dispersed location equilibrium that improves social welfare. We also examine the case when the private firm in the mixed duopoly is foreign with its profits repatriated and so excluded from the domestic welfare maximized by the public firm (Fjell and Pal 1996). We demonstrate that the public firm now has an increased incentive to lower price to reduce the profit of the foreign firm. Indeed, equilibria exist in all timings, but they are not unique. Interestingly, all equilibria have the public firm pricing low enough to take the entire interior market. Moreover, all three timings can result in equilibria with separated firms (not collocated). We show that these routinely increase domestic welfare relative to the case of a private duopoly. They typically, but not always, increase global welfare as well. We emphasize the novelty of the showing by Dragone and Labertini (2020) by isolating its departure from previous resolutions. Previous resolutions include adopting convex transport cost (Anderson 1988; Economides, 1986), imagining a game in mixed strategies (Dasgupta and Maskin, 1986; Osborne and Pitchik, 1987) or changing the assumption that consumers are uniformly distributed along the market segment (Neven, 1986; Caplin and Nalebuff, 1991; Anderson et al. 1997).Footnote 1 Despite this long history, examining the role convex production costs was new to the Hotelling setting. As Dragone and Labertini (2020) show, production cost convexity limits the incentive of firms to compete for market share as the additional sales now increase marginal costs. This limits the price undercutting by firms and allows an elevated price equilibrium that would not otherwise exist.
 The assumption of convex production costs makes a valuable contribution for several reasons. First, substantial evidence shows that a variety of firms and industries have meaningful ranges of the implied diseconomies of scale.Footnote 2 Hsieh (1995) confirms diseconomies for several manufacturing industries in the USA. Huang and Wang (2001) demonstrate decreasing returns for Taiwanese banking, and Harada (2004) shows decreasing returns among Japanese technological start-up firms. Assaf (2010) reports that large UK airports operate with decreasing returns, while Ramcharran (2011) confirms decreasing returns in the Puerto Rican pharmaceutical industry. At minimum researchers and policy makers should consider cases of convex costs sufficiently realistic to warrant further consideration. Second, convex production cost matters in models of mixed markets outside the spatial context. Matsumura and Okamura (2015) show that convex production costs generate different optimal degrees of privatization for a public firm than do linear costs. Haraguchi and Matsumura (2021) show that the quadratic portion of a general production cost function can influence privatization policy when entry is allowed. Third, convex production costs have been meaningfully analyzed in location models but not applied to the basic Hotelling model. Gupta (1994) originally showed that adding convex production costs in a delivered pricing model causes rivals to move further apart from each other than would otherwise be implied. Indeed, the first-best locations associated with delivered pricing (Lederer and Hurter 1986) are lost under convex production costs. Recent delivered pricing models have frequently assumed convex production cost building them into models examining mergers (Heywood and Wang 2014), pricing in vertical chains (Courey 2016) and collusion (Andree et al. 2018). We present the first examination of a mixed market in a Hotelling model adopting convex production costs. We recognize that mixed markets have been examined with other assumptions and in other spatial models. Cremer et al. (1991) and Inoue et al. (2009) assume quadratic transport costs, and Fernandez-Ruiz (2020) assumes cubic transport costs in a Hotelling model. Matsushima and Matsumura (2003, 2006) examine spatial models with competition over quantity rather than price showing the extent of agglomeration. Heywood and Ye (2007, 2009) examine mixed markets under spatial price discrimination.Footnote 3 A portion of the past literature on mixed markets in a spatial context examines sequential location as will we.Footnote 4 Thus, Heywood and Ye (2007, 2009) contrast sequential and simultaneous location under spatial price discrimination. In the paper closest to our setting, Matsumura and Matsushima (2003) examine a sequential location duopoly under Hotelling with the traditional quadratic transport cost and linear product cost. The presence of a public firm alters the private sector result of maximum differentiation. The public firm cares about minimizing transport cost and so moves toward the center. Welfare is larger when the public firm leads than when it follows. Our model starts with a private sector result of minimum differentiation, and we will also present the welfare consequences of a public firm under sequential entry. In what follows, the next section models two private firms confirming that the equilibrium with sequential location matches that with simultaneous location. Section 3 models the mixed duopoly presenting both simultaneous and sequential location.

Government policies to strengthen entrepreneurial activities are nowadays present in all industrialised countries and in most of the developing countries. They are considered an important means of supporting the economic development at the supranational level group of countries (like the EU), at the national level of selected countries, and at the sub-national level of regions (like the federal states within Germany or the USA), or even local communities. While surely not every territory has the potential to become the next Silicon Valley, which emerged from a very unique mixture of entrepreneurial spirit, start-up dynamics, and historical incidences, many policy-makers indeed do believe that entrepreneurial activities in the form of new ventures led by owner–managers have the potential to spur economic development. Partially due to these expectations among policy-makers and partially because research is emerging independently, we can observe an extreme increase in scientific publications, academic conferences, and journals on the subject over the last three decades. Entrepreneurship research has long left the narrow disciplinary boundaries that characterised the entrepreneurship field some decades ago. Presently, entrepreneurship topics have grown in popularity (while still inhabiting a small niche in the identified disciplines) in several more or less neighbouring academic disciplines like psychology, sociology, and economic geography (Obschonka and Stuetzer 2017; Bögenhold et al. 2014; Mayer and Leick 2019). This might be interpreted as a clear indication of the interdisciplinary nature of entrepreneurship itself, but that does not automatically mean that the identified academic fields always have close relationships and seek intense cooperations across disciplines when entrepreneurship research is conducted. Despite many valuable examples of such cooperations in recent years, real interdisciplinarity is still, as in other academic fields, more often an assertion than a practice. It is worth mentioning that the understanding of entrepreneurship in general and of its relationship with other fields differs among entrepreneurship scholars of different academic disciplines. Let me just mention three of the most influential. For economic geographer Maryann Feldman (2001), “entrepreneurship is primarily a regional event” that is largely influenced by geography (Malecki 2009), albeit the original idea of “the entrepreneurial event” was introduced by management scholar Albert Shapero (1984). According to economist Erik Stam (2010, 141) “entrepreneurship is the result of the interaction between individual attributes and the surrounding environments”. Finally, leading management and entrepreneurship scholar Per Davidsson (2016, 62f) observes, “entrepreneurship research encompasses the study of processes of […] emergence of new economic ventures, across organizational contexts. This entails the study of new venture ideas and their contextual fit; of actors and their behaviors […], and of how the characteristics of ideas, actors and behaviors link to antecedents and outcomes on different levels of analysis”. This paper focuses on the relationship between two of these academic fields, entrepreneurship and economic geography, and between both research objects with the same name. Scholars of several different academic fields contribute to entrepreneurship research, indicating that entrepreneurship is a “multi-level phenomenon” (Davidsson 2016, 21). This paper mainly concentrates on the two identified fields and consequently addresses the content overlap between them, i.e. the geographical aspects of entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial aspects of economic geography, respectively. Whenever entrepreneurship is considered from an academic perspective, it is necessary to define what is meant by this not self-explanatory term. In this paper, entrepreneurship is related to any kind of new businesses, as the term has been used in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project for two decades. Following Sternberg and Wennekers (2005), entrepreneurship refers, first, to owning and managing a business on one’s own account and at one’s own risk and, second, to “entrepreneurial behaviour” in the sense of seizing an economic opportunity. For this paper, I define entrepreneurship as a combination of some elements of behavioural entrepreneurship with some aspects of the dynamic perspective of occupational entrepreneurship, therefore characterising new venture creation as the hallmark of entrepreneurship (Cooper 2003). The paper is structured as follows. Following the introduction, the second section examines the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic geography from two perspectives. First, the role of geography within entrepreneurship is addressed, followed by the opposite perception, i.e. the role of entrepreneurship within economic geography. In the third section, a review of the current state of the art of geographically sensitive entrepreneurship research is given, divided into theoretical and empirical research. The fourth section is dedicated to the policy side of regional entrepreneurship research. The related opportunities and challenges are described. Based upon obvious research gaps, some suggestions regarding a regional entrepreneurship research agenda are proposed in the fifth and final section.",9

From traditional perspectives based on subsidising startups, the emphasis has shifted in current perspectives towards creating, maintaining, and improving established worldwide value chains (McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2016a; McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2019). New theoretical and empirical approaches have helped identify better the drivers of entrepreneurial creation, the main actors in the process and their significant contributions to socio-economic prosperity. One of the main conclusions of these new theoretical and empirical approaches is that entrepreneurship is heavily determined by place (Acs et al. 2015; Audretsch 2015; Fritsch and Mueller 2004). A single ideal entrepreneurship formula does not exist because entrepreneurship takes a different shape depending on the regional basis. Regions differ in many aspects. Some differences can be found in whether they are rural, peri-urban or urban; natural resources-based or not; in terms of their degrees of fiscal decentralisation; whether they are lagging or innovation-driven; and also on the way that regions respond to changes and their capacity for resilience when confronting grand challenges such as globalisation, automation or ageing societies (Barca et al. 2012; Iammarino et al. 2019; Prenzel et al. 2018; Terzidis and Ortega-Argiles 2021). Concepts such as path dependency, embeddedness, industrial ecology and heritage, connectivity, culture and local norms, and interregional knowledge spillovers all play an essential role in how we think about entrepreneurship in its local context and how we can best construct meaningful policy frameworks for industrial upgrading and resilience (Rocchetta et al. 2021; Neffke 2011). The importance of thinking about the drivers and inhibitors of entrepreneurship at the regional level is highlighted by the nature and scale of the fundamental changes in the global economy. During the last three decades, the world economy has changed almost out of recognition, and new opportunities and challenges have emerged and affected regions differently (Barca et al. 2012; Iammarino et al. 2019; Terzidis and Ortega-Argiles 2021). Technological changes such as advances in telecommunications, automation, 3D printing and the 'internet of things' have reduced the need for prior scale economies in many industries, thereby potentially opening up new opportunities for new and smaller firms. While this is true in manufacturing, this is also the case in service industries, as witnessed by the rise in innovative business models such as Uber and Airbnb. At the same time, the globalisation and fragmentation of production processes have created opportunities for new forms of local economic Specialisation to respond to consumer demand. In particular, these changes may make it easier for groups of related small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to respond to modern consumer demands for more personalised goods and services in situations which may be unattractive for large corporations. In particular, increasing disposable incomes have created demands for high-quality products, and there may be new opportunities for startup SMEs to capitalise on new niche markets. In order to best help firms respond to these opportunities, governments in many countries have implemented new policy measures and instruments based on which they hope to increase economic activities and hold on to comparative advantages. In particular, given the importance of entrepreneurship for local economic growth and development, governments increasingly opt to use public policy to help make places more entrepreneurial (Reynolds 1999; Zacharakis et al. 2000; Murdock 2012). However, this policy shift also reflects more fundamental shifts in both analytical and empirical approaches to entrepreneurship which has taken place in recent years, and it is not without criticism (Parker 2007; Shane 2009). Therefore, understanding these shifts is essential if we are to make sense of the changing policy landscape. This paper will discuss how our understanding of the importance of the local context in shaping entrepreneurship has evolved and how our growing understanding has reshaped the entrepreneurship policy frameworks that are being developed. We will examine different policy approaches emerging in different parts of the world and identify the core elements which shape these various approaches. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section discusses the relationship between entrepreneurship and regional development in general and in the context of regional entrepreneurship ecosystems. The third section discusses the traditional and evolving basis for entrepreneurship policy, including market failures and governance issues. The fourth section provides a brief discussion of the experience of entrepreneurship policy in the US and the EU, and the fifth section concludes.",2

Larsson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The process through which a local economy becomes dense in new firm formation is important for several reasons. Perhaps most importantly, local growth is tightly connected with the rate of new firm formation as well as with the density of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) (Fritsch 2013; Fritsch and Wyrwich 2016; Glaeser et al. 2015, 2010; Tsvetkova et al. 2019). As a consequence, significant interest in understanding the drivers of spatial variations in new firm formation and SME density is shared among researchers and policy makers alike. In part, the empirical literature on the geography of entrepreneurship has emphasized the role of so-called economic fundamentals in explaining the geography of entrepreneurship (Plummer and Pe’er 2010, Glaeser 2010). Fundamentals refer to basic supply- and demand-side conditions, such as local supply of labor, business services, suppliers as well as access to financial capital, knowledge resources and local presence of population and employment. However, it is increasingly recognized that fundamentals only provide a partial account of startup activity in regions. The presence of resources is simply not sufficient for people to act on perceived opportunities. There is growing evidence that different regions have different locally embedded values and attitudes toward entrepreneurship, and that these have a strong and persistent influence on local entrepreneurial activity. These values are analyzed in a multitude of ways in the literature, Some studies undertake case-based research. For example, Saxenian’s (1996) analysis of the success of Silicon Valley over Boston’s route 128 of regional development emphasizes that one of Silicon Valley’s main advantages is a local culture that is more supportive toward entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial activity.Footnote 1 Others focus on the persistence of regional variations in entrepreneurial activity. Fritsch and Wyrwich (2014) use data from East Germany to show that regional entrepreneurship levels of 1925 predict contemporary levels, even after controlling for other factors. This spatio-temporal persistence of entrepreneurship holds despite Nazism and the Second World War, the communist dictatorship that actively sought to stomp out entrepreneurial tendencies (see also Fritsch et al. 2014), and several economic crises. Giannetti and Simonov (2009) find that entrepreneurs in entrepreneurship-dense localities have lower earnings and face higher opportunity costs, compared to entrepreneurs in other places, conditioned on a rich set of individual and place-based characteristics. These findings cannot be explained on the basis of fundamental factors alone. How can we systematize and understand these inferred social factors? Many researchers use the concept”local entrepreneurship cultures” as a catch-all term to capture social, as opposed to fundamental, phenomena that are external to the individual but internal to the region. The term is usually employed to refer to the level of social acceptance and encouragement of entrepreneurs and their activities in a place (Fritsch and Wyrwich 2014, 2019, Andersson and Koster 2011). As this ‘social fabric’ of regions changes slowly and have long-lasting effects, they constitute a major challenge for policy. The question is then how and why different local entrepreneurship cultures develop and persist over time. In this paper, we link up to the works of Chinitz (1961), Glaeser et al (2015), Fritsch et.al (2019) and Stuetzer et al (2016) and discuss these issues with a focus on how and why a region’s industry structure shapes the long-run entrepreneurial character of a region. First, we present theoretical perspectives and empirical findings of the relationship between historical industry structure of a region and its entrepreneurship culture. Supported by previous research, we argue that the historical development of a place’s industry is tightly linked with the industriousness of its culture, and point to local social interaction as one of the mechanisms that fosters the formation as well as persistence of a local entrepreneurship culture in a region. We argue that local social interaction effects constitute vehicles for the transmission of attitudes, behaviors and information among residents in a region. Second, to illustrate the empirical relevance of the arguments about a link between historical industry structure and local entrepreneurship cultures, we discuss historical circumstances in Sweden and provide examples of findings from recent case studies of Swedish municipalities. We also employ data on historical voting patterns and local fraction of manufacturing industry across municipalities in Sweden and assess their correlation with present-day entrepreneurial activity as well as measures of public attitudes to entrepreneurship. The empirical analyses show that municipalities with a high share of left-wing votes in the period 1917–1948 have lower rates of new firm formation, less positive public attitudes toward entrepreneurship as well as larger average establishment sizes in the twenty-first century. The same is true about places with early reliance on manufacturing industries. Our interpretation is that early presence of heavy industry has spurred local economies dominated by labor union activity, and ultimately less entrepreneurship-friendly attitudes among the local population. While merely suggestive, these patterns are consistent with the argument that regions’ historical industry structure is one channel through which local entrepreneurship cultures may influence present-day rates of new firm formation in regions. While our study lacks any causal ambitions, our results lend further support first, to the hypothesis that ‘entrepreneurship cultures’ are spawned through local industry, and second, that these long-lasting regional attributes change slowly. Our contribution is to summarize perspectives in the literature on how and why historical local industry structure is one factor that shapes the local entrepreneurship culture of place and to point to empirical regularities in Sweden that lends further support for these arguments. The paper also aims to inspire future research in this vein, and we point to different research areas of relevance to further advance our understanding of how and why local entrepreneurship cultures develop and persist.",

Aroca,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Initially a geographer who undertook his doctorate at The Johns Hopkins University investigating urban design and children and parent travel patterns in intercity Baltimore, Roger Stough forged a long and formidable academic career as a scholar who embraced regional science and public policy.
 Over his long career Roger Stough won more than $80 million in sponsored research grants and contracts. His research output was prolific, with 43 books and more than 100 papers in peer reviewed journals, including: Public Administration Review; Applied Econometrics and International Development; International Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management; Environment and Planning; The Annals of Regional Science; Geographical Analysis; Transport Reviews; International Journal of Transport Economics; Growth and Change, Journal of Transport Geography; Regional Governance and Economic Development; Transport Review; Papers in Reginal Science; Review of Regional Studies. In the 1970s Stough played a central role in building a public policy program at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. He followed this by his move to Indianapolis where he joined the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and eventually became Associate Dean for the Indianapolis campus. From the early 1990s Stough would play an instrumental role developing the research program at the new Institute for Public Policy—later to become the School of Public Policy, then the Schar School of Policy and Government—at George Mason University (GMU). He attracted and mentored a stream of doctoral students at GMU where he, and his students and visiting faculty focussed on and developed a high profile for a research program in transportation, regional economic development, and entrepreneurship. Indicative of Stough’s drive and leadership capabilities was the way he revitalised the Mason Enterprise Centre (Mason’s small business outreach program) expanding it across the state of Virginia. For the last few years of his career, he became Vice-President for Research and Economic Development at GMU, where he reorganized the research office, expanded grant and contract activity, and set up their entrance into the top ranks of the Carnegie Research University grouping. A hallmark of Roger Stough’s academic career was his collegiality, his mentoring young scholars and many doctoral students, and his ability to develop powerful collaborations with regional scientists around the world, including Sweden, The Netherlands, the UK, Turkey, Australia, China, Korea, Vietnam, India, and Chile. The outcome was a substantial flow of publications, many of which came out of the large number of symposia, seminars, and conferences which he helped organise on important topics in regional development, entrepreneurship, and public policy, which brought together established and emerging researchers. Two examples are especially worth mentioning. The first was Roger Stough’s involvement in the initiative by Peter Nijkamp to hold the Tinbergen Institute’s Annual Symposium in Amsterdam addressing regional development issues, which ran for over two decades from 1996. The second was his important role in the annual Uddevalla Symposium initiated in the same period, and which also lasted for about two decades. Roger Stough’s early research on intra-metropolitan cooperation and inter-jurisdictional taxation issues was complemented by his research work on redevelopment in historic urban settings, which was followed by a focus on tourism (Stough et al. 1984). Much of this was driven by his commitment to local development both in Charleston, Indianapolis, and the Washington Metropolitan Area. Then his research interests would diversify to range across several fields of interest to regional scientists and policy analysts. These included: intelligent transport systems; regional development; innovation, entrepreneurship, and institutions; industrial clustering; migration and labour markets; metropolitan organization; urban evolution; and urban and regional planning. In the late 1990s he concentrated on intelligent transportation systems and their implementation and consequences for metropolitan development. In what follows we focus on three specific fields of research which attracted the attention of Stough in collaboration with many colleagues, citing key books that were published.",
70.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,23 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-021-01097-4,Industrial transformations and regional inequalities in Europe,February 2023,Roberta Capello,Silvia Cerisola,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Regional inequality is back on the scene with great emphasis. As a matter of fact, after a long period of convergence, in 2008 inter-regional disparities started to increase, giving rise to a period of “reverse convergence” as has been labelled by DGRegio, the EU Directorate in charge of European Regional Policies. The increase of economic disparities reinforced social inequality, sense of frustration towards the EU as an institution, and the rise of populistic and nationalistic parties (Farole et al. 2018; OECD 2018; Dijkstra et al. 2020). The geography of social discontent (Rodríguez-Pose 2018) reflects rich and advanced areas in favour of socio-economic integration and openness as opposed to poor, agricultural and less developed areas supporting a nationalistic view. Brexit is the most evident case of nationalism and of European dis-satisfaction, where the “leave” vote in the Referendum of 26th June 2016 was more pronounced in less prosperous regions than in more prosperous ones, and by people who sensed that they had suffered under modern globalization (McCann 2018). The situation will probably appear even more dramatic when the negative effects of the coronavirus crisis, especially on more fragile economies, will be clearer in the European economic trend. Such crisis, in fact, can easily push towards an even more uneven development. Regional inequality is therefore a source of social dis-satisfaction and calls for the identification of adequate normative interventions. As a matter of fact, research on regional disparities has always been wide and articulated, both in terms of empirical analyses and of methods applied for measurement (for a review, see Ezcurra and Rodriguez-Pose 2019), most of them describing and interpreting the convergence or divergence of regional per capita GDP, following the initial contributions provided by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991 and 1992).Footnote 1 Moreover, a strand of literature exists on the sources of regional disparities. These are in general attributed especially to institutional changes, namely the widening and deepening of the European Union, and particularly in the case of the large Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) enlargement in 2004 (Camagni et al. 2020; Casi and Resmini 2014, 2017; Popovici and Calin 2015; Iammarino and McCann 2013; Petrakos 2001; Pusterla and Resmini 2007; Resmini 2007). One of the most quoted explanations for the existence of spatial disparities is the industrial structure of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, with respect to the Western, more modern, economies. The 7th Cohesion Report, the most important official document of DGRegio reporting on the socio-economic conditions of European regions and on their evolution, largely quotes the significant specialization in low value-added sectors, usually identified as traditional sectors, of CEE countries as a source of regional inequality (European Commission 2017). Such specialization explains the lagging behind of such countries and puts forward the question whether policies to support industrial transformation towards more advanced sectors should be developed. Rural regions specialized in a traditional sector like agriculture are the poorest areas; the support by EU policies to transform their economies towards industrial activities is something strongly debated. However, the same 7th Cohesion Report rightly underlines that the catching-up in productivity of CEE countries is especially registered in low value-added sectors—agriculture and industry. This is true especially before the 2008 economic crisis, but also in the years of crisis, even if at less pronounced rates. Industrial transformation is broadly defined as changes in the productive structure, i.e. in the mix of sectors present in a country or region. In the debate on CEE countries, industrial transformation is expected to change the composition of sectors towards higher value-added ones, with a positive effect on productivity growth through: i) a mix of local sectors in the region that increase their productivity more than the European average. This is potentially possible through a process of technological progress at the sectoral level (modernization effect); ii) the presence of local sectors that are more competitive than the same sectors somewhere else (efficiency effect); iii) a reallocation of the labour force from low to high value-added sectors (reallocation effect). A legitimate question then is whether the industrial transformation processes lead to decreasing inequalities in the EU, through an increase in productivity in less developed countries. Normative interventions, in fact, must be adjusted to the process that prevails and that drives productivity dynamics. This question is particularly relevant in Europe, characterized by two blocks of countries (Western and Eastern ones) that, for historical reasons, register a different industrial structure, a different industrial transformation and different productivity growth and levels. The paper has the aim to reply to such a question and to identify whether the effect of productivity growth on inequalities in Europe is the result of a modernization, an efficiency or a reallocation effect, understanding the weight of each effect on regional inequality to guide policy actions. The paper starts by describing the relatively scant existing literature on this specific topic (Sect. 2), preparing the ground to the analysis of how structural changes in the industrial structure influence regional imbalances, disentangling productivity growth in its three components (Sect. 3), and simulating their specific individual role on regional disparities (Sect. 4). The final goal is to guide policy interventions in favour of an industrial transformation supporting the reduction of regional imbalances (Sect. 5).",3
70.0,1.0,The Annals of Regional Science,10 June 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-022-01129-7,Economic vulnerability in US metropolitan areas,February 2023,Gordon F. Mulligan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Analyzing the nature and extent of regional economic growth continues to be a dominant topic of research in economic geography and the related social sciences (Karlsson et al. 2015; Capello and Nijkamp 2019). In recent times, three aspects of this research have become increasingly prominent. First, there is a widespread belief that planners, policymakers, and leaders should learn to construct and implement endogenous growth strategies (Stimson et al. 2019). These self-sustainable strategies should begin with a realistic assessment of the core competencies that are currently available to each region. However, many regions will never enjoy self-sustainable growth, either because they are too small or too specialized, or badly lacking in human capital or physical infrastructure (Stimson et al. 2009). Second, there is growing recognition that regions can only compete by becoming more creative and innovative (Moretti 2012; Jackson and Schaeffer 2017). Here, the research on regional knowledge production functions (RKPFs) highlights the key roles played by industrial laboratories, university facilities, and STEM jobs in the so-called New Economy (Varga and Horváth 2015). Other studies have clarified that the various information and knowledge transfers between agents are now determined more by occupations than by industries (Michaels et al. 2018). But innovation can also be viewed as a region-wide learning process where entrepreneurs successfully bring more “local” products and practices to the market (Cerisola 2019). Third, there is growing interest in gauging the sustainability, vulnerability, and resilience of regional economies. But to date, a lot of this research has been self-selective—often targeting “at risk” industries or “declining” regions—and has not yet revealed the general economic vulnerability of metropolitan areas, either to internal uncertainties or external disruptions. In truth, much more hard evidence is needed to clarify how sensitive regional unemployment shifts are to national or international events (Armstrong and Taylor 1993). Only then will planners and policymakers fully realize that some regions are much more, and others much less, vulnerable to disruptive changes. However, all three of these perspectives realize that the fortunes of every metropolitan economy rest on attracting and nurturing human capital that in turn can take advantage of social networks, knowledge spillovers, and other local externalities (Shearmur et al. 2016). Here, the role of natural- and human-created amenities is seen to be increasingly important in attempts to widen or deepen the region’s pool of skilled and educated workers (Marans and Stimson. 2011; Mulligan et al. 2019). The analysis of this paper addresses the monthly changes in unemployment rates across 381 US standard metropolitan statistical areas during the three pre-COVID decades stretching between 1990 and 2020. All these areas currently have populations that exceed 50,000 although many were sub-metropolitan, or micropolitan, back in 1990 (U.S. Census Bureau 2021). As discussed below, these metropolitan areas, based on county units, represent the labor markets of the nation’s major cities. The analysis uses the BLS time series for unemployment rates, and the sensitivity of metropolitan rates, in comparison with the national rates, is estimated across some 360 months using ordinary least-squares regression (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020a). Using the Brechling–Thirlwall approach (see below), more widely known in the UK, the first-order difference in each area’s unemployment rate is compared to the first-order difference in the nation’s unemployment rate. Some metropolitan areas, in part due to their locations and in part due to their histories and ever-evolving industrial profiles, always exhibit more volatility in their unemployment rates than other areas. The degree of this volatility can be linked, in part, to various initial conditions of the metropolitan areas in 1990. Specialization (or over-representation) in primary or manufacturing industries is shown to have a positive impact and specialization in government activities a negative impact on the subsequent volatility seen in metropolitan unemployment rates. Similar effects are seen for self-employment (−), natural amenities (+), human-created amenities (−), real wages (−), the initial unemployment rate (+), and the importance of colleges and universities (−). Together, the results suggest that certain key activities can be chosen as public-policy instruments for dampening monthly changes in unemployment rates. An alternative estimation, which includes the corresponding monthly changes in unemployment rates at the state level, indicates that per capita patent production (−) and overall industrial diversity (+) can also affect the volatility in unemployment rates experienced across US metropolitan areas. The analysis considers a wide variety of economic circumstances that prevail before a lengthy study period and is not designed to gauge those factors that might drive employment growth or decline over much shorter periods (Kreston and Wójcik 2018). Moreover, lead and lag effects, whether of the spatial or industrial variety, are not examined at this time (Park and Hewings 2012). The paper concludes with a short discussion of economic vulnerability at the level of individual industries, where the notion of “riskiness” has recently become commonplace. Here, the results are taken from the analysis of four different activities—amusement, health care, real estate, and retailing. In all four cases, each metropolitan area’s single-industry degree of specialization is determined by a location quotient computed for 2018, and the ranks of these LQs are compared to the ranks calculated for the 30 years of volatility in the various unemployment rates. As expected, all four correlations are positive and three of these are also highly significant. The results show that different metropolitan areas can be equally vulnerable to disruptions or downturns even though those areas specialize in different “at risk” activities.",1

By late March of 2022 in the USA, over 80 million cases and 970,000 deaths have been confirmed. This public health crisis has produced a significant shock to national and regional economies. Government directives for stay-home orders and business closures directly impacted economic activities while growing uncertainty and concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic discouraged economic activity indirectly. The negative shock on regional economies was widespread and extensive, though the magnitude of the shock varied by region. This was mainly due to regional economies' varying levels of resilience, which are largely dependent on their industrial structures. Regions highly concentrated in service or manufacturing sectors that rely on intensive face-to-face interaction are more vulnerable to the economic shock from COVID-19. Businesses in those sectors, such as restaurants and bars, travel and transportation, entertainment (e.g., casinos and amusement parks), personal services (e.g., dentists, daycare providers, barbers), vulnerable retail (e.g., department stores and small retails), and vulnerable manufacturing (e.g., meat processing and packing), were directly and adversely affected by the shutdown orders. Conversely, regions highly specialized in industrial activities that are not necessarily prone to government shutdown orders are relatively less vulnerable to the economic shock from the pandemic. These industrial activities include but are not limited to: professional business services, information technology, financial activities, freight transportation, and warehousing and storage services. Martin and Sunley (2015) found that high-tech manufacturing and knowledge-led service industrial activities are vital for resilient regional structures, mainly thanks to innovative activities and a more adaptable labor market structure. The economic shock from the worldwide pandemic is still ongoing and no one can accurately forecast when it will end due to existing uncertainty from COVID-19 variants even with widely available access to vaccines. In the first quarter of 2020, some U.S. regions started to show early signs of economic recession, but the shock to regional economies in the U.S. predominately started in the second quarter of 2020. With the recent release of state GDP in the U.S.,Footnote 1 empirical studies about the shock on regional economies in the U.S. have mainly focused on how regional economies react to shocks (resistance). This should be separated from the subsequent questions: how regional economics recover from shocks (recovery), and how regional economies grow in the post-recovery period by renewal and reorientation (realignment and adaptation). Martin (2012) provided an extensive discussion on a regional reaction to recessionary shocks, post-recession hysteresis, and the long-term trajectory of a regional economy facing recessionary shocks. Like many other recent studies on COVID-19 and its impact on regional economies, this study focuses on the question of how regional economies react to shocks (resistance) with the ongoing recession due to COVID-19. This paper emphasizes the importance of industrial structure for a region’s reaction to a recessionary shock. This study employs two factors as the main determinants for the regional industrial structure during this ongoing recession. The first is if the economic activities have been determined as ‘essential’ by the federal government. The second is the level of interpersonal interactions for the economic activities. With these two factors under consideration, the industries of a region can be classified into four groups: (1) essential with high interpersonal interactions, (2) non-essential with high interpersonal interactions, (3) essential with low interpersonal interactions, and (4) non-essential with low interpersonal interactions. Specialization of re-classified industries is associated with the level of resistance to an extreme event, particularly an infectious disease outbreak, such as COVID-19. The two main research questions in this study are: ‘does the industrial structure of a state differentiate the intensity of a negative economic impact from the COVID-19 shock?’ Secondly, ‘are states with highly specialized industries that are vulnerable to the pandemic disease more prone to the shock from COVID-19, as compared to other states?’. Our study contributes to the evolving literature on the regional economic impact of COVID-19 by proposing an industrial taxonomy that allows us to investigate the extent to which regional industrial structure attributes to heterogeneous regional economic impacts in the U.S. The industrial structure is measured by the sectoral specialization and diversity for each state using employment and establishment data. The results enable us 1) to identify the states that are the most economically damaged (or benefitted) from the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of annual change in state GDP and resistance level, 2) to learn how regional industrial structure explains the variance in regional economic impacts, and 3) to draw policy implications to enhance economic resilience by restructuring regional industrial sectors. The following section summarizes the relevant literature and research, followed by the method and data in Sect. 3. Section 4 shares the findings from this study, and the last section concludes.",5

Thus, the Protocol No. 26 of the ‘Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union’ emphasises the requirements for ‘a high level of quality, safety and affordability, equal treatment and the promotion of universal access and of user rights’ when it comes to the provision of SGI (European Union 2008, p. 308). SGI have been defined as ‘market and non-market services which public authorities class as being of economic interest and subject to specific public service obligation’ (CEC 2001, p. 23). They incorporate both services of general economic interest, which refer to gas, water, electricity, postal service, transport, waste management, ICT and electronic communications and social services of general interest such as labour market services, education, health care, child care, social care, (social) housing and social assistance services (Rauhut and Ludlow 2013). When the SGI are addressed from the perspective of quality, availability, accessibility and affordability standards, the minimum level of SGI for individuals and enterprises is brought into discussion, entailing analyses that take into consideration thresholds, critical mass and vulnerability. As the EU territories are very heterogeneous, quantitative levels of SGI for the EU as a whole are not possible to be established. Instead, these levels are subject to national policies in accordance with ideologies, institutions, macroeconomic performance and resonating with moral values, traditions, demographic structures, life style aspects, etc. At the same time, two dimensions are envisaged by the discussions on SGI, namely the socio-economic dimension, which focuses on the provision of SGI to everyone, and the territorial dimension, which concentrates on the provision of SGI everywhere (Constantin et al. 2015; Littke and Rauhut 2013). As a result, empirical studies undertaken in this respect have revealed that, especially when it comes to the social services of general interest, territorial inequalities in terms of their availability are smaller than the overall territorial development disparities (e.g. Constantin et al. 2015, referring to health services). The situation is more heterogeneous with regard to the services of general economic interest: in this case, the disparity pattern for services such as transportation, gas, waste management usually mirrors the overall territorial disparities depiction (e.g. Vulevic 2016, with reference to transportation infrastructure). However, some ‘trade-offs between accessibility, economic efficiency and equity in both developed and developing country contexts’ are revealed when such services are addressed as well (Geurs et al. 2016, p. 3). In the depicted context, water provision holds a special place. The importance of water, sanitation and sewage services derives from the water functions, which cover a wide range of user possibilities, from drinking water to water for industry, water for agriculture, water for recreation, water in the natural environment, transportation water (shipping), water in the residential environment, water for construction and water for disposal (Dalhuisen and Nijkamp 2002). The supply of water is based on the production, transportation and distribution processes, the sources for water production being found in surface water, ground water or in a combination of these two sources (Dalhuisen et al. 2001). The whole human existence proves the vital necessity for drinking water and, more and more, for clean drinking water. Water provision is closely connected to piped water, while water disruptions create a lot of concern about their direct and indirect impacts: directly, affected families are inclined to find substitutes in less clean water, entailing the increase in water-borne illnesses; indirectly, as families tend to wash their hands less frequently, non-water-borne, infectious, contagious diseases may spread and weaken their immune systems and raise infant mortality (Ashraf et al. 2017). From twentieth century onwards, widespread water improvements have been possible as a result of massive investments in water and sewage infrastructure. The provision of core services in urban area—like clean water and sanitation—is addressed with reference to the quality of life and inclusiveness issues. More recently, it has been included in the discussions about city/local community resilience, as a component of prosperity index related to economic vulnerability. In this context, the infrastructure dimension incorporates indicators such as piped water (defined as percentage of households connected to water) and sewerage (as percentage of households connected to the sewage system) (Hudec et al. 2017). At the EU level, the right to water and sanitation is acknowledged and regulated by the Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EC, with additional improvements in response to the European Citizens’ Initiative ‘Right2Water’ (2018). It is in line with the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2018) and recognises ‘the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential to the full enjoyment of life and human rights’ (United Nations 2010, p. 2). In keeping with the requirements formulated for the SGI, EU has pointed to the human rights that all Member States bear with regard to the access to safe drinking water, which must be ‘available, physically accessible, affordable and acceptable’ (Council of the EU 2010, p. 1). In the EU countries, water supply falls traditionally under the responsibility of local authorities, which have to ensure the access to water resources in accordance with quantity, quality and safety requirements. As a result, they play a primary role in the provision of investments for construction, expansion and maintenance of water distribution systems (Dalhuisen et al. 2002; Dalhuisen and Nijkamp 2002). However, in the last decades, the creation of the Single Market has made the EU Member States agree to open public procurement in the energy, water and transport sectors to the general competition. This liberalisation process has brought private enterprises in the water sector as well, raising questions and debates about shaping private entrepreneurship by public regulations, private entities developed into so-called multi-utilities, private investment, obligation of private utilities to spend the necessary sums for water infrastructure maintenance, subsidies removal, regulation of private utilities for safety reasons, etc. (Ashraf et al. 2017; Glaeser 2012; Glaeser and Joshi-Ghani 2013; Cutler and Miller 2006; Dalhuisen et al. 2001). And, even if privatisation is accepted, government continues to play an active role in water system administration and management, given the need to solve difficult issues such as asymmetric info, misuse of market power, efficiency, transparency, effective co-ordination, etc. (Dalhuisen et al. 2001). In the EU, an important obligation for each Member State is ‘to take all measures necessary to ensure access to drinking water for vulnerable and marginalized groups’ (European Commission, 2018). Deriving from this Directive, the drinking water affordability represents a major concern, measurements being taken with regard to affordability ratio (water bills as a share of free disposable income) and the hours of work at the prevailing minimum wage required to pay for a monthly water bill (Gutorova et al. 2018). The affordability assessment in the EU Member States indicates serious problems in the Eastern European Countries, especially in relation to the poorest segments of the population (Gutorova et al. 2018; Eurostat 2020a). Thus, according to the 2020 monitoring report of the Eurostat on progress towards Sustainable Development Goals in the EU context, the connection rates and water services are, overall, way higher than 10 years ago but ‘different levels of access to water services and sanitation persist between member states’ (Eurostat 2020a, p. 123). In 2018, in Romania 25.6% of households did not have access to basic sanitary facilities and quality water, followed by Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria with around 9%, while most of the EU countries have reported shares of less than 1%. The access gap to water supply and sanitation services is largely a legacy of these countries’ communist past, statistics showing Romania as a complete outlier in the European Union (World Bank 2018). This situation emphasises a strong link between access to water services and sanitation, on the one side, and poverty, on the other side: the afore-mentioned countries also hold the first positions in terms of at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2018, with 23.5%, 23.3%, 22.9% and 22%, respectively (Eurostat 2020b). However, when GDP per capita at PPS is considered, things are more nuanced: the ratio between the level of this indicator at national level and the EU average is 70% for Romania, 84% for Lithuania, 69% for Latvia, 67% for Greece, 65% for Croatia and 53% for Bulgaria. These results show that there is not a clear correlation between the well-being at country level and the water services provision. For example, in Romania’s case the situation is better when it comes to GDP per capita compared to the rate of access to water services. In fact, Romania, a former communist country that joined the European Union in 2007, is a very relevant example from the ‘beyond of GDP’ perspective: according to the EU Social Progress Index, Romania’s average is 47.9%, compared with 66.7% EU average, while for the ‘water and sanitation’ component of this index Romania’s average is 52.5%, compared with 88.9% EU average. Within Romania, the ‘water and sanitation’ sub-index varies from 32.9% in the South-Muntenia region to 65.2% in the West region (NUTS-2 level). These findings have made us focus on Romania for a much deeper inquiry, of a special significance for the availability and accessibility principles related to the SGI provision—water in this case—which refers to territorial inequalities. More precisely, we have aimed to identify the determinants of regional inequalities in water consumption and to shed light on the potential spatial autocorrelation in water consumption patterns. In the depicted analysis framework, unlike in the vast majority of studies which treat GDP per capita as a dependent, resultative variable, this time it is employed as an independent variable in the study of interregional variations of water consumption. Apart from the GDP per capita—which serves as a proxy for regional income and prosperity—we hypothesised agglomeration, urbanisation, the demographic structure and some economic factors to have significant influences on water consumption patterns. Our analysis discriminates between households and firms patterns and factors of influence regarding the consumption of piped water. By dealing explicitly with spatial effects in the framework of a spatial panel model, this paper also brings a novel methodological approach to the analysis of water consumption.",

Haynes,Meng-Hao Li,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the last century, different types of pathogens have killed more people than any armed conflict (Adda 2016). COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and it can infect people via direct and indirect human-to-human contact. The differences we observe in the infections and fatalities are due to built-in characteristics within the society that generate different exposure levels and different responses to the virus attack. All regions are not equally responsive to the diffusion and impact of the virus since most regions reflect different social, demographic, behavior, and economic characteristics and related responses. Therefore, although the attack of COVID-19 on human society was exogeneous, the response to the virus was completely endogenous to society’s established characteristics. COVID-19 appears to be impacting people disproportionately across different socioeconomic groups and varies by ethnicity, income, age, gender, and social groups or communities. This is reflected in the relative concentration of these communities in different regions. However, it is not possible to simply and reliably put together the threads of evidence that clarify these discriminatory COVID-19 impacts. The evidence of differences linked to impact differentials needs to be better understood. What are the aggregated regional characters that are fundamental to these disparities in virus infections and fatalities? This paper explores these disproportionate impacts for COVID-19. The poverty rate is an economic variable, and we evaluate how the poverty rate influences the rate of transmission and consequences for viral disease—here COVID-19. Earlier literature has investigated several economic variables and their role in health conditions related to economic activity in the context of infectious diseases (Adda 2016). These variables include income, GDP per capita, and unemployment rates (Adda et al. 2009; Ettner 1996; Ruhm 2000, 2003, 2005). Others have also looked at the impact of trade (imports and exports) and international exposure in a context of viruses and bacteria as they relate to human infections, including smallpox, whopping cough, scarlet fever, mumples, measles, polio, tuberculosis, and HIV among many others (Oster 2005). In this paper, we test two main hypotheses fundamental to understanding the relationships between poverty and COVID-19. In theory, it is not clear whether poverty should worsen the transmission of infectious diseases, or help it contain the diseases. It is even more complex and obscure in the developed world context. If poverty prone areas have limited economic activities and that in turn limits human interaction, poverty may help to control infectious diseases like COVID-19. On the other hand, if poverty is related to physical interpersonal contacts, limited health care capacity, and certain interaction behaviors, it might dominate other poverty-related limited economic activity, which means we may experience higher infections in poverty prone areas. For example, financially poorer people are often essential workers that demand physical presence and are not permitted to work from home. The increase in physical interpersonal contacts and decline of compliance with social distancing in poverty prone areas would exacerbate the spread of the COVID-19 disease (Kim and Kwan 2021; Liu et al. 2020). Furthermore, economically disadvantaged neighborhoods may be clustered by houses with poor conditions and have less safety in outdoor spaces. Overcrowding in poverty prone areas will put people at higher risk of spreading the contagious disease (Rollston and Galea 2020). Moreover, poverty and public shame may shape how people experience being observed and judged by others during the pandemic. A strict disciplinary measure and shaming in any form (rather than harm-reduction strategy) can cause stigmatization and eventually undermine public health efforts by discouraging people, particularly poor people, from getting tested and disclosing their health status to contact-tracers or cooperating with other mitigation programs (Collins 2020; Gold 2020). Saxe (2020) presented how stigmatization and criminalization deter testing and exacerbate problems of abusive policing of members of marginalized communities in the HIV epidemic. Similarly, a higher poverty rate can be responsible for higher death and fatality rates (fatality rate is the ratio of COVID-19 infections to deaths, converted into percentage) because poor regions may have limited capacity to provide medical access and treatment to infected (COVID-19) patients. Additionally, economically disadvantaged people may not be able to afford health insurance and hesitate to get the COVID-19 test which in turn limit their access to health resources and treatments in poverty prone areas (Cordes and Castro 2020). The majority of this literature covering the characteristics and consequences of the pandemicFootnote 1 can be grouped as follows: (a) the measurement of the spread of COVID19 and the role of mitigation such as masks, crowding limitation, and social distancing, (b) the degrees of disease transmission, plus the effectiveness and compliance with social distancing, (c) the economic impacts of COVID-19 such as the impact on employment, (d) the socioeconomic consequences of extreme measures such as shelter-in-place or lockdowns, and e) the governmental response to the pandemic (Brodeur et al. 2020). Some literature attempts to relate COVID-19 to key socioeconomic variables as causes for the difference in impacts. Most of these have yet to be peer-reviewed (Chin et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020). Other studies focus on spatial analysis (Sun et al. 2020), ethnic disparities (Li et al. 2020), development of online dashboards for tracking COVID-19 (Wissel et al. 2020), use of vulnerability indices (Mukherji 2020), and issues in equitable COVID-19 response (Chin et al. 2020). The major concern of these studies is that they do not adequately address the confounding factors. For example, counties in each state were subject to various COVID-19 mitigation policies. Therefore, simple county-level cross section analysis often suffers from selection biases by not controlling for state mitigation policies. This is the case for most pre-print unpublished articles. We address these problems using multi-level data with state fixed effects which control all COVID-19 policies and other factors across the states. We observe a significant difference in results with and without state fixed effect controls. We also estimate a multi-level mixed method for robustness checks which is a suitable and appropriate strategy given in our research design and data set. In this paper, we hypothesize that poverty worsens the COVID-19 impact, and we test it using US county-level data. However, this expectation is not obvious or not agreed upon. The next section states the hypotheses about the relationship between COVID-19 and poverty. Section 3 reports methods, data, and descriptive statistics. Section 4 presents the results of cumulative COVID-19 data until the end of July 2020. The next section, Sect. 5, presents a robustness check by disaggregating results by monthly cumulative cases and deaths and by estimating a multi-level mixed method. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

Tolbert,Male,Male,Male,Male,"A growing body of regional economic research examines the impact of local banks on regional economic indicators, with effects varying across the rural–urban spectrum and local industrial structure. Suggestive evidence indicates that local bank presence is associated with higher income, higher wages, reduced poverty, and reduced income inequality. However, long-run and ongoing restructuring in the financial services sector continues to reshape capital lending costs and relational lending practices, two important mechanisms within local and regional capital lending. In the past, small businesses (and banks) relied on relational lending to help facilitate local capital lending to small businesses. However, the proliferation of absentee‐owned banking networks brought standardized practices, reducing the independence of local loan officers to utilize social capital in loan decisions, i.e., reducing relational lending (Tolbert et al. 2014). The rate of decline of local banks has been greatest in the most rural counties and this decline corresponds with a decline in the use of traditional small business loans for start-ups and emergence of alternative, potentially riskier, financial services (Mencken and Tolbert 2016, 2018b). The effects of local banks are not necessarily uniformly positive, however. First, benefits appear to decline across the rural–urban spectrum (Carpenter et al. 2019). Second, benefits may vary across industries. For example, banking deregulation (which correlates with the decline of local banks) reduced the cost of credit for the agricultural sector, and had positive impacts on farm sales and net income, though those benefits were again concentrated in metro areas (Kandilov and Kandilov. 2018). We investigate these heterogeneous impacts of local banks on proximate businesses by testing if local banks decrease the demand threshold necessary to support a business for six industries in the retail and manufacturing sectors in the United States. We show evidence to suggest that the influence of local banks on these proximate businesses varies and may depend on the establishment’s firm extent (single-commuting zone versus multi-commuting zone) and the establishment’s industry classification, but not rurality, as previously hypothesized. While antecedents in the literature find suggestive evidence that local banks benefit businesses and increase dynamism, particularly in rural areas, we attempt to disentangle the influence of local banks on rural businesses. Drawing from Central Place Theory (CPT) we hypothesize that local banks lead to lower demand thresholds for rural establishments owned by local firms compared to larger firms. Where, “local” describes establishments belonging to a firm with all branches in a single commuting zone, and “regional” describes establishments belonging to a firm with branches in multiple commuting zones.Footnote 1 After all, the more geographically homogenous lending practices of regional banks may be more attractive to firms looking to expand outside of a single market area (i.e., commuting zone). This distinction in how local banks influence local versus regional businesses is important to better understand the overall impact and role of local banks in regional economies. In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that small locally-owned firms increase per capita income growth, while larger absentee-owned regional firms have the opposite effect, showcasing the potential for our results in regional economic policy development (Goetz and Fleming. 2011). Pursuantly, we explore three retail and three manufacturing industries with strong implications for rural economic development.Footnote 2 This article proceeds by first reviewing extant literature on local banks via a brief review of banking deregulation since 1980, the associated decline in local banking establishments, and empirical findings on the local and regional effects of this decline. Next, section II reviews CPT and its applicability as a potential framework to further understand and test the relationship between local banks and the frequency of local and regional establishments in retail and manufacturing industries. We use restricted federal administrative data to finely delineate impacts of local banks on demand thresholds by rurality, industry, and the ownership structure of establishments. To complete our analysis, we also explore how the same local factors contribute to the frequency of local banks. This two-pronged approach leads to a more complete understanding of regional and local banks’ roles in rural economies. Results indicate that while regional banks lower the demand thresholds of all retail and manufacturing industries, local banks may further lower the demand threshold for some local businesses. Unlike past studies, we find that rurality plays little to no part in the benefits received by local banks, indicating that previous findings may have been muddled by the endogenous higher share of local businesses in rural areas. We conclude with a summary of suggestions and implications. The financial services sector experienced substantial consolidation over the last 40 years. Causes of the consolidation include policy changes, such as the 1994 Riegle‐Neal Interstate Banking Act, but also technological changes to information technologies (Cetorelli and Strahan. 2006; Whaling 1996). Although the number of banking firms declined by about 60% between 1984 and 2009, banking establishments nearly doubled at the local level, replacing many formerly independent community and regional banks that serviced local businesses (Collender and Shaffer 2003, 2009).Footnote 3 In 2015, over half of all branch establishments in the United States were owned by a bank or bank holding company in another state.Footnote 4 Figure 1 emphasizes the scale of this change and how the changes were particularly large in rural areas. Share of local banks (1976–2015) Local bank research branches out in multiple directions. Research began with descriptive articles on bank firm consolidation and bank establishment proliferation over the past 40 years. For large business ventures with many potential financing options, such as publicly traded stock, venture capital/private equity, and loans from large financial corporations, this is typically seen as less worrisome (Erel 2011). In rural communities, however, local businesses are typically smaller and do not attract the attention of large venture capital firms (Mencken and Tolbert 2016). These smaller businesses rely on multiple sources of financing, including personal savings, small business loans from banks, credit lines, and informal loans from friends and family (Craig et al 2007; Craig and Hardee 2007). Moreover, Mencken and Tolbert (2016, 2018b) show that banks are a more relied-upon form of start-up and expansion capital for business owners in non-metropolitan economies, compared to similar businesses in metropolitan economies. While there is evidence that this consolidation has increased access to customers and capital for some, there are potentially significant implications for small businesses started by local entrepreneurs (DeYoung et al. 2008). Indeed, changes in the U.S. financial sector since the 1980s lead some researchers to argue that businesses attempting to start or operate in rural areas are disadvantaged (Flora et al. 2015; Mencken and Tolbert 2018b). Put another way, researchers argue that the loss of independent local banks may lead to a small business credit constraint in non-metropolitan economies. There are currently two main mechanisms through which researchers conceptualize the impacts of the consolidation in the banking sector and the resultant decline local banks: (1) market concentration, and (2) relational lending. Market concentration extends the reach of highly capitalized regional and national financial institutions through, among other things, a proliferation of branch banks. These branches enjoy the security of the larger financial enterprises of which they are parts. In the wake of the 1980s savings and loan crisis, interstate banking was seen as a backstop for localized financial downturns. One important rationale of the 1994 Riegle-Neal congressional act was to promote interstate banking companies. The law spawned a wave of mergers and acquisitions in which independent state banks were bought and converted to branches of regional and national financial institutions. The impacts of market concentration can play out in different ways across the rural/urban divide. In rural areas, there may be only one banking brand and little or no competition for commercial lending. In urban areas, there will typically be a handful of national banking brands competing with regional banking companies. Small businesses have more options where there is more banking competition and larger banks may provide loans to small businesses at better rates because there is less risk (Berger et al. 1998; Erel 2011). These observations and studies lead us to categorize regional and national firms into a single classification described as “regional” to which we compare local firms in our analysis. Relational lending in the financial literature refers to the use of “soft” data for business lending (Mencken and Tolbert 2018b). Loan officers take into account more than financial and business performance information in making a lending decision. Bankers may consider the community reputation and local standing of the borrower. In the social science literature, relational lending is a form of the general concept of social capital activation (Mencken and Tolbert 2016). One’s networks and reputation are aspects of social capital that can be used for acquiring business capital at a bank. In rural communities with a handful of local independent banks, loan applicants can negotiate with their social capital as much or more so than their business record. When local independent banks advertise that “... lending decisions are made right here,” they are essentially saying that they still engage in relational lending and welcome applicants with ample stocks of social capital. In urban areas where branches of national and regional banks dominate the market, relational lending gives way to centralized lending decision-making at headquarters. There still may be competition but, in the absence of relationships with loan applicants, bank officers’ criteria are limited to “hard” data on past and projected business performance. Note that these differing mechanisms/frameworks through which local banks impact regional economies can co-exist. For example, Carpenter et al. (2019) provide evidence consistent with higher social capital in rural areas increasing the impact of the relational lending regionally, while metro areas appear to benefit from market concentration. Carpenter et al. (2019) also show that local banks increase county-level establishment dynamism. That is more local and regional establishment births, but also more establishment deaths. The question of if the total number of establishments changes, remains unanswered, though Rupasingha and Wang (2017) show that small business lending more generally increases small business growth. Such growth may be particularly important for rural areas, given entrepreneurs will require a higher success probability to enter a rural market rather than an urban market (Yu et al. 2011). Collender and Shaffer (2009) similarly find variation across the rural–urban divide in employment growth, though these findings are not consistent across time. Empirical findings also extend beyond direct effects on local businesses, with increases in per capita earnings and income, and reduced poverty and income inequality in rural counties (Mencken and Tolbert 2018a). Further, more generally, there is a broad literature detailing how local or community banks and lending matter for firms such as through startup, growth, and survival and, in aggregate, for rural resilience (Jagtiani and Lemieux 2016; Nguyen and Barth 2020). This broader research highlights the uniqueness of this study and how community banks may be important to the vitality of rural communities. Given this broader literature, examining the demand threshold effects with banks represents a potentially valuable contribution.",

This sector is one of the most innovative and productive in Portugal (Diniz et al. 2015) and has recently experienced a notable growth. From 2010 to 2017, the number of employees increased by 25% with firms employing almost 40,000 workers; besides, production increased by 34%, producing approximately 83 million pairs of shoes in 2018. The gross production value of the sector exceeded 2.054 million euros in 2017, representing an increase of 60% from 2010. The profile of the firm in the footwear industry is a small-sized, young firm and located in one of the two poles in the area surrounding Porto. More specifically, the vast majority are micro and small firms with an average of 26 employees (87% of footwear firms employ fewer than 50 people); in addition, 281 new firms were created in the period 2010–2017 (23% of increase), reaching 1.526 firms. Finally, 80% of the firms are located in two poles: Felgueiras–Guimarães and Santa Maria da Feira–Oliveira de Azeméis–São João da Madeira (see APPICAPS 2018). Thus, location seems to be a relevant decision for entrepreneurs in this industry. Concerning the variables related to the location of firms’ growth in the Portuguese economy, some contributions have analyzed agglomeration and specialization effects (Cesario 2016) or region-specific characteristics (Barbosa and Eiriz 2011).Footnote 1 Differently, our analysis focuses on the cluster of the Portuguese footwear industry [subclass 15201 at the Portuguese Classification of Economic Activities (Rev. 3)]. Ours is a modest attempt to reduce the gap present in the empirical literature concerning the relationship between regional firm density and the growth of firms in a strategic sector for the Portuguese economy. We use linear regression models and a dataset of 896 firms of the Portuguese footwear industry for the period 2013–2017 obtained from the Sistema de Análise de Balanços Ibéricos database. In the light of the depicted location features of the Portuguese footwear industry, a positive external effect of location is expected to spur and contribute to the firms’ growth. Yet, our multivariate analysis finds that location is not a significant variable affecting the growth of the firms for the Portuguese footwear industry, which sharply contrasts findings on location externalities in the literature (Audretsch and Dohse 2007; Harabi 2007; Hoogstra and van Dijk 2004; Liedholm 2002; McPherson 1996; Storey 1994). However, our findings appear to be consistent with empirical results presented by Lee (2018) and Geenhuizen and Reyes-Gonzalez (2007): being located in a cluster, per se, has no positive effect on firm growth. To understand our disparate results on location, we adopted a graphical criterion to separate firms into two groups as the scatter plot location-firm growth presents a U-shape pattern: we take firms surrounded by 200 firms as a threshold. We fit a separate linear regression for these two subsets of data to find that there exist two different patterns for regional firm density: location is negatively correlated with growth for the group of firms surrounded by less than 200 firms and positively correlated for the group surrounded by more than 200 firms. This allows us to propose a suggestive explanation: firms surrounded by few firms have more access to resources and can grow fast, whereas firms within a cluster are benefited from the location externalities (i.e., Marshallian agglomeration externalities). Indeed, the Portuguese footwear industry requires no intensive qualified labor: most workers have a basic education, 90.5% according to ACT (2013). The resource availability versus location externalities trade-off, which can explain the absence of location effects, entails straightforward implications to entrepreneurs wishing to start a new business in this sector. Besides location, our analysis also addresses the effect of other variables on the growth of firms. First, concerning size and growth, our results do not validate Gibrat’s Law (Gibrat 1931); and second, age and growth are significantly and negatively correlated, which implies that young firms grow faster than older ones and supports Jovanovic (1982)’s theoretical results. These results are in line with the empirical literature (for example, Audretsch et al. 2004; Coad et al., 2016, 2018; Coad and Tamvada 2012; Nunes et al. 2013; Oliveira and Fortunato 2006b). The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 contains the theoretical background; Sect. 3 presents the methodology and describes the data and variables; Sect. 4 presents nonparametric and parametric results; Sect. 5 presents concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.",

Their structure is in a constant state of flux. At times it changes quickly. At times, the change is imperceptibly slow. Following the industrial revolution (1760–1840) cities spread out, and in the decades following the end of World War II Alonso style, compact cities leap-frogged out into the suburbs. In the USA, the construction of a massive interstate highway system led to the creation of secondary business districts, edge cities. Today, cities are porous with spatially continuous clusters of built areas of various sizes often, but not always, displaying fractality (Benguigui et al. 2000, 2001a, b, 2004a, b). Ever since Adam Smith economists wondered why some places grow while other places stagnate. Modern economics sought answers by studying the economy as a self-organizing system. The evolving actions of interacting agents, responding to conditions created by their past actions, give rise to innovations and generate economies and diseconomies of scale creating conditions for endogenous growth (Broitman and Czamanski 2020). It was not until the twentieth century that tools created in the physical sciences became available to address the question how particular patterns of actions at a point in time will create new patterns in the next. Until then economists’ inquiries were limited to the examination of consistencies between the actions of individuals and macro-patterns (Chorafakis 2020, Rosser 2014). Assuming that all agents are the same and contrary to reality, economists focused on conditions for equilibrium. Modern contributions view equilibrium as possible, but not imperative, economic condition and study growth and spatial polarization as a far from equilibrium system (Broitman et al. 2020; Broitman and Czamanski 2020). In the short run the spatial evolution of cities can be approximated by linear extrapolations. In the long-run it is the result of self-organizing processes subject to positive and negative feed-back effects. The net impacts on city structures are not easily discernable. The impact of disasters such as the Covid 19 pandemic complicates things further by causing the behavior of agents to change during the evolution, both in the short and in the long run. The current paper is an attempt to sort out the forces responsible for the spatial evolution of cities. In particular, we focus on the COVID 19 natural experiment that changed significantly the demand for various land uses in cities and use it as a prism for studying urban dynamics. The rest of the paper consists of 4 sections. Section 2 presents an overview of our model. A preliminary application of the model is presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we present some results following the COVID 19 experience. Section 5 presents some conclusion and suggestions for future work.",2

However, its rapid growth has also resulted in serious air pollution. For example, suspended particulate matter (PM) and sulfur dioxide (\({{\mathrm{SO}}_{2}}\)) are far above the World Health Organization’s Air Quality Guidelines in most Chinese cities (Chen et al. 2017a, b). Based on air pollution data from 2013 to 2015, Barwick et al. (2018) estimated that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration in China resulted in a 60 billion yuan ($9 billion) increase in annual health spending by the Chinese population.
 The Jinchuan mining area (abbreviated as Jinchuan), which is part of Jinchang city, is located in the northeast of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province. The total area of Jinchuan is 3370 square kilometers, and the total population in 2020 was 314,600. Jinchuan’s economy is dominated by mining and processing of nickel, which have substantially contributed to its local economic development. In particular, 50% of Jinchuan’s working population is employed by the nickel industry. However, these industries have also caused serious environmental issues, especially air pollution. Jinchuan is one of the ten cities in China most seriously affected by air pollution (Ding et al. 2018; Lan 2013; Wei 2008). Suspended particles, SO2, chlorine gas and carbon dioxide are the main health-related pollutants (Huang et al. 2009; Lan 2013; Wen et al. 2018). Many studies have been conducted on the link between air pollution exposure and behavioral responses, notably the trade-off between the cost of averting behavior and the benefits of reducing exposure in a bid to reveal people’s preference for improving air quality. Examples of this literature are on installing air filters indoors (Bresnahan et al. 1997; Ito and Zhang 2020), wearing masks outdoors (Zhang and Mu 2018), adjusting or cancelling outdoor activities (Bresnahan 1997; Neidell 2009; Zivin and Neidell 2009), taking preventive or curing medication or food (Deschenes et al. 2012), migration (Banzhaf and Walsh 2008; Chen et al. 2017a, b), and choosing travel modes (Dirks et al. 2012; Kingham et al. 2013). The objective of this paper is to analyze the responses of the inhabitants of Jinchuan to the health risks related to air pollution in their region and to estimate their preference for air quality improvement in terms of willingness to pay (WTP). To this end, we apply the household production function approach, introduced by Grossman (1972) and Parente et al. (2000), particularly the health-related averting behavior model. Traditionally, the relationship between the costs of averting actions and socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., age and education) is applied to explain averting behavior. However, many researchers have pointed out that sociopsychological factors, particularly knowledge and perception, are also needed for adequate modeling of (averting) behavior (Folmer 2009; Folmer and Johansson-Stenman 2011; Menon et al. 2008; Li and Hu 2018; Tan and Xu 2019).Footnote 1 For example, Folmer (2009) argued that the omission of sociopsychological factors leads to model under-specification and thus to biased estimators of all the model coefficients, if the omitted systematic explanatory variables are correlated with an included explanatory variable and the explanatory variables are mutually correlated - which is virtually always the case in the social sciences, including (environmental) regional science. This paper presents an extension of the household production function model, specifically, the averting behavior model (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2018) extended with sociopsychological factors. The model is called the Perception-based Averting Behavior Model (PABM). The paper furthermore analyzes various types of averting behavior to reduce perceived health risk and presents a framework to estimate the WTP for health risk reduction. Finally, it presents an application of the model to Jinchuan city. The paper is organized as follows Sect 2 outlines the perception-based averting behavior model (PABM). Section 3 briefly summarizes the methodology (structural equations model with latent variables (SEM)) and Sect. 4 describes the survey, data, and empirical results. Section 5 presents the conclusions and policy recommendations.",3

The second section describes the difference between commodities, the focus of neoclassical economics, and relational goods, the focus of the proposed synthesis. The third section illustrates how the proposed synthesis resolves several well-known economic anomalies.

Pinheiro,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent years, a substantial body of research has analyzed the impact of non-government organizations (NGOs) on the living standards of the poor (Macdonald 2016). In that context, several frameworks have been proposed to evaluate the social and economic impact of development projects (Friedmann 1992; Farrington and Lewis 1993; Fowler 1996; Bebbington 1999, 2004; Hoefer 2000; Esquivel et al. 2006; Conley and Udry 2010; Hartmann and Arata 2011; Kú et al. 2013; Marshall and Suárez 2014; Hermans et al. 2017; Dyck and Silvestre 2018). Yet, research on the impact of NGOs on the social structures and innovation capabilities of smallholder farmers in developing countries is still rather limited and mostly qualitative in nature. This is a major shortcoming, considering that around 2 billion people (IFAD 2013) live in smallholder households, many of which rely on NGOs’ local development projects. Here, we show how methods and tools from network science can be used to evaluate the impact of NGOs on the social cohesion and local innovation performance of smallholder farmers. While smallholder farmers usually do not engage in cutting edge global innovation, they do introduce, create, adopt, adapt, and diffuse local innovations. Local innovations are those that (in their essence) are not necessarily new in the global context, but they are new to a particular region and typically require adaptation of the existing knowledge and technologies to the region’s unique conditions (Cassiolato and Lastres 1999). Indeed, innovative activities can be found in local agricultural communities all over the world (e.g., Mytelka 2000, Srinivas and Sutz 2008). Key factors for the diffusion of local innovations (as they are also for global innovation) are both intra-regional learning through local innovation networks as well as access to new technical information through external sources (Bathelt et al. 2004). Arguably, the innovation performance of farmers in small communities is linked with two key forms of social capital: one stems from their ability to establish strong social bonds at local level, that is, within productive organizations or frequent information exchange with other local farmers; and a second is related to their capability to create bridges to external knowledge sources. Yet rural regions in developing countries often face significant constraints, such as lack of regional communication, trust, and access to external knowledge (Durston 1998; Islam and Morgan 2012). In that context, NGOs can play a key role in providing access to external technical knowledge and in promoting local initiatives that foster cooperation and knowledge exchange (Loa 2002; Islam and Morgan 2012). However, NGOs’ activities can also reshape the power and socio-technical structures in local regions to the point where the communities become deeply dependent on their presence. This is problematic, as it goes against the goal of an NGO, which in such cases is to help farmers to help themselves. Methods from network science can help in understanding the social clustering, power structures, information flow, and cohesion of local communities, and thus provide a valuable methodology to evaluate the impact of NGOs on local development. Indeed, early approaches in social network analysis have been applied to study the diffusion of innovation in rural areas (Rogers 1962). Moreover, recent approaches in applied development projects and economics have used social network analysis to map the existing influence and power structures (Schiffer and Hauck 2010). However, social network analysis has rarely been used to study how NGOs impact the local socio-technical and innovation performance of smallholder farmers (Hartmann and Arata 2011; Hartmann 2014; Hermans et al. 2017). The majority of the literature concerning NGOs activities has emphasized conceptual and qualitative research, rather than quantitative evidence (Lecy et al. 2012), particularly with respect to the role of NGOs in social networks formation. A look at most academic works on effectiveness/impact of NGOs shows that authors tend to focus on adding theory, or analytical frameworks, to the research agenda. Data-driven studies that test those frameworks are rare (Lecy et al. 2012). In this article, we employ tools from network science and econometrics to analyze the effects of an NGO’s development project on the social cohesion and innovation of smallholder farmers in an agricultural community in Peru between 2003 and 2018. To that end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 48 fruit and wine farmers on their socioeconomic characteristics, main sources of technical information, and different types of innovation they introduced to their production and distribution processes. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the impact evaluation of NGOs’ local development projects on social capital and innovation of smallholder farmers in rural areas of developing countries. Section 3 introduces methods from network science and survey data on the social capital and innovation performance of fruits and wine farmers in Chaparra, an agricultural valley in southern Peru. Section 4 presents empirical results on the effects of an external NGO’s local development projects on the evolution of the social cohesion, network centrality, and innovation performance of Chaparra’s farmers in the period 2003–2018. The findings show that the NGO had significant effects on the social cohesion and network centrality of the farmers; though, the effect on the innovation performance of the famers also depended on the type and strength of interaction of the farmers with the NGO. Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",
70.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,01 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-020-01005-2,The contribution of social capital on rural livelihoods: Malawi and the Philippines cases,June 2023,Ellen Fitzpatrick,Sedef Akgungor,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The aim of this study is to examine whether communities that received Heifer model of development increased social capital and income and whether the social capital was positively correlation with improved livelihoods. Heifer model of development integrates human capacity building with an asset transfer in communities that fall below their national poverty lines. This model of community development asserts that the transfer of the asset of livestock (physical capital) combined with a set of trainings and ‘sensitizings’ (human capital) is significantly correlated with social capital and contributes to productive capacity among participant households. It is hypothesized that this new productive capacity is a significant factor that has a positive correlation with the household’s net farm income.Footnote 1 In this model of development, we assert that social capital, whose variables are operationalized by social network analysis measures, facilitates the collective action that contributes to economic opportunity especially in an environment of missing markets. If there are incomplete or missing markets, social capital can fill these gaps by providing conduits for information, labor supply and financing through savings groups or cooperatives. Although this link between social capital and increased economic opportunity is important to facilitate endogenous development, there has been limited evidence that intervention groups have deeper social capital and that the deeper social capital contributes to economic opportunity. Social transfer programs specifically asset transfer programs involving livestock have demonstrated a positive correlation between cash or asset transfer and improved well-being (Haushofer and Shapiro 2013; Barrientos 2012; Krishna et al. 2012). This study tests these three links: the intervention to social capital (activity to proximal outcome), intervention to net farm income (activity to distill outcomes) and social capital to net farm income (proximal outcome to distill outcome).Footnote 2 In this paper, the authors are interested in social capital rich networks—groups of people who share social capital. The first case, a dairy development project in Malawi, Heifer Malawi’s Smallholder Dairy Development (MSDD1), examines the impact of the project on social capital formation and improved livelihoods. MSDD1 was implemented in Mchinji district, Mlonyeni traditional authority with joint financial and technical support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Heifer International in 2009. The goal of the project was to enhance the livelihoods among smallholder farmers whose income and access to resources put them at or below the poverty line. The project included an asset transfer in the form of a pregnant dairy cow and training to enhance participants’ capabilities in dairy production and marketing. The asset transfer and training were designed to increase community-based social capital to catalyze collective action in support of dairy-based livelihoods. The project transferred a cow with calf to 130 participants. The household that received the initial asset (original group, OG) was obliged to pass on the offspring from the transfer to another project participant who was ready to receive a calf (Passing on the Gift, POG). This pass-on process and the ability to work collectively to form a ‘milk bulking group’ are illustrative of relational goods, an outcome of increased social capital. Over a three-year period, October 2009–September 2012 a total of 611 households participated in the project.Footnote 3 In this study, we trace the effects of this project on the original 130 participants as this provides the longest time period to assess change. Project participants completed several workshops which included animal and milk product management, women’s savings group formation, cooperative development and project governance. Nineteen community volunteers were trained as Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) and equipped to support other dairy farmers within their communities to manage basic animal health issues. The project supported farmers of Bua Milk Bulking Group, which established a milk collection and chilling center in their community. The project assisted in the acquisition of milk chilling equipment, while the farmers contributed locally available resources and labor to construct the collection and chilling house. The milk bulking group started operations in April 2011 and established a business relationship with Lilongwe Dairy Processors, one of the large-scale dairy processors in Malawi (Heifer International Malawi, Final Report for Malawi Smallholder Dairy Development Project, December 2012). The second case, RICSA, is a similar project including a livestock transfer of swine and a capacity development program of trainings for participants and specialized trainings for community animal veterinary entrepreneurs (CAVE) in Northern Luzon, the Philippines. In this project, Heifer worked closely with the Philippine government through the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DWSD) to target households with income below the poverty line. The DWSD, implemented a Conditional Cash Transfer program (CCT) in the region. The CCT provided essential cash while requiring families to ensure consistent attendance in school for children under 14 and regular visits to health facilities for children and pregnant women. The underlying assumption of this program is that the cash transfer will allow families to invest in the health and education needs of their children and hence break the cycle of poverty. Complementary to the CCT is a Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP). The SLP consists largely of a loan of US$250.00 to families that are CCT participants and have successfully developed a plan to use the loan to increase family income over time. The premise of the SLP is that as families leave the CCT program, this stream of income will allow the families to ensure continued investment in the well-being of the family. The RICSA project was created to be an alternative to the loan of the SLP. The RICSA project was designed to bring together the asset transfer and training similar to the Malawi project to create a robust livestock subsector that includes backward linkages to the inputs of feed and animal health, the production of swine and forward linkages in transportation, wholesale and retail marketing. The project also intended to facilitate a swine producer’s association (cooperative) that would allow for lower prices for swine feed, community-based animal health services and collective bargaining power in the sale of swine. It was expected that the RICSA/SLP families would increase their revenue streams from the sale of swine, swine products and cooperative activities. Like the MSDD1 participants, the RICSA/SLP families participated in training to improve animal management, collective action and local governance of the project. The combination of asset transfers and training was expected to catalyze the development of social, human, financial and natural capital. The development of social capital which would augment reciprocity and trust would occur through the development of women’s self-help and savings groups and the ‘passing on’ of first litter of swine. Increased economic opportunity would occur through the networks of backward and forward linkages stimulated by the project, and the project would create networks of knowledge through both the training of community members and the community animal health worker. The research question for both cases examines whether social capital is significantly augmented by this model for development and, if so, does social capital contribute to participants’ changes in income.",2

Today, the focus of rural development has undergone a transition from just addressing rural problems to exploiting localities. In addition, rural areas have become a place to escape for urbanites who wish to take a break from the current crowd and monotone lifestyles lying at the heart of urban areas. Therefore, the interaction between urban newcomers and rural locals has started to create a great synergy that has the potential to have wide-ranging impacts on rural communities, especially in terms of economic activity by integrating these areas into the global market. Today, both rural communities and the perception of rural areas have changed especially thanks to the digital platforms with which social and economic liaisons are being explored. The interaction between the globalization and localization processes has had a crucial effect on these changes. Here, the question is how global meets local. The idea of a competitive advantage can only be provided with strong local processes, harmony with globalization and localization (Eraydın 2002). The important features for competitiveness are local aspects and local specificities (Capello 2008). In other words, within the globalization process, locality gains importance. Moreover, it is also highlighted that sustaining a competitive advantage necessitates an increase in technological capacity (Eraydın 2002). Nowadays, the global economy concentrates on technologic improvements arising from the service sector in urban areas while changing the current situation of relatively less improved areas, putting pressure on localities. In order to promote rural economic and social welfare, exploiting local resources in the global economy is considered a way to facilitate the expansion of rural networks, allowing a rural economy to remain local while acting global (Ray 1998). Furthermore, like in urban areas, technology should also be integrated in the process of rural activities. On the other hand, rural areas still possess distinct social capital. Considering social capital as a strong feature, rural areas can benefit from the idea of social innovation, which includes “innovative activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting a social need and that are predominantly diffused through organizations whose primary purposes are social” (Mulgan 2006). As a result, in rural areas, it is important to take social capital into consideration as well as technology and local products. Local products vary according to the characteristics and productive activity type of a rural area. One of the most important categories of local resources/products in rural areas is agro-food products (Pacciani et al. 2001), a sector with important potential exploited by local economic actors (entrepreneurs) in their businesses. Since entrepreneurship entails concrete economic profits for the local economy where they are established (Goetz 2013), it is important to understand their system within rural development. Particularly, in today’s world economy, there is a shift towards a service-oriented knowledge economy on the basis of individuals’ creativity to benefit and generate values from accessible information (Salenbacher 2015). This new economic environment offers a milieu where locality gains importance, and development starts from locals/individuals. The change in rural development approaches has brought about new relationships within the agricultural sector. As opposed to the agro-industrial model, the rural development model is based on networks of farmers and farms in a given region (Marsden 2009). The development of such new networks is related to the rise of locally based short food supply chains (Renting et al. 2003). Due to both consumer health concerns about food and producers’ low profits, food network systems have been reconsidered, leading to the emergence of alternative food networks (AFNs). AFNs, a growing trend, are forecasting a switch from an industrialized and conventional food sector to a re-localized farming and food industry (Sonnino and Marsden 2006). They are the response to worries related to the after-effects of conventional food systems (Beckie et al. 2012). Moreover, at first, AFNs were accepted as niches of social innovation based on trust and equality between consumers and producers in addition to providing healthier, more natural and more local food production (Barbera et al. 2014). The emergence of these new networks has gained increasing attention and international policy support on the rural development agenda as well as scientific attention (Dansero and Puttilli 2014). Moreover, an entrepreneur who is an important actor in rural development can make contributions in this new development process. E-commerce entrepreneurs have become the most important drivers of AFNs by combining the knowledge-based economy with online entrepreneurship. The aim of this paper is to understand the role of social networks in e-commerce by analysing entrepreneurial characteristics and the ecosystems of their enterprises through case studies. In addition, the network characteristics and expansion of chosen enterprises are examined under three main subjects: (i) types of relations with rural residents; (ii) relations with suppliers (both producers and logistics); and (iii) the extent of their networks in the e-marketplace. Online entrepreneurs whose businesses are related to rural agricultural products were selected as case study examples. Starting in 2016 and extending into 2018, interviews were conducted with 11 of the 29 selected entrepreneurs. The data are derived from the results of the interviews by the use of visualization tools to map out their entrepreneurial network and ecosystems. This paper begins by highlighting the importance of understanding the rural social network created by rural economic actors. The following section defines the role of these actors in rural development, while the third section reveals the changes that they made to reach the wider market of the global economy. The fourth section provides the data, methodology, analysis and results of this study. The paper concludes with a discussion of prospective studies in the field.",1
70.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,16 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-019-00963-6,Neighbor effects on adoption of conservation practices: cases of grass filter systems and injecting manure,June 2023,Haluk Gedikoglu,Sansel Tandogan,Joseph Parcell,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Adoption of new technologies has been extensively analyzed in the literature (Gedikoglu et al. 2011; Feder et al. 1985; Huffman 1980; Just and Zilberman 1988). Since the seminal study by Griliches (1957), the technology adoption literature has been developed. The literature mostly focused on the adoption of productivity-increasing or profitable technologies, especially during the green revolution (Gedikoglu and McCann 2012). However, increasing concerns about environmental quality have prompted interest in the adoption of conservation practices. Studies that analyzed the adoption of conservation practices used factors similar to those predominantly used for the adoption of profit-oriented technologies (Gedikoglu and McCann 2012; Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). However, previous studies reported that the adoption of conservation practices is not well explained by factors used primarily to analyze the adoption of profit-oriented technologies (Gedikoglu and McCann 2012; Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Hence, different factors might influence the adoption of conservation practices (Gedikoglu and McCann 2012; Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). Profit-oriented technologies provide direct economic return for the cost incurred for the adoption of the new technology (Gedikoglu and McCann 2012). However, adoption of some conservation practices might not provide a direct economic return (Claassen et al. 2014). These practices might be adopted more to conserve the environment or to follow environmental regulations. Not bringing an immediate economic return is one of the major differences between profit-oriented technologies and conservation practices. Another major difference between the two is that conservation practices involve a common resource/property, such as water or air quality (Dockner et al. 2000). Since the actions of farmers impact the state of the common resource, the adoption decision of a farmer is often impacted by the actions of other farmers (Dockner et al. 2000; Cooper and Keim 1996; Rogers 2003). The actions of farmers also impact the well-being of the other farmers directly through the impact on the common resource. Hence, the adoption of conservation practices involves an interaction among farmers (Dockner et al. 2000; Cooper and Keim 1996; Rogers 2003). Previous studies that analyzed technology adoption incorporated the interaction between farmers through learning from neighbors/others, which is defined as social learning (Maertens and Barrett 2012; Bardhan and Udry 1999; Conley and Udry 2010; Foster and Rosenzweig 1995; Munshi 2004; Krishnan and Patnam 2012). Because the adoption of a new technology brings uncertainty, farmers could strategically wait for other farmers to adopt first and then learn from them (Rogers 2003; Prokopy et al. 2008; Maertens and Barrett 2012; Bardhan and Udry 1999; Conley and Udry 2010; Foster and Rosenzweig 1995; Munshi 2004; Krishnan and Patnam 2012). However, for the adoption of conservation practices, besides the learning effect, interaction with neighbors could also reflect the presence of social capital because the actions of neighbors impact the common resource (Prokopy et al. 2008; Robison et al. 2002; Wollni and Andersson 2014). Adoption of a conservation practice to conserve the natural resource will be influential if the farmers who have access to the natural resource adopt the conservation practice jointly or if a cooperative agreement is established among farmers to conserve the natural resource. This situation creates the free rider problem, commonly seen in the provision of common resources: there is an incentive for a farmer not to adopt the conservation practice but rather to benefit from others who adopt that practice. However, the social capital aspect of the neighbor effect might cause a farmer to adopt a conservation practice, thus preventing the free rider problem. Previous studies of various economic issues showed that social capital could prevent the free rider problem. Karlan (2005) analyzed how social capital among group members impacted the repayment of a loan that was given to a group of villagers by a nonprofit village banking organization in Peru. Results of the study showed that social capital was a predictor of the financial behavior of group members. Specifically, the villagers who were trusted by others were less likely to default on a loan and more likely to contribute to savings that benefited the villagers as a group. Karlan (2005) indicated that, in groups where there is social pressure, the default on financial loans could be avoided. Goes et al. (2016) analyzed the effect of the online social network size of individuals on providing online product reviews, which is a public good. Their results showed that as the individuals’ online network sizes grew (which was assumed to be an evidence of an increase in social capital), the individuals provided more and longer reviews. There is a need to further identify the impact of social capital on the adoption of conservation practices to see if it prevents the free rider problem related to the conservation of a common resource (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007; Sneeringer and Pon 2016). Different definitions of social capital exist in the literature, and there is no consensus (Hunecke et al. 2017; Robison et al. 2002; van Rijn et al. 2012). Putnam (1993) defines social capital as the trust, norms, and social networks that could change an economic outcome. On the other hand, according to Robison et al. (2012), social capital reflects the sympathy or a sense of obligation that one person or a group of persons feels toward another person or a group of persons, which influences economic choices of people. Robison et al. (2002) provides a review of the definitions of social capital in the literature and highlights that social capital resides where there is social interaction. Social interaction, including group membership, is needed for social capital to exist, but it does not guarantee that there will be social capital (Robison et al. 2002). Rather, sympathy, or a sense of obligation toward each other, or norms and/or trust within the social relationship results in cooperation among people to achieve a desired outcome (Robison et al. 2002; Hunecke et al. 2017; van Rijn et al. 2012). Interaction with a neighbor could reflect trust and/or norms in the social relationship between the farmer and the neighbor or the sympathy and/or the sense of obligation toward each other, which serves as social capital. Hence, whether the definition of Putnam (1993) or Robison et al. (2012) is adopted, the relationship with a neighbor could influence the economic decision of a farmer in ways beyond merely providing an information exchange. This influence on the economic decision of the farmer could vary based on the strength of the relationship that the farmer has with his or her neighbor (Robison et al. 2002). Knowing different ways neighbors impact the technology adoption decision of farmers could benefit policymakers and extension programs to promote the adoption of conservation practices. Funds could be allocated in the beginning of a program to generate social capital in a region, instead of focusing on individual farmers to promote a conservation practice that requires farmers to act cooperatively. Specifically, the neighbor effect through social capital could be used to accomplish joint adoption of a conservation practice by farmers in a region. As with the varying definitions of social capital, there is no consensus in the literature on how to measure social capital. In the current study, social capital was measured by individual interaction with a specific neighbor, instead of measuring social capital through group membership or as membership in networks (Putnam 1993; Bowles and Gintis 2002). As indicated by Robison et al. (2002), social capital resides within relationships. However, being a network member or part of a group may not necessarily reflect the fact that there is social capital within a specific network or group (Robison et al. 2002; Hunecke et al. 2017; Sato 2013). Hence, the disadvantage of measuring social capital through network or group membership is that there may not be social capital within the network or group related to the topic in question (Hunecke et al. 2017; Sato 2013). For example, in the case of the current study, a network or a cooperative membership of farmers may not reflect norms or sympathy related to the use of a water resource, so measuring social capital in this way would be misleading. However, having an interaction with a neighbor could reflect norms or sympathy toward each other related to the use of a common resource and could influence the economic decision of a farmer related to managing a common resource. In the literature review below, we provide further information about how previous studies measured social capital. Overall, the objective of this paper is to analyze the social aspect of the adoption of conservation practices. We specifically analyzed the neighbor effect on the adoption of two nutrient management practices: use of grass filter systems and injecting manure into soil. By doing so, we aim to provide a better understanding of (1) how the neighbor effect impacts the adoption of conservation practices and (2) about the relative importance of this effect in comparison to other effects identified in the literature. The results of the current study will provide insights to create more efficient policies and educational programs to promote the adoption of conservation practices (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007; Swinton 2000; Sneeringer and Pon 2016). To our knowledge, this is the first study that seeks to analyze the different ways the neighbor effect affects the adoption of conservation practices. We contribute both to the technology adoption literature and the social capital literature. The contribution of the current study to the technology adoption literature is to disentangle the neighbor effect and analyze the social capital aspect of the neighbor effect on the adoption of conservation practices. We demonstrate how social capital can be used to promote the adoption of conservation practices and prevent the free rider problem related to the conservation of a common resource. The current study also contributes to the literature on social capital by providing a situation where social capital is measured by an individual’s interaction with a specific neighbor instead of being measured through group membership or as members of social networks.",4

They impact the different actors socially, economically and in some cases lead to strong protestations, violence, and even to the death of some local actors. Those conflicts are rarely resolved and just settled by public policy, mainly through its enforcement (Yusran et al. 2017). They vary in types and expressions and are mainly based on violation of livelihood, land acquisition and property rights and ignorance of population needs and wills. Informal settings and lack of legal rights further sparks the conflicts (Lombard 2016). Moreover, historical settlements and inequalities among the local people on the basis of these settlements make land acquisition and compensation issues more complicated not only between local people and Government but also among the local population (Sabir et al. 2017). Dam construction is known as a major cause of infrastructure conflict (Magsi and Torre 2015; Moran 2004; Bui et al. 2013). Land acquisition, displacement and resettlement, livelihood and compensations are core issues during dam construction projects, causing negative social impacts, tensions and conflicts (Oppio et al. 2015; Sun 2013; Williams and Porter 2006). Around the world several people are displaced (Scudder 2005; World Commission on Dams 2000), which led to landlessness, unemployment and social disorder (Brown et al. 2009). Compensation issues are significant as they fail to uphold the living standard of local people mainly due to late or lower compensation (Magsi and Torre 2014; Awasthi 2014; Li et al. 2015), high resettlement cost and different expectations and demands of local people. Land-use planning decisions have potential of generating conflicts due to negative impacts on environment and community (Kaya and Erol 2016). The studies show that proper compensations of the damages caused depend upon local people’s awareness to use this amount properly, as there are significant chances of losing that compensation amount in different ways (Sabir et al. 2017). Employment opportunities for local people and lack of resettlement plans are an important issue to consider during construction of infrastructure projects. It is always hard to keep the original profession which in combination with inappropriate employment opportunities by ignoring actual needs of people lead to poor living standard. (Moran 2004). Landlessness, delayed and out of culture resettlement and in some cases migration of affected people to developed areas create tensions and conflicts among society and likely to raise crime rate. Given the importance of the factors discussed so far in infrastructure projects, the importance of social capital cannot be ignored. On the one hand, personal linkages of local people, relations between various social groups, local and religious values and norms come into play when economic and social benefits are at stake due to such projects. On the other hand, lack of proper management of these issues and involvement of local population while planning the project could result into violent conflicts. Moreover, most of the times, rural and tribal areas are selected for such projects where historical settlements become a big source of conflict among different groups based on these settlements. Pakistan is a water stressed country with continuously diminishing availability of water for irrigation. Under such circumstances government is focusing on dam and water reservoir projects and launched big projects during the last 15 years. Diamer Bhasha dam project is one of the steps taken by the Government which could prove a great milestone for the economy in bringing and retaining water in the country. But along with its benefits, there are some heavy social and economic costs to local society. The goal of this article is to examine the loopholes in different phases/activities of the project of Diamer Bhasha Dam and the interactions and conflicts among different stakeholders. The research is mainly based on the study of national and regional dailies and experts and stakeholders on-field interviews. It includes different project activities, their impacts on the society, relationships among different stakeholders and conflicts between them. Our investigations allow us to go deep into the root causes of these conflicts by highlighting the poor planning and governance related to resettlement, livelihood opportunities, Government’s provisions and mistrust of locals due to ignoring them in the project activities. We also enter into the various manifestations of weakness or very localized character of social capital and their impact on the delated setting of the infrastructure. The structure of the article includes description of case study and area profile and discussion about the main local conflicts in the second part of the article. Part 3 includes methodology of collection of data (also highlighted in the Annex) mainly based on daily press releases and on-field interviews. Part 4 presents the results and highlights the current issues related to the project and the main conflicts between different actors, be there local stakeholders or public authorities. Finally, the article provides policy measures and recommendations in the form of capacity building of affected people in different areas, more developmental projects in local area and public participation in different project activities.",3
70.0,3.0,The Annals of Regional Science,27 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-022-01112-2,The dark side of social capital: a contextual perspective,June 2023,Tüzin Baycan,Özge Öner,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Social relationships have been studied for a long time within the field of sociology (Durkheim 1897; Tönnies 2011). However, it was the (re)introduction of the concept social capital by Bourdieu (1986) and Coleman (1988), and the subsequent studies by Putnam on the subject (1993; 2000), which brought about increased attention. Social capital became a frequently addressed factor in various types of literature such as entrepreneurship, institutional economics, labor economics, education, public health. The majority of the studies describe social capital as value (economic or social; for the individual and/or the group) that stems from resources made available through social relationships or access to social networks (Coleman, 1990; Granovetter 1992). Social capital has mainly been synthesised into three dimensions: cognitive, relational, and structural (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). The cognitive dimension stands for shared meaning and understanding between actors; the relational dimension represents trust, friendship, respect, and reciprocity developed through previous interactions, and the structural dimension refers to patterns of relationships between actors (Villenaa et al. 2011). The importance of social capital for economic performance and development is associated with a varied list of actions, from political participation to civil society involvement. The power of social capital to enable individuals and communities of different types to get engaged in cooperative and high-trust networks is undeniable. This aspect of social capital is especially crucial for local development, as the high-trust, and cooperative networks act a reducing factor for transaction costs, mitigating regional and urban–rural disparities, in which a lack of material resources is compensated for with more immaterial and value-based cultural assets. Economies with greater social capital are argued to be more prosperous and to enjoy fast growth (Knack and Keefer 1997). High levels of interpersonal trust in thick social capital geographies are argued to allow communities to perform notably better in providing investment possibilities despite the lack of proper financial institutes, and to boost innovation and economic activities in general (Sack 1997; Knack and Keefer 1997). Social capital is also embedded in space, which brings about a wide range of desirable outcomes related to entrepreneurial milieux at varying aggregates of geography. For example, both conceptual discussions and empirical evidence for the strong link between local social capital and entrepreneurship are available in the previous literature (Westlund and Bolton 2003; Scott 2006; Andersson and Larsson, 2016). In fact, the advantages that are enjoyed by individual actors due to their connection to such social organizations and groups are addressed by a significant body of literature.
 While emphasizing the ‘bright side’ of social capital, the existing literature pays disproportionately little attention to the possible detrimental effects associated with certain aspects of social capital. It may not be reasonable to establish a dichotomy where social capital is labeled in a binary fashion as good or bad. However, there is a need to address how social capital manifests itself in highly context-dependent ways. Against this background, this paper aims at reviewing the neglected ‘dark side’ of social capital and its potential detrimental aspects to highlight the contextual nature of social capital by way of examples from different geographies. This paper is by no means a complete review of the literature on social capital, but a humble attempt at highlighting the positive bias in its treatment in the literature. We focus on two aspects in particular. First, we address why it is essential to take the contextual nature of the social capital into account while investigating its implications for a variety of social and economic outcomes. Second, we are explicit in asserting the importance of geography in determining the context, as it is a necessary dimension that dictates to what extent social capital may be beneficial or detrimental for individuals. We also highlight three spatial considerations for the contextual nature of social capital and fairer treatment of the concept in a spatial context. These are: (1) the importance of the spatial scale at which social capital is studied; (2) the specific locality within the urban–rural continuum where social capital is considered; and (3) finally, path dependencies and the relevance of local social capital for positive and negative lock-in effects. Section 2 of this paper addresses the conceptualisation of social capital and juxtaposes good and bad social capital with reference to the relevant literature. Section 3 offers a taxonomy of the dark side of social capital. Section 4 focuses on the spatial considerations to mitigate bias, and Sect. 5 concludes.",4
