*",December 2012,Eric V Edmonds,Maheshwor Shrestha,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Labor laws and regulation are the primary instruments used by many countries to combat child labor. The last 15 years has seen an enormous surge in these laws as international pressure has encouraged low income countries to sign international conventions related to the prohibition of child labor and to pass labor laws consistent with the principals of those conventions. Most countries now have laws in place that prohibit the economic activity of children below age 12 and regulate employment through age 17. This paper considers the impact of laws that restrict the minimum age of employment on child labor and schooling. Such laws are principally directed at paid employment outside of the family. When enforced, they alter the age distribution and location of child employment. An upper bound on the importance of these laws in influencing the prevalence of child labor would attribute all of the age variation in work outside of the household to these laws. Of course, there are many reasons other than regulation that would lead time allocation to vary with age. Even so, using data from 59 countries included in rounds 2 and 3 of UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, we observe that age accounts for little of the variation in paid employment outside of the home, schooling, or idleness. 1For example, age explains less than 0.5 percent of the variation in paid employment in the 29 African countries examined herein. The largest share of the variation in paid employment explained by age in Africa is 1.6 percent in Madagascar, where compulsory schooling and minimum age of employment regulations relax at the same age. In contrast, household characteristics such as income and parental background account for 67 percent of the variation in paid employment in our African data and 63 percent across all countries. These findings are consistent with the literature from high income countries that document an impact of minimum age of employment regulation and compulsory schooling laws on education but find the impact of these law changes to be modest compared to the secular trends (Moehling 1999, Lleras-Muney 2002, Goldin and Katz 2011). Age may account for little of the variation in paid employment, but there is still scope for minimum age of employment regulation to influence time allocation. To examine this, we look for changes in time allocation at the minimum age of employment in each of the 59 countries separately and pooled. Our econometric approach is to compare the observed prevalence of paid employment at the minimum age of employment to what would be predicted based on an age trend estimated on the regulated (younger) ages. Our estimates of the impact of minimum age regulation are, in effect, estimates of the impact on paid employment of extending current minimum age regulations by one additional year, holding all prices fixed. Of course, this design does not inform the counterfactual of what employment would be in the absence of minimum age laws altogether. In the pooled and weighted data from all 59 countries representing 158 million children, we find that paid employment increases by a statistically insignificant 0.7 percentage points, or 11 percent, at the minimum age of employment. When we look at each country separately as well as at all the different measures of time allocation available in our data, we are plagued by the multiple hypothesis problem and type I errors. We rely on economic theory to assess whether statistically significant changes stem from minimum age regulation. In the presence of competitive labor markets and working capital within the household, we show that binding minimum age of employment regulations shift child work to the family farm or business but have no effect on schooling. Our argument is based on three assumptions. First, child and adult labor are perfect substitutes subject to a productivity shifter (“the substitution axiom” in Basu and Van 1998). Second, the child’s household can freely substitute adult and child labor between productive tasks inside the household, i.e. “non-saturation.” Third, adult labor can move freely between the household and the labor market, i.e. “competitive adult labor markets.” According to this theory, the data will be consistent with binding minimum age of employment regulation when we observe increases in paid employment, decreases in work inside the household, and no change in schooling or idleness at the minimum age of employment. In the data, we observe increases in paid employment at the minimum age only in 4 of the 59 countries. We do not observe a significant or substantive decline in work inside the family at the minimum age in any of the countries. Hence, we do not observe evidence consistent with binding minimum age of employment regulation in a single country. The data are consistent with increases in household based activities when paid employment increases in general. Some countries have labor laws that allow light work before the minimum age of employment, and there is one country, Trinidad and Tobago, where the data are consistent with binding light work regulations. Compulsory schooling regulation, which co-exists with minimum age regulation in many countries, presents both an econometric and interpretive problem in our results. When both regulations relax at the same time, we will not be able to attribute the changes in child time allocation to one particular regulation. On the other hand, if compulsory schooling law relaxes at a younger age than the minimum age of employment, then it creates a distortion in the age profile of child time allocation. This is problematic as we use age trends in child time allocation to estimate the counterfactual allocation at the minimum age of employment. We find evidence consistent with binding compulsory schooling regulations in one country, Burundi, where the law may interfere with our ability to infer whether minimum age regulations bind. There are 17 countries in our data where the minimum age of employment is the same as the age at which schooling is no longer compulsory. In four of these countries we observe increases in paid employment at the minimum age but also observe increases in household based employment (inconsistent with binding minimum age of employment regulation). It is possible that these findings are driven by a combination of minimum age of employment regulation and compulsory schooling laws (although the change in schooling is not significant in any of the four). In fact, we find that the changes in paid employment are 9 times larger in magnitude in the pooled data in the selected group of countries where minimum age of employment and compulsory schooling regulations coincide compared to countries where schooling is not compulsory at the minimum age of employment. Hence, while overall, we find little to suggest a role for minimum age of employment regulation, as enforced, in combating child labor, there may be some benefit to coordinating employment and schooling regulation. That said, given the importance of household-level, child-invariant characteristics in child labor, it is not obvious that age-based regulation, as currently implemented and enforced, merits its current place at the center of anti-child labor policy. In the next section of the paper, we present an overview of minimum age of employment regulation in our data. Section II considers how binding minimum age of employment regulation influences time allocation. Section III describes our empirical approach to measure the impact of minimum age regulation and the data we use. Section IV presents our findings. Section V concludes. Minimum age of employment regulations have existed in many high income countries since the late nineteenth century, and a series of international, industry specific minimum age of employment conventions were passed in the 1920s and 30s. The minimum age regulations studied herein have been influenced by two more recent international conventions. ILO Convention 138 on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment was passed on June 26, 1973 and has been ratified by 161 countries at the time of writing. A majority of ratifying countries had done so subsequent to 1996. While there is considerable nuance in C138, three broad ideas inC138 are especially important in our discussion. 2 First, C138 emphasizes that countries should raise the minimum age of admission to employment to no less than 15.Countries that are “insufficiently developed” may specify a transitional minimum age of employment of 14. Second, it distinguishes between employment and light work, defining neither. Light work is codified on a national basis, but in principal it is work that does not conflict with school attendance and is not harmful to child health. Light work may be permissible from age 13. Third, it explicitly excludes “family and small-scale holdings producing for local consumption and not regularly employing hired workers” (article 5 section 3) from the provisions of the convention. ILO Convention 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor was passed on June 17, 1999 and has been ratified by 174 countries at the time of writing. 3C182 defines a child as a person under 18 and proposes restrictions on certain categories of employment until age 18.It differentiates between unconditional worst forms of child labor from which children should be prohibited regardless of circumstance (includes all forms of modern slavery, prostitution and pornography, illicit activities and drug trade, and armed conflict) and hazardous child labor that national laws must define. This paper examines the impact of minimum age of employment laws in all 59 countries with publicly available time allocation data from the second and third rounds of UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). 4Data collection instructions and survey questions are nearly uniform across each MICS country allowing for cross-country comparisons. Round 2 of MICS occurred in 2000/01. Round 3 occurred 05/06.In the public use data, there are 28 African countries, 14 from Europe and Central Asia, 7 from East Asia and the Pacific, 6 from Latin American and the Caribbean, 3 from Middle East and North Africa, and 1 from South Asia. Nineteen countries have data in both MICS 2 and 3.The remaining40 countries only have surveys in 1 of the 2 rounds. In reviewing the minimum age of employment regulation in these MICS2 and MICS3 countries, their legislation generally looked like a combination of these principles from the two conventions. Appendix One of Edmonds and Shrestha (2012) contains a detailed description of laws in each country considered herein. Most countries have some form of light work allowable at some age under 14, a general easing of restrictions on most forms of employment around 14 of 15, and continued regulation on certain types of work until age 18. We define the minimum age of employment as the youngest age at which it is legal to pay a child to work full time outside the home (during the day, limited hours). We define the light work age as the youngest age at which a child may work for limited hours during the day in traditional (a common word) or family based activities. Table 1 summarizes the regulation for light work and non-hazardous work for the countries considered in this study. When countries appear in both MICS2 and MICS3, they are listed once if minimum age regulations did not change substantively between rounds, and they are listed twice if their regulations changed. We report the minimum age of employment regulations in place at the time of the survey. Of the countries surveyed in both MICS2 and MICS3, only Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago have changed the basic minimum age of employment for non-hazardous work. Fourteen is the modal minimum age of employment. Only Somalia does not appear to have any non-hazardous work regulation in place at the time of MICS3.Nineteen countries distinguish between light work and non-hazardous work, so the two ages are the same for a majority of the countries. Many countries contain exceptions from regulations for apprentices and work done in school, and we have coded the minimum ages in the table excluding apprenticeship regulation and allowances of work done in school. An important issue that will arise in assessing the impact of the minimum age of employment regulation is whether the laws co-move with compulsory schooling regulation or natural school transition points.C138 stipulates that compulsory schooling laws should define the lower bound on minimum age of employment regulation if such laws require schooling beyond age 14. The last column of Table 1 contains the age at which schooling is no longer compulsory (or NA if schooling is not compulsory). Compulsory schooling regulations are sometimes based on grade completion, in which case we have translated that grade to an age using the rates of school completion reported by UNESCO (see the appendix). These imputed compulsory schooling ages are marked with an asterisk. Four countries do not have any compulsory schooling regulation. Sixteen of the 59 countries have aligned their compulsory schooling laws with their minimum age of employment laws. The next section considers how these minimum age of employment regulations and compulsory schooling laws impact time allocation. C138 explicitly excludes work inside the family from minimum age of employment regulation. Many countries have regulations that cover work inside the home, but even when it is law, few countries (high or low income) discuss enforcement of labor regulation inside the family. Hence, we treat enforced minimum age of employment regulation as affecting the availability of employment outside of the household. We begin with an unconstrained (separable) farm household model as a benchmark. We add binding constraints on employment outside of the home in section B.A challenge in our empirical work below is disentangling the effects of minimum age of employment regulation from compulsory schooling laws. We consider how the two child time allocation related laws differ in their effects in section C. We begin with a standard separable farm household model (e.g. Benjamin 1992) and add children and child labor. 5We adopt two modeling simplifications standard in the child labor literature (e.g. Basu and Van 1998). A family consists of one child and one adult. Adults and children are perfect substitutes in production subject to a productivity shifter. A child is equivalent to a adults, where a<1. This is known as the substitution axiom. We begin with the unrestricted case of perfectly competitive labor markets where adults and children can freely sell their labor in the open labor market. Adult labor receives a wage w. Children then receive the wage aw. Preferences are defined over the family's standard of living s, the child's education e, and the adult’s and the child's leisure consumption, {lA, lC} respectively, with the utility representation: Returns to education are understood to be part of the agent’s utility from education. Education costs p per unit. Total expenditures on education and the standard of living (price=1) come from net income from the family business and labor income: where {L

F(-) is the household’s production function (expressed in the same units as s) and exhibits a positive, diminishing marginal product. For economy, we have suppressed other inputs in the production function. Adult and child employment in the labor market are defined as {L

Child leisure consumption and thus schooling is chosen so that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and standard of living depends on the child's wage (aw): and the allocation of child time between leisure and schooling depends on the relative cost of schooling, which is: Household demand functions for education and leisure then depend on child wages, the price of schooling and endowment incomes: where

 We assume minimum age of employment laws regulate child employment outside of the household. Consider a country with binding minimum age of employment laws that reduce child employment outside the household. Binding minimum age regulation does not affect the total amount the child works or the child's leisure consumption and schooling under the assumption of non-saturation. That is, so long as families have productive opportunities for labor inside the household, binding minimum age regulations change the location of work but not the amount of work. To see that binding minimum age regulation induces substitution between activities, suppose that the binding constraint on work outside of the household adds the restriction of L
M
C = 0 to (3). This has no effect on the opportunity cost of child leisure in the household so long as there is some adult (hired in or own) labor in the family enterprise. 6The key reason why minimum age restrictions do not impact schooling or work probabilities (only type of work) is that households are free to buy and sell other forms of labor. Faced with additional child labor in the family business, the household reduces its use of hired in and adult labor until the value of adult equivalent labor's marginal product equals the market wage. The value of adult equivalent labor in the family business will still be equal to the market wage. Hence, the value of the child's marginal product of labor is still aw. This produces the same marginal rate of substitution between leisure and standard of living as in equation (7). It is possible that constraining all child labor to the family business reduces productivity in the family business to below the market wage and no adults would participate. We call this the “saturation” case. It is unclear how schooling and leisure consumption should change when binding constraints on paid employment induce saturation. Child productivity in the family enterprise is below what it was in the unconstrained case (aF ' < aw).Household income declines. The opportunity cost of time in leisure is the agent’s value of the child’s productivity in the farm

, and whether it is above or below the opportunity cost of time in leisure in the unconstrained case depends on the curvature in preferences for s. However, we should see a rise in household-based economic activity and specialization of adult employment towards work outside the home with saturation. We are skeptical about the relevance of saturation for our analysis. What keeps the household from starting multiple businesses if the marginal product of labor in one is below market? Banerjee and Duflo (2007) document the prevalence of multiple enterprises within non-farm households, and the diversity of activities within farm households is broadly understood. We interpret this lack of specialization as being consistent with our hypothesis that even poor households can create multiple enterprises rather than face saturation in within-household labor supply. Binding compulsory schooling laws may be de facto or de jure. De facto compulsory schooling laws occur when strong norms exist within a society requiring students to attend school through a certain level (completing primary for example). De jure compulsory schooling laws entail legislation that require students to complete a certain level of school or continue in school through a certain age. Binding compulsory schooling laws work differently than minimum age of employment laws. Minimum age of employment regulation restricts one type of job, inducing substitution to other types of work. Binding compulsory schooling laws put a lower bound on time in education and hence induce a decline in time to be allocated among other activities. To model this binding constraint, we fix e at some level k. The assumption that k is binding implies that education increases. Absent binding constraints on employment outside the home, this binding compulsory schooling law reduces endowment income by (p+aw)*k. The coerced additional expenditure on schooling is (p+aw)*(k-e*) where e* is the solution to the unconstrained problem from section A. The reduction in endowment income should reduce leisure and induce a substitution towards more work. It is possible that the decline in endowment time is sufficiently large such that there is less time available to work: L

C * + L

C * > EC − k where L
t
C * is the optimal time devoted to labor type t ∈ {M, H} in the unconstrained problem of Section A. In this case, work also declines with compulsory schooling. Because of the substitutability of different types of labor (child, adult, outside), there is no clear prediction about the incidence of this decline in work across different locations. In sum, binding constraints on the minimum age of employment decrease paid employment outside the home. They have no effect on schooling or labor force participation rates except under saturation. Binding compulsory schooling laws increase education yet have an ambiguous effect on work. They reduce income that can be consumed as living standards by forcing school expenditures and decreasing the time available for work. The reduced income increases demand for children to work, but they may bind such that the desired amount of work absent the constraint is not feasible under the compulsory schooling law. We assume that absent regulation, age trends in time allocation tend to be smooth. 7Minimum age regulations relax at certain ages. Hence, a natural empirical design is to test for breaks in age trends in time allocation at the ages where such regulations are relaxed. Perfectly enforced laws imply no paid employment outside of the home until laws are relaxed and some age trend in participation after employment is permitted. Perfect enforcement does not exist, and we focus our test on the weaker case of whether measurable changes in time allocation appear when minimum age of employment regulation is relaxed. Our empirical approach is to fit a polynomial to model the age trends when restrictions are in place. We use that polynomial to predict the level of various time allocation measures if the age trend had continued. We then compare this predicted level of the dependent variable under the constrained age trend to the actual level observed in the first year that the restriction is eased. This approach is different than a more standard two-sided design, because we do not observe time allocation above age 14 for most countries in the MICS data. Appendix 2 of Edmonds and Shrestha (2012) compares our one-sided results to a more standard two-sided design for the sub-set of countries where the age range of the data make it feasible to use a two-sided estimator. Specifically, let y
ic
 represent the outcome of interest for child i in country c. Define the cut age as the age where a minimum age of employment law relaxes. Below the cut age, the parametric assumption on the relationship between y
ic
 and age A
i
 under the constraint is simply: where π
c
(A

) is a polynomial in age. Age is transformed as a deviation from the cut age so that the interpretation of the constant is the estimate of the value of outcome y at the cut age absent the easing of the restriction on minimum age of employment (10) is only estimated on the sample below the cut age, and the estimate of β0c is compared with the sample estimate of y at the cut age,

cut
c and its standard error can be obtained collapsing the data to country-age cells and regressing outcome y on a polynomial in age (transformed so that age 0 is the cut age) and an indicator for the cut age using weighted least squares where the weight is the country population in that age cell. D
cut
c is the coefficient on the cut age indicator. A similar empirical approach (albeit two-sided) is used by Oreopoulos (2006). There is, of course, the issue of what order polynomial to fit to the pre-cut age trends in (10).Parametric RD approaches such as the one employed here are sensitive to the choice of specification. We opt for a data driven approach for the choice of the functional form of the polynomial using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) employed in Black et al. (2007) and discussed in Lee and Lemiuex (2011). Specifically for each country c and each outcome variable y separately we pick the order of the polynomial to minimize: AIC

y
c is the mean squared error of the regression of outcome y on a polynomial of order p for country c estimated on the country-level age-cell data from below the cut age. Nc is the number of observations in the weighted dataset. Given that we only observe ages in years, and we work on the age-cell level, our approach is intrinsically parametric. One substantive issue in this approach is that we are estimating the impact of extending regulation by one additional year under the assumption that there is a smooth trend in the age pattern of time allocation before regulation is relaxed. Transition points in schooling naturally complicate this assumption. As a robustness check, we have estimated the impact of relaxing minimum age of employment regulations using only data from after the age primary school is usually completed. This restriction to the data limits the number of countries we can consider, but in those countries, we found in our basic results that age explains little variation in time allocation and that there is no statistically significant evidence consistent with binding minimum age of employment (although estimates are extremely imprecise when the data is restricted).The smooth age trends assumption is also complicated by other regulations. For example, if compulsory schooling relaxes before the minimum age and compulsory schooling regulation is binding, then the assumption of smooth age trends in estimating the impact of easing minimum age regulation would be incorrect. Likewise, if minimum age regulations bind and relax before compulsory schooling regulations are relaxed, then the assumption of smooth age trends in estimating the impact of easing compulsory schooling would be incorrect. We discuss the salience of these potential econometric problems caused by off-setting regulations in specific country contexts below. One important advantage of the MICS data for this type of work is that the time allocation module is nearly uniform across countries and between rounds. Thus, while the laws that we are evaluating differ from country to country, the basic measures of time allocation do not. Of course, even though the original questionnaires were largely identical, local understanding of the questions can differ. The standard MICS questionnaire used in almost all countries contains 7questions in the child labor module. The reference period is defined as “the last week” for all questions. Questions are directed towards the mother or caretaker of all children age 5 through 14 although several countries extend the age range to 17. We choose not to use the data for children 5-7 in our analysis. Participation in paid employment is rare in children below 8, and heterogeneity in school starting ages creates conceptual difficulties with the younger children. Pooled together, the data represent 158 million children 8-14. The questionnaire measures two types of non-household employment. We define paid employment as a positive answer to the question of whether the child did any kind of work for pay for someone who is not a member of the surveyed household. While “work” is not defined, the questionnaire stipulates that pay may be for cash or in kind. Unpaid, non-household employment is defined as working in any kind of work over the past week for someone who is not a member of the household without pay. The questionnaire does not allow the respondent to work in both paid and unpaid non-household employment. It asks for total hours in the last week in the two types of non-household employment, and it explicitly instructs respondents to combine hours across all non-household jobs. The questionnaire collects information about household based activities as well. It includes questions about participation and hours in unpaid household services in the last week. It lists “household chores such as shopping, collecting firewood, cleaning, fetching water, or caring for children” as examples of these unpaid household services. The questionnaire also asks about participation and hours in the last week in “other family work,” giving work in “the farm or in a business or selling goods in the street” as examples. We label this category “household based economic activity.” Several aggregates will be considered in this discussion. Unpaid economic activity includes household based economic activity and unpaid, non-household employment. Economic activity combines unpaid economic activity with paid employment. Work combines economic activity with unpaid household services. Household based economic activity and services combines’ household based economic activity with unpaid household services. Schooling data is also collected in a consistent manner across countries in each round, but the questionnaire changes slightly but substantively between round 2 and round 3. Both rounds asked whether the child attends school during a reference year and both collect information on number of days attended in the last week. Unlike the time allocation questions where the last week is poorly defined, the school attendance question asks explicitly references “last (day of the week).” This should be how the enumerators implement “last week” in the child labor module as well, but the questionnaire for schooling is more explicit in this regard. There are two other important differences between rounds. First, the age range for school attendance data changes. Schooling attendance is collected for all children age 5-17 in MICS2 and 5-24 in MICS3.Second, MICS 3 is more specific about the reference school year for the attendance question. Round 2 asks about the current school year. Round 3 explicitly identifies the reference year. This could be substantive during interim periods when it is unclear whether the current year would reference the year about to start or the year recently completed (enumerators should have made this clear). Idle children are children that neither work (in economic activity or unpaid household services) nor attend school. We suspect measurement error is an important component of idle status. Table 2 contains time allocation summary statistics for the data used in this study. Column 1 pools all the data available in the MICS data. Column 2 contains summary statistics for the pooled MICS2 data. Column 3 contains summary statistics for the pooled MICS3 data. Column 4 bifurcates the pooled MICS rounds into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other geographic regions. The data represent 156 million children, 72 million of whom are in SSA. Three percent of children work in paid employment. Twenty-six percent are engaged in unpaid economic activity. Twenty-eight percent are economically active. Seventy-five percent are engaged in unpaid household services. Seventy-eight percent are in household based activities (combining unpaid household services with household based unpaid economic activity). Eighty percent are engaged in some kind of work. Eighty-two percent attend school, and 4 percent are idle, neither working nor attending school. All work measures are lower and schooling is higher in MICS3 compared to MICS2. Working children are more prevalent in the SSA countries with unpaid economic activity standing out as a substantive difference. The prevalence of unpaid economic activity is more than double in SSA compared to non-SSA countries. Summary statistics for time allocation by country for children 8-14 are in Edmonds and Shrestha (2012). Figure 1 pools the data from each country (combining MICS data when applicable) and plots participation rates by country. In our data, paid employment is most prevalent in Togo and least prevalent in Kazakhstan.

 Enforced minimum age and compulsory school laws change the age distribution of activities. We begin with the question: how important is age in time allocation? Time allocation varies with age for reasons other than regulation. Physical, mental, and emotional capacities for different types of work vary with human development. While there is ample scope for age to be an important determinant of time allocation even when minimum age regulations are completely unenforced, age appears to have a minor, often negligible, influence on time allocation. On average, age can account for 0.7 percent of the variation paid employment. The lack of explanatory power for age contrasts sharply with other influences that vary at the household, not child level. In African MICS countries, age accounts for 0.5 percent of the variation in participation in paid employment (1.1 percent in non-African MICS countries).In contrast, household-level characteristics can account for 67 percent of the variation in participation in paid employment in the African-MICS countries (58 percent in non-African). To examine the importance of age-specific attributes, we begin by examining how much of the variation in participation in paid employment can be attributed to age. Figure 2 is a histogram of the fraction of the variation in paid employment that can be explained by age for each of the countries in our data. This is the R2 of a regression of paid employment on a vector of age dummies without controlling for household attributes run separately for each country. The average R2 in the data in Figure 2 is 0.7 percent. Fraction of variation in paid employment explained by age. Histogram of R2 from regression of paid employment in last 7 days on age separately by country for all MICS countries with paid employment data listed in Table 1. Limited to ages 8-14. Bin width is 0.1 (one tenth of one percent). Data range from 0.04 to 2.78 with a mean of 0.73. An R2 of 1 in the picture means that 1 percent of the variation in paid employment can be explained by age. The low explanatory power of age contrasts with the ability of household characteristics to account for variation in paid employment. To compare the explanatory power of age with other child and household attributes, we regress outcomes (we choose paid employment, school attendance, and idle) on dummy variables for age, gender, and household. We then compute what fraction of the total variation in the outcome can be explained by each component of the model as well as the model as a whole. This decomposition exercise is obviously only identified for households with more than 1 child present of school age. We limit our sample accordingly. Table 3 is this analysis of variance for the pooled data. All individuals are weighted by their inverse sampling probability. The analysis of variance in the pooled data is thus representative of 158 million children 8-14. Each cell contains the fraction of the total sum of squares that can be attributed to the row variable for all countries pooled (column 1), all African MICS countries (column 2), and all non-African MICS countries (column 3). The first four rows present our findings for paid employment, the next four contain school attendance, and the bottom four examine idle status. Age can explain 0.71 percent of the variation in paid employment in all countries combined, 0.48 percent in Africa, and 1.09 percent in other countries. Household characteristics account for 63.29 percent of the variation in paid employment in all countries, 67.77 percent in Africa. Figure 3 presents the results of computing this analysis of variance for each country separately (Table 3A and B of Edmonds and Shrestha 2012 contains the detailed results). Figure 3A is a histogram of the partial R2 of age from estimating the model of Table 3 in explaining paid employment. The partial R2s are close to the unconditional R2 in Figure 2 although they are often smaller in magnitude. Age differences are most substantive in Syria, Vietnam, and Bangladesh.

We focus on age, because binding minimum age of employment regulation impacts the distribution of activities across ages. It is useful to compare the explanatory power of age to gender and household attributes. In African countries, gender accounts for less than a tenth of a percent of the variation in paid employment. Lesotho stands out with gender accounting for 0.68 percent of the variation in paid employment. Overall, gender accounts for little of the variation paid employment. The importance of household attributes for time allocation contrasts with age. Household attributes can account for 63 percent of the variation in the prevalence of paid employment, 70 percent of the variation in school enrollment, and 62 percent of the variation idle status. The individual country partial R2s are in Figure 3B. The figure is constructed identically to Figure 3A except the figure is a plot of the partial R2 for the household fixed effects in explaining variation in paid employment. The contrast between Figure 3A (partial R2 for age) and Figure 3B (partial R2 for household fixed effects) is striking. The importance of child-invariant household attributes may be driven by low family income, parental characteristics and attitudes, or community level attributes such as the prevalence of certain types of employment or schools. Outside of Comoros and Cote d’Ivoire where we believe the household identifiers are incorrect (the far left tail of Figure 3B), household attributes account for a majority of the variation in paid employment in 50 of the 57 countries.8 The fact that the variation in paid employment with age is small does not have any implication for whether minimum age regulations influence time allocation. For example, suppose paid employment was flat with respect to age, but the relaxation of constraints lead to a small, one-time jump in the prevalence of paid employment. Age would still explain little of the total variation in paid employment even though there was an effect of regulation. In this section, we report estimates of (11) for each activity category at the age at which light work is permitted (or light work regulation is no longer binding).The next section contains estimates for minimum age of employment regulation, and the final section focuses on compulsory schooling regulation. Obviously, our findings in each section are limited to countries that relax regulation within the age ranges covered in the data. This constraint means that different countries will be included in the results for each section of the paper. Unlike the previous section, where we only used data for children age 8-14, in this section, we use data between ages 8 and the cutoff for the regulation in estimating (11) when the older data is present and relevant. Table 4 contains results aggregating all countries together and separating out the African countries. For paid employment, the “base” amount is the projected prevalence of paid employment if the time trend in paid employment under regulated ages was extended to the year where the regulation is not longer in place. The “change” is the difference between the actual incidence of paid employment at the age the law relaxes compared to the base level. Thus the “base” level of paid employment is the counterfactual of what paid employment would be at the age where regulation is relaxed absent the relaxation of the regulation on the minimum age of employment. Dividing the change by the base gives the percentage change in paid employment associated with the relaxation of the regulation. All other columns of the table report the “change” column for the dependent variable listed as the column header. We omit the base level for economy for all other outcomes. We focus on the light work results in this section. When light work is allowed, minimum age regulations are still binding. However, light work regulation would prevent any child employment. Hence, the age at which light work is permitted is the youngest age for which we might see paid employment if the regulations were binding and enforced. We expect the easing of the prohibition on light work to have the same comparative statics as discussed for the relaxation of minimum age of employment regulation earlier in the paper. We should see an increase in paid employment and a decline in household based activity without changes in school attendance. Our findings for the pooled data are in Table 4. There is no evidence of a change in participation in paid employment with the easing of light work regulation in the pooled data or in the African countries. While the changes in paid employment are especially small, we do not observe t-statistics greater in magnitude than 1 for any of the time allocation measures in Table 4 in Africa. In the combined data, the only t-statistic greater than 1 is in magnitude is for school attendance, but the estimated percentage change is still less than 10 percent and not significant. The lack of an impact of easing light work regulation in the aggregate data is clear in Figure 4. For Figure 4, we have transformed every child’s age to a measure that is years since the relaxation of light work regulation in the country (for countries with light work regulation only). Hence -1 implies 1 year before the youngest age that light work regulation is no longer binding, and 0 is the first age a child may work in light work. It is clear that the incidence of paid employment when light work is allowed does not deviate from the trend when restrictions are in place. 
Change in paid employment with relaxation of light work restrictions.
 Figure 5 contains results by outcome and country. The figure contains the change in paid employment confidence intervals and point estimate (diamond). The figure also contains the estimated change in household based activity and marks that with a circle. A solid circle indicates that we reject the null of no change in household based activity with 95 percent confidence. A hollow circle indicates 0 is within the 95 percent confidence interval for the parameter. Each row of the figure contains the results from two different regressions, and each row is estimated separately. In general, countries are identified by their country code (see Table 1), but when multiple MICS are available for the country we have added a 2 or 3 to the country code to make it clear whether the results come from MICS2 or MICS3 for the country. Change in paid employment and household based employment at minimum age for light work by country. Change in paid employment at age light work is allowed (diamonds with 95 percent confidence intervals pictures) and change in household based activity at age light work is allowed (circles / filled = reject null of no change with 95 percent confidence). A “2” after the country code indicates the data comes from the MICS2 survey for the country (“3” for MICS3). Country codes in Table 1. We observe increases in paid employment with the easing of light work restrictions in 8 countries. We can reject the null that these changes are 0 at a p-value of 0.10 in Mauritania and 0.05 in Trinidad and Tobago. In Mauritania, we observe an increase in household based activities at the age of easement of regulation that is similar in magnitude to the increase in paid employment we find. Hence, we do not find evidence consistent with binding light work regulation in Mauritania. Interestingly and nicely illustrating the importance of examining whether we observe changes that match the prediction of theory, in one round of MICS for Trinidad and Tobago, we observe a decline in paid employment with the easing of regulation. We observe an increase in the other. Focusing on the 2006 data where we observe the increase in paid employment, we also observe a decline in household based activities and no change in schooling. Hence, the pattern observed in 2006 in Trinidad and Tobago is consistent with binding light work regulation. Between 2000 and 2006, Trinidad increased its regulation so the light work age in 2006 is the minimum age of employment in 2000.This evidence from Trinidad and Tobago, which may reflect the impact of the easing of light work regulation or lagged minimum age of employment regulation is the only evidence of enforced employment regulation in this study. It is worth noting that compulsory schooling was lifted before light work was allowed in Trinidad and Tobago, so this is one country where our econometric assumption of smooth age trends before light work is permitted maybe problematic. However, there is no evidence in Trinidad and Tobago of binding compulsory schooling regulation in the discussion below. Minimum age regulations are more prevalent and more restrictive than light work regulation. Hence, we expect a larger impact of their relaxation if they are binding. One rarely hears accounts of the enforcement of light work regulation, but attention is more often brought to minimum age of employment regulation. In our discussion, we do not discuss the impact of removing the restrictions on hazardous work and the worst forms of child labor that persist until older ages, because we do not have data on time allocation at older ages and generally those restrictions are on less prevalent work. The minimum age regulations are the relevant regulation for the most common types of paid employment in which children may work. In the pooled data, there is little to suggest an impact of the relaxation of minimum age of employment restrictions. These estimates are in Table 4 above. Figure 6 presents the pooled findings for paid employment graphically. The construction of the figures is identical to Figure 4, so that 0 is the minimum age at which work is permitted outside of worst forms of child labor. Paid employment is higher than would be predicted by the trend from the ages when employment was restricted. The magnitudes are such that the easing of minimum age of employment regulation increases paid employment by slightly more than 10 percent, although this change is not statistically significant. In Africa (Table 4), we also observe an increase in work inside the household too. We observe a decrease outside of Africa, but both these changes in household based activity are not statistically significant or large in magnitude. 
Change in paid employment with relaxation of minimum age for non-hazardous work restrictions.
 Figure 7 mimics the format of Figure 5 and presents the changes in paid employment and household based activity graphically. Confidence intervals and point estimates for changes in paid employment (diamonds) and household based activities (circles) are pictured. We observe statistically significant increases in paid employment with the relaxation of minimum age regulation in one African country, Nigeria. The magnitude of the estimated increase in paid employment is large in Nigeria, over 50 percent. Bolivia, Bangladesh, and Trinidad and Tobago are the three other countries in the world where we observe statistically significant increases in paid employment at the minimum age for employment. Change in paid employment and household based activity at minimum age of employment by country. Change in paid employment at minimum age of employment (diamonds with 95 percent confidence intervals) and change in household based activity at minimum age of employment (circles / filled = reject null of no change at 95 percent). A “2” after the country code (see Table 1) indicates the data comes from the MICS2 survey for the country (“3” for MICS3). With a large number of regressions, we expect to see statistical significance by happenstance. In fact, in Figure 7, we observe more statistically significant decreases in paid employment at minimum age of employment than increases. We cannot rely solely on tests of statistical significance in evaluating whether we are observing effects of easing labor regulation. Hence, we examine the countries where we observe significant increases in paid employment for evidence of shifts in work from inside to outside the household. In Nigeria, there is some decline in participation in household based activity, although the change is roughly a third of the magnitude of the increase in paid employment. We also observe large decreases in schooling in Nigeria at the minimum age of employment. In Table 1, it is noted that schooling is no longer compulsory at the minimum age of employment, and the patterns observed in the data (see Edmonds and Shrestha 2012) are consistent with the effects of the relaxation of compulsory schooling laws. In Bangladesh, the observed pattern of responses even more clearly follows the compulsory schooling law predictions although compulsory schooling laws are believed to relax a year before minimum age regulation. Paid employment increases by 1 percentage point (25 percent) at the minimum age of employment; the prevalence of any work increases by 3 percentage points; and school attendance declines by 9 percentage points. We observe this pattern that appears consistent with relaxed schooling laws, although in the next section we find no change in schooling at the ages where compulsory schooling is dejure relaxed. This may be a case where de facto schooling norms and de jure schooling regulations differ. In Bolivia, we observe changes in time allocation that suggest that the statistically significant finding of an increase in paid employment may be spurious. We observe a statistically insignificant increase in household based activity that is similar in magnitude to the increase in paid employment. Hence, we do not observe the pattern of changes in time allocation suggested by the theory. For Trinidad and Tobago, we observe increases in paid employment and increases in household based activities that, together, are nearly double the statistically significant decrease in schooling we observe. If, in fact, light work regulations bound in Trinidad and Tobago, the assumption of smooth age trends under binding minimum age regulation would not be correct. Overall, these Trinidad and Tobago findings for minimum age regulation are difficult to interpret. Like Bangladesh, they are consistent with relaxing compulsory schooling laws. Like Bangladesh, we find no evidence of binding compulsory schooling laws below, so we could be capturing de facto schooling transition points. We have an additional problem here that our light work findings imply substantive concerns about our econometric approach to estimating the impact of relaxing minimum age regulation. While these are the statistically significant findings, there are many changes in paid employment that are not statistically significant. We observe the general pattern suggested by binding minimum age regulation: increases in paid employment matched by declines in work in the household. To assess this, we plot the estimated changes in paid employment at the minimum age of employment against the estimated changes in household based activity in Figure 8. The figure includes the linear regression line (solid, bold) and the 45-degree line (light, dashed). While binding minimum age regulation implies that changes in paid employment and household based activity should be negatively correlated, we observe that the association is positive in the data. In fact the quadrant of increasing paid employment and decreasing household based activity has the fewest observations of any of the combinations. Relationship between changes in household based work and paid employment. Figure plots estimated change (from trend) in household based work participation at the minimum age of employment for non-hazardous work against the estimated change in paid employment participation at the same age. “Household Based Work” combines work in the family farm or business with work in unpaid household services. Fitted regression line also pictured. One outlier in change in paid employment omitted. A “2” after the country code (see Table 1) indicates the data comes from the MICS2 survey for the country (“3” for MICS3). All countries. For the present study, compulsory schooling regulation may present an econometric problem that prevents us from estimating a counterfactual prevalence of paid employment or a confounder that makes it difficult to use theory to identify type I errors. In the pooled data (Table 4), we observe a decline in schooling when schooling is no longer compulsory. The decline in schooling is not matched by an increase in work, inside or outside of the home. The decline in schooling in the pooled data is concentrated in non-African countries. When we focus on Africa alone, the changes in schooling are neither substantive nor significant. Hence, in the aggregate, we do not see effects of compulsory schooling laws that match our theory. On a by country basis (see Edmonds and Shrestha 2012), we observe statistically significant declines in schooling in Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, South Sudan, Albania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Guyana, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Tajikistan, and Vietnam. Theory predicts that relaxation of binding compulsory schooling restrictions lead to increases in work. Because of missing employment data, we can examine this pattern in Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Albania, South Sudan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia. Among these countries where we observe declines in schooling when schooling is no longer compulsory, Burundi and Kyrgyzstan are the two countries where there are changes in time allocation consistent with theory. Work increases as schooling declines, although we do not find statistically significant or economically meaningful changes in paid employment in either country when schooling is no longer compulsory. Burundi is potentially the most important of these two for our analysis of the impact of minimum age of employment, because schooling is no longer compulsory at an age below the minimum age of employment, and this may bias our ability to estimate a counterfactual prevalence of child time in various activities. There are 4 countries where we observed increases in paid employment at the minimum age. We identified these as potential type I errors, because we did not see a corresponding decline in household based activity. In fact, we observed a statistically significant increase in unpaid activities as well. All 4 countries have compulsory schooling regulations that relax at the minimum age of employment. Hence, it is possible that we are capturing the effect of compulsory schooling laws on paid employment. However, we do not observe declines in schooling in any of the four countries. Nonetheless, we are hesitant to rule out the hypothesis that regulations are most effective when they are coordinated and that we are capturing some effect of coordinated regulation on time allocation. Even though these changes in time allocation do not conform to our prediction for binding minimum age regulation or compulsory schooling separately, the observed changes in time allocation may follow from the combination (although the lack of a change in schooling is not consistent with binding compulsory schooling regulation). To explore this further, we consider how the impact of the minimum age of employment differs with whether compulsory schooling laws relax at the same age. Our findings in the pooled data are in Table 5. In the first row, we consider the impact of relaxing the minimum age of employment when compulsory schooling laws are not binding. We find no significant changes in time allocation for that group. In the second row, we find that relaxing the minimum age restriction at the same age as compulsory schooling is associated with an increase in paid employment. There is also a decline is school attendance which is large in magnitude, but imprecisely estimated such that we cannot reject the null of no change in school attendance at the age where both regulations relax. Taken together, the evidence in this section suggests that the minimum age of employment is most apt to be associated with increases in paid employment when the laws are coordinated with compulsory schooling laws. We cannot separate whether this observation owes to selection in who has coordinated laws or an impact of both laws changing at the same time. Given that we do not generally observe statistically significant declines in school in these countries with coordinated laws, we suspect that selection is more important. Nonetheless, it is important to keep these cases in mind in contrast to all other countries where we do not find evidence of binding minimum age of employment regulation.",14

This increased tendency for people in industrialized countries to be self-employed has created an academic and political interest in the factors that influence individuals to become self-employed. This interest is also fuelled by the commonly held view that entrepreneurship is a source of economic growth. Nevertheless, the incidence of self-employment is far from uniform among the OECD countries. In particular, Spain and Denmark represent countries with one of the highest and the lowest rates of self-employment. According to OECD data, by 2010 self-employment represented 17% of total emplyment in Spain, while in Denmark the self-employment rate was 11.7%. Furthermore, there is a considerable difference between Spain and Denmark in the fraction of female self-employment: in 2010 the fraction of women in self-employment was 12.40% in Spain and 5.50% in Denmark. In this paper we compare these two labor markets and analyze the role of the employment conditions in the decision of entering into self-employment for men and women separately.2 In particular, we exploit the differences in the labor market environment between the two countries to provide evidence about whether more obstacles for an individual to enter regular wage labour market leads her to become self-employed with a greater probability. We make a deeper investigation of some of the issues raised by Blanchflower (2000) who analyzes the relationship between the self-employment rate and the unemployment rate for the OECD countries. We provide some further insight on certain aspects of the labour market environment such as the labour market flexibility, the generosity of the unemployment benefit system, the conditions to start and operate a business, and child care policies. This latter aspect is specially relevant for women. In the study of women’s labour force participation, one of the most consistent findings is the negative effect of the presence of young children on the probability of participation. However, the simple choice between being employed and not being employed may mask important aspects of the decision regarding participation. A more enlightening approach could be to consider employment options that could lessen the constraints that child care needs place on the mother’s employment. Among these employment choices, we could consider self-employment.3 Given that the institutional conditions in terms of access and cost of child care are markedly different in Denmark and Spain, we investigate the extent to which self-employment is used in both countries as a way of obtaining more flexibility in order to combine family and working life. The dynamic aspects of self-employment are the focus of our research.4 To this end, we use six waves from a strictly comparable micro data set for Denmark and Spain, The European Community Household Panel (ECHP). These data allow us to observe transitions into self-employment, and not only the stock of self-employed individuals. As far as the empirical strategy is concerned, we offer evidence on the characteristics of the self-employed in both countries and estimate reduced form parametric transition probabilities from employment and non-employment to self-employment, for men and women separately. Our results indicate that being disadvantaged on the labour market (measured in a number of ways) has a greater effect on the probability of becoming self-employed in Spain than in Denmark. Specifically, in Spain, individuals in the bottom part of the wage distribution start more often their own business. Moreover, the entrance form non-employment is considerably higher for Spanish than for Danish workers, specially if they do not receive unemployment benefits and if they are mothers with small children. Finally, we do not find strong evidence that the lack of relatively cheap child care in Spain put some extra incentives on mothers with small children to start as self-employed, since we only find evidence in favor of this hypothesis for women coming from non-employment but not for those coming from wage-employment. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2. describes the underlying theoretical framework and relationships to be studied. The relevant features of the Danish and Spanish labour markets are described in Section 3. and the data set is described in Section 4. In Section 5. we present the estimation strategy and discuss the empirical results. The final section summarizes and concludes.",7
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,27 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-1-12,How quickly does structural reform pay off? An empirical analysis of the short-term effects of unemployment benefit reform,December 2012,Romain Bouis,Orsetta Causa,Romain Duval,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"While the theoretical case for public unemployment insurance is compelling (Blanchard and Tirole2008), the potential adverse effects of high benefit replacement rates on steady-state employment have also long been identified in mainstream labor market theories (e.g. Layard et al.1991; Pissarides2000). With some qualifications1, the theoretical prediction that – all else equal – high benefits should lower the equilibrium employment level is supported by a wide body of empirical literature, be it macroeconometric work based on cross-country time-series panel data (e.g. Bassanini and Duval2009; Nickell et al.2005) or country-specific microeconometric analysis based on difference-in-differences approaches (Card1990; Card and Krueger1994). However, the typical theoretical analysis provides some insights into the long-term impact of a change in policy settings from a static comparative perspective. Much less explored has been the dynamics of the economy towards its new (post-benefit reform) steady state, leaving largely unanswered the question of whether unemployment benefit (and other labor market) reforms take time to pay-off or might even imply trading long-term gains for short-term pain. Yet in the presence of Keynesian features in the economy, benefit cuts could lower aggregate demand temporarily weaken output and employment, thereby delaying the gains from reform. This could happen for instance if the unemployed have an above-average marginal propensity to consume (possibly because they are credit-constrained), and macroeconomic policy does not fully respond to the associated reduction in aggregate demand (possibly because monetary policy faces a binding zero-bound constraint, see e.g. Eggertsson2010). Beyond its theoretical relevance, the short-term impact of benefit reform also bears major implications for the political feasibility of labor market reforms, as possible transitional losses have often been put forward as an obstacle to their implementation in the policy debate, over and above the usual political economy factors. Some emerging literature has used small and large-scale dynamic general equilibrium models to explore the dynamic effects of labor market reforms (e.g. Cacciatore et al.2012; Everaert and Schule2008; Gomes et al.2011). One consensual finding is that labor market reforms appear to pay off only gradually, consistent with the presence of frictions in labor markets. While a negative short-term impact is a theoretical possibility – at least under certain conditions, such as if the country considered is a small member of a monetary union – in all such models, whether it materializes in practical simulations depends on the specific design features of the models and their key calibrated parameter values, as well as on how labor markets are represented. By contrast, to our knowledge no empirical evidence exists concerning the short-term employment effect of unemployment benefit or other labor market reforms. By design, microeconometric analysis – which is otherwise the most robust approach to identify the impact of benefit level or duration cuts on job search and the length of unemployment spells – is poorly suited to assess the economy-wide, general equilibrium effects of reform. Cross-country time-series analysis would therefore seem the most natural choice in this particular case. However, existing studies have relied either on static panel data estimates of a reduced-form unemployment equation, or on dynamic panel specifications in which the short-term dynamics of unemployment is very basic and by construction similar for all types of reforms. This paper contributes to fill this gap by adopting a different macro panel data approach. Specifically, benefit reform “shocks” are identified for a panel of OECD countries spanning three decades, and turned into reform variables following the methodology outlined by Romer and Romer (2010) to estimate fiscal multipliers at various horizons based on measures of fiscal shocks. The dynamic impact of reforms on employment is then estimated following the simple approach proposed by Jorda (2005), which allows some direct estimation of impulse response functions (IRFs). IRFs are estimated for up to five years after the reform. The main findings are three-fold. First, it takes time for unemployment benefit reform to pay off, with its impact continuing to be felt into the fifth year after the reform. Second, although reforms materialize only gradually, they do not appear to entail any negative short-run effects. Third, we find however some tentative evidence that reducing the generosity of unemployment income support could have negative short-run effects in “bad times”, i.e. when output and employment are particularly depressed. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the approach taken to identify unemployment benefit reform “shocks” and details the econometric approach used to identify their dynamic effects. Section 3 provides the results from the empirical analysis, and Section 4 checks for the sensitivity of the results to the use of alternative reform identification criteria and econometric specifications. Section 5 concludes.",10

Labor-market institutions and volatility of the youth unemployment rate,December 2012,Daiji Kawaguchi,Tetsushi Murao,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Although the unemployment rate fluctuates in line with the business cycle, the fluctuation of age-specific unemployment rates differs significantly across Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The way age-specific unemployment rates fluctuate over the business cycle significantly differs across the US, France, and Japan, as shown in the time-series plot for the 1960-2008 period in Figure 1. First, youths’ (15-24) and adults’ (45-54) unemployment rates move in parallel in the US. Business-cycle fluctuations seem to be absorbed equally across generations. Second, youths’ unemployment rate fluctuates more sharply than adults’ unemployment rate in France. This implies that employment adjustments occur more often for youths than for adults in France. The Japanese trend lies somewhere between those of the US and France. Shocks to the economy are equally absorbed by generations in the US, while they are intensively absorbed by younger generations in France. To see the heterogeneity of the age distribution of unemployment-rate volatility, adjusting for differences in the levels of unemployment rates by age groups, Table 1 reports the coefficient of variation of unemployment rates for these three countries. Again, we find that youths’ unemployment-rate volatility relative to adults’ employment-rate volatility is higher in France than in the US or Japan. 
Age-specific unemployment rates (US, France, and Japan).
 What factors cause this international difference in the responses of age-specific unemployment rates over the business cycle? Answering this question is particularly important to address policy makers’ concerns about the continuing high unemployment among youth across OECD countries after the 2008 financial crisis. The press release by OECD in advance of the G20 Labor Ministers Meeting in Mexico on 17-18 May 2012 points out that the youth employment rate is higher than the general unemployment rate, citing examples of Greece and Spain, where youth unemployment is three times higher than general unemployment rate.1 Pointing to longer-term consequences of youth unemployment, OECD recommends that governments expand job-search assistance, apprenticeship and other vocational training programs, and employment subsidies for youth. It also recommends reducing the gap of employment protection between permanent and temporary workers, and setting minimum wage not too high. Although these policy recommendations are likely to be effective for alleviating youth unemployment problems, determining why the burden of negative economic shock falls disproportionately on youth in some countries in the first place can contribute to removing the causes of youth unemployment. Previous literature shows that the youths’ unemployment rate is more cyclically sensitive than that of adults (Clark and Summers 1981, Alba-Ramirez 1995, Rios-Rull 1996, Gomme et al. 2005, Bertola et al. 2007and Jaimovich and Siu 2009). Many theoretical and empirical investigations also account for higher unemployment rates for youths than for adults. Research indicates that stricter employment protection or a higher unionization rate raises the unemployment rate in general (e.g. Lazear 1990). These rigid labor-market institutions particularly raise youths’ unemployment rate relative to adults’ (Lazear 1990, Canziani and Petrongolo 2001, Rodriguez-Palenzuela and Jimeno-Serrano 2002, Bertola, Blau and Kahn 2007, Kahn 2007, Leonor 2008). These prior studies examine how employment protection or wage-setting institutions affect the respective unemployment rates of youths and adults. In other words, these studies examine the long-run effect of employment protection or wage-setting institutions on the unemployment rate of youths relative to that of adults. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies examine why the fluctuations of age-specific unemployment rates differ across countries. It is important to study which age groups of workers absorb the short-run macroeconomic shocks from the point of view of inter-generational risk-sharing. Economies where younger generations disproportionately absorb macroeconomic shocks place a greater burden of the business cycle on youths, who presumably have a lower capacity for absorbing risks because they hold less asset than other age groups, on average. Neumark (2002), Wachter and Bender (2006) and Genda et al. (2010) report that the employment status of youths has prolonged effects on labor-market outcomes in the long run because of the hysteresis. Thus, short-run macroeconomic shocks experienced when workers are young may well have a considerable long-run effect on their welfare, and workers belonging to different birth-year cohorts may have significantly different levels of welfare in an economy where short-run macroeconomic shocks are absorbed disproportionately by young workers. This paper explores the extent to which labor-market institutions, such as the degree of employment protection, affect heterogeneous responses of age-specific unemployment rates to macroeconomic shocks. We derive empirical predictions from a theoretical model and test them using panel data of the unemployment rate of 18 developed countries spanning the 1971-2008 period. By regressing changes of age-specific unemployment rates on the overall unemployment rate, the heterogeneity of responses of age-specific unemployment rates to a macroeconomic shock is estimated. We further examine how this heterogeneity depends on various labor-market-institution indexes, originally published by OECD and extended by other sources. Our results indicate that stricter employment protection amplifies the effect of the cyclical unemployment rate on youths’ unemployment rate. This implies that the cost of the business cycle falls disproportionately on youths in the countries with stricter employment protection. A higher replacement rate for unemployment insurance benefits seems to mitigate the cyclical sensitivity of youth unemployment rates. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a theoretical model to derive empirical predictions on how labor-market institutions affect unemployment rates of different age groups in different ways. Section 3 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 reports the empirical results, and Section 6 provides conclusions.",6

An overview of current approaches,December 2012,Herwig Immervoll,Stefano Scarpetta,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past decade, a number of OECD countries have introduced or reinforced strategies to “activate” the unemployed and other benefit recipients, hereafter called “activation strategies”. These strategies varied significantly across the board, depending on underlying labour market conditions and the capacity of public employment services. However, the main features of the activation strategies include the enforcement of strict eligibility criteria for benefit recipients together with the provision of effective re-employment services. At the same time, governments have made efforts to encourage economic self-sufficiency while supporting the living standards of low-income families, by providing different forms of in-work benefits. Evidence suggests that, if well-designed, such strategies have contributed to better labour market outcomes, by ensuring that benefit recipients have a better chance of obtaining employment and minimising the risks that high and/or long-lasting benefits significantly damage work incentives (Reassessment of the OECD Jobs Strategy in OECD,2006a; OECD2005). This paper discusses such strategies for activation and employment support in OECD countries. 1 They comprise measures that: Strengthen people’s motivation to look for and make use of existing earnings opportunities (e.g., work incentives, job-search requirements and benefit sanctions); Address specific employment barriers on the labour-supply side by improving the capabilities of jobseekers and other policy “clients” (e.g., training and employment rehabilitation); and Expand the set of earnings opportunities that are available and accessible to jobseekers and those with limited income from work (labour-market intermediation and programmes that support labour demand through wage subsidies or direct job creation). While activation strategies were generally launched in the OECD countries in the 1990s with the aim of combating high and often persistent unemployment, their effectiveness in mobilising the unemployed and other benefit recipients was evaluated in particular in the decade prior to the Great Recession of 2007–08 -- a period in which many countries enjoyed relatively strong economic growth and buoyant labour demand and thus when the number of jobseekers was low relative to the number of vacancies. Early activation measures focused on specific groups facing labour-market difficulties in a context of relatively strong overall labour-market performance (such as low-skilled urban youth). More recently, activation principles have been extended to cover a wider range of population groups, and increasingly in a co-ordinated manner across policy domains. With a rapidly growing number of jobseekers and low labour demand, the recent financial and economic crisis has exposed activation strategies to a hard test. Re-employment services and other active labour market programmes, (ALMPs, henceforth) had to be scaled up to provide support to the greater number of jobseekers; and activation procedures had to be adapted to ensure that jobseekers receive the appropriate supports. While resources for ALMPs have increased in response to the crisis, often more than in previous major downturns (OECD2012), spending per unemployed has generally declined significantly. This has meant fewer resources available to support jobseekers at a time when their chances of quick reintegration into work were weaker given the limited number of vacancies and high competition among the unemployed. In this context, policy-makers are facing daunting trade-offs. On the one hand, fiscal consolidation efforts require containing public spending, including for labour market programmes. On the other hand, early successes with activation strategies suggest that they can contribute significantly to mobilise benefit recipients back into employment, which is key both for reducing benefit spending, and for shoring up government revenues now and in the longer term. In addition, the downturn has pushed up the numbers of people living in “low-work intensity” households requiring support, and this has heightened concerns about inequality trends and the situation of the poorest families in particular. In restoring incomes at the bottom, a key policy challenge is therefore to facilitate employment and earnings growth that benefits low-income groups. Moreover, longer-term trends also point to a greater role for activation policies. In most of the OECD area, population ageing and the associated pressures on social expenditure budgets make active labour-market participation of working-age individuals a necessary ingredient of policies that seek to restore the fiscal sustainability of social protection systems. The paper reviews different elements of the activation strategies adopted by OECD countries and discusses what works under different underlying labour market conditions. After a brief review of key features of activation strategies (Section 2), the paper considers benefit generosity and work incentives (Section 3); eligibility conditions and obligations of job seekers and benefit recipients (Section 4); and ALMPs (Section 5). Section 6 characterizes aspects of countries’ overall policy stance by discussing the balance of policies and links between them.",36

Although the quantitative results differ across different empirical studies, there is by now a broad agreement among researchers that more generous social insurance, ceteris paribus, yields less effort to prevent and escape from unemployment and inactivity. This means that policy makers need to strike a balance between two highly legitimate, but conflicting, aims. At the end of the day, this is intrinsically a political choice, which must be made on the basis of values. But scientific knowledge can be used to design institutions that minimize the efficiency-equity tradeoff. The present paper discusses how a strategy of activation can be applied to reduce the conflict between generous insurance and appropriate incentives for being self-sufficient. Activation can play this role because it removes the “leisure component” of social insurance, and hence makes social insurance less attractive for individuals whose problem is low work motivation rather than (or in addition to) lack of job opportunities. It may thus substitute for, e.g.,“strict” maximum duration limitations as a moral-hazard-containing device, which in the context of a comprehensive welfare state in any case may appear as a time-inconsistent – and thus empty – threat. Properly designed, activation requirements may also imply that otherwise idle labor resources are employed for useful purposes during waiting/search periods – at least to some extent – and that the prospects for (again) obtaining regular work are improved. But activation also entails costs – in the form of administrative resources, potential lock-in-effects, and non-intended market distortions (e.g., if public sector work crowds out private-sector work). Over the past decades, there has been a trend in many countries toward making unemployment insurance (UI) and social assistance (SA) programs more focused on activation. Activation requirements have come in many forms – from counseling and job-search-monitoring to educational programs and job-training. Although the empirical research is less than unanimous in its evaluation of individual effects of actually participating in these activities, there is now overwhelming evidence indicating that activation reduces moral hazard problems, and that threats of activation have similar effects as threats of outright benefit termination. But, so far, the activation strategy has primarily been limited to unemployment insurance and social assistance programs. Disability insurance (DI) programs have to a large extent been sheltered from this development, probably because these programs have been designed to provide benefits to individuals with serious health problems who presumably have lost their ability to work. Work-ability is not a dichotomous characteristic, however; it is a matter of degree more than of kind. The distinction between “unemployment” and “disability” is thus anything but clear-cut, and the classification of a given non-employment spell as one or the other is often determined more by the design of the insurance institutions than by the nature of the problem at hand. A likely side-effect of making one part of the system thriftier or more activation oriented may therefore simply be that insurance costs are shifted over to another part of the system. This also implies that threats of benefit termination lose credibility, as well-informed economic agents realize that alternative – less demanding – options are available. A proper strategy for minimizing the conflict between equity and efficiency thus has to take the design of the whole social insurance system into account. In the present paper, I review the existing evidence on the impacts of alternative moral-hazard-containing instruments, as viewed from a welfare state perspective. While there are a large number of empirical studies on the impacts of maximum duration constraints and/or activation strategies in unemployment insurance systems, the evidence regarding similar strategies in disability insurance systems is much more limited. Based on the available evidence, I argue that there is a strong case for limiting the duration of “passive” income support periods, both in unemployment and disability insurance programs. But I also point out that maximum duration constraints need not be “definitive” in order to achieve the intended threat/encouragement effect – they have been shown to bite even when they are “soft”, in the sense that the termination of passive benefits is accompanied by (lower or more strongly conditioned) follow-on benefits or by opportunities to participate in paid activation. The idea of activation in DI programs is that health problems/disabilities often reduces a person’s work capacity, but rarely eliminates it completely; and consequently that there are significant “hidden” labor supply resources among DI claimants. Offering income insurance in the form of the opportunity to earn income through (at least some) work rather than through a pure income transfer implies a more attractive DI program for those who really want to work, while it at the same time entails less moral hazard problems. And, as I show below, existing empirical evidence indicates both that work tends to be a healthy activity for disabled individuals and that policies aimed at maintaining some work through periods of temporary disability significantly improve subsequent employment and earnings prospects. The paper proceeds as follows: In the next section, I briefly discuss the evidence on the overlap of unemployment and disability insurances. I then examine the empirical evidence on activation – in unemployment as well as disability insurance programs. Thereafter, I discuss the implications of important structural trends and cyclical fluctuations for the optimal blend of welfare and workfare policies. Finally, I draw some conclusions regarding the role that activation can play in balancing the objectives of appropriate social insurance and sufficient work-incentives.",9

For a given macroeconomic background and policy setting the overriding task for labour market policies is to reduce the extent to which the rise in unemployment translates into an increase in long-term unemployment and thus the structural unemployment rate. Experience from the high unemployment period in the 1970s and 1980s shows both how steep increases in unemployment can translate into increases in the structural unemployment and how difficult it may be to bring down the structural unemployment rate subsequently. Active labour market policies may play an important role in this context. However, how should active labour market policies (ALMP) be designed so as to reach this objective in a very slack labour market? This raises several issues. First, there is a volume effect. For given ALMP policies an increase in unemployment causes a larger inflow into the ALMP programmes. This raises both a funding and a capacity issue. Can such an increased level of activity be funded? How fast can the supply capacity in ALMP programmes be expanded. A particular concern is that the quality or effectiveness may be decreasing in the overall activity level e.g. because private job training (one of the instruments which is usually found to be most effective) may be in shorter supply. Second, the composition of the pool of unemployed may change. In a situation with low unemployment, the group is dominated by individuals who face more serious barriers for employment, while in a severe slump more core workers enter. Does this call for a different level or type of ALMP programmes? Thirdly, is the effect of ALMP policies business cycle dependent? There are two sides to this question since ALMP serves both to strengthen search incentives and to improve qualifications to enhance job finding possibilities. A slump may at the same time reduce the importance of the incentive problem and increase the importance of the qualification problem. The former because unemployment benefits may be less distortionary in a slump and hence the need to maintain search incentives via ALMP is accordingly smaller. The latter because a deep recession is associated with structural changes and therefore some core workers may find that their human capital to some degree becomes obsolete. Finally, the political support for ALMP may be business cycle dependent. It may seem more reasonable to have tight ALMP conditions when unemployment is low and job finding rates are high, and the opposite with high unemployment and low job finding rates. We consider some of these questions with outset in the Danish experiences and policy responses to the great recession. The Danish case is interesting due to the role ALMP plays in the so-called flexicurity model (see e.g. Andersen and Svarer (2007)). The Danish labour market has flexible hiring and firing rules, relatively generous unemployment insurance benefits and a strong focus on ALMP (highest among OECD countries 1). At the same time it has delivered a rather low unemployment rate. How well has this model coped with the great recession, and how have ALMP policies been adapted to the crisis? Denmark is also an example of how ALMP has been continuously changed. Even though the overall level measured in terms of expenditures as a share of GDP has been relatively constant over the years, the specific design of ALMP has changed significantly over the years in response to the labour market situation, new evidence on the effects of ALMP and changes in political prioritizations. Clearly it is not possible from one observation (and even a relatively short observation period) to make a reliable inference on how a recession influences the effectiveness of ALMP. The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the insights which can be inferred so far from the Danish case. The paper provides a discussion of how ALMP has been changed in light of the recession as well as new evidence and insights on how it works. The focus will thus be on some policy issues and lessons. This paper is organized as follows: The developments in the Danish labour market since the onset of the Great Recession are mapped in Section 2, followed by a more detailed account of active labour market policies in Section 3. Active labour market policies have been continuously changed in light of experience and new evidence, and in Section 4 we discuss some recent randomized experiments, their findings and influence on labour market policies. The management structure of labour market policies have recently been changed according to a one-shop principle at the municipal level, and the issues this has raised are discussed in Section 5. A few concluding remarks are given in Section 6.",9

Unemployment (defined below) befalls about 200 million of the world’s people – a sizeable number but small compared to the three billion people who are poor using the $2.50 PPP dollar poverty line. A much larger number – 900 million - are employed but earning so little that they and their families are unable to reach even $2 per person per day (ILO, 2012). They are working hard and they are working poor. (Working Hard, Working Poor is the title of my latest book (Fields, 2012). To achieve more and better employment (where “better” depends on such factors as rate of pay, job security, employment protections, and type of work), analysts and donors need to understand better how employment, growth, poverty and other factors interact, how unemployment is caused, and how employment can be improved. At the same time, drawing on practical experience, research can identify knowledge gaps that to date pose limits to successful employment creation policy. Some research findings have been so clearly established that they form the knowledge base for the rest of this paper. Specifically: Most countries in the world have experienced economic growth (World Bank, 2012). Economic growth is positive in every geographic region of the world. It is positive in every income group (high income, middle income, and low income). And it is positive in 90% of the countries of the world. Most countries in the world have experienced falling poverty (World Bank, 2012). Economic growth and poverty reduction usually go together at the macro level (Fields, 2001). Poverty has fallen in the great majority of country cases when economic growth has taken place. When poverty has not fallen, it typically is because economic growth has not taken place. Human development indicators have risen in every single country of the world (United Nations, 2011). In every country of the world, better educated workers earn more on average than less educated workers do (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004). Consequently, countless poverty profiles from around the world show lower rates of poverty among households whose heads are better educated. An important reason why better educated workers earn more is that they work in better job categories than less educated workers do (Schultz, 1988). Unemployment is particularly prevalent among youth (defined by the ILO as persons between the ages of 15 and 24). However, youth are only about 20% of the world’s labor force (ILO, 2012). The world has an employment problem more than an unemployment problem. 200 million people in the world are unemployed, but an additional 900 million earn so little that they and their families are unable to attain a standard of living of even $2 PPP dollars per day (ILO, 2012). The essence of developing countries’ labor market problems is an insufficient number of “good jobs” for all who want to work in them and are capable of performing them. Workers in the poorer countries need to work, and so when no one else will hire them, they create their own earning opportunities, typically in very low-paying self-employment, which has been graphically termed “reluctant entrepreneurship” (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). Consequently, the unemployment rates in the developing countries are lower than those in the developed countries. The poor work long hours but earn so little per hour that they are unable to move above the poverty line. Besides their low earnings, most have few job-related social protections. Too many are in indecent work: modern-day slavery, indentured servitude, child prostitution, and the like. Women face particular disadvantages in the labor market. These and other conditions are elaborated in Fields (2012, Chapter 4), to which the reader is referred for further information.",4

One focuses primarily on the education and skills of US workers, and how they have failed to keep pace with employer skill needs over time. The other focuses on the quality of jobs, rather than workers, and argues that legal and institutional changes have reduced the pressure on employers to generate high-quality jobs for US workers. Of course, these two discussions have quite different implications for the policies that are needed to improve workers earnings and reduce inequality. The former emphasizes our need to improve worker skills by raising educational attainment and achievement among US workers, especially among lower-income groups. In contrast, the latter emphasizes the need to pressure employers into raising job quality, mostly by strengthening collective bargaining rights and labor standards (such as minimum wage laws)1. I will argue below that there is some truth to both views. Employers do create good jobs in the US, but they are doing this less than in the past for workers with weak education levels and occupational skills. In particular, workers who lack some kind of postsecondary educational credential or training have increasing difficulty finding good jobs. And too many Americans, especially from low-income backgrounds, fail to earn these credentials and attain these skills. This seems to be true for general educational attainment as well as specific occupational training, and at the middle of the education and training spectrum (i.e., beyond a high school diploma but below a bachelor’s degree) as well as the top. Accordingly, we need policies that will enable more workers to obtain the skills and credentials that employers seek when creating good jobs. This means not only a stronger educational system, but one in which higher education and workforce development are more effectively integrated and responsive to trends in the labor market, especially sectors where good jobs are being created. Below I lay out this argument. First I consider trends in labor demand – specifically, where good jobs are being created, and what skills employers need to fill them. Next I consider why the supply of workers with these skills does not always respond to the demand-side trends, as simple labor market models with very elastic supplies of skills (in the long run) suggest they should. I review evidence on education and training programs and practices that seem relatively successful at raising skill levels among the disadvantaged, and also their employment and earnings. Then I discuss a set of policies to generate more such practices, before concluding.",10

One reaction to this criticism was to point to the fact that automatic stabilizers in Germany are more important than in other countries, so that less discretionary action is required. This raises the general question of whether countries with weaker automatic stabilizers have taken more discretionary fiscal policy action to compensate for this. The recent recession triggered by the financial crisis has had a severe impact on incomes and employment around the world and especially in Europe (OECD 2012). While it is uncontroversial that both the magnitude of the economic contraction during the crisis and its effects on labor markets were attenuated considerably by the work of automatic and discretionary stabilization, a large part of the resulting policy debate has focused on the size of discretionary fiscal policy plans and on rescue packages for banks. Much less attention has been devoted to the workings of automatic stabilizers. Automatic stabilizers are usually defined as those elements of fiscal policy which reduce tax burdens and increase public spending without discretionary government action. In particular, automatic stabilizers provide income replacement immediately when unemployment starts to rise. During the recent crisis, the tax and benefit system has acted as an automatic stabilizer on both the revenue as well as the expenditure side of the general government budget. Due to differences related to the structure and financing of the tax benefit system, the degree of automatic stabilization was bound to vary across countries. Automatic stabilizers are widely seen to play a key role in providing income insurance for households and hence in stabilizing demand and output. The automatic action of tax-transfer policies was accompanied in most countries by discretionary action in the field of tax, social and labor market policy. This action included a broad range of measures such as (payroll) tax cuts, employment incentives, activation policies, higher benefits and increased transfers to low-income households. Therefore, especially for the recent crisis, it is important to assess the contribution of automatic stabilizers to the overall fiscal expansion and to compare their magnitude across countries. Understanding the relationship between automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy is crucial, because countries with larger automatic stabilizers have to rely less on discretionary fiscal stimulus packages, other things being equal. As final data on fiscal stimulus packages during the recent economic crisis are now available, it is possible to shed light on this relationship. This is the purpose of this paper. We build on former work (see Dolls et al. 2012) which investigates the magnitude of automatic stabilizers inherent in the tax and transfer systems of 19 EU countries plus the US1. We relate these estimates of automatic stabilizers to new information on discretionary fiscal stimuli. Our empirical analysis points to a robust negative relationship between these two pillars of fiscal and social policy. This suggests that policy makers may indeed have taken into consideration the strength of automatic stabilizers when they decided how much to spend on discretionary fiscal policy packages in the crisis. These results are interesting because they shed new light on the factors determining the fiscal policy response of governments to the crisis. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing policy debate about institutional reforms following the sovereign debt crisis. While it is clear that balanced budgets need to be achieved in the medium-run, it is important to take into account the impact of reforms on automatic stabilizers. Also, our results support the argument that countries that have enacted smaller stimulus programs were countries with more automatic stabilizers. Of course, automatic stabilizers should not be the only determinant of discretionary programs. Other factors like the initial budgetary position or the size of the shock in the country under consideration have to be taken into account. What is the contribution of this paper, relative to the existing literature? To the best of our knowledge, we are the first who analyze this relationship for the recent economic crisis with a direct measure for the magnitude of automatic stabilizers and up-to-date data on fiscal stimulus packages. The (IMF 2009), using the average ratio of revenue to GDP as an indirect measure for automatic stabilization, finds a negative relationship between government size and the size of the discretionary fiscal impulse2. Moreover, as their work was done at an early stage in the recession, they rely on projections for discretionary measures (see IMF (2009)). However, in (Dolls et al. 2012), we show that simple macro measures such as the tax revenue to GDP ratio only partially predict the amount of automatic stabilization. In a similar vein, the (OECD 2009) finds an inverse relationship between the size of fiscal packages and automatic stabilizers, but also uses projections for fiscal stimulus and a measure for automatic stabilization which is conceptually not comparable to ours as it is based on the cyclical sensitivity of the budget to the economic cycle (see Girouard and André 2005). Two recent contributions investigate the cross-country variation in fiscal stimulus during the crisis ((Bénétrix and Lane 2010) and (Aaizenman and Jinjarak 2010)) and relate it to several explanatory variables (e.g. pre-crisis GDP per capita, trade openness, fiscal space), but do not account for the amount of automatic stabilization. Interestingly and in line with our hypothesis, (Auerbach 2009) points to the fact that automatic stabilizers have been historically low in the pre-crisis years 2003-7 in the U.S. and concludes that this low level of automatic stabilization is one potential explanation for policy decisions with regard to discretionary fiscal policy during the recent economic crisis in the US. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the conceptual framework and the empirical approach. Section 3 presents the results for automatic stabilizers and section 4 the relationship with discretionary fiscal policy. Section 5 concludes.",3

The German labor market and the Great Recession,December 2012,Ulf Rinne,Klaus F Zimmermann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is a broad consensus that Germany’s post-war economic boom constitutes an “economic miracle” (Giersch et al., [1992]; Lang, [1990]). This perceived miracle refers to the period in which West Germany, badly destroyed after World War II, caught up with the development of the world economy. During the recent financial and economic crisis the country experienced what may be considered to be another economic miracle: the surprisingly mild response of the labor market to the worst global recession in post-war history. What can explain the German success story? The underlying factors are related to the improved functioning of the country’s labor market, the specific nature of the crisis in the German context, as well as the concrete policy responses in this critical period. A number of institutional factors have created an environment that is more difficult to generate or to replicate elsewhere. From a long-term perspective, the German economy had made impressive progress to attack its classical Achilles’ heel – the labor market – until 2008. Substantial labor market reforms making low-skilled labor productive helped put the economy into a relatively strong position when the crisis started. While the long-term unemployment rate could be substantially reduced, skilled labor in the best-managed and successful companies, typically in the export sector, became increasingly scarce. This is important to recognize in this context as the crisis in Germany mainly affected export-oriented companies, in particular manufacturing, and not the consumption sector. Firms affected by the Great Recession had a strong interest in retaining their qualified workforce against the background of population ageing and the expected future shortages of skilled labor. Finally, the behaviors of social partners and automatic stabilizers have also helped cushion the labor market impact of the crisis. We argue that all these factors together have resulted in the country’s recent success story. Firms affected by the Great Recession reacted mainly at the intensive margin to retain their workers. Next to the reduction of overtime hours and other instruments of working time flexibility if available at the firm level (e.g., working time accounts), short-time work was the instrument through which this could be managed at reasonable costs. Our explanation therefore emphasizes the central role of the interaction between short-time work, or more generally working time reductions, and increasing shortages of skilled workers in sectors and regions that were mainly affected by the crisis. This interaction is typically missing in other explanations of the German economic miracle (e.g. Burda and Hunt, [2011]). Germany has proven to be a strong case of internal flexibility in response to the Great Recession. The German success story is in stark contrast to the situation in the United States, which now has to worry about persistent long-term unemployment. More than 20 years ago the phenomenon of successive, recession-related waves of unemployment that ended up accumulating was considered to be entirely a European problem (Blanchard and Summers, [1986]). Among the countries in Europe, Germany served as the prime example for the pattern of high and rising unemployment. The situation has remarkably changed since the 1990s when the impressive employment growth in the United States was frequently characterized as an “employment miracle” (Krueger and Pischke, [1997]). We argue that this striking change is mainly due to successful labor market reforms in European countries such as in Germany and due to demographic changes. The Great Recession has merely acted as a shock that made the change apparent. This paper proceeds as follows. We outline how the crisis had an impact on the country’s economy, how policy responded, and how the German success story emerged. Finally, we conclude and discuss future challenges.",47

Evidence from Turkey,December 2013,Sinem H Ayhan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The employment rate in Turkey, fluctuating between 40%–50%, has been ranking the lowest in Europe for the last decade. Even Poland and Romania, amongst the lowest ranking EU countries, have an employment rate more than 15 percentage points higher than Turkey, as displayed in Table 11. The divergence in employment rate between Turkey and the EU is mainly because of the dramatically low rate of female employment in Turkey. As of 2007 only 21% of women were employed in Turkey, corresponding to one third of the EU average. Reasons behind the divergence in employment performances among countries have been central to the literature in labor economics. A number of national and international surveys point at high non-wage costs, particularly high social security contributions in Turkey that create a burden on employers, and this in turn discourages employment creation in the formal sector while encouraging informal employment (OECD (2007); TCEA (2006); World Bank (2006)). This view, also shared by the Turkish policy makers, was embodied in a policy intervention legislated in May 2008. The law prescribed a cut (up to 100%) in social security contributions borne by employers who hired young men (aged 18 to 29 years) and women (aged over 18 years) between July 1 st, 2008 and June 30th, 2010. The main goal of this paper is to conduct a micro-econometric analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy in creating formal employment for the targeted group (women), something that, to the best of my knowledge, has not been done yet. Employment subsidy policies in the form of social security contribution cuts have taken place in several countries mostly in the northern Europe such as France (e.g. Kramarz and Philippon (2001)), Belgium (e.g. Goos and Konings (2007)), Sweden (e.g. Bennmarker et al. (2008); Egebark and Kaunitz (2010)) and Finland (e.g. Huttunen et al. (2010)) over the last two decades. Chile (e.g. Gruber, (1997)) and Turkey (e.g. Betcherman et al. (2010); Uysal (2013)) are the only known examples of developing countries where employment subsidies have empirically been analyzed. The employment subsidies generally target disadvantaged groups (e.g. low-wage workers, the young or the old), certain sectors or geographic locations rather than being applied to all workers and/or to all establishments. The availability of certain target groups enables the researchers to analyze the effectiveness of employment subsidies through difference-in-differences and/or triple difference strategy. The studies have mostly found little or no evidence of an employment effect of labor tax reduction with a few exceptions (i.e. Betcherman et al. (2010); Goos and Konings (2007); Uysal (2013))2. Following the previous studies, my empirical analysis relies on a difference-in-difference-in-differences (triple difference) strategy with the intent of avoiding potential confounding effects of the 2008 economic crisis which coincides with the policy period. More concretely, firstly, the change in the outcome of women aged 30 to 34 (affected by the policy) is compared with the change in the outcome of men of the same age group (unaffected by the policy) between before and after the policy period, assuming that the outcomes of both groups would have had a parallel trend in the absence of the policy. Then the resulting difference is contrasted with the comparison of the relative outcomes of two treatment groups (women and men aged between 25 and 29 years old) which are both subject to the policy and to the crisis between pre- and post-policy period. The latter difference enables the canceling out the crisis effect on women aged 30 to 34 under the assumption that both age groups have been affected by the crisis in a similar way. The estimation results suggest a positive and significant effect of the social security premium incentives on creating employment for the targeted group (women) in the periods shortly after the policy announcement. As far as is known to date, this study is the first attempt to explore the causal relation between Turkish non-wage subsidy policy in 2008 and employment creation. There is only little empirical research on developing countries in the field of employment subsidies. The existing literature, moreover, does not focus on the total number of employment positions created by the policy that this paper intends to explore by using flow data. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 documents an overview of non-wage cost rigidities in the Turkish labor market and then introduces the policy of interest. Section 3 describes the data and the technique used to construct flow data. The identification strategy is discussed in Section 4, and estimation results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes, and finally the appendix where the regressions and all the figures and tables are presented is provided.",6

In the 2009 Federal Budget, the WITB was boosted in order to double the fiscal relief. With a budget of $1.135 billion in 2009–10, more than 1.5 million Canadians are targeted to benefit from the enhanced WITB. Although the total budget allocated to this program is modest, this earning supplement may entail significant work incentives and distributional effects at the household level. Indeed a number of studies that have examined the impact of similar earning supplements – in partial equilibrium framework – suggest that they are likely to have positive effects on labour supply and poverty alleviation. However, what would be the impact of these work incentives on net labour supply if general equilibrium effects are taken into account? And what would be the impact of a rise in labour supply on low-income earners when indirect effects, such as a decline in wage rates, are accounted for? In an attempt to provide answers to these questions, we conduct policy simulations with a newly developed general equilibrium model with nearly 30,000 families to assess the net impact of this refundable tax credit on households’ labour market participation, low-income families and income distribution. In addition, to ensure that households’ behaviour is properly captured in the model, we have empirically estimated labour supply elasticities by household composition and income bracket for model calibration. Three scenarios are simulated taking into account increased work incentives for low-income earners (Scenario 1), labour market participation of social assistance recipients (Scenario 2), and the risk of higher marginal tax rates when this tax credit is phased-out (Scenario 3). At the aggregate level, the results show positive but modest impacts on labour supply and GDP, as well as a decline in low-income rates and income inequality. At the micro level, the shocks affect particularly labour market participation of low- and medium-skilled lone-parent families. These positive effects on labour supply translate into higher after-tax incomes leading to a decline in low-income rates and low-income gaps. Regarding the impact on inequality (as measured by the Gini index), we find a decline across all household categories, especially lone parents. Finally, robustness analysis is performed showing that the declines in the low-income rate and inequality at the aggregate level are statistically significant only under Scenarios 1 and 2. Nevertheless, the results show that all three scenarios lead to an alleviation of the low-income gap (as measured by the amount of money by which each household falls below the low-income threshold). We present a brief literature review on income supplements in Section 2. Sections 3 and 4 describe the main features of the model and the data used for its calibration. Policy simulations and analysis are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",2

Unemployment rates in MENA are among the highest in the world, and the region has a large share of untapped human resources. Female labor force participation, at 25.4 percent in the Middle East and 28.1 percent in North Africa, is significantly lower than the world average of 51.6 percent (World Bank 2013).1 Youth unemployment is higher in the Middle East (19 percent) and North Africa (25 percent) than in any other developing region. At the same time, population growth in MENA is also among the highest in the world, with a demographic transition in which the youth bulge (ages 15–24) accounts for about 30 percent of the overall population, compared to 18 percent worldwide (World Bank 2013). Although unemployment rates in MENA are high and rising, employers in the region are still struggling to fill vacancies primarily due to a shortage of candidates with the relevant qualifications and skills (World Bank 2013). Indeed, more than half of employers in MENA identify skills mismatches as a major constraint to doing business and to firm growth, according to enterprise surveys. This percentage is the highest among developing regions (World Bank 2013). A combination of inadequate skills and lack of information about existing vacancies is contributing to critical labor market failures that restraint employment mobility. This is confirmed by available data from employment agencies throughout the region suggesting that thousands of vacancies are not being filled, despite the existence of thousands of individuals who are both willing and able to work (see Angel-Urdinola et al. 2013 and Belghazi 2012). Available evidence also indicates important constraints to labor market transitions in MENA (World Bank 2013). Recent work shows that while the school-to-work transition in developed countries generally takes less than two years (measured as the difference between the age at which 50 percent of the population has left education and the age at which 50 percent has found employment), in many MENA countries it takes over five years (World Bank 2013; Angel-Urdinola and Semlali 2010). Moreover, private and public formal employment networks play a limited role in labor intermediation (Gatti et al. 2012). In a context where skills mismatches prevail, unemployment soars, information about job opportunities is asymmetric, and there seems to be vacancies that cannot be filled, ALMPs could help to enhance labor mobility and improve job matching. Available evidence suggests that ALMPs do not have a good track record of improving labor market outcomes in developing countries. However, poor performance of ALMPs should not lead to the conclusion that they are not a relevant policy instrument to address labor market challenges. Instead, the causes of their apparent failure need to be closely examined. Existing analytical studies and evaluations suggest that ALMPs in developing countries suffer from poor design and implementation as well as from inappropriate governance and accountability arrangements that reduce incentives to respond to the needs of job seekers and employers (Betcherman et al. 2004; Card et al. 2010; Kuddo 2009; Rodriguez-Planas and Benus 2010). This study offers a comprehensive look at the problems facing publicly provided ALMPs in a selected group of MENA countries, takes stock at some initiatives that seem to have had positive results in the region, and proposes a policy reform agenda to improve effectiveness and delivery of ALMPs in the region. Admittedly, ALMPs should not be seen as substitutes for private-led employment creation or as a solution to the many structural constraints of the region’s labor market, such as stagnant labor demand, low productivity, low competitiveness, and high informality. However, if well designed and effectively delivered, ALMPs could be a mechanism for addressing high unemployment rates, all while providing the region’s population with some immediate and concrete results.",2
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,24 September 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-2-12,Designing and implementing unemployment benefit systems in middle and low income countries: beyond risk-pooling vs savings,December 2013,David A Robalino,Michael Weber,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As part of the objective of achieving more flexibility for employers while better protecting workers, several countries have been considering the adoption (or reform) of unemployment benefit systems. Policy discussions then often revolve around the question of whether to adopt an unemployment insurance (UI) scheme or unemployment individual savings accounts (UISAs). Proponents of the first emphasize its ability to pool risks and introduce an element of solidarity. Critics highlight its potentially negative effects on labor supply as individuals would have fewer incentives to seek, take or keep jobs. The evidence, which comes mainly from OECD countries, is in general mixed.1 (There are various studies for high income countries showing that unemployment spells and the unemployment rate tend to increase as the level of benefits and/or their duration increases (see Ribe et al. 2012; chapter 5, Lalive 2008, or Lalive et al. 2005). Chetty (2004, 2008) and Chetty and Looney (2006) reveal a welfare increasing income effect of unemployment benefits which is particularly important in the presence of inefficient private insurance markets and high risk aversion. Chetty (2004, 2008) highlights that the income effect is significant for liquidity constrained households, since unemployment benefits increase the opportunity for consumption while unemployed. This, in turn, reduces the need for job search which leads to a substitution effect. If workers are unconstrained, this income effects is broadly not existing. The substitution effect and the income effect have contrasting welfare implications (see Chetty and Looney 2006). At the same time, more generous benefits can give workers more flexibility to search for jobs and lead to better matches. Recent analysis for European countries confirm this argument Tatsiramos (2009). Unemployment individual savings accounts have both, proponents and opposers. The main advantage over UI which has been emphasized in the literature is that, because benefits are financed out of individuals' savings, workers have better incentives to seek and take jobs (Robalino et al. 2009). Indeed, balances in the individual account can, under certain conditions, be used to finance investments such as education or the purchase of a house, or to increase the pension’s value upon retirement. The main criticism, however, is that in their pure form they do not provide enough protection to workers, particularly low skilled workers who tend to have shorter contributions densities (and therefore lower savings) and might have more frequent periods of unemployment. The fact that benefits are often paid as a lump sum can also be problematic as there is a risk that workers over consume and run out of savings before having found a job. In addition, since benefits are financed only out of savings, contributions rates are usually high (e.g., 8 percent to finance one month of unemployment benefits after 12 months of contributions) and this can reduce incentives to enroll or game the system. Below market interest rates on savings can have the same effect, particularly when access to credit is constrained and individuals cannot 'dis-save'. In the case of Brazil, for instance, there is evidence of increases in turnover as workers try to cash-out part of the savings in their accounts (World Bank 2009). In this paper we argue that UI and UISAs are, in fact, particular cases of a more general design and that the key policy choice is in terms of how redistribution is financed. Indeed, as in the case of UISAs, unemployment insurance programs also rely on some type of individual accounting since it is necessary to track contributions (which condition eligibility for benefits) as well as the payment of benefits (to assess when to terminate them). The essential difference between the two systems is that in the case of UI any positive balance in the accounts is taxed at a 100 percent rate. It is the revenue from this implicit tax that is used to subsidize the accounts with negative balances allowing the system to guarantee a certain level of benefits during a given period of time, regardless of the level of individual contributions accumulated in the account. In the case of UISAs the savings in the accounts are not taxed, but the level of protection is lower - many workers will only be able to finance a couple of months of unemployment benefits. To address this problem, countries such as Chile have created a 'solidarity fund' to top up the savings of the most vulnerable workers. In the Chilean case, the solidarity fund is financed by a combination of pay-roll taxes and general taxes. However, this is just one possible form of taxation. An alternative form of UISA could tax savings instead and decrease the payroll tax. This might reduce the incentives to save and, thus, find or keep jobs but as long as the tax is below 100 percent the incentives will be stronger than in the case of a pure UI system. We argue that making these policy choices explicit opens a broader range of possibilities for the design and implementation of unemployment benefit programs in middle and low income countries; designs that can create a better balance between incentives and protection. The paper is organized in five sections. In the next section, we provide a brief overview of unemployment benefit arrangements around the world to set the context. The section that follows introduces UI and UISAs as part of a more general design and identifies the key policy parameters that need to be chosen to create a continuum between the two systems. A continuum along which incentives for work and levels of protection move in opposite directions. The next two sections focus on the design and implementation of UB systems in middle and low income countries respectively. In terms of design we provide guidelines to set the mandate of the system (benefits and duration) and how to assess the tradeoffs between alternative mechanisms to finance redistribution. Regarding implementation, the focus is on institutional arrangements to manage the scheme; the types of conditionalities to pay benefits that need to be considered and enforcement mechanisms; and mechanisms to contract and pay providers of services. The paper ends with a short summary of its main messages and policy implications.",3

In 2010/11, at the time of the Arab Spring, around one in five graduates in North Africa were unemployed1 In Tunisia, cradle of the revolutions which swept across the MENA region, it is widely believed that graduate unemployment was one of the major causes. Indeed, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor in the rural town of Sidi Bouzid had set himself on fire on 17th December 2010 (the incident which sparked the Tunisian revolution), he was believed to be an unemployed graduate desperately trying to scrape together a living.2 In post-revolution Tunisia, graduate unemployment continues to be a major cause of social unrest, and the new government has made it one of its top priorities. The causes of graduate unemployment in Tunisia are complex, and both demand and supply factors are at play. On the supply side, previous governments have made heavy investments in education. Tunisia’s first president after independence, Habib Bourguiba, made education free and compulsory until the age of 16. Large cohorts of young people completing basic education led, in turn, to the expansion of upper secondary education (partly under pressure of the international donor community) and, because passing the baccalaureate in Tunisia provides automatic entry into higher education, this put pressure on the government to increase the number of university places, which are provided free of charge. As a means of satisfying this popular demand, higher education experienced a rapid expansion under Tunisia’s second president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, from fewer than 12,000 graduates in 1993/94 to 86,000 in 2009/10. This seven-fold increase in the number of university graduates came at the expense of quality, and was matched by an equally large increase in the graduate unemployment rate over the same period. In 1994/95, just 3.8% of graduates were unemployed. By 2009/10, nearly a quarter were.3 At the same time, few jobs were being created. The ILO (2011) has estimated that, between 2004 and 2007, there were 77,000 net jobs created - the majority of which were low-skilled. At the same time, the labour force increased by nearly 190,000 and, as pointed out above, included many young university graduates entering the labour market for the first time. Tackling graduate unemployment in Tunisia will need a multi-pronged approach, including education reforms, private sector development, but also changes in labour market institutions, and a range of active labour market policies to help graduates’ transition from education into work. The focus in this paper is on the latter type of policies. More specifically, it looks at the Stage d’Initiation à la Vie Professionelle (Initiation into the World of Work - SIVP), an employment subsidy (or hiring credit)4 aimed at incentivising employers to take on first-time job-seekers and, until recently, Tunisia’s largest active labour market programme. In 2010, the national SIVP budget was approximately TND 45.5 million (or around EUR 22 million).5 The programme has also rapidly grown in size: the number of graduates benefiting from a SIVP has increased from under 15,000 in 2004 to just over 45,000 in 2011 (ANETI 2011). Given the seriousness of graduate unemployment in Tunisia, the urgency to do something about it, and the importance of the SIVP in the government’s employment strategy, an assessment of the programme is timely. Despite the fact that such policies are widely used in the North Africa region (e.g. Idmaj in Morocco and CTA in Algeria), few studies have critically assessed them in any great detail. In one notable exception in the case of Tunisia, Marouani (2010) uses a dynamic general equilibrium model to compare a range of alternative labour market policies, including the SIVP, and concludes that the latter (if targeted at highly skilled intensive sectors) is more effective than tax reductions or investment subsidies at generating jobs, but not enough to reduce unemployment significantly.6 More generally, there is little systematic analysis on the effectiveness of active labour market policies in the MENA region (Angel-Urdinola et al. 2010). To a large extent, this is a result of a lack of transparency on the part of previous regimes and an unwillingness to accept criticism of government policies. Today, with post-revolutionary and elected governments in place in a number of these countries, there is a renewed opportunity to change the way policy is made, and make it more evidence-based. Although such evidence is still rare, there are signs that things may be changing. In Tunisia, for instance, a recent paper by Premand et al. (2012) discusses a randomised controlled trial of entrepreneurship training for university graduates. The authors conclude that, although the programme had small effects on the likelihood of self-employment, it had no effect on employment rates overall. This evidence makes it all the more important to explore the effectiveness of other programmes (such as the SIVP) to see which interventions might be effective at tackling graduate unemployment. The purpose of this paper is to help fill this gap in the literature. The data used in the paper come from a graduate tracer study (GTS) of a representative sample of over 4,700 university graduates who qualified in 2004 and were interviewed in both 2005 (around one and a half years after graduation) and 2007 (around three and a half years after graduation). This dataset also contains a “calendar” recording monthly activities over the entire period since graduation (44 months). The data are not experimental and, as will become clear from the descriptive analysis, selection into the programme is not random. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) will be used to try and compare treated and untreated individuals. The data allow the investigation of a wide range of outcomes, including joblessness, unemployment, sector of employment, as well as job quality and earnings. The analysis shows clearly that SIVP beneficiaries have lower joblessness and unemployment rates, and that they are much more likely to be hired in the private sector - although these results cannot be interpreted as causal since the identification strategy used is not strong enough to make such inferences. The paper does highlight some key design aspects of the policy which need to be amended if it is to have a greater impact on the employment rates of graduates. In particular, greater targeting of those graduates facing the highest risk of unemployment would enhance the effectiveness of the programme and reduce the deadweight loss. In addition, it is likely that combining the programme with other interventions (like training, counselling and job search assistance) would also improve its effectiveness (Katz 1996; Kluve 2006). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 'Employment subsidies' reviews the literature on employment subsidies and summarises their effectiveness in generating employment, as well as the design features associated with the most successful programmes. Section 'The SIVP programme' then explains the workings of the Tunisian SIVP programme at the time the graduates in the dataset were observed. Section 'Data and descriptive statistics' discusses the data and describes the characteristics of SIVP beneficiaries. Section 'Unemployment and participation in the SIVP programme' looks in more detail at the attributes associated with selection into the programme, and Section 'SIVP participation and employment outcomes' provides a brief overview of the methodologies used and presents the results from the analysis. Section 'Discussion and conclusion' concludes, calculates the cost-effectiveness of the programme, and offers some recommendations on how to improve employment subsidies in Tunisia (or, indeed, elsewhere).",13
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,08 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-2-8,Fiscal consolidation and unemployment: does EPL matter?: A look at EU countries,December 2013,Alessandro Turrini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the outburst of the of the 2008 financial crisis, Europe is witnessing a worrying upsurge in unemployment and an unprecedented degree of dispersion of unemployment rates. The implementation of major and protracted fiscal consolidation strategies in such a context, and without prospects of a stable worldwide recovery, has stimulated debate on the growth and employment impact of consolidation measures, with implications for the coordination of timing and modalities of budgetary adjustment across EU countries (e.g., Corsetti, 2012). Despite these concerns, a number of EU countries not only have recently put in place ambitious fiscal consolidation plans, but have also at the same time carried out major labour market reforms. In particular, the notoriously rigid and hard-to-reform Employment Protection legislation (EPL) systems of Southern European countries have been profoundly shaken with a view to stimulate job creation and tackle the problem of labour market segmentation at a juncture where severe budgetary cuts to reassure markets and put public finances on a sustainable footing where necessary. Against this background, this paper aims at addressing a number of questions: to what extent continued fiscal consolidation across Europe would impact on unemployment? Which type of consolidation, expenditure or revenue-based, would be most employment-friendly? Does the impact of fiscal consolidation on unemployment come mostly from the job destruction side or does job creation play a relevant role as well? How do employment protection reforms interact with fiscal consolidation in determining unemployment and labour market flows? Are budgetary cuts more harmful when dismissals are less costly? The analysis presented in this paper builds on various streams of existing literature. The literature on large episodes of fiscal consolidation focuses on the possible expansionary effects linked to the forward-looking behaviour of agents (e.g., Giavazzi and Pagano, 1990; Alesina et al., 2002) and on the effectiveness of these episodes in durably improving the state of public finances (e.g., Alesina and Ardagna, 1998). Another stream of literature focuses on the estimation of fiscal multipliers. Most of the empirical literature based on structural VARs identifies fiscal shocks from a-priori information on the impact of the cycle on revenues and expenditures and generally find significantly positive multipliers, but seldom larger than one (e.g., Blanchard and Perotti, 2002; Perotti, 2005). Analyses based on a “narrative”, “action-based” approach to the identification of fiscal shocks, which requires a bottom-up computation of discretionary fiscal measures reported in official documents, also estimate significantly positive multipliers, but values are often large, well above unity (e.g., Romer and Romer, 2010; Guajardo et al., 2011). Most empirical analyses on the impact of fiscal policy focus on output, and only few papers look at the unemployment and labour market impact. Monacelli et al. (2010) develop a structural VAR for the US and estimate a negative and significant impact of government spending on unemployment and job creation, while job destruction falls. Brückner and Pappa (2012) estimate structural VARs for a number of OECD countries and show that government spending can actually raise employment and unemployment at the same time, due to the fact that it also increases participation. The aim of this paper is to fill gaps in the existing literature in two main respects. First, it presents estimates of the impact of fiscal policy on unemployment and job market flows on EU countries: evidence is scarce for these countries. Second, it aims at shedding light on the interaction between fiscal consolidation and labour market regulation in driving labour market developments. The baseline measure of fiscal consolidation used in the analysis is the action-based fiscal consolidation variable constructed in Devries et al. (2011), which present the double advantage of not including cyclical elements and being largely exogenous. As a countercheck, a “top-down” fiscal consolidation variable based on the cyclical adjustment of budgetary data is also used. The impact of fiscal consolidation is assessed on cyclical unemployment, on job separation and finding rates (hazard rates), and on the share of long-term unemployment. In light of limited sample size, econometric analysis spans the whole available panel of data for EU countries, but separate analysis is carried out for countries with a high vs. low degree of employment regulation. Results confirm the finding that fiscal consolidation, notably government expenditure cuts have a significant although temporary impact on unemployment, which comes both from an increase in job destruction and a reduction in job creation. Interestingly, this unemployment impact does not differ much between high or low-EPL countries. There are considerable differences instead for what concerns job market flows, with fiscal consolidation in high-EPL countries having a much less strong impact on job destruction but also leading to a more pronounced reduction in job finding rates and, therefore, to a higher share of long-term unemployment. Such results apply to EPL for regular contracts, while countries with low EPL for temporary contracts simply exhibit a higher unemployment response to consolidation associated to increased job separation flows, with no significant difference for what concerns job finding rates and long-term unemployment. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section the data and the empirical strategy are illustrated. Section 3 presents results. The last section concludes with remarks on policy implications and suggestions for further analysis.",8
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,01 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-2-7,Wage discrimination over the business cycle,December 2013,Jeff E Biddle,Daniel S Hamermesh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"For nearly 50 years the measurement of wage differentials between racial and ethnic groups, and between genders, has been a mainstay of empirical labor economics. Nearly all of the empirical work has implicitly been grounded in Becker’s (1957) taste-based approach; and almost the entire oeuvre survey (Cain,has either measured cross-section differentials or considered trends in these differences, which we, following the literature, refer to throughout as “discriminatory.” Relative to the attention paid to cross-section differences and trends in wage effects, remarkably little attention has been paid to how these differentials vary with the extent of labor-market tightness. The issue was mentioned only in passing in the first Handbook1986) and was not even alluded to in subsequent Handbook surveys (Altonji and Blank, 1999;Fryer 2011). A few studies from the 1970s and 1980s did attempt to measure the cyclicality of discriminatory wage differentials (Ashenfelter, 1970;Freeman, 1973;O’Neill, 1985), analyzing aggregate time series of the ratio of annual earnings of disadvantaged compared to other workers. Measured cyclical movements in ratios of earnings per hour could arise from two distinct mechanisms: changes over the cycle in the characteristics of the workers in each group (composition effects) and changes over the cycle in pure wage discrimination. The authors recognized this and pointed to both mechanisms as reasons for expecting cyclicality in measured discriminatory wage gaps. Discussions of composition effects pointed to the greater “vulnerability” of women and minorities to cycle-related job loss, but also noted the tendency for women and minorities to be employed in more stable, albeit lower-wage, industries. Both O’Neill and Freeman concluded that composition effects led to a counter-cyclical movement in measured discriminatory wage differentials. Freeman and Ashenfelter offered reasons for suspecting that true wage discrimination would also be counter-cyclical, with the latter referring to an apparently common argument of the time that the perceived cost to employers of discriminating was higher in tight labor markets. But neither found empirical evidence of cyclical movements in pure wage discrimination in the aggregate data. Since the mid-1990s, despite the continuing volatility of aggregate and local labor markets, including the turmoil caused by the Great Recession, almost no attention has been given to the relationship between labor market tightness and discriminatory wage differentials. Numerous studies have used the CPS and other individual level data sets to study longer-term movements in discriminatory wage differentials, but with almost no mention made of the possible cyclicality of such differentials1. This neglect seems unfortunate for policy purposes: We know the implications and concerns for the prospects of different demographic groups’ employment as aggregate demand changes: Blacks and Hispanics’ employment is more volatile than that of whites, while men’s employment has been more volatile than women’s, especially during the Great Recession. But knowing how the relative prices of an hour of workers’ time vary over the cycle across these different race/ethnicity gender groups, after accounting for other characteristics, is just as important. Total earnings, adjusted for unchanging personal characteristics that affect earnings, is a crucial input into measuring well-being and its cyclical variation. Careful measurement of cyclical changes in relative wages is thus an essential step in inferring the path of cyclical changes in the relative well-being of different groups. In this study we provide this measurement. In the next section we document the paths of wage differentials by gender (female/male), ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic) and race (black/white), using the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS-MORG) from 1979 through 2009. This is a sufficiently long period to cover four (or five, if one considers the early 1980s recessions as distinct) aggregate cycles. Since the CPS-MORG files provide individual level data with industry and geographic identifiers, we can measure more accurately the labor market environment facing each worker; and the longitudinal component of the CPS-MORG data allows us to distinguish changes in measured wage differentials due to changes in pure wage discrimination from those due to composition effects, both observable and unobservable. We find that the male–female wage gap is counter-cyclical, that is, the wage disadvantage faced by women grows when and where unemployment is temporarily higher. This does not appear to be due to a composition effect, but rather to changes in pure wage discrimination. The measured discriminatory gap for African-Americans, on the other hand, is pro-cyclical, but this is partly the result of composition effects. The cyclical behavior of the wage disadvantage faced by Hispanics is unclear. Section 3 sets out a search-theoretic model of discrimination to aid in interpreting the evidence. We show that a standard random search model with employer discrimination implies a cost to employers of indulging discriminatory tastes that varies pro-cyclically, thus providing a formal version of the argument cited in early work; but the model also points to other ways that discriminatory wage differentials will be affected by a changing unemployment-vacancy ratio that work in the opposite direction. One implication of this model, that economic fluctuations will change discriminatory wage differentials chiefly through their impact on the wage changes experienced by job-changers, is supported in the data.",27

In 1983, the famous “A Nation at Risk” report cited declines and low levels in student achievement relative to other countries in terms of math and verbal tests, functional illiteracy, weak high order skills, and the need for remedial math courses in public colleges, businesses, and the military (National Commission on Excellence in Education1983). Today, commentators, researchers, and policymakers continue to decry the state of American education. In a 2009 column, Thomas Friedman approvingly quotes a former business executive, who argues, “Our education failure is the largest contributing factor to the decline of the American worker’s global competitiveness, particularly at the middle and bottom ranges.” Economists have generated a body of evidence showing that cognitive skills are increasingly important in achieving high earnings. The sharp rise in the wages of college graduates relative to high school graduates indicates that employers will pay an increasingly high premium to employ workers with higher level academic skills. The need for a nontrivial level of cognitive skills extends to at-risk groups of workers, including high school dropouts. Evidence shows higher math scores are positively correlated with higher earnings (Tyler2004). The relative earnings gains for women are linked in significant ways to occupational shifts that involve rising demand for cognitive skills (Bacolod and Blum2010). While cognitive skills in reading and math up to some level are generally prerequisites for good jobs, a growing body of evidence suggests that non-academic skills are at least as powerful determinants of earnings. Until recently, information on the non-academic skills of a large sample of workers was not readily available and was certainly less common than data on educational attainment and tests of academic skills. Often, non-academic skills were considered as part of a residual impact not captured by school attainment or measured test scores. However, new data sources and innovative techniques have begun to shed light on the importance of non-academic skills, especially for at-risk youth. Non-academic skills cover a wide scope. As Borghans et al. (2008) and Almlund et al. (2011) have argued, the term “non-cognitive skills” is not appropriate for summarizing personality and other non-academic skills since cognitive skills influence and are influenced by aspects of personality; they point out that “…few aspects of behavior are devoid of cognition.” Easy distinctions elude academic and non-academic skills as well. Certainly, math, reading, and writing abilities are relevant to learning a range of occupational skills. On the other hand, remaining drug-free, honesty, and punctuality are behaviors that are not necessarily linked with cognitive skills. Still other, hard to measure skills, such as creativity and problem-solving, likely depend on cognitive abilities. Unfortunately, at-risk young men have experienced stagnating educational attainment, weak and stagnant wages, high unemployment, incarceration, unwed fatherhood, and family instability. Yet, despite rising levels of per pupil spending on elementary and secondary schools, the educational and more importantly the job outcomes for low-income and minority students (especially males) are disappointing and show little progress. The nation’s publicly sponsored job training programs, targeted mainly at the disadvantaged, have fared little better. For example, an experimental evaluation of the Job Training Partnership Act found no impacts of earnings gains from participation (Orr et al.1996). A major emphasis on youth programs in the late 1970s yielded at best mixed results (Hahn and Lerman1985). Why have so many initiatives in education, work experience and training led to uneven or poor outcomes for young people? One possibility is the difficulty of teaching academic skills. Another possibility is that the initiatives either do not emphasize or successfully teach employability and occupational skills, which may especially important to a young person’s success. Many programs funded as job training spend considerable time preparing participants for an alternative high school credential (the GED test) despite evidence that the earnings gains from passing the GED test are weak (Heckman and LaFontaine2006).1 Possibly, developing effective employability skills requires learning in the context of actual workplaces. The widespread evidence of gains to work experience in the human capital literature may reflect the improvement of such non-academic skills as listening, working effectively in teams, maintaining work discipline, and reliability. Thus, even employment and training programs that do not explicitly target non-academic skills may help young people improve then by raising their chance of finding and staying on an initial job. This paper considers two central questions about skills and earnings. The first asks: what are the relevant skills for success in the labor market, especially for at-risk workers and those holding middle skills jobs? The next section describes non-academic and occupational skills and their importance for success in the job market. The second question is: what interventions have increased non-academic skills and/or occupational skills and helped participants do better in the job market? The review deals with programs aimed at non-academic, employability and occupational skills as well as programs affecting non-academic skills as a byproduct of other activities. Then, the paper discusses potential barriers to upgrading non-academic skills, especially barriers within the school system. I conclude by highlighting the need for more research and measurement on methods to raise non-academic skills, specifically by analyzing the role of dual learning and earning models that combine work with schooling in an integrated manner.",21
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,29 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-2-5,The role of short-time work schemes during the global financial crisis and early recovery: a cross-country analysis,December 2013,Alexander Hijzen,Sebastien Martin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Short-time work (STW) programmes are public schemes that are intended to preserve jobs at firms experiencing temporarily low demand by encouraging work-sharing, while also providing income-support to workers whose hours are reduced due to a shortened workweek or temporary lay-offs. A crucial aspect of all STW schemes is that the contract of an employee with the firm is maintained during the period of STW or the suspension of work. The main purpose of STW schemes is to avoid “excessive” layoffs, that is, the permanent dismissal of workers during an economic downturn whose jobs would be viable in the longer-term. In an environment where firms are risk-neutral and they can fully insure their employees, excessive layoffs are effectively ruled out (Burdett and Wright, 1989). However, in an environment where firms are financially constrained, as during a credit crunch, a well-designed STW scheme may help to increase welfare (Braun et al., 2011). Moreover, STW schemes may also help to improve equity by sharing the burden of adjustment more equally across the workforce (OECD, 2009)1. There has been a strong interest in STW schemes during the global financial crisis in OECD countries. Most governments in countries with existing schemes took specific measures in response to the crisis to promote their use, while several others established new ones. The interest among firms and workers in STW schemes, as measured in terms of take-up, also tended to be substantial. Across the 25 OECD countries that operated a STW scheme during the global financial crisis, take-up increased from a negligible amount in 2007 to over 1% of dependent employment in 2009. This corresponds to over 4.5 million workers across the OECD. However, the use of STW differed substantially across countries. At its peak, take-up amounted to over 7% in Belgium, around 4 to 5% in Germany and Japan and around 1 to 2% in Austria, Czech Republic, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. In other countries with STW schemes it remained below 1%. The use of STW declined considerably during 2010 as a result of the initial economic recovery, with the decline in the use of STW in response to the improvement in economic conditions in the early recovery being similar to the increase in response to the deterioration in aggregate demand during the crisis2. Given the size and prominence of STW schemes during the global financial crisis, it is important to evaluate their impact. Two approaches have been used: firm-level and country-level approaches. The basic idea of firm-level studies is to assess the causal impact of STW by comparing outcomes of firms that make use of STW with those of comparable firms that do not. The main challenge is to overcome the selection problem that arises because firms that participate in STW schemes tend to be less competitive than other firms that can serve as a control group. As this turns out to be very difficult in practice, many previous firm-level studies have either concluded that STW is counter-productive or that it is not possible to overcome the selection problem with the available data3. The study by Boeri and Brucker (2011) represents a notable exception. They propose a plausible instrument based on the experience of firms with STW before the crisis. This is a valid instrument as long as prior use is a good predictor of use during the crisis and output demand shocks during the crisis are uncorrelated with shocks before the crisis, which appears to be the case. They find that STW increases employment growth and that the effect increases in size once the endogeneity of STW with respect to employment growth is taken into account. Unfortunately, using the same data and a similar strategy, but a somewhat more sophisticated specification, Bellman et al. (2012) were unable to confirm these results. As most other firm-level studies, their results indicate that STW increases the output elasticity of employment, possibly due to a problem of weak instruments. In the light of the mixed success of firm-level studies in identifying the causal impact of STW, aggregate approaches in the spirit of Abraham and Houseman (1994) and Van Audenrode (1994) provide a potentially fruitful alternative. Hijzen and Venn (2010) provide an early assessment of the impact of STW schemes on preserving jobs during the crisis. Their estimates support the conclusion that STW schemes had an economically important impact, with the largest impacts of STW on employment in Germany and Japan among the countries considered. However, the positive impact of STW was limited to workers with permanent contracts, thereby further increasing labour market segmentation between workers in regular jobs and workers in temporary jobs. The estimated jobs impact was smaller than the potential number of jobs saved as implied by the full-time equivalent number of participants in STW. This suggests that STW schemes end up supporting some jobs that would have been maintained in the absence of the subsidy. Subsequent studies by Boeri and Brucker (2011) and Cahuc and Carcillo (2011), who make use of largely the same dataset but employed somewhat different estimation strategies, reached similar conclusions4. This paper also analyses the quantitative effects of STW programmes on employment and hours by exploiting the country and time variation in STW take-up rates. It provides an update on the initial assessment by Hijzen and Venn (2010) by extending the time and country coverage of the dataset from 2004 Q1-2009 Q3 to 2004 Q1-2010 Q4 and from 19 to 23 countries5. The use of more recent data is important as it allows analysing the impact of STW not just during the crisis, but also during the early phase of the recovery. The econometric analysis takes account of differences in institutional settings across countries that might affect the relationship between labour market outcomes and output and addresses the potential endogeneity of STW take-up with respect to labour market conditions using the age of the programme as an instrument. Moreover, special attention is given to model the dynamic aspects of the relationship between output, employment and working time. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides information on the institutional features of STW schemes as they operated during the global financial crisis as well as suggestive evidence on the role of these features for take up. Section 3 presents the econometric framework, while Section 4 discusses the data. Section 5 provides a qualitative discussion of the results based on the econometric estimates, while Section 6 discusses their quantitative implications in terms of the number of permanent jobs saved since the start of the global financial crisis. Section 7 presents simple simulations in order to illustrate how the role of STW changes under different assumptions about the persistence of the output shocks and the use of STW during the economic recovery. Section 8 concludes.",30

Yet when the present welfare state was being designed, this was far from people’s minds. In his famous report on welfare reform in Britain, William Beveridge identified as the main problems of society five great giants which needed to be slain: they were poverty, unemployment, poor education, bad housing and disease (by which he meant of course physical disease)1. Over the 70 years since his report most advanced countries have made huge strides on all of these fronts, except at times unemployment. But there is still widespread misery – and what surveys we have of happiness and misery suggest things have changed little since Beveridge wrote. So what did he and his fellow reformers miss? They overlooked the human factor – the problems that come from inside ourselves (and not mainly from externals). It is because of the human factor that, despite unparalleled prosperity and mostly high employment, we now observe more family conflict, less trust and more crime, than when Beveridge wrote. And this in turn helps to explain the need which so many people feel for a new metric to measure the progress of society.",4

In these countries, it typically offers good protection: it covers the majority of employed persons, irrespective of occupation or industry, and provides adequate smoothening of consumption patterns. In the early 1990s, transition countries also introduced UI programs, and their use in developing countries is on the rise as well. The incidence of unemployment benefit programs is strongly related to the level of development (see Vodopivec2004). But prompted by increased exposure to foreign markets and fearing future global crises, more and more developing countries (including lower middle-income countries such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka) are contemplating to introduce UI. Such considerations are bolstered by the potential efficiency and distributive advantages of reforming social protection programs for workers in developing countries. Namely, in many developing countries the balance between job and worker protection is tilted in the favor of the former: virtually all have – typically exceedingly restrictive – severance pay programs, and very few have UI programs (see Holzmann et al.2012). It is often argued that removing excessive job protection would not only boost the creation of more and better jobs, but also improve job prospects for vulnerable groups (see, for example, Heckman and Pagés2004). And it goes without saying that reducing job protection is an extremely sensitive task that can often be implemented only if accompanied by introducing or strengthening income protection programs for workers – UI being one of them. While providing an excellent opportunity to bolster both worker protection and economic efficiency, the introduction of UI programs in developing countries poses major challenges. When is a country ready to introduce an UI program? Which factors influence whether UI programs operate successfully and how can the programs’ design be adjusted with respect to coverage, eligibility rules, the generosity of benefit, structure of incentives, and monitoring? In particular, how to account for factors such as a lack of administrative capacity, a large informal sector, and the profoundly different nature of unemployment in developing countries? To address these questions, the paper analyzes key labor market and institutional features of developing countries that affect the functioning of UI: a large informal sector, weak administrative capacity, and large political risk. It argues that these countries should tailor an OECD-style UI program to their circumstances, among others by relying on self-insurance (via unemployment insurance savings accounts), complemented by solidarity funding, as a key source of financing; by simplifying monitoring of job-search behavior and labor market status; and by piggybacking on existing networks to administer benefits. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 addresses a difficult question of whether and when developing countries should introduce UI. Section 3 provides stylized facts about the UI program, focusing on its income protection as well as efficiency properties, thereby outlining possible opportunities to strengthen worker protection of countries contemplating UI introduction and establishing limits of such endeavor. Section 4 discusses how to adjust program design to account for developing countries’ specific circumstances, and section 5 concludes.",23

In Europe, many countries have a type of apprenticeship programme that combines education in school and in the workplace. While a portion of apprenticeship models are predominantly school-based and only feature short work placements, other models require apprentices to spend up to 80 per cent of their time with the training firm1. Obviously, a firm’s costs associated with the training provided in the workplace not only increase with the length of the work placement but also with the intensity of the training provided during the work placement (as defined by training regulations). While a firm may find it less costly to provide firm-specific skills that can be learned on the job without much interruption of the production process, teaching apprentices more general skills may be more costly. Nonetheless, depending on the duration of an apprenticeship, firms may well benefit from an increased skill level on the part of their apprentices because it raises their productivity toward the end of the training period. However, apprentices typically also receive pay that (partially) compensates for their productive contribution. Consequently, the pay structure within firms and imposed minimum wages for apprentices are highly important when calculating the costs and benefits to a firm from training apprentices. Although high apprentice pay makes an apprenticeship more attractive for youth than school-based education (because it lowers the opportunity costs of acquiring education), high apprentice pay lowers a firm’s incentives to provide high quality training that goes beyond providing merely the firm-specific skills necessary to perform work within the firm. Accepting low apprentice pay may still be an attractive way for young people to finance their education, as long as training regulations are defined such that apprenticeship training provides sufficient general skills that are nationally certified and therefore valued by many other firms. Put differently, as long as apprenticeship training results in a sufficiently high rate of return to education, low apprentice pay may serve as an efficient device to privately finance education, rather than serving as an indicator of apprentice exploitation. Thus, depending on where most of the training takes place (in the firm or at school) and the extent to which apprentices are reimbursed for the value of their productive work, the financing scheme for a particular apprenticeship system varies accordingly. In a number of European countries with apprenticeship systems, the expenses related to apprenticeship training are borne entirely by the government, or similarly, governments reimburse firms for their expenses during the time that apprentices are in work placements.2 In other countries, particularly when apprentices spend more time in work placements, the private sector makes substantial investments in apprenticeship training but also expects corresponding returns on its investments. In the parts of this paper where we will illustrate our arguments with empirical data, we have to heavily rely on data collected in Germany and Switzerland for the simple reason that representative data on the costs and benefits of apprenticeship only exist for these two countries3. In the remainder of this article, we will discuss the different components of training costs and what types of training benefits a firm can expect, taking into account important external factors that influence the profitability of apprenticeship training and thereby also considering a firm’s training strategy and behaviour.",35

This is a long-standing issue that has been confronted in different ways beginning with research in the early part of the last century (Neumark et al., 2014). In the current incarnation of this debate, Dube et al. (2010, hereafter DLR) and Allegretto et al. (2011, hereafter ADR) have argued that to obtain valid estimates of minimum wage effects it is essential to control for “spatial heterogeneity”, using nearby geographic areas as controls to better account for where and when minimum wages are adopted or increased. Moreover, based on their specifications of how best to control for this spatial heterogeneity, DLR and ADR have put forward a severe critique of the findings from much of the existing U.S. evidence on the employment effects of minimum wages using state-level panel data. They argue that this evidence is biased because of “a spurious negative relationship between the minimum wage and employment for low wage workers…” (Dube 2011, p. 763), owing to minimum wages being adopted when there are negative shocks to the employment of affected workers unrelated to minimum wage effects. Their evidence in support of this claim comes from implementing two types of what they refer to as “local controls”. The first is the inclusion in their regression models of jurisdiction-specific linear time trends. The second is the inclusion of interactions between period dummy variables and dummy variables for sets of nearby states or neighboring counties, so that minimum wage effects are identified only net of common changes within these sets. Based on these two approaches, they argue (in DLR, for example) that there are “no detectable employment losses from the kind of minimum wage increases we have seen in the United States” (p. 962). In Neumark et al. (2014, hereafter NSW), we presented evidence that the methods advocated in these studies do not isolate more reliable identifying information (i.e., better comparison groups) and thus are flawed and lead to incorrect conclusions. In one case – the issue of state-specific trends – we explicitly demonstrate the problem with their methods and show how more appropriate ways of controlling for unobserved trends that affect teen employment lead to evidence of disemployment effects similar to past studies. In the other case – identifying minimum wage effects from the variation within Census divisions or, even more narrowly, within contiguous cross-border county pairs – we show that the exclusion of other regions or counties as potential controls is generally not supported by the data. Moreover, for regions where restricting the identifying variation in this way is supported by the data, the evidence is consistent with past findings of disemployment effects. Finally, when we let the data determine the appropriate control states to use for estimating the effects of state minimum wage increases in the Current Population Survey (CPS) data, we find evidence of disemployment effects for teens, with elasticities near −0.15. Most recently, Allegretto et al. (2013a, hereafter ADRZ) have criticized our conclusions, attacking much of our evidence. In the present paper, we lay out several issues that we see as forming the crux of this debate about the use of local controls to construct better comparison groups and provide our own analysis of these issues. In general, we find little basis for the alternative analyses and conclusions ADRZ present, and we conclude that the best evidence still points to job loss from minimum wages for low-skilled workers – in particular for teens.1 In our view, the key issue is whether the identifying assumptions entailed by ADR’s and DLR’s use of local controls lead to more biased or less biased estimates of the employment effect of minimum wages. Our previous work concluded that the assumptions implicit in their methods bias the estimated effect toward zero. The issue was not simply whether the variation left unused by DLR and ADR reduced the efficiency of their estimates of the employment effects of minimum wages. Labor economists often use approaches thought to reduce bias at the cost of less precise estimates. In the final section of this paper we provide a possible explanation for why limiting attention to local controls might produce a bias towards finding no employment effect and cite recent evidence from Baskaya and Rubinstein (2012) consistent with this explanation. At the same time, estimation of richer specifications prompted by some of the analyses presented by ADRZ undermines the conclusion that, for teens, including local controls reduces the estimated employment effect of the minimum wage. So in either case, the claim that controlling for spatial heterogeneity establishes that minimum wages do not reduce employment of unskilled workers is unfounded.2",27

Thomsen,Thomas Walter,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Benefit sanctions are used as part of the unemployment insurance and public welfare systems in many countries. Social welfare benefits have increasingly been made conditional on requirements such as active search for a job or participation in active labor market programs.1 Sanctions (or the threat to impose them) are intended to provide incentives for benefit recipients to comply with these requirements. The empirical literature on the effects of sanctions shows that benefit cuts often increase transitions from unemployment to employment.2 Yet, the strictness of sanctions differs considerably across countries, and there is no country that imposes sanctions for a first refusal of a job offer or a labor market program automatically (see Venn 2012). Tightening the sanction regime, therefore, is a relevant policy option. Given the evidence for sanction effects at the individual level, the question arises whether an intensified use of benefit sanctions would be effective. This question has not been investigated in the literature so far. To answer the question, we make use of a unique data set for Germany. The case of Germany is interesting because sanctions have become much more commonplace after the reform of the German welfare system in 2005. The obligation to actively search for employment and to participate in active labor market policy programs marked an important change in Germany’s welfare policy. For the first time, welfare recipients had become a target group of labor market activation. Benefit sanctions are now frequently imposed by welfare agencies in the form of a partial or a complete revocation of benefits for a certain period of time. Welfare agencies possess a high degree of discretion in individual sanction decisions, which results in substantial regional variation of sanction rates. While in some regions sanctions are imposed frequently, they are used rarely in other regions.3 Exploiting this regional variation, we follow an instrumental variable approach using information about sanctions across welfare agencies to identify the effect a stricter sanction policy would have.4 The data set for the empirical analysis combines information of a large survey of welfare benefits recipients with administrative information, collected at 154 welfare agencies in Germany. In addition to individual information, the data provide information on organizational aspects and strategies of the welfare agencies. In particular, we have access to survey information on the sanction strategy that is used in the respective welfare agency. The different sanction strategies of the welfare agencies as well as the differences in the frequency with which sanctions are actually imposed are used to instrument the selection process at the individual level and to estimate local average treatment effects (LATE, see Imbens and Angrist (1994)). Specifically, we estimate the effect of a sanction on individuals who are not sanctioned in a welfare agency with a moderate sanction policy, but who would be sanctioned if the agency would change its policy and would impose sanctions more frequently. The estimated LATEs can thus be interpreted as a measure of the effectiveness of an intensified use of benefit sanctions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some details of the German welfare system and the institutional setting of benefit sanctions. The data used in the empirical analysis is described in Section 3. Our empirical identification strategy is discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide the estimation results and the final section concludes.",22

Women, who tend to be part of the lower skilled or semi-skilled labor, the abundant factor in developing countries, should therefore gain from trade in both of these respects. Women can also gain through an additional path: increased competition through openness to international trade. A dynamic implication of the Becker (1971) model of discrimination is that increased international competition will reduce employer’s ability to engage in costly discrimination, and therefore improve women’s outcomes in the labor market. Alternative theories however, suggest that increased competition from trade might actually hurt those whose mobility is constrained, or have less bargaining power due to the threat of unemployment, while still helping others with higher skills and better options, thereby widening wage inequalities. These mixed theoretical predictions suggest that the effect of trade liberalization on women in the labor market depends on the nature of the liberalization process and the industrial composition of the economy being studied, and hence remains largely an empirical question. This study contributes new evidence on the relationship between increased openness to international trade and the change in earnings and employment disparities between men and women in Egypt, a key economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), for which this question has not been studied before. Egypt represents a particularly relevant setting for several reasons. In 1991, the Egyptian government initiated an economic reform and structural adjustment program (ERSAP) that aimed at transforming the heavily protected, state led economic development model that had been followed since the 1950s into a more market-based economy with greater openness to international trade. The program included three important elements that affected the labor market: increased openness to international trade, widespread privatization of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and reduction in government spending, which involved downsizing of employment in the government’s civil service sector. Between 1991 and 2009 tariff rates were slashed by more than 50% on average, more than half of the 314 state owned enterprises (SOEs) were privatized, and employment in the manufacturing public sector declined by more than 30%. However, these reforms have gone hand in hand with marked increases in market concentration in many industries and popular discontent with the reform program. It was widely believed that a small group of businessmen benefitted from the reforms1, while the majority of the working class population was left out, with poverty and inequality increasing2. During the same period, the status of women in the labor market in particular was deteriorating. Despite a long history of laws that purport to support “equal pay for equal work”, and a public sector that was known to discriminate favorably towards women, allowing them generous maternity and child care leaves for example, gender wage inequality increased during the reform period, especially in manufacturing3. At the same time, the female labor force participation rate continuously declined (Assaad and Krafft 2013). In fact, a 2005 World Economic Forum Report on women’s empowerment ranked Egypt at the bottom of the list of the 58 countries surveyed, receiving the lowest mark in all five areas of the analysis: economic participation, economic opportunity, political, health and well-being (Lopez-Claros and Zahidi 2005). This study explores the relationship between the deteriorating status of women in the labor market in terms of both wage discrimination and employment; and level of trade liberalization and industry concentration. The paper exploits the variation in the degree of liberalization across industries, and the variation in the degree of initial concentration, using a difference-in-difference strategy, to determine the relationship between industry concentration and women’s outcomes, with international trade acting as the channel of increased competition. The study finds that higher initial industry concentration, and increased import competition in initially competitive industries are associated with worse labor market outcomes for women in terms of both relative wages and employment. Increased exports in these initially competitive industries however, is associated with a lower wage gap, but also lower female employment. Results also indicate that opening up to increased international import competition in initially concentrated industries reduces employer’s ability to discriminate against women in terms of both relative wages and employment, while increased exports in these industries is associated with higher female employment as well. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two discusses the literature on trade liberalization and its relationship to industry concentration and gender discrimination. Section three describes women’s labor market conditions, the labor market data used in the analysis, as well as the trade liberalization process. Section four describes the empirical methodology, while section five presents and discusses the results. Section six performs robustness checks, and section seven concludes and presents some policy recommendations.",4

This work is based on a growing line of research that documents persistent negative career effects – as measured by earnings, occupational prestige, and probability of promotion – for individuals who leave school in an economic downturn (Genda et al. 2010; Kahn 2010; Oreopoulos et al. 2012; Oyer 2006, 2008). Non-monetary forms of compensation (or fringe benefits), such as health insurance, can hold substantial value for employees. For example, the average annual cost of an employer-sponsored family health insurance plan was $16,351 in 2013 and employers covered 71% of this cost (Claxton et al. 2013). Because of its high monetary value, and preferential tax treatment, employer-sponsored health insurance represents an important component of full compensation. Health insurance is important to consider for at least two reasons beyond simply better measuring compensation. First, standard models of the demand for health highlight the importance of medical services (Grossman 1972). Health insurance, by lowering the monetary cost faced by the consumer, will increase the quantity of medical services demanded which may, in turn, improve health outcomes. Second, health insurance offers protection against financial instability generated by health shocks and their associated medical costs (Finkelstein et al. 2012; Gross and Notowidigdo 2011; Himmelstein et al. 2009). Those who do not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance, and wish to obtain private coverage, must purchase insurance through the individual market. An individual’s ability to substitute employer-sponsored health insurance with insurance purchased in the individual market may be hampered by high costs (Whitmore et al. 2011) and insurance companies’ historical ability to exclude (or charge higher premiums to) persons with pre-existing conditions (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012). Provisions (e.g., guaranteed issue) in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), effective January 2014, are expected to prevent such exclusions however (111th United States Congress 2010). Understanding determinants of access to private health insurance (employer-sponsored health insurance is currently the most common source of private health insurance in the U.S. (DeNavas-Walt et al. 2013)) is not simply of interest for understanding individual health and financial well-being. Instead, individuals who do not have access to private health insurance either take up public health insurance (e.g., Medicaid) or become uninsured and rely on emergency medical care. The use of both public and emergency medical care places a direct financial burden on the American taxpayer and how the U.S. will finance health care expenditures is of concern to fiscal policy makers (Chernew et al. 2009). Such concerns are likely to increase as the ACA expands access to health insurance to millions of Americans. In particular, health insurance provisions in the ACA are predicted to cost the Federal government $710 billion between 2014 and 2019 (Congressional Budget Office 2013). To study the effect of leaving school in an economic downturn on access to employer-sponsored health insurance, I build a long panel data set of workers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort (NLSY79) and model the probability of access to employer-sponsored health insurance as a function of the state unemployment rate at school-leaving. To this end I exploit variation generated by volatility in the U.S. economy between 1976 and 1996. The NLSY79 regularly collects information on access to employer-sponsored health insurance and thus allows me to track workers from school-leaving (which coincides with initial labor market entrance for many) through mid-career (members of the NLSY79 cohort are ages 45 to 53 in the last year of my data). I address the potential endogeneity of both the time and location of school-leaving with instrumental variables using instruments based on birth year and state of residence at age 14 (Kahn 2010; Kondo 2007; Maclean 2013b; Oreopoulos et al. 2012; Oyer 2006). In extensions to the main analyses I examine whether leaving school in an economic downturn influences access to a second form of non-monetary compensation (life insurance) and utilization of public health insurance as measured by Medicaid coverage. My findings suggest that economic downturns experienced at school-leaving persistently and negatively affect access to employer-sponsored health insurance, but the effects are observed for men only. Men who leave school in an economic downturn are less likely to have access to employer-sponsored health insurance than their counterparts who left school under stronger economic conditions. My instrumental variable specification implies that a 1 percentage point increase in the school-leaving state unemployment rate leads to a 1.7 percentage point (2.2%) reduction in the probability of access to employer-sponsored health insurance among men. Although the effect dissipates over time a disparity is observable and statistically distinguishable from zero 18 years after school-leaving. I find evidence that access to other forms of non-monetary compensation, as measured by employer-sponsored life insurance, is also negatively and persistently influenced by leaving school in an economic downturn among men but not women. I do not find evidence that individuals who leave school in an economic downturn take-up public health insurance. However, data limitations prevent me from providing conclusive results.",8
3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,20 August 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9004-3-18,Recent extensions of U.S. unemployment benefits: search responses in alternative labor market states,December 2014,Robert G Valletta,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the recent “Great Recession” and its aftermath, unemployment insurance (UI) benefits in the United States were extended from the normal period of 26 weeks to the historically unprecedented maximum of 99 weeks. Rather than being rolled out comprehensively, the extensions were phased in slowly over time, and their full extent and exact timing varied across states based on state unemployment rates and other factors. This complex rollout created idiosyncratic variation in the maximum availability of UI benefits and hence provides a unique opportunity for assessing the effects of UI benefit extensions on job search behavior and unemployment duration. Other recent research has examined the impact of the benefit extensions and found modest effects on search behavior and the overall unemployment rate but a larger effect on the share of unemployment that is long term (Rothstein 2011, Farber and Valletta 2013). Consistent with recent research using data for other countries (Card et al. 2007), the main estimated impact of the recent U.S. benefit extensions was prolonged labor force attachment rather than reduced job finding. I add to the existing literature by providing new estimates of the impact of recent benefit extensions on search behavior and unemployment duration. Like Rothstein (2011) and Farber and Valletta (2013), I use matched data from consecutive months of the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS). These data are combined with data on the monthly timing of UI extensions at the state level. The resulting data set is used for a discrete hazard analysis of the determinants of unemployment exits, focusing on the role of variation in the maximum availability of UI benefits across states and over time. The paper makes three main contributions relative to the existing literature. First, I estimate the response of unemployment duration to benefit duration and directly compare results for the recent benefit extensions with past estimates based on U.S. administrative data (Moffitt 1985; Katz and Meyer 1990; Card and Levine 2000; Jurajda and Tannery 2003). The findings suggest that the CPS household survey data provide a useful substitute for UI administrative data, which typically are available with a substantial lag (and are not yet generally available for the recent UI extension period). Second, I compare the most recent episode of benefit extensions with the prior episode that occurred during a period of relatively favorable labor market conditions in the early 2000s. This enables an assessment of whether search responses vary based on the state of the labor market. Farber and Valletta (2013) focused on the duration of benefits rather than their generosity and found no meaningful difference in their job search impact under the very different labor market conditions prevailing during the benefit extension episodes of 2002–04 and 2008–12. However, they used a restricted specification that does not enable direct estimation of the response of unemployment duration to benefit duration. Finally, I also compare the impact of the UI extensions on search behavior and outcomes for individuals who are eligible or ineligible to receive UI benefits. Individuals who are ineligible to receive UI benefits will not be directly affected by the availability of extended benefits and as such can in principle be used as a “placebo” group. However, the ineligible group may be affected by spillover effects or search externalities that increase their job-finding rates (Levine 1993; Lalive et al. 2013). Recent research suggests that such spillover effects are likely to be most pronounced when available jobs are rationed due to a severe downturn, such as that associated with the recent recession (Landais et al. 2010). My comparison of extended UI effects for eligible and ineligible individuals provides a test for search externalities that result from the implementation of broad labor market programs. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the UI extension programs and relevant past research, along with further discussion of the value-added of my paper. Sections 3 and 4 describe the matched CPS data and econometric framework, followed by the empirical results in Section 5. To preview, my results show that for the group most likely to be affected by UI extensions (job losers unemployed for at least 6 months), the estimated search response is in the middle-to-upper end of the range of past estimates based on administrative data. The estimates do not vary meaningfully across the two separate episodes analyzed (2000–04 and 2007–11). However, I uncover evidence of spillover effects that raise job-finding rates for ineligible individuals in states with high unemployment rates in the 2007–11 sample. I provide interpretation and discussion of these findings in the conclusion and suggest avenues for future research.",16

At the societal level, ill health reduces the labour supply (Berkowitz and Johnson 1974) and impounds considerable resources to the financing of social security benefits (Eurostat 2009). As a consequence, decision makers have devoted much energy to finding ways of increasing the labour market attachment of people with ill health. While some workers acquiring a work-limiting health problem remain in their job without changing job conditions, many workers change job conditions through either workplace accommodations or a job change (Daly and Bound 1996;Campolieti 2009). This paper studies how these two responses influence the labour market attachment of long-term sick-listed workers after they resume work. As health-related work absenteeism may arise because of a mismatch between the worker’s capacities and current job demands (Nagi 1965;Verbrugge and Jette 1994), policies affecting the supply-side or the demand-side may reduce work absenteeism. Supply-side policies include vocational rehabilitation programs with measures like education and job training that may increase the individuals’ working capacity for meeting the job demands (e.g. Frölich et al. 2004). Demand-side policies may alter employers’ demand for workers with ill health by subsidizing employers or mandating them to hire or accommodate workers with health problems (e.g. Burkhauser et al. 1995). For example, many European countries have wage subsidy programs for people with disabilities, and the ‘Americans with Disabilities Act’ in the United States mandates employers to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. Many economic studies have assessed factors that may affect the labour supply of people with disabilities (for literature surveys, see Bound and Burkhauser 1999;Currie and Madrian 1999). In contrast, few studies have investigated conditions that influence whether workers remain in the workforce after the onset of a health condition (Burkhauser et al. 1995;Butler et al. 1995;Daly and Bound 1996;Campolieti 2005)1. These studies have focused on how reductions of job demands may improve the labour market attachment of disabled workers. Daly and Bound (1996) showed that job demands can be lowered through workplace accommodations or a job change. Thus after the onset of a disability the worker may either continue to work for the employer, which provides accommodations that reduce job demands, or change employer. Burkhauser et al. (1995) found that accommodations increase the employment duration of US workers acquiring a disability by a factor of almost three. Butler et al. (1995) found that Canadian workers with permanent partial impairments who returned to work with modified equipment, light workloads or reduced working hours had significantly more stable labour market attachment than workers who did not have their working conditions accommodated. Campolieti (2005), who studied the employment duration of workers with permanent partial impairments who returned to work after a work injury, also found a positive effect of workplace accommodations. However, the size of the accommodation estimates was much smaller than those found by Burkhauser et al. (1995). Campolieti (2005: 497) concludes that this difference suggests that workplace accommodations may be more effective in preventing departures from employment for workers who have not previously left the workforce for health reasons than for workers who are re-entering after an occupational injury. Only few studies have investigated the consequences of returning to work for the pre-disability employer versus returning to work for a new employer. These studies suggest that the pre-injury employer has a significant impact on disabled worker’s subsequent labour market outcomes. For example, Campolieti (2004) found that workers who returned to the pre-injury employer were more likely to receive accommodations than workers who returned to another employer. Campolieti and Krashinsy (2006) found that permanently impaired male workers who returned to the pre-accident employer had significantly higher wages than workers who did not return to the pre-injury employer. We contribute to the literature by examining the effects of job change and workplace accommodations on the employment duration of long-term sick-listed workers in a novel way. We study whether workers remaining with their employer in an accommodated job after a sick leave have longer employment durations than workers who either change employer or remain with their employer in a non-accommodated job. We use survey and register data of 809 long-term sick-listed workers to estimate a joint proportional mixed hazard rate model with two durations, i.e. the competing risk duration until returning to work (in an accommodated job with the current employer, in a non-accommodated job with the current employer, or in a job with a new employer) and the duration of the subsequent employment. This study adds to this literature in several ways. First, whereas previous studies estimated the effect of workplace accommodations among people with permanently reduced working capacity, we assess their effect on people who received a temporary working incapacity benefit, i.e. sickness benefit. Compared to work injured workers with permanent impairments, workers receiving temporary working incapacity benefit are a much larger group. Second, we provide new evidence about the effects of workplace accommodations in a European (Scandinavian) context. Third, as the first study we assess whether changing workplace is a better strategy to cope with a health condition than staying with the pre-sick leave employer in an accommodated job. Thus, we study not only whether workplace accommodations prolong employment spells at the current employer but also whether long-term sick-listed workers who change employer have longer employment spells. The finding of Daly and Bound (1996)–that disabled workers who changed employer more often report a reduction in job demands than workers who remain with their employer–indicates that long-term sick-listed workers changing employer may have longer subsequent employment durations than long-term sick-listed workers who remain with their employer. Yet workers starting to work for a new employer do not know with certainty whether they match the new job, an uncertainty that may reduce the quality of the employer-employee match and hence also reduce the employment duration. Fourth, our data and a recent econometric approach enable us to adjust for possible selection effects in a more comprehensive way than previous studies. Burkhauser et al. (1995) and Campolieti (2005) estimated a single spell duration model with individual specific random effects. However, when researchers only have information from one spell distinguishing unobserved heterogeneity from duration dependence is difficult. In a single spell analysis a decreasing hazard rate out of employment over time may reflect either that the hazard rate is indeed decreasing or that some people have unobserved characteristics that make them exit employment quickly. Therefore, the identification of unobserved heterogeneity in single-spell duration models hinges on a misspecification of the functional form of the baseline hazard rate or the functional form of the unobserved heterogeneity (van den Berg 2001). We use information of two interrelated durations (the duration until returning to work and the subsequent employment duration), thereby improving the identification of possible unobserved heterogeneity. With this approach, our econometric model should better than the models used in previous studies mitigate possible selection problems that may lead to bias in the estimated effect of workplace accommodations. We find that individuals remaining with their employer in an accommodated job have longer subsequent employment durations than both individuals who change employer and those individuals remaining with their employer in a non-accommodated job. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the Danish disability policy, and Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 explains our econometric model, and Section 5 presents our findings and the results of robustness checks to our empirical model. Section 6 concludes.",18

In 1985, 2.2 percent of individuals between the ages of 25 and 64 were receiving DI benefits. By 2008, just before the great recession, this fraction had more than doubled to 4.6 percent. A significant share of this increase can be accounted for by the growing work force attachment of women. However, even among men, DI participation grew rapidly over the period, rising from 3.1 to 4.8 percent of 25 to 64 year-old men. Congressional reforms that made it substantially easier for those suffering from severe pain or depression to obtain benefits, together with increases in the effective after-tax replacement rate, plausibly contributed significantly to both DI participation increases and the downward shift in the age distribution of benefits (Rupp & Stapleton, 1995; Autor & Duggan, 2006) – two phenomena raising concern that many receiving DI benefits may in fact be capable of work. This concern was fueled during the 1990s and 2000s when employment rates for working-aged men remained constant but declined for men with work limitations, as shown in Figure 1. Other researchers have found similar patterns using other sources of data (Burkhauser et al. 2002; Burkhauser et al. 2003)1. 
Employment rates for men, age 25-61, who indicate a work limitation, 1989-2012.
 Several influential studies using aggregate data have suggested that the recent growth in DI participation may account for much, if not all of the employment decline of men with work limitations2. At both the national and the state level, Bound and Waidmann (2002) regress the fraction of men out of work with health impairments on the fraction receiving DI, and Autor and Duggan (2003) estimate similar cross-state regressions for the period 1978 to 1998 for high-school drop-outs, who represent a disparate share of those with DI benefits. In both studies, the increase in DI participation appears to have had a major negative effect on employment of men with the highest probability of applying for and receiving DI benefits. In contrast to these analyses, studies using rejected disability insurance applicants to measure the labor market potential of DI beneficiaries have found that rejected applicants have low earnings and employment rates. Bound (1989) analyzes two samples of denied applicants from the 1970s. Arguing that rejected applicants should be more capable of work than are beneficiaries, he posits that their employment rate can be thought of as an upper bound estimate of how much beneficiaries would work had they not applied for DI. He finds an employment rate for denied male applicants of no more than 50 percent. These results have been replicated for the same age category of men (45 years and older) by von Wachter et al. (2011), who use administrative records spanning the period 1978 to 2004. Chen and van der Klaauw (2008) find similar results using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) covering the 1990s. They exploit a discontinuity in the determination process to estimate the disincentive effect for a subgroup of applicants whose determination is based on vocational factors3. They estimate that the employment rate of these DI beneficiaries would have been only 20 percent higher had they not received benefits. Finally, Maestas et al. (2013) use administrative data on variation in disability determination examiners’ allowance rates to identify the employment prospects for marginal DI awardees. They find that the employment rate for members of this group would have been 28 percentage points higher had they not received disability benefits. Results from these studies are generally interpreted as evidence that the increased availability and generosity of DI benefits have had, at most, a moderate effect on the employment rates of people with work limitations. Each of the two approaches for estimating the impact of DI participation on employment involves making assumptions that are open to some question. On the one side, Bound and Waidmann (2002) and Autor and Duggan (2003) observe only ecological correlations. It is possible, though, that men with work limitations found it increasingly difficult to work during the time period and that the DI program drew from a population with relatively low employment rates. If this were the case, the approach used by these two studies would overstate the negative effect of the increase in the availability of DI benefits on the employment of men. On the other side, Bound (1989), Chen and van der Klaauw (2008), von Wachter et al. (2011), and Maestas et al. (2013) estimate the counterfactual employment rate of beneficiaries assuming the application process itself does not substantially reduce employment for denied applicants. The plausibility of this presumption is open to question (see the interchange between Parsons (1991) and Bound (1991) for a discussion of this issue). The application process effectively requires applicants to remain out of work between their application and the decision on DI benefits. While initial decisions occur within 3 or 4 months, rejected applicants who appeal decisions typically wait several years before a final decision is made, and evidence suggests that these delays lower reemployment prospects (Autor et al. 2011). More important, denied applicants who plan to appeal their rejection or to reapply later are likely to remain out of work for strategic reasons (French and Song, 2012). While the number of denied applicants who appeal was relatively small early in the history of DI, currently about half of those initially denied mount appeals (Autor and Duggan 2010), while others simply reapply. If applying for DI benefits had a negative effect on the employment of denied applicants, using the employment rate of denied applicants could understate the average treatment effect of receiving disability insurance for beneficiaries. In addition, in this case, any growth in the fraction of men who are denied benefits would contribute to overall employment decline. We overcome the limitations of these two approaches by identifying through administrative records an additional control population – non-applicants with reported work limitations – and by assessing the expansion of the DI system jointly with employment rates for different applicant and age groups. Our results clarify that the employment decline during the early 1990s can be explained by the concurrent DI expansion only under the extreme assumption that the marginal beneficiaries would have worked at rates comparable to non-applicants were they not receiving benefits. In addition, when we extend the analysis past the period of rapid expansion of the DI program into the late 1990s and early 2000s, we find that employment rates for men with work limitations continued to decline, despite a slowdown in the growth rate of DI. This alone suggests important other factors at work. The next section briefly discusses main features of the DI program and major policy changes over the last several decades. In Section 3, we develop and discuss the decomposition. Section 4 provides a description of the main data sources used for this study. It is followed by results (Section 5) and concluding remarks (Section 6).",6

Disability insurance programs provide cash assistance to people with determinable and significant work disabilities. By contrast, the public-sector Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program, a $3 billion federal-state partnership, is designed to provide employment-related assistance to persons with a broad spectrum of disabling conditions. As the nation’s primary employment support program for people with disabilities, state VR agencies seem well-positioned to assist people with disabilities in securing gainful employment rather than receiving SSDI/SSI (Stapleton and Martin 2012). Yet, while found to play an important role in helping persons with disabilities to engage in the labor market (Loprest 2007; Dean et al. 2013a2013b and 2013c), very little is known about whether VR services reduce participation in Federal Disability Insurance programs1. If VR services improve labor market outcomes of potential SSDI/SSI beneficiaries, some clients may choose to fully participate in the labor market rather than take up SSDI/SSI. Yet, for those with limited abilities or interest, VR programs may instead serve to help clients understand Federal Disability Insurance programs and rules, and consequently lead to an increase in take-up (Stapleton and Martin 2012; Dean et al. 2013a). Using a unique panel data source on all persons who applied for VR services in Virginia in State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2000, we study the relationship between VR service receipt and SSDI/SSI receipt. For each applicant, we observe quarterly SSDI/SSI, employment and earnings data, and VR service receipt data from 1995 to 2010. This rich panel data enable us to provide important insights into the long-run impact of VR services on receipt of Federal Disability Insurance. Given that the labor market impacts of VR services are known to differ by the type of limitation (Dean and Dolan 1991; Baldwin 1999; Dean et al. 1999; Marcotte et al. 2000; Dean et al. 2013a2013b and 2013c), we analyze the full population as well as subpopulations of clients with a physical impairment, mental illness, or cognitive impairment2. We also examine SSDI and SSI receipt separately: the two groups of recipients have very different characteristics, receive different benefit amounts, and face different earnings incentives. In particular, the non-medical eligibility criteria for SSDI requires a significant work history, SSDI benefits vary with work history, and SSDI benefits are terminated when a recipients earnings exceed some threshold. In contrast, SSI is means-tested and SSI benefits are determined using a fairly standard negative income tax formula with a basic guarantee and 0.50 earnings tax after a small earnings disregard. After describing the data in Section 2, we proceed in two parts. In Section 3, we consider the association between VR service receipt and participation in SSDI and/or SSI, specifically examining take-up and exits from the Federal Disability Insurance programs. In Section 4, we evaluate the association between VR receipt and labor market outcomes, focusing on clients who received SSDI/SSI prior to applying for VR services. Finally, in Section 5, we draw conclusions. Three central findings emerge. First, in general, VR services are associated with lower rates of participation in disability insurance programs – a nearly 2 point drop in SSDI receipt and 1 point drop in SSI receipt – but there is substantial variation across impairment groups. Most notably, for the cognitively impaired subgroup, VR services are associated with greater SSDI/SSI receipt. Second, VR receipt is associated with lower rates of entry into SSDI/SSI but also lower rates of exit from the SSDI roles. Finally, among VR applicants on SSDI/SSI, those who receive substantive services are more likely to be employed but, on average, earn less per quarter. While these results may suggest that VR programs can effectively reduce SSDI/SSI roles for certain subgroups, we caution against drawing this type of causal conclusion from the evidence presented in this paper. Rather, this analysis is largely descriptive, and does not formally address the fundamental methodological problem involved in drawing such inferences from observational data. Specifically, the decision to provide VR services is not likely to be random, or exogenous, with respect to SSDI/SSI receipt. Selection has been found to be a central problem in addressing the impact of job training programs in general (LaLonde 1995; Friedlander et al. 1997 and Imbens and Wooldridge 2009), and VR program in particular (Aakvik, Heckman, and Vytlacil, 2005; Stapleton and Martin 2012 and Dean et al. 2013a2013b and 2013c). Hence, the observed associations evaluated in this paper are likely to reflect, in part, unobserved factors such as the severity of disabling limitation and general health status which are likely to be jointly associated with VR service and SSDI/SSI receipt. Likewise, the Social Security Administration’s cost-sharing arrangement with VR agencies for services provided to certain SSDI/SSI beneficiaries further confounds causal inference (see Stapleton and Martin 2012).",5

Collectively, these groups are called Social Security Disability (SSD) beneficiaries2. Many SSD beneficiaries with low SSD benefits also receive benefits from a separate welfare program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is administered by the same agency, the Social Security Administration (SSA). In 2011, more than 9.8 million people received SSD benefits. Many SSD beneficiaries are able and willing to work at some level; most of those who work earn too little to lose their benefits. Recognizing this, the Ticket to Work and Work Improvement Incentives Act of 1999 (Ticket Act) put into place a number of new policies and programs designed to encourage beneficiaries’ return-to-work efforts. The leading initiative is the Ticket to Work (TTW) program. Initially, the Social Security Administration (SSA) mailed each eligible disability program beneficiary a “Ticket” that he or she could assign to either a state vocational rehabilitation agency (SVRA) or to a prequalified local rehabilitation service provider, called an employment network (EN), in exchange for employment placement, job training, and other services3. SSA promised to pay the provider on the basis of earnings and benefit outcomes for the beneficiary. TTW was designed to expand the service options available to beneficiaries and create greater incentives for providers to help beneficiaries earn enough to forgo benefits. TTW was rolled out in three phases. A first set of states completed the TTW rollout in 2002 (Phase 1), a second set in 2003 (Phase 2), and a final set in 2004 (Phase 3). In July 2008, SSA significantly changed the regulations governing TTW to attract more providers and reflect a more flexible return-to-work concept; hereafter, we call the pre-2008 program the “original” program. Previous attempts to estimate impacts of TTW provide inconclusive evidence. The earlier analyses were, in essence, based on annual trends in differences for mean service enrollment, earnings and benefit outcomes across the three phases (Thornton et al. 2007; Stapleton et al. 2008). Results were inconclusive, because methodological issues made it impossible to discriminate between potentially very small, yet important impacts of TTW and pre-existing trends in the differences across phases for earnings and benefit outcomes. A number of alternative strategies were attempted in recent years to estimate Ticket impacts, but were also found to be inadequate4. In this article, we present results from a rigorous new analysis of the impact of the introduction of the original TTW program, incorporating multiple innovations relative to earlier efforts. The analysis exploits a feature of the initial TTW rollout in each phase: just before the start of the rollout, SSA selected the month in which it intended to mail each eligible beneficiary’s Ticket in an essentially random fashion. We use variation in the intended mail month to rigorously estimate how the timing of Ticket mailing affects beneficiary outcomes over the following 48 months, then use the estimates to draw inferences about impacts of TTW (versus no TTW) over the same period. The new analysis also takes advantage of improvements in the measurement of work related outcomes from administrative data, namely a monthly indicator of benefit suspension or termination for work (STW) and a count of months in nonpayment status after STW (NSTW months) and before returning to current-pay status, attainment of the full retirement age (FRA), or death (NSTW months)5. This article focuses on impacts for NSTW months as well as for two intermediate outcome variables: enrollment for employment services with an SVRA or EN, and an event that must precede STW: completion of the trial work period (TWP)6,7. The analysis focuses on the subgroup of beneficiaries for whom we expect impacts to be easiest to detect: young (ages 18 to 39 at award), new SSD-only beneficiaries—that is, those awarded SSD recently who are not also receiving SSI. Recent research suggests that TTW had the most promise of having impacts on work outcomes for this group (Liu and Stapleton 2011, Mamun et al. 2011, Stapleton et al. 2008). We assumed that if we found no substantial evidence of impacts on key outcomes for this group, we could be reasonably confident that there would be no evidence of impacts if we applied the same approach to other groups. If instead we found evidence of positive impacts for this group, we could extend the methodology to see if the same approach produced positive evidence for other groups. The focus on new beneficiaries also allowed us to exclude those who received awards before July 1999, when there was a significant change in how earnings affect benefits. The findings reported here directly address the following primary research questions related to the three outcomes. Each question concerns the impact of duration from the month before the rollout start in the beneficiary’s state to the month in which SSA mailed a Ticket to the beneficiary (the beneficiary’s “mail month”) on outcomes over the 48 months after the rollout start.  Was enrollment for employment services and completion of TWP less likely to occur as of 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after rollout start the longer the duration from rollout start to mail month?  Was the number of NSTW months as of 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after rollout start smaller the longer the duration from rollout start to mail month? We then use the findings to indirectly answer the question of most interest to policymakers:  What was the impact of mailing Tickets as of 48 months later versus not mailing Tickets at all? We also assess whether TTW was self-financing by 2007, before the new regulations took effect.",2

If such reforms were unambiguously beneficial, however, they would be obvious free lunches, unlikely to remain unexploited until discovered by economists. Economic research can more plausibly help policy-makers by analyzing how the structural and political characteristics of different countries and periods shape trade-offs between productivity and other objectives. Yet, such arguments are not often spelled out explicitly by advocates of reforms, who sometimes seem to fight a previous war, praising policy frameworks that perform well in specific instances (such as Danish flexicurity in times of growth and structural transformation, or German vocational education in the current crisis) without characterizing clearly how past policy choices relate to various aspects of subsequent performance. In reality, markets are not as perfect as economists would like them to be, policy-makers are not as powerful as they would like to be, and policies that trade production efficiency off labor income stability have different implications for the welfare of different individuals. Hence, no labor market configuration is optimal in all circumstances and from all points of view, and a positive theory of labor policy needs to take into account its implications in terms of distribution as well as of production efficiency. This paper illustrates the policy-choice and empirical implications of this perspective using a model, set up in Section 2, of an economy where policy provides protection from uninsurable labor income shocks and reduces individual incentives to perform costly actions that increase aggregate production. Section 3 outlines how this and more general models can help interpret labor policy choices and effects in terms not only of risk aversion, but also of distributional tensions and international market pressure. Section 4 examines European empirical evidence from that perspective. Section 5 discusses the possible role of labor policies in the path towards the eurozone crisis, and the credibility problems faced by crisis-triggered reforms of labor policies that are meant to protect individuals from risk and have delayed productivity effects. Section 6 concludes with some more general considerations.",8

Are these reactions different or reinforced when the drop in sales is paired with a credit drain? A firm can adjust through prices, margins, and costs. The menu of cost-cutting alternatives is large: firms might, at least partially, pass the costs of the fall in demand along to suppliers, renegotiating the prices of intermediate inputs. In parallel, or alternatively, firms might adjust labour costs by lowering either employment or wages. The relative importance of each of these margins of adjustment is likely to depend on the intensity and nature of the shock as well as on the structural features of the product and labour markets where the firm operates. This paper sheds some new light on these questions, drawing on a large survey of European firms during the 2009 global economic crisis. The survey, carried out by the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN), a research network of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), was administered in two waves. The first, conducted during the last two quarters of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, included a wide array of questions on firm characteristics, workforce composition, price- and wage-setting behaviours, and certain features of the economic environment in which the firm operated at that time. Importantly, the base period of observation predates the Great Recession, and hence information refers to each firm’s structural characteristics before the negative shocks hit. The second wave, during the third quarter of 2009, was designed to assess the adjustment mechanisms the firm was using, or planning to use, to cope with the global crisis. The main advantage and rationale for launching an ad hoc survey of private sector firm managers during the Great Recession lay in the wealth and scope of information that could be collected. Typical firm-level data have little information on a firm’s labour force, hence are silent on the different channels of labour cost adjustment. Matched employer-employee data constitute a great stride towards filling this gap, but even in this case, important information is missing. The information on the firm side is usually rather limited, constraining the analysis of the adjustment strategies that firms may use. Moreover, the nature of the shocks hitting the firms is usually not observed, and hence has to be inferred from the data. Instead, the use of a survey allows respondents to assess qualitatively the nature and intensity of these shocks. This paper, after presenting the firms’ perceptions of the shocks they faced, discusses the various adjustment mechanisms that firms put in place in response to these shocks during the incipient stages of the global economic crisis in 2008–09. First, we look at the primary responses to these negative shocks: changes in output, prices, margins, and costs. The discussion illustrates the importance of cost-cutting strategies relative to the other adjustment mechanisms and introduces the second part of the analysis, where we concentrate on the alternative cost-cutting strategies the firms adopted. In particular, we investigate the relative importance of wage reductions (in either base wages or flexible wage components), reductions in labour inputs (e.g., hours), and the adjustment of temporary and permanent workers. As a residual option, we also assess the importance of nonlabour cost-cutting policies. The closest work to our paper is Bertola et al. (2012), who analyse the different adjustment strategies firms can employ in response to hypothetical supply-side shocks using data from the first wave of the same survey we exploit here. In this paper, rather than looking at a firm’s response to a hypothetical cost shock, we concentrate on its actual response during the Great Recession’s initial phase in Europe—from the start of the crisis (third quarter of 2008) through mid-2009. This period was characterised by a large negative demand shock accompanied by a credit crunch. Hence, the main difference between the two studies lies in the nature of the shock considered and in the hypothetical shock addressed in the 2007 questionnaire versus the factual shock addressed in the 2009 questionnaire. Our findings illustrate the vast heterogeneity of firm reactions to these negative shocks. Yet they also show how the different responses were theoretically consistent—both with the firms’ internal characteristics and with the features of the labour and product markets in which they operate. Some important messages stand out: base wages are cut, if at all, as a last resort. During the first year of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, firms were unwilling to cut base wages in an attempt to protect jobs. The only notable exception were Estonian firms, which suffered the worst negative shock and operate in the most flexible wage-setting institutional environment among our sample of countries. Adjustment of nonlabour costs is the first cost-cutting strategy that European firms were willing to adopt, and laying off permanent workers was the last. Reduction of flexible wage components and temporary jobs serve as a buffer when other forms of adjustment are unavailable or unaffordable. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section describes the data used in the analysis. Section 3 discusses the main theoretical channels through which firms are likely to cope with a fall in demand or a negative shock in credit markets, setting the scene for the empirical analysis of the following sections. Section 4 presents the nature of the shocks hitting the sample of European firms covered in the survey. Section 5 focuses on the broad margins of adjustment that firms use—from price-setting mechanisms to changes in profit margins and costs. Section 6 concentrates instead on the subset of firms that adjusted costs in response to the Great Recession. The wealth of information from our surveys allows us to examine how different cost-cutting strategies relate to firm and institutional characteristics. Section 7 concludes.",26

4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,27 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40173-015-0050-9,Minimum wages and employment in China,December 2015,Tony Fang,Carl Lin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since China enacted its new minimum wage regulations in 2004, minimum wages have sparked intense debate in the country. In China, supporters of minimum wages advocate them as a way to assist individuals or families to achieve self-sufficiency and to protect workers in low-paid occupations (Zhang and Deng 2005; Sun 2006). Minimum wages can help reduce inequality by providing a wage floor (Zhang 2007; Jia and Zhang 2013). In addition, higher labor cost may promote managerial efficiency and labor productivity, inducing employers to invest in productivity-improving technology (Cooke 2005). Along these lines, many Chinese scholars have argued in favor of the more proactive increase of minimum wages (Du and Wang 2008; Ding 2009; Han and Wei 2011). On the other hand, opponents argue that raising the minimum wage can decrease the employment opportunities of low-wage workers and also lead to reduction in other components of the compensation package (Xue 2004; Ping 2005; Gong 2009). Such regulations can undermine enterprises’ dividend policies and reduce China’s comparative advantage in the abundance of low-wage labor (Cheung 2004, 2010). For example, rural–urban migrants (estimated 168 million workers in 2014 by the National Health and Family Planning Commission) usually have very low pay and tend to work in the uncovered sectors (Chan 2001; Ye 2005).Footnote 1
 The minimum wage policy is contentious also because its effects on employment cannot be easily estimated. However, in recently years the new policy in China has generated a lot of variation that is useful in identifying the effects of minimum wages. Since January 2004, China promulgated new minimum wage regulations that required local governments to introduce a minimum wage increase at least once every two years, extended coverage to self-employed and part-time workers, and quintupled the penalties for violation or noncompliance. The new regulations were put into effect in March 2004, leading to frequent and substantial increases in minimum wages in the subsequent years. These large variations both across jurisdictions and over time facilitate our estimation of minimum wage effects on employment in China. Figure 1 shows the nominal and real minimum wage (monthly average) in China from 1995 to 2012 as well as those corresponding to the provinces that raised the minimum wages for each year, along with its moving average over the same period.Footnote 2 Between 1995 and 2003, the average nominal minimum wage increased steadily from 169 RMB to 301 RMB, amounting to a 78% growth in 9 years. However, since China implemented the new minimum wage regulations in 2004, the nominal minimum wage has increased even more rapidly by over 200%, reaching 944 RMB in 2012.Footnote 3 The real minimum wage grew at a slower pace before 2004 and began to rise thereafter. In particular, Fig. 2 shows the minimum-to-average wage ratio started to increase in 2004 for the three regions and the whole country, implying that the 2004 policy has induced an increase in the bite of the minimum wage. Furthermore, as shown by the moving average curve in Fig. 1, there is an apparent rise after 2004 in the number of provinces that raised the minimum wage standards, indicating that minimum wage adjustments had become more frequent after that year. Minimum wages in China, 1995–2012. Nominal minimum wages have been adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2000 RMB Minimum-to-average wage ratios in China, by region. The East includes Liaoning, Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Guangdong; the Central region includes Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi; and the West includes Gansu, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Yunnan How did this regulatory environment affect labor market outcomes in China? More specifically, did changes in the minimum wage have any impact on employment in the Chinese labor market? Although there is an enormous literature documenting numerous aspects of minimum wages and their role in the labor market, most studies have been conducted in the high-income economies such as the U.S., U.K., and Canada; even there, no consensus has been reached on the magnitude of an effect of minimum wages on employment.Footnote 4
 This paper represents the first paper using county-level minimum wages merged with urban household survey microdata in China. Empirically speaking, there are at least three challenges involved in measuring the employment effects of Chinese minimum wages. First, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regionsFootnote 5 in China have considerable autonomy and flexibility in setting their minimum wages according to local conditions. There are often at least 3 or 4 levels of minimum wage standards applicable to various counties in most provinces. The fact that each county is responsible for selecting its own minimum wage standards implies that the county- or city-level minimum wage data containing the relevant information on the dates and the extent of minimum wage increases are not readily available.Footnote 6 Second, omission and endogeneity of important variables (such as the timing of decisions to adjust minimum wage standards) make it difficult to separate causal effects from effects due to other unobserved confounding factors.Footnote 7 Third, in China, it remains difficult to find microdata that can be both plausibly representative of the population and also influenced by minimum wage increases. Furthermore, some provinces, such as Beijing and Shanghai, do not include social security payments and housing provident funds as part of wages as part of the minimum wages. In effect, their actual minimum wages are higher on a comparable basis.Footnote 8
 In this paper, we first assess whether and the extent to which minimum wage changes affected the Chinese labor market by measuring the effect of the minimum wage on employment. To do so, we begin by analyzing the labor market responses to changes in minimum wage standards using panel data regressions. The most distinctive feature of our data—crucial for our research design—is the combination of a large county-level panel data of minimum wages, which covers all counties (over 2000 counties each year) in China, with a urban household survey micro-dataset of 16 representative provinces between 2002 and 2009.Footnote 9 We use the urban household surveys to construct the county-level variables and then merge the constructed county-level data with the county-level minimum wage data. The use of county-level data rather than provincial level data allows for a more accurate measurement of the relevant minimum wage and labor market conditions, providing more variation in detecting the effects of minimum wages on employment in China. In particular, we also attempt to evaluate the effects on subgroups of the population, especially those who are at risk of being affected by a minimum wage increase, such as young adults, female and low-skilled workers. Our regressions based on county-level panel data reveal a significant disemployment effects of minimum wages on young adults (age 15–29) between 2004 and 2009 nationwide—the estimated elasticity of the sum of current and lagged effects is −.259. Please note, for expositional convenience, we refer to the minimum wage relative to the average wage as the minimum wage in all discussion of the empirical results. Our results are reported for such normalized measure. Furthermore, we find that the previous year’s minimum wage has the largest adverse effect on the employment of at-risk groups, which as defined as workers whose monthly wages are between the old and new minimum wage standards. We treated it as a simple zero–one dummy variable as the young adults group. As such the wages and employment of this at-risk group are most likely to be affected by the changes in minimum wages. As expected, the sum of the current and lagged effects yields estimated elasticities in the range of −.465 to −.552 over the same period. Several studies on the employment effects of minimum wages in China found mixed results, and the results for different regions are often opposite to one another. For example, using provincial level data Ni et al. (2011) focused on all employees and found some negative effects in the more prosperous and rapidly growing East region, and some positive effects in the developing Central region and less developed Western regions over the 2000–2005 period. In contrast, Wang and Gunderson (2011) used 2000–2007 provincial data of rural migrants and found no adverse effects and in fact a positive employment effect in state-owned enterprises in the East and negative effects in the Central and Western regions. The discrepancies between these studies may be explained in part by the fact that the employment effects of minimum wage increases on different target groups tend to differ. By examining the effects on several subgroups, our estimates seem to be consistent with their findings—we find that, similar to Ni et al. (2011), the current minimum wage has a significantly negative effect on all employees in the East and a one-year lagged positive (though statistically insignificant) effect in the Western region in 2004–2009. In contrast, using rural migrants as the target group, we find that the current minimum wage has an adverse and significant effect in the West and a positive (though statistically insignificant) effect in the East over the same period studied in Wang and Gunderson (2011).Footnote 10
 Finally, we investigate the impact of the minimum wage on the employment of workers by skill level. In theory, low-skilled workers are relatively vulnerable to job loss when facing minimum wage increases. As anticipated, our county-level panel data analysis shows that the current minimum wage has an adverse, though perhaps mild, effect on the employment of low-skilled workers (defined as those with a high school diploma or below), the estimated elasticites of the current effect are in the range of −.054 to −.080 for the entire sample, −0.070 for the East region, and −0.070 to −0.077 for the Central region. As a placebo test, we do not find a statistically significant effect for high-skilled workers (defined those with a college diploma or above).",40

Ignacio García-Pérez,Alfonso R. Sánchez-Martín,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Spanish labor market has a longstanding tradition of not being particularly friendly to elderly workers. At the time of this writing, the employment rates of workers aged 50 to 64 are among the lowest in OECD countries (52% in Spain vs. 62% in the EU-15). Rates have been low for a long period of time, even after the sharp improvement in employment recorded in the last cyclical expansion of 2000-2008 (the employment rate for those aged 50-59 rose from 52% in Q1-2000 to 63% in Q2-2008). This tendency was abruptly halted during the Great Recession and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis, which has sent the unemployment rate for this age range skyrocketing to more than 21% (from 5.3% in Q3-2007). For older workers, unemployment is supposed to be a transitory stage in the process of returning to the labor force or before a permanent withdrawal from the job market. However, the incidence of long-term unemployment (+1 year) is particularly high in this group (46.5% vs. 37.8% in the 16-39 age group), nearly always ending in total withdrawal from the labor force. Indeed, the observed reentry rates are remarkably low (in Spain, the quarterly reemployment hazard is less than 13% in the 55-59 age range and a meager 1.5% in the 60-65 range). To complete the overall picture, note that a small proportion of the unemployed declare that they are actively searching for a new position.1
 Several factors have been invoked to explain this state of affairs. On the one hand, demand-side considerations appear to play a major role, with Spanish corporations reluctant to attract older unemployed individuals back to the workforce. A number of reasons (ranging from the rigidity of remuneration practices to large productivity deficits compared with their younger workmates) are usually mentioned to explain this behavior. On the other hand, searching and retraining are assumed to generate especially high welfare costs for workers of advanced age. In response, legislators and policy makers have been quick to provide particular protection for those workers (in the form of early retirement programs and, in some cases, tailor-made unemployment insurance (UI) schemes for older workers). As a result, benefits for unemployed individuals over the age of 50 are typically higher or can be drawn for longer periods than benefits for younger unemployed individuals. Furthermore, the conditions regarding availability for work and job-seeking are often relaxed. Moreover, the unemployed are subject to regular (and sometimes ad hoc) pension regulations. This scheme opens a new set of opportunities for them, as it clearly sets the choices of the unemployed approaching retirement apart from the choices made by their younger counterparts (see Tatsiramos (2009) for an analysis of the behavior of young unemployed workers). In Spain (as in other EU countries), loopholes in the rules make it feasible for older unemployed individuals to escape early retirement penalties while enjoying the income protection of unemployment benefits (but without suffering the pains involved in the job search process). In other words, strategic individuals and corporations can use unemployment and pension rules to transfer the costs of quasi-voluntary early retirement to the general population.2 Such practices have clear direct costs for public finances (leading to higher taxation) as well as important opportunity costs in terms of wasted or inefficiently allocated resources. In Europe, which is struggling to regain competitiveness and is threatened by population aging and soaring pension costs, these considerations are having an increasing influence on the decisions of national governments and on the recommendations of the European Commission.3
 The goal of this paper is to uncover the relative contribution of bad institutional incentives versus poor labor demand to the meager reemployment rates of Spanish workers aged 55 and over. More precisely, we aim to achieve the following: (i) to quantify the extension of the opportunistic behavior of the Spanish unemployed (those who fail to engage in a real search effort while enjoying the income protection of the unemployment program) and (ii) to explore feasible changes aiming to improve incentives in the current policy design. In particular, we attempt to measure their welfare impact and financial cost on the joint system of unemployment and old-age protection. To answer these questions, we build, calibrate and simulate a model of optimal search and retirement behavior adapted to the Spanish institutional environment.4 After testing the model’s ability to match the basic empirical patterns (in a large sample of administrative records from the Spanish Social Security System for the 2002-2008 period), we use it to simulate the reactions to alternative institutional environments. First, we consider a theoretical environment in which the fiscal authorities can enforce the search request as a prerequisite for unemployment insurance. We then explore a real-world pension reform aimed at eliminating the incentive for opportunistic use of the UI system: we classify individuals as early retired immediately after they stop paying contributions (rather than when they first claim the pension benefit). This approach should stimulate the self-selection of workers into either early retirement or job search, even in a world of imperfect observability. We find that our stylized model of search and retirement can very accurately reproduce the age patterns of labor supply and reentry wages in Spain. The parameters that deliver a good empirical match reveal an environment with rather high search costs for individuals and poor labor demand conditions for older workers (summarized in relatively small average wage offers and a sizable chance of failing to receive any offer at all). The model predicts widespread voluntary non-participation by the older unemployed as a rational response to such an unfavorable labor market (given the Spanish institutional environment). Our first policy experiment illustrates the opportunistic nature of this behavior: we find a strong increase in labor supply in the world where search requirements are effectively implemented. This outcome leads to large savings in the net pension liabilities of the pension system. Our main experiment, however, is more relevant for real-world policy makers. Our feasible reform achieves appreciable increases in the labor supply and sizable reductions in the implicit liabilities of the pension system. These financial gains are sufficiently large to fully compensate for all the welfare losses inflicted by the reform. Inducing search efforts among unemployed workers close to retirement is (theoretically) cost-effective in the Spanish case.5 However, even if the change is not strictly Pareto-improving, policy makers could judge the gains in efficiency as sufficiently large to lead to an overall improvement in social welfare. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevance of the Spanish case, its public institutions and the main empirical patterns. The theoretical model is discussed at length in section 3, including a discussion of the model calibration and a review of its quantitative performance. Our simulation experiments, including our policy reform proposal, are presented in section 4. Finally, section 5 presents our overall conclusions. Three appendices provide further details on the workings of the model (Appendix A), the reference sample (Appendix B) and pension cost calculations (Appendix C).",

Economists seem to be mostly puzzled (see, for instance, Glaeser and Gottlieb 2008; Neumark and Simpson 2014). Nevertheless, supportive arguments have also been proposed (Barca et al. 2012), and policy makers all around the world implement these policies, spending considerable amounts of public money (for instance, $95 billion annually in the US, according to the figures of Kline and Moretti 2013a). A prominent example of place-based policies is given by the European Union (EU) Structural Funds (European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and European Social Fund, ESF), which target disadvantaged areas and use a significant fraction (278 billion, 28%, in the programing period 2007–2013) of the EU budget. Expenditures under the Structural Funds include both investments (transport or telecommunications infrastructures, outlays for innovation, energy, the environment) and labor market programs (aimed at reducing unemployment and increasing human capital and social integration). The bulk of Structural Funds expenditure flows to Objective “Convergence” (former Objective 1) areas, which are EU regions with GDP per capita less than 75% of the EU average. The aim of the Structural Funds is to increase long-term growth in lagging regions and make it sustainable. Since 2008, however, the EU Commission encouraged using the funds to offset the negative consequences of the economic crisis, through an acceleration of the execution of the programs, originally planned over a 7-year horizon, and a re-orientation of the financing towards counter-cyclical interventions (European Commission 2008a, b). We investigate the effectiveness of Structural Funds on a number of outcomes (employment, population and house prices), which, according to the theory, should pick up the bulk of the economic effects of the transfers. A new Italian dataset (www.opencoesione.it) allows us to geo-reference payments relative to projects funded by the European Structural Funds. Unfortunately, comparable data at this detailed level of geo-stratification do not exist for other countries. We focus on 325 Local Labor Markets (LLM) located in Southern Italy, as this is a traditional example of a disadvantaged area in the EU. The choice of considering only Southern regions is motivated by the fact that they were the target of most of the European transfers. In the programing period 2007–13, more than 80% of the total financing at the national level was allocated to this area. Furthermore, given that one of the main challenges for the evaluation is to address the potentially diverging trends in disadvantaged LLMs, the choice of excluding Northern and Central Italy aims at reducing the degree of heterogeneity. Regions located in the South showed quite different trends in employment, population and house prices during the period of interest, as they were more strongly hit by the recession. Our identification strategy exploits the variability in disbursements across LLMs between 2007 and 2013. It refers, therefore, to the years of the economic crisis. We estimate the effect of these payments on the growth rates of the outcomes, controlling for both LLM-specific time-invariant features and LLM-specific time trends. In particular, to account for omitted time-varying factors, we include a long set of fixed LLM characteristics interacted with linear and quadratic time trends. Given that this procedure requires including a very long vector of covariates, we select them according to the procedure suggested by Belloni et al. (2014). Including controls for local traits and dynamics should help in isolating the effects of the funds from those associated with the concurrent deteriorating economic conditions experienced by the LLMs during the severe recession. Our estimates are, basically, diff-in-diffs estimates (with a continuous treatment). In the absence of a policy rule (i.e., a discontinuity) that might allow to isolate the exogenous variation of the transfers, we try to reduce the role of omitted time-varying variables by controlling for an extensive list of LLM-specific traits that should help in predicting local trends. Obviously, our empirical approach might have limitations, insofar one cannot ensure that all the sources of local dynamics are successfully differentiated away. These limitations, however, should be weighed against the benefits of having timely empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the interventions carried out during the current programming period (2007–13) of the EU Structural Funds, which can be also useful to inform the design of the interventions in the next stage (2014–20). Our results suggest that the EU funding had limited impact on employment. Estimates for the effect of cumulate payments (over 2007–13) on average growth do not detect any effect. Some small increase in employment, however, seems to be associated with the acceleration/re-targeting of payments started in 2011. Across the categories of expenditures, our findings suggest that the EU money channeled through incentives and the purchase of goods and services might have had a slightly more favorable impact on employment compared to money spent on infrastructure. We also do not find any effect whatsoever of the Structural Funds on both population and house prices. The upshot of overall ineffectiveness seems to confirmed even for the LLMs characterized by very low employment or very low initial housing prices. Next, we verify whether a faster disbursement might have implied a more encouraging impact of the scheme on the local economies and find that this is unlikely to be case. We finally show that results do not seem to be affected by the presence of other funds, which are available from national sources and are targeted to cohesion purposes as well. The paper is structured as follows. The next section illustrates the conceptual framework. Section 3 presents the related literature, while the fourth one provides the relevant institutional details. Section 5 describes the identification strategy, while 6 explains the data. The results are illustrated in Section 7. Concluding thoughts are offered in Section 8.",18

The role of health and skills,December 2015,Anton Nilsson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists have long been interested in what factors determine an individual’s success in the labor market, such as the ability to find a job. Whereas older research has often focused on education, recent literature has shown the importance of health, cognitive ability and non-cognitive abilities (e.g., Heckman et al. 2006; Currie et al. 2010; Lindqvist and Vestman 2011; Lundborg et al. 2014a). In this paper, we examine if those with poor health and abilities face a “double penalty” in the sense that they are not only less likely to be employed in general, but their probability of employment is also more sensitive to the unemployment rate. In the presence of such a phenomenon, career and life planning becomes more difficult for disadvantaged individuals and they incur utility losses given that they are risk averse.Footnote 1 Down the road, individuals with a heavily fluctuating employment status may lose human capital and suffer long-term consequences. Policy-makers may want to compensate or invest in individuals that are more sensitive to unemployment, or alternatively, reduce aggregate fluctuations by stabilization policies. Going back to Tobin (1972), a number of authors have noted that unemployment has distributional consequences along some dimensions. An increase in unemployment is obviously associated with fewer hirings and/or more layoffs, but there is also evidence of a second-order effect; some groups of individuals are hit more by unemployment than others. So far, research has documented the differential effects of the unemployment rate by characteristics such as age, race, sex and education. While other characteristics such as cognition and social skills may be equally or even more important for labor market success, data on these are rarely available and studies have not considered unemployment sensitivity with respect to these. In particular, previous studies have documented that low-educated individuals are more sensitive to the unemployment rate than higher educated individuals. The mechanisms behind this are not entirely clear. It is possible that the effects partly arise because of underlying differences in abilities correlated with education. This would seem reasonable as more able individuals often undertake more education than less able ones. It is also possible that results reflect the sorting of individuals into jobs with different characteristics. Our study is able to address these issues. Our study uses a dataset from Sweden with several advantages. First, it includes high-quality data on predetermined individual characteristics of virtually the entire population (of males). It is an important feature of these data that both health and skills are measured before labor market entry because it means that reverse causality is not an issue. Second, the data have been linked to tax records to determine whether or not individuals are employed (at some point) during a certain year. Third, we have data on regional unemployment for several years and we can control for both region- and year-specific effects that may be correlated with the unemployment rate. Fourth, we are able to identify individuals that move in order to examine if the results may be driven by mobility patterns. Sweden has much stronger employment protection legislation than countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. (e.g., Nicoletti, et al. 1999), and we would therefore expect the sensitivity of groups that are disadvantaged, in terms of health or skills, to be smaller in our context. After working for the same employer for more than 2 years, the employee typically has the right to be offered a permanent contract. This means that middle-aged and older workers tend to have a stronger employment protection than the young, and we may expect effects to be concentrated in the group of young workers. Our findings consistently suggest that individuals in poor health or with low non-cognitive skills exhibit greater variations in their employment probability as the unemployment rate varies. The penalty is non-linear in the sense that the effects are much larger for individuals in poor health or with lower skills than for individuals with intermediate health and skills. Running our regressions for different age groups separately, we show that our results are not only driven by the group of younger workers. In other words, the effects do not only operate at labor market entry. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a background discussion and an overview of the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 lays out the empirical model. In Section 5, we present the results, and Section 6 concludes.",3

In 2007, OECD countries spent on average 1.2 % of their GDP on DI benefits, which is almost 2.5 times higher than the fraction of GDP spent on unemployment benefits. Only 1-2 % of DI recipients exit from DI receipt into employment per year (OECD, 2003; 2009; 2010). Work disincentives are frequently cited as a reason for low exit rates from DI receipt into employment (OECD, 2010): In most countries, DI recipients lose either all or part of their benefits if their earnings exceed certain thresholds (“cash-cliffs”). Many countries thus plan to reform their DI systems to remove these work disincentives. However, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of DI reforms that provide stronger work incentives for DI recipients.Footnote 1 Campolieti and Riddell (2012) evaluate a change in the “earnings disregard”, which is the amount of earnings that DI recipients are allowed to receive without losing their benefits. Kostøl and Mogstad (2014) as well as Weathers and Hemmeter (2011) evaluate the introduction of a gradual reduction in benefits when people take up or expand work, and Gettens (2009) analyses the effect of expanding health insurance coverage to individuals who exit from DI receipt into employment. While some of these policies increased employment, none of them affected exit rates from DI receipt into employment. To our knowledge, no study so far examines conditional cash incentives that are paid out if DI beneficiaries extend their labour supply and thus reduce their benefit receipt. This paper complements the literature on results of a field experiment in Switzerland. To stimulate employment and benefit reduction, the DI system offered a conditional cash transfer (“seed capital”) to 4,000 randomly selected DI beneficiaries. The cash-transfer is a lump-sum payment, which is granted to individuals who extend their labour supply and reduce benefit receipt by a specified amount. Individuals in this setting have to solve a dynamic optimisation problem. They have to consider a trade off between a flow of DI benefits against a flow of earnings and a fixed one-time cash transfer. The seed capital programme differs in two ways from previous programmes: First, eligibility depends directly on employment outcomes and benefit reduction. Individuals can only claim seed capital if they take up or expand employment and if, as a consequence, their DI benefits decrease by at least one quarter.Footnote 2 Second, the financial incentive is large compared to incentives in previously studied programmes. Individuals receive a payment of 18,000 Swiss francs (CHF) in the high treatment condition or CHF 9,000 in the low treatment condition for a reduction of DI benefits by one quarter. The maximum payment to an individual with a full DI pension who completely terminates DI receipt amounts to CHF 72,000 (about USD 77,000 at the time of the introduction of the programme in September 2010). This amount is comparable to the average disposable yearly income of Swiss households (FSO, 2007). In addition, the lump-sum payment enjoys preferential tax treatment. We use a simple labour supply model to simulate expected responses to seed capital. For a majority of individuals, extending labour supply for a period of more than two years would not have been beneficial. Significantly increased take-up rates of 50 % and higher can be expected for individuals with work disincentives. These are individuals who would lose a substantial amount of their benefits if they increased work hours and thus earnings by a small amount (“cash-cliff constrained” individuals). What can we conclude from this experiment on the role of financial work incentives and cash-cliff constraints? In the aggregate, the programme did not succeed: By the end of the experiment (September 2010–August 2013), only 20 individuals or 0.5 % of the experimental sample took up seed capital.Footnote 3 We investigate the short-term responses to the announcement of seed capital using data on call-backs of DI beneficiaries who asked for further information about seed capital. We find that the size of the financial incentives does not affect response rates. Both in the high and the low treatment group, only about 4 % of individuals contacted their case worker for more information. We find that cash-cliffs play a role, but the reactions of cash-cliff constrained individuals fall far behind the model predictions. More specifically, call-back rates of cash-cliff constrained individuals are only 3 to 4 percentage points higher, compared to the call-back rates of individuals who are not cash-cliff constrained. Consequently, factors that are unrelated to incentives may have prevented individuals from contacting their DI office and from taking up the programme. One potential explanation is that the complexity of the Swiss DI system made it difficult for DI beneficiaries to understand the incentives involved and, as a consequence, many beneficiaries decided not to participate in the programme. Another explanation is that the seed capital offer was not very attractive for risk-averse beneficiaries because it required them to weigh giving up guaranteed DI benefits against a possibly higher, but uncertain labour income. Consistent with this latter explanation, we find that DI beneficiaries whose benefits would have been terminated by taking up seed capital (and with it the possibility of receiving means-tested benefits) were significantly less likely to call back and to schedule a meeting with their case worker. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a description of the disability insurance system in Switzerland and discusses the design of the experiment. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 outlines the expected impact in a standard labour supply model and presents simulation results of the programme effects. Section 5 summarises the results, followed by a discussion in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.",9

Just a decade ago there was mass unemployment with roughly five million unemployed people and low employment rates. Germany was labelled “the sick man in Europe”. Today, unemployment is well below the three million threshold and employment rates are at a record high. Germany has been dubbed a job wonderland and European champion with regard to its labour market (see Rinne and Zimmermann 2013 and Dustmann et al. 2014). Against this backdrop, it is time to reflect on the further development of the basic income system in Germany. It is indeed true that the Hartz reforms, which are considered internationally as the largest labour market reforms in post-war history, led to a clear decline in the number of unemployed and long-term unemployed people; however, the interim reports after five and eight years of the Hartz IV reform (see Koch et al. 2009 and Dietz et al. 2013) clearly show that the problem of long-term unemployment and long-term basic income receipt remains unsolved. Roughly one million people have remained unemployed for longer than one year and are therefore considered long-term unemployed. Approximately three million employable individuals received basic income for about two years or longer and are considered long-term basic income recipients. Note that the 2005 Hartz IV reform as a part of the Hartz reforms refers to the merger of unemployment assistance and public assistance to one means-tested and tax-financed basic income scheme which allowed previous public assistance recipients access to active labour market policy instruments. Therefore, the “carrot and stick” principle of the Hartz reforms is in clear need for further development. The paper is structured as follows. In chapter 2, empirical evidence with a focus on long-term unemployment will be summarised following a depiction of long-term unemployment and long-term basic income receipt. Chapter 3 serves to shed light on the practice of “carrot and stick”. In Chapter 4, a differentiated three-pillar concept for preventing and reducing long-term unemployment and long-term basic income receipt will be outlined on the basis of different experiences with Hartz IV over the last ten years. A conclusion to this issue is given in Chapter 5.",10

Robins,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper presents the final results on the implementation, impacts, costs, and economic benefits of the UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) programme, which sought to improve the labour market prospects of low-paid workers and long-term unemployed people. The paper also highlights some of the methodological contributions of the demonstration, such as the use of cross-office analysis to learn from positive impacts in order to refine policy and, in time, raise overall effectiveness. Launched in 2003 in selected Jobcentre Plus offices, which administer Government cash benefits and employment services, the programme was envisioned as a ‘next step’ in British welfare-to-work policies. Participants in ERA had access to a distinctive set of ‘post-employment’ job coaching and financial incentives, which were added to the job placement services that unemployed people could normally receive through Jobcentre Plus. Once employed, ERA participants could receive at least 2 years of advice and assistance from an employment adviser to help them continue working and advance in work. Those who consistently worked full time could receive substantial cash rewards, called ‘retention bonuses’. Participants could also receive help with tuition costs and cash rewards for completing training courses while employed. The programme has been carefully evaluated though a large-scale randomised control trial. ERA targeted three important groups with different views on and preparation for work and advancement: 
‘The NDLP group’: Unemployed lone parents receiving Income SupportFootnote 1 and volunteering for the New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) welfare-to-work programme; 
‘The WTC group’: Lone parents working part time and receiving Working Tax Credit (WTC), which supplements the wages of low-paid workers; 
‘The ND25+ group’: Long-term unemployed people aged 25 or older receiving Jobseeker’s AllowanceFootnote 2 and who were required to participate in the New Deal 25 Plus (ND25+) welfare-to-work programme. These target groups faced somewhat different types of challenges that impeded their success in the labour market. A goal of the evaluation was to determine whether ERA could help each of them similarly, and whether it worked better for some than others. This paper thus compares the results for all three target groups and provides the final evidence of the programme’s effectiveness over a 5-year follow-up period. Over 16,000 people from six regions of Britain (East Midlands, London, North East England, North West England, Scotland, and Wales) applied to the programme. Random assignment was used in order to conclusively test whether or not ERA helped participants work more, earn more, advance further and achieve better outcomes in other specific areas. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the programme, while the remainder served as a ‘business-as-usual’ control group—a counterfactual which did not receive any assistance from ERA and thus provided a benchmark indicating what would have happened in the absence of the ERA programme. Footnote 3
 Prior to the launch of ERA, the New Deal programmes and Jobcentre Plus offered little further assistance to participants once they obtained jobs. Thus, ERA was a major departure from the ‘business as usual’ approach, and there was no guarantee that Jobcentre Plus could implement the model. The evaluation found that, after initial start-up problems, and despite variations in quality across offices and staff, ERA was largely implemented as designed, attesting that it was feasible to attach a post-employment component to the work of Jobcentre Plus or other employment agencies. ERA produced short-term earnings gains for the two lone parent target groups: the NDLP and WTC groups, which were made up mostly of women. The early gains resulted from increases in the proportion of participants who worked full time (at least 30 h per week). This pattern aligns with the programme’s requirement that participants work full time in order to qualify for the employment retention bonus. These effects generally faded in the later years, after the programme ended. However, an earnings gain appears to have lasted longer among NDLP participants who were better educated, though initially unemployed. Compared with other unemployed lone parents, this group may have had more unrealised potential to succeed in work, which ERA may have tapped into. From a cost-benefit perspective, ERA did not produce encouraging results for the lone parent groups, with the exception of the NDLP better-educated subgroup. More impressive were the results for the long-term unemployed participants (mostly men) in the ND25+ target group. For them, ERA produced modest but sustained increases in employment and substantial and sustained increases in earnings. These positive effects emerged after the first year and were still evident at the end of the follow-up period. The earnings gains were accompanied by lasting reductions in benefits receipt over the 5-year follow-up period. ERA proved cost-effective for this group from the perspectives of the participants themselves, the government budget, and society as a whole. This is a noteworthy achievement for a group that is widely considered among the most difficult to help.",1

An analysis of fiscal policy and the labor market,December 2015,Elva Bova,Christina Kolerus,Sampawende J.A. Tapsoba,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The global financial crisis has left its marks on labor market conditions in many advanced economies. Unemployment increased significantly in the OECD, adding eight million unemployed from 2008 to 2014 (Fig. 1); improvements in labor markets over the past years have been uneven (Fig. 2). The years of the crisis challenged policy makers in addressing unemployment and triggered a series of old and new policy responses aimed at containing job losses through setting incentives for both labor demand and supply (IMF 2010, IMF 2012, OECD 2009). Further, fiscal policy was tilted toward supporting jobs by stimulating aggregate demand. Unemployment Rates in OECD Countries (2008–14) Differences in Employment Rates Between September2014 and September 2008 The objective of this paper is to examine the role of fiscal policies in the dynamics of the labor market. It assesses how fiscal policy instruments and events (consolidation and expansion) affect labor market outcomes. Traditionally the literature has addressed the role of fiscal policy for employment either as a derivate of the output multiplier literature or through studies on the impact of specific fiscal policy instruments, such as labor taxation and unemployment benefits. Against this literature, we provide an innovative angle to the analysis by examining the interplay of fiscal policy, employment and output through the lenses of Okun’s Law. Observed first in the early 1960s, Okun’s Law captures the empirical regularity between employment (unemployment) and output, whereby output expansions are associated by employment expansions (or unemployment reductions). While a broad set of the literature examines the role of labor market institutions in reducing the Okun’s coefficient, not much evidence has been provided on the role played by fiscal variables, namely fiscal policy instruments and episodes of fiscal expansions or fiscal consolidation. To this end, this study re-addresses the issue of the stability of Okun’s Law by looking at the role played by fiscal policy. Precisely, we investigate whether fiscal and labor market policies can alter the responsiveness of employment gaps to output gaps. Using a panel of 34 OECD countries over the period 1985–2013, we calculate time-varying Okun’s coefficients for each country. We first document variations over time and across countries of Okun’s coefficients. Then, we estimate how these coefficients are affected by fiscal policy — spending as well as tax components — and by fiscal events — consolidation and expansions. We also control for the phases of the business cycle by analyzing the responsiveness at times of positive and negative output gaps. In line with the relevant literature, we examine the role played by labor market policies and institutions — active and passive labor market policies as well as employment protection legislation and include a monetary policy variable. The key findings are as follows. Okun’s coefficients display large heterogeneity across countries and over time. We find no impact of specific fiscal instruments on the Okun’s coefficient, suggesting that increasing or reducing total spending or some spending components and increasing or reducing tax rates would not alter the way employment reacts to output. Against this, we find that fiscal consolidation has a sizeable, positive and robust impact on the coefficient, suggesting that increasing tax revenues or reducing the size of the government by reducing spending enhances the responsiveness of employment to output. Interestingly, we find no impact of fiscal expansion on the Okun’s coefficient. We further find that the impact of fiscal consolidation on the Okun’s coefficient does not change according to the phases of the business cycle. This finding suggests that during a consolidation episode, employment tends to be more reactive to output than in normal times. If output is expanding then employment would expand more than in normal times, while if output is contracting, employment would contract more than in normal times. Hence, consolidating in good times (during output expansion) is here found to positively affect employment. The result is robust under a specification which includes the duration of the consolidation episode, expressed in number of years. Further, distinguishing between expenditure-driven and revenue-driven consolidation episodes, we find that the Okun’s coefficient is sensitive only to expenditure reduction and not increases in revenue. This is an interesting result which may highlight the presence of a crowding-in effect for the private sector when the government size in the economy shrinks. Yet an analysis of the change in the composition of spending during consolidation is necessary to accurately interpret the finding in light of a crowding-in effect for the private sector. Finally, we confirm the finding of the literature that employment protection legislation weakens the responsiveness of employment to changes in output. In addition, we find that active labor market policies magnify this impact, while unemployment benefits and early retirement benefits do not alter the Okun’s coefficient. We also find that monetary policy, here captured by the central bank money rate, has a negative impact on the coefficient. This result could capture changes in labor demand not due to output but rather caused by increases in the cost of capital relative to labor. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a review of the literature on the stability of the Okun’s Law and on the way fiscal policy can impact the labor market; Section III presents the empirical analysis, including model specification, data and estimation results; Section IV concludes.",5

To that purpose, use is made of the information provided in the European Commission LABREF database, which collects characteristics of policy measures in a wide range of labour market fields. Since the onset of EMU, there was clear awareness that a successful monetary union would require reforming labour markets where needed in such a way as to ease adjustment in the face of asymmetric shocks and to permit the correction of macroeconomic imbalances. The need for such reforms has become urgent after the crisis in light of the highly asymmetrical impact on the financial sector, public finances, and the real economy of EU countries and as a consequence of the sudden unwinding of large external imbalances accumulated over the 2000s. After the financial crisis, most EU countries have stepped up their reform agenda by reviewing existing interventions to support employment and by taking action to reform labour market institutions to foster adjustment to the major shocks materialised since the Great Recession. This increased reform activism calls for a proportionately increased effort to track the record of past reforms and assess their features, determinants and effects. Although relevant progress has been made in recent decades in measuring the impact of different policy settings on aggregate labour market outcomes (e.g., Nickell and Layard, 1999; Blanchard and Wolfers 2000), the assessment of reforms remains a challenging task. The first and most important condition for an effective assessment of reforms is adequate information on the reform features and characteristics. The aim of this paper is to describe recent reforms carried out in EU countries making use of the LABREF database that was set up by DG ECFIN of the European Commission in cooperation with the Economic Policy Committee of the ECOFIN Council. This database contains information on a large set of policy measures carried out between 2000 and 2011. As compared with other similar existing databases, it contains information on a larger set of reform characteristics. Despite limitations of count data on reform events, the evidence permits a number of interesting insights. Countries with similar institutional settings have followed broadly analogous reform patterns throughout the 2000s. The 2008 crisis triggered increased policy activism in most policy domains in a large number of EU countries. In a first phase, reforms were mainly aimed at supporting labour demand during at the start of the recession and adapting social safety nets. In a second phase, reforms became more intense in domains with relevance for labour market adjustment, including employment protection legislation (EPL) and wage setting frameworks, while tax wedge and welfare reforms became increasingly constrained by the available fiscal space in a number of countries. By analysing labour market reform drivers across the EU, the paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of structural reforms and, thanks to the high degree of detail of the LABREF database, helps digging deeper to understanding what drives different types of reforms. Two reform indicators are considered. First, the simple count of policy measures introduced overall and by specific policy domains. Second, a measure of reform stance by policy domain, which takes into account in which direction the underlying policy variables are moving as a result of reforms. Despite the relatively short time series available, the sample permits the carrying out of regression analysis, which offers interesting insights. The evidence shows that reforms were more numerous in countries with a lower GDP per-capita at the start of the sample, suggesting that the evolution of labour market institutions was faster in EU countries at earlier stages of economic development. The evidence also shows that, other things being equal, reform activism was more intense in countries with a longer record of EU membership. The findings give some support to the hypothesis that crises and harsh economic and labour market conditions are associated with an increased number of structural reforms (Drazen and Easterly, 2001; Høj et al., 2006). A higher unemployment rate and the presence of a large negative output gap are associated with a higher frequency of reforms, although results depend on the specific policy domain, the relation being strong especially for active labour market policies, EPL, early retirement and retirement age reforms, and wage setting reforms. There is also support for the hypothesis that, as reforms are often politically costly, they are more likely under conditions that reduce the actual or perceived political cost for governments. Reforms appear less likely in election years, while the likelihood is higher immediately after elections. The evidence also moderately suggests that the fraction of parliamentary seats held by the government is positively associated with reforms. Fiscal variables have instead a non-systematic relation with reform activism, results depending on specific reform domains. The reform stance variable, in line with previous evidence (Høj et al., 2006), exhibits a clear relation with initial policy conditions. Reforms raising the tax burden are less likely the higher the tax wedge on labour; those increasing the generosity of unemployment benefits occur less often the higher are net replacement rates for unemployment insurance; reforms increasing the degree of stringency of EPL reforms are less numerous if EPL is rigid to start with. Regarding EPL, it appears that the strictness of regulation for permanent contracts makes reforms easing EPL restrictions more likely, while the initial degree of regulation for temporary contracts has no association either with EPL reforms in general or with reforms targeted to temporary contracts. The reform stance depends on labour market conditions in the expected way, with high unemployment being associated with reforms lowering the tax burden on labour, raising the generosity of unemployment benefits and that of active labour market policies. The LABREF database permits digging deeper into such findings and uncovers that, over the crisis period, unemployment generosity was increased especially in terms of entitlement conditions, while benefit duration was not increased and was actually made tighter in a majority of cases starting from 2010. The direction of reforms depends also on the initial fiscal position, in line with findings of previous literature (e.g., Duval, 2008; Høj et al., 2006), with the relation depending on the specific policy domain considered. With lower government deficits, reforms tend to lower the tax burden of labour and to increase the generosity of unemployment benefits. The data also provide some support to the view that reforms, notably those reducing the extent of employment and wage setting regulations, are triggered by financial market pressure, as measured by the interest rate spreads on government bonds. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the measurement of economic reforms and describes the LABREF database. Section 3 presents the main trends of labour market reforms in the EU since 2000 by broad policy domains and country groups. Section 4 studies the economic determinants of reforms, in particular by a detailed regression analysis of how the economic, political and fiscal context influences the emergence of specific reforms. Section 5 concludes.",29

There are a number of reasons for undertaking this inquiry, and we seek to answer a number of interrelated questions. First, since the older population is a sizeable and ever growing demographic group with limited time to recover from economic shocks like the one recently experienced, we seek to understand how the recession impacted this demographic group overall. Understanding if and how the economic downturn impacted the wealth of this segment of the population can help us prepare for subsequent generations of older households that can be subject to similar shocks. Second, we analyze whether there is a differential impact by nativity. Immigrants’ and natives’ portfolios are likely to differ in substantial ways due to various economic, social and cultural factors. For example, due to differences in labor market opportunities or risk preferences, immigrants may be more or less likely to own businesses, hold certain types of financial assets or invest in non-owner occupied housing than natives. As such, immigrants and natives might have either responded to or been impacted by the 2008–2009 economic shock in different ways. By examining the impact of the recession by group, we may gain insights into whether different approaches to asset accumulation are better or worse suited to withstanding shocks like the Great Recession as different portfolio mixes may have either accentuated or attenuated the economic shock following the downturn. Third, we examine whether different wealth categories did better or worse following the economic contraction. Since poorer and richer households face different constraints that result in differences in portfolio holdings, poorer and richer households may have been impacted differently due to the recession. We examine these differences, continuing to take nativity into consideration. Using data from the 2006 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal study of U.S. households aged 50 and above, we estimate the impact that the recession had on the overall wealth and asset accumulation strategies of older American households. In our analysis, we distinguish among three categories of households according to their nativity–native, immigrant and mixed households. Native households are households in which the household head and the spouse are both native-born. Immigrant households are similarly defined as those households where the household head and spouse are both foreign-born. Finally, mixed households are households in which the household head and the spouse differ in their nativity, with one being native-born and the other foreign-born. Sometimes these households are considered to be ‘partially’ assimilated. Do “partially assimilated” households behave more like native or immigrant households in their asset compositions? If the wealth accumulation patterns of households differ by nativity and the recession impacted the ownership rates and values of various assets differently, the downturn may have had different impacts on these various groups of households. Furthermore, the declines in asset values may have been particularly harmful among groups with inadequate safety nets. Due to their undocumented status (now or in the past), shorter work histories or differences in employment patterns, immigrant households might be less likely to qualify for old age social security benefits than natives. And, if they qualify, their payouts may be lower. If that is the case, immigrants could end up being exposed to significantly greater economic and well-being hurdles. We find that the so-called Great Recession has made a significant dent on the portfolios of older American households by eroding the value of specific assets to the point of impacting their retirement strategies, as noted by other studies in the literature. Furthermore, its impacts were unevenly distributed across demographic and economic groups, with mixed and immigrant households in the middle and top wealth quartiles prior to the recession enduring significantly larger wealth losses than natives due, primarily, to their greater losses in primary housing ownership and primary housing values.",7

It led to sharp increases in unemployment in many countries and a resurgence in the numbers of long-term unemployed. While unemployment has subsequently fallen back in the United States from its high of over 10% in 2010 to under 7% at the end of 2013, and in Japan too, it has continued to rise in the European Union: the average EU28 harmonised unemployment rate rose from under 7% in early 2008 to 10.7% at the end of 2013. The increases in unemployment have inevitably brought labour market policies back to centre stage and put the spotlight on the potential of so-called “activation strategies” to help the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed and other at-risk groups, find jobs. At the beginning, the concept of activation was viewed in a very narrow sense: it meant increasing public resources going into a range of active labour market policies (ALMPs) as opposed to spending public resources on so-called “passive labour market policies”, namely unemployment insurance (UI), unemployment assistance (UA) and related welfare benefits. The underlying idea was to shift the balance on public spending on labour market policies away from passive spending towards spending on ALMPs and in that way help to reduce structural unemployment (see Appendix 1 for a brief resume of the history of the concept of activation). However, the evidence from OECD countries’ experiences in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that this view of activation was too naïve. It neglected the fact that some countries with relatively low spending on ALMPs maintained low unemployment rates while other countries with above-average ALMP spending experienced rising structural unemployment. It also neglected the fact that economic theory highlighted several potentially important interactions between the generosity of UI systems, the size and mix of ALMP spending and the degree to which benefit eligibility is subject to conditions concerning job search and employability1. As a result, the concept of activation was broadened to embrace these different elements and take due account of possible interactions between them. While there is no agreed definition of the concept, the OECD currently defines activation strategies as aiming: “to bring more people into the effective labour force, to counteract the potentially negative effects of unemployment and related benefits on work incentives by enforcing their conditionality on active job search and participation in measures to improve employability, and to manage employment services and other labour market measures so that they effectively promote and assist the return to work”2. Drawing on analytical studies and member country experiences in the 1990s and early 2000s, the OECD and the European Commission encouraged member countries to implement effective activation strategies for the unemployed, arguing that the evidence showed that they would help cut unemployment and boost employment. They also argued the case for extending the remit of activation strategies, suitably modified, to other working-age recipients of a range of inactivity benefits such as disability/long-term sickness, early retirement, and sole-parent or social assistance benefits. The Great Recession and the subsequent hikes in unemployment in many countries have proved to be a severe stress test for activation strategies, and it is opportune to assess how they are standing up to this test bearing in mind that the current job crisis is far from over in many countries. This paper aims to shed light on this important question via the lens of recent OECD research, notably a series of on-going country reviews of activation policies in selected countries. It will also chart, using the well-known OECD/Eurostat data base on labour market policies, how member countries have responded to rising unemployment in terms of the resources they are devoting to meet this challenge. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 1 presents the stylised facts as to how OECD countries have responded to the job crisis in terms of ramping up their ALMP and activation efforts. This is followed by a review of the macroeconomic evidence on the impact of ALMPs on unemployment and employment rates. The third section summarises some of the key lessons that can be drawn from the OECD activation policy reviews. Section 4 highlights some unanswered questions about activation. The final section presents some bottom lines.",77

But for some skills, particularly in health care, shortages are global—and skilled migration has the potential to exacerbate shortages in skilled migrants’ countries of origin. Policy responses that involve blocking skilled migration may be difficult to implement effectively or ethically, and do little to resolve skill imbalances at the destination. This note proposes a new kind of policy response to global skill shortages. A Global Skill Partnership is a bilateral public-private partnership to link skill creation and skill mobility in a mutually beneficial and equitable way. Countries of migrant origin and destination agree ex ante who will bear the costs of training skilled migrants, and allow a small portion of the large economic gains from skill mobility to foster skill creation in origin countries. Well-designed partnerships would eliminate and even reverse fiscal drain from origin countries due to new migration, while preserving workers’ mobility and providing needed skills at the destination. This note focuses on one profession and one region: It offers examples of why and how a partnership for the training and mobility of nurses might work between North Africa and Europe. But such partnerships could in principle work in various professions and regions. These partnerships take a dual economic opportunity and turn it into an engine of human capital creation for both origin countries and destination countries. The first opportunity to create value is the very large gap in the price of nursing services between migrant-origin countries and destination countries. Nursing services are worth 5–8 times as much, for example, in Western Europe as in parts of North Africa. The second opportunity is that the cost of nurse training at the migrant origin is a small fraction of the cost at the destination. It likewise costs at least 5–8 times as much to train a nurse in Western Europe as it costs in North Africa. Skilled migration can thus create enormous economic value. Global Skill Partnerships share that value in a way that origins, destinations, and migrants can agree to. This proposal begins by describing global skill imbalances in nursing and discussing four traditional classes of policy response, each of which has important disadvantages. It then sketches why and how a Global Skill Partnership could do better than traditional approaches in some settings, and offers examples in the North African setting. It then lists several design features key to the success of such partnerships, and reviews global experience with related initiatives in the past.",17

Addison,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper charts changing views on a labor market institution from the perspective of microeconomic and macroeconomic flexibility. The particular labor market institution examined here is collective bargaining—other labor market institutions will be mentioned only in passing. And in discussing microeconomic flexibility and reallocation needs, we will be rather more concerned with enterprise flexibility than with considerations of external adjustment. Our discussion of macroeconomic flexibility centers familiarly on the ability of the economy to maintain a low average unemployment rate and to limit fluctuations in the unemployment rate in response to shocks under different collective bargaining regimes. In discussing micro flexibility, evidence that unionism is associated with wage rigidity constraining labor market reallocation has to be considered in the context of bargaining level as well as alongside the apparent stimulus given to adjustments along other margins. Further, the importance of internal labor markets under both union and non-union regimes redirects our attention to enterprise flexibility. Theoretical developments in the areas of collective voice and contract theory that focus on internal labor market structuring have offered support for pro-productive union effects. If the promise of unions in this regard remains unfulfilled for the USA, this evidence cannot be uncritically applied to other nations. In particular, some of the more promising performance results are reported for the German dual system of sectoral bargaining in combination with workplace codetermination. Work on macro flexibility was if anything to portray unionism and collective bargaining in a more positive light once research moved beyond a focus on union density/coverage and the simple exertion of market power. But the performance of models based on corporatism, modified notions of centralization (most notably the hump-shape thesis), and even coordination faded through time. That is, institutions did not affect macro outcomes consistently. Moreover, important changes in collective bargaining beginning in the 1990s in the form of decentralization were not reflected in the stylized institutions. However, Visser’s (2013, 2016) updated discussion of national collective bargaining institutions provides a comprehensive breakdown of changes in collective bargaining along the dimensions of bargaining coverage, bargaining structure, and bargaining coordination. His discussion is summarized in the present treatment, and certain key themes uncovered there enlarged upon. These include extension agreements, orientation, and above all decentralization. Visser’s taxonomy pays especial attention to decentralization while addressing diversity of practice within bargaining categories. In conjunction with other pieces of evidence, it helps us establish the protean shape of emerging (i.e., decentralized) collective bargaining systems that may be fit-for-purpose in the sense of meeting the requirements of micro and macro flexibility. Supportive case study material drawn from studies of innovative practices associated with decentralization is provided. Specific support for the German model and the modified Scandinavian model is qualified by very recent theoretical work pointing to the superiority of fully decentralized collective bargaining systems also reviewed here. It is argued that these models of firm-level bargaining are not inconsistent with the German and Scandinavian sectoral models. By the same token, one has to recognize that these theoretical developments more directly make a case for the Anglo-Saxon model, albeit one probably differentiated from the two other models by its greater reliance on managerial control. This is a not unimportant conclusion and is consistent with Freeman’s (1998: 15) evocative “more than one road to Rome” remark. It has long been argued that trust may be just as important in securing macro (and micro) flexibility as the structure of collective bargaining itself. In tackling the neglected issue of trust, its association with unemployment is examined together with some supplementary research findings on the relation between trust and the design and the quantity of labor market legislation. In addition, the intriguing notion that the very scale of the changes in wage-setting institutions in recent years may have served to erode trust is addressed. Social pacts are also considered since they may be viewed either as requiring trust or as substituting for it. In discussing the polder model 1982–2000, it becomes clear that there are also features of the collective bargaining system that potentially help build trust. For this reason, our series of fit-for-purpose collective bargaining models may be expanded to include the contemporary Dutch system. The last major theme examined in this report is the vexed question of earnings dispersion, analysis of which has gained more currency of late because of the association between inequality and growth. Information on this association is reviewed before turning to union decline and inequality. Two basic views of unions and inequality are offered. The first is the standard one: unions are associated with reduced inequality, the corollary being that their decline has exacerbated it. The second is associated with the recherché notion that unions have in fact become less interested in redistribution. Even if one accepts that union decline is an important determinant of rising inequality, however, there is no general presumption in favor of strengthening the institution. The growth card is complicated precisely because losses of competitiveness may have caused union decline. However, to take up a separate issue, and one remitted to our concluding section, might not the case for offering support to unionism be stiffened by the likelihood of a shortfall in worker voice in the wake of union decline? At face value, this case is rather more convincing, and mandates favoring (some form of) worker representation may be indicated. That said, the evidence, while not unequivocal, points to a dramatic expansion of British non-union voice in the wake of union decline in that nation as well as the active suggestion that management has had an incentive to invest in non-union voice. It is important to recognize that the present treatment is a partial one. It reflects the very real state of flux in the institutions of collective bargaining that awaits formal incorporation into models of the covariation of labor market institutions and macro outcomes. Further, at the more detailed micro level, it reflects in part the tendency of research to focus on Anglo-Saxon nations and a few key continental European nations and also in part the research preoccupations of the author. As a result, some nations will be mentioned only in passing and others largely ignored. The limitations of this explorative analysis have therefore to be stated at the outset and borne in mind throughout. The goal is to establish key associations and the most important trends in a framework that seeks to identify a plurality of fit-for-purpose regimes rather than favoring any single model.",13
5.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,13 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40173-016-0074-9,Sharing housework between husbands and wives: how to improve marital satisfaction for working wives in Japan,December 2016,Mayu Kobayashi,Miki Kobayashi,Emiko Usui,Female,Female,Female,Female,"In Japan, household chores and child-rearing duties are rarely outsourced; family members, particularly women, overwhelmingly perform them (Davis and Greenstein 2004; Greenstein 2009; Kamo 1994). This is the case partly because outside help is not affordable for many families in Japan, unlike in the US and many Asian countries, where hiring domestic workers (often, if not typically, foreign workers) is an affordable and available option (Cortes and Pan 2013; Cortes and Tasseda 2011). In a 2013 survey, only 1.1 % of Japanese households reported having utilized housekeeping services within the past 2 years (Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training 2014). Furthermore, in a public opinion poll conducted by the Japanese Cabinet Office in 2000, 83.0 % (80.6 %) of Japanese women (men) preferred family members to perform housework—such as meal preparation, cleaning, and washing—whereas only 17.8 % (14.2 %) of women (men) preferred to use outside services for such tasks (Cabinet Office, Government of Japan 2001). Most childcare services in Japan are institutional, and informal babysitting is not common. It is not common practice for older school-aged girls to provide inexpensive babysitting for other families (Aoki 2012) or for immigrant labor to provide inexpensive childcare in the home. Performing household chores and child-rearing on weekdays is a significant burden for working married women because such housework must be performed before or after their workday. If they continue to work, these women typically reduce the time they spend on leisure and sleep, which can reduce life satisfaction. Fearing such burdens and given the difficulty faced in engaging in household chores and/or child-rearing while remaining fully employed, many married Japanese women choose to either work part-time at a reduced wage or leave the labor force altogether. In fact, the proportion of married women in Japan who work full-time has remained stagnant, at approximately 30 % since the 1980s (Abe 2011). Due to Japan’s low birthrate and extended life expectancy, the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (2012) projects that the proportion of the Japanese working-age population (aged between 15 and 64 years) will decrease from its 2010 share of 63.8 to 49.7, 50.7, or 51.9 % by 2060, depending on whether the projections for both fertility and mortality rates are low, medium, or high, respectively. No matter the scenarios, these demographic projections indicate that the working-age population will continue to decline. One of the most effective ways for Japan to mitigate the adverse effects of this demographic trend is to increase the number of Japanese women participating in the labor market as well as the extent of each woman’s participation. Our paper thus examines how martial satisfaction of Japanese wives is related to the housework that is performed by the husbands. We focus on the nature of the support married men provide by performing household chores. Specifically, we examine whether the timing of housework performed by husbands—on weekdays or weekends—affects wives’ satisfaction with their husbands. We distinguish between weekdays and weekends because the opportunity cost of not working in the market on weekdays is often greater for husbands than for wives, as the market wage of husbands tends to be higher. However, the opportunity cost of not working on weekends tends to be similar for husbands and wives because work opportunities on weekends are similarly limited for both.Footnote 1
 Using the Japanese Longitudinal Survey on Employment and Fertility (LOSEF), we find that in couples with a nonworking wife, the wife’s satisfaction with her husband is higher when he performs less housework on weekdays, while the husband’s satisfaction with his wife is higher when she performs more housework on weekdays. As a result, for single-earner couples, both husbands and wives are more satisfied with the other spouse if the wife performs the greater share of the housework on weekdays. However, in dual-earner couples, spousal satisfaction for both husbands and wives is higher when the other spouse performs more housework on weekdays. Japanese dual-earner couples are unable to spend more time on housework, because of husbands’ inability to reduce their long working hours and the fact that wives are already performing a significant share of housework on weekdays. Therefore, institutional and social constraints have to be relaxed to improve the well-being of Japanese dual-earner couples.Footnote 2
 The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the LOSEF data. Section 3 discusses how housework is shared among married couples in Japan. The focus of the paper is in Section 4, in which the relationship between the spouse’s share of housework and spousal satisfaction is examined. The paper concludes in Section 5.",9

Over the past decades, the demand for knowledge and advice on the role and the adequate set of EPL has grown in the global context of heightened competition, pressure for greater labor market flexibility, and especially the jobs crisis of 2008–2016. Many countries adopted reforms of EPL in the hopes of boosting employment creation and reducing unemployment, especially among most vulnerable groups. While the role of employment protection legislation has been studied in various contexts, EPL remains one of the most controversial labor market institutions, whether its impact is examined on unemployment, on productivity, or on economic growth (for most recent overviews, see Betcherman, 2012; 2014). One of the key features that virtually all studies on the role of EPL performed on the macroeconomic level share is the assumption that EPL applies to the whole labor market. Some authors do warn that labor markets in theory differ from other markets because different rules may govern employment of different workers (Boeri, 2011). Others also highlight that the existing measures of EPL account only for the legal dimension of this institution, such as the level of protection afforded to workers, but do not consider enforcement or coverage issues which are essential to understanding how labor regulations operate (Bertola et al., 2000). Yet, these issues remain largely out of the scope of the analysis. Empirical studies, starting from the pioneering Lazear (1990), to now typically cited Scarpetta (1996), Nickell (1997), Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), Footnote 1 but also more recently Bassanini and Duval (2009) or De Serres et al. (2012), contain an implicit assumption that EPL rules apply to all workers. Likewise, some recent theoretical or general equilibrium studies, such as Bouis et al. (2011) or Cacciatore et al. (2012), model EPL effect similar to other macroeconomic variables that concern all workers. In the same spirit, analytical work conducted by international organizations, whether the World Bank (ex.: World Bank, 2013), the IMF (ex.: IMF, 2016), the OECD (ex.: OECD, 2007 and subsequent publications), or the ILO (ex.: ILO, 2015a), does not generally account for EPL coverage. Our paper shows that, because EPL rarely concerns all workers, such studies most probably overestimate the aggregate EPL effect, as well as the scope and the size of EPL reforms that need to be undertaken. The aim of this paper is to document the extent to which the issue of EPL coverage may matter. We start by exploring the information provided by the ILO EPLexFootnote 2 database, which records legal rules governing termination of employment contracts,Footnote 3 regulations of fixed-term contracts, as well as the scope of regulation, or legal coverage. The ILO EPLex database, under its “scope of regulation” section, lists firm and worker categories that are formally excluded from statutes, in a sample of over 90 countries, over the period from 2009 to 2013. Equipped with this listing, we use national statistics of these countries, as well as other data sources, to assemble data on the number of workers in each of the excluded categories. We relate this to the total number of employees and of the employed to construct measures of legal coverage of employment protection legislation for employees and for the employed, respectively. As the ILO EPLex database contains legal coverage of workers concerned only by legal provisions and not including, apart from very few exceptions, case law or collective agreements on this subject, the coverage data that we thus assemble can be viewed as the EPL coverage by laws, or what can be called a general EPL regime, rather than EPL coverage at large.Footnote 4 These coverage data also complement the EPLex aggregate indicators (ILO, 2015c) measuring the overall level of legal protection afforded to workers in case of individual termination of regular contracts at the initiative of the employer, as well as the ILO EPLex information on regulations of fixed-term contracts. This paper further documents all the methodological issues encountered during this data compilation, as well as all data sources and assumptions made. It also shows differences across countries in the extent of EPL legal coverage, highlighting the importance of accounting for it in the macroeconomic analysis of EPL. Our results demonstrate that EPL coverage varies significantly across countries. In some countries, legal coverage of employees by the general EPL regime is complete (i.e., Armenia or Romania), while in others, it is relatively low (i.e., Turkey, which excludes domestic workers, agricultural workers, managers/executives, some other worker categories, but also enterprises with less than 30 workers). Naturally, because by definition EPL only applies to workers who are in a subordinate employment relationship (wage employees), and does not apply to self-employed, by construction, EPL coverage for employees is always higher than EPL coverage of the employed. In developed countries, where wage employment represents a large share of total employment, EPL coverage of the employed is close to that of employees, and both tend to be very high, ranging from 90 to 100 %. In developing countries, however, where wage employment remains limited, EPL concerns only a very small portion of all employed, being less than 5 % in a country like Niger. Clearly, studies and policy actions addressing the role of EPL in such settings should focus not only on setting up an appropriate level of EPL but also on ensuring that EPL is a relevant institution. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses some of the particularities of coverage information. Section 3 outlines methodological assumptions of the data construction. Section 4 provides detailed data description. Section 5 discusses the relationship between coverage and level of protection afforded by EPL. The remainder of the paper contains data collection assumptions (Appendices 1 and 2). All data sources are made available through an online appendix and are also available on request.",9

In developed economies, labour market legislation reforms have been perceived as useful instruments to sustain employment levels in times of rising unemployment rates and limited public resources (OECD 2012). In developing countries, the attention towards labour market legislation has mostly concerned the need to protect workers against shocks in labour demand resulting from fluctuations in international trade (ILO 2015a). In both cases, policy interventions have differed with respect to their (i) motivation (e.g. enhance competitiveness or kick-start job creation); (ii) direction (e.g. increasing or decreasing protection); and (iii) area of intervention (e.g. permanent or temporary workers, collective bargaining). This variation raises questions about the determinants of labour market reforms as well as about the effectiveness of these reforms in improving labour market outcomes. In an effort to better understand these developments, we build a novel compendium of labour market reforms that covers 110 advanced and developing economies for the period between 2008 and 2014. To our knowledge, this represents one of the most comprehensive attempts to map changes in labour market legislation during the crisis—both in terms of countries covered as well as areas of employment legislation. A descriptive analysis based on the data in our compendium shows that reform intensity has increased during the first phase of the recession, reaching a peak in 2012. Between 2012 and 2014 the average number of reforms passed annually decreased, matching levels that characterized the pre-crisis period. Moreover, the majority of reforms have decreased existing levels of regulation—although large disparities are registered across geographical regions and policy subdomains. Reforms of permanent contracts have been at the centre of the attention of policymakers in developed economies, while governments in developing economies have primarily reformed collective bargaining institutions. Finally, the majority of reforms have been of permanent (rather than temporary) nature and they have targeted the entire eligible population (rather than specific subgroups). Drawing on our compendium of labour market reforms, the purpose of the paper is twofold. First, it seeks to explain determinants of reforms’ approval. The results of the analysis show that high and increasing unemployment rates have positively affected the probability of adopting labour market reforms. At the same time, the approval of reforms is positively associated with the simultaneous implementation of fiscal consolidation measures as well as the presence of a fixed exchange rate regime. These results partially confirm the findings from earlier studies (Turrini et al. 2015; Duval and Elmeskov 2006; Høj et al. 2006), while expanding their geographical coverage. The paper then examines the determinants of labour market reforms across policy directions (i.e. increasing or decreasing legislation), temporal horizon (i.e. temporary or permanent measure) and coverage (i.e. complete or two-tier intervention). Furthermore, it also examines the different labour market subdomains where reforms have been implemented. Our results show that determinants of labour market reforms approved between 2008 and 2014 do indeed differ across these dimensions, thus providing new insights to the existing literature. Finally, we examine the short-term effects of labour market reforms on unemployment rates. In the baseline specification, we find no effects of either a reduction or an increase in labour market regulation on changes in unemployment. However, when analysing the effects of reforms at different points of the business cycle, the results reveal that deregulatory labour market reforms increase the unemployment rate in the short run when they are approved during crises—while not having a statistically significant effect if they are implemented during periods of economic stability or expansion. These results are in line with the previous literature which argues that structural reforms might have unintended consequences when implemented during economic crises (Cacciatore et al. 2012; Bouis et al. 2012). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology used to compile the policy compendium and presents the main reform trends derived from it. Section 3 discusses the empirical results looking at the determinants (Section 3.1) and short-term effects (Section 3.2) of labour market reforms. Section 4 summarizes our findings and concludes.",14

So far, studies suggest that in many countries, the returns to tertiary education have risen or held steady, implying that the rising demand has at least till recently kept pace with the supply (e.g. Machin and McNally 2007), while in only a few countries such as Hong Kong (Lui and Suen 2005) have the returns fallen. There is some evidence, however, of differentiation in the returns along varied dimensions (e.g. Martins and Pereira 2004; Hoekstra 2009; Green and Zhu 2010; Altonji et al. 2012; Figueiredo et al. 2013; Lindley and Machin 2014). Differentiation reflects a combination of within-group skill heterogeneity and disequilibrium in the graduate labour market, consistent with a range of labour market theories (McGuinness 2006). This paper examines changing differentiation in the recent evolving graduate labour market in Britain, through the lens of evidence on “graduate jobs” using a new indicator. Hitherto, discourse on graduate labour markets that focuses directly on supply- and demand-side indicators has been hindered by the lack of a widely accepted, conceptually satisfactory method of classifying occupations as “graduate jobs” or “non-graduate jobs”. Existing classifications are used by career advisers, human resource service companies, policymakers, and journalists (e.g. ONS 2013; Scurry and Blenkinsopp 2011; Milburn 2009; Groom 2013), as well as by researchers studying high-skilled labour markets and graduate overeducation. But no consensus exists as to what constitutes a graduate job. Some classifications are conceptually flawed, using tautological indicators, while others are unsuitable for analysing trends over time or rely on a traditional concept that makes no room for upskilling outside the professional and high managerial occupations. This paper contributes a new method of classifying occupations, which is conceptually valid, based as it is on direct evidence of skill use in jobs, and which is therefore responsive to changes in job skills within jobs. Several empirical tests of its criterion validity support its use over other indicators. While we deploy the indicator to analyse recent changes in Britain’s high-skilled labour market, it can be used in a wide variety of settings and for multiple purposes. While changes in tertiary education mismatch might arise from changes in the efficiency of skills matching institutions or from changing within-group skill heterogeneity, current concern tends to focus on the overall balance of the stock of graduates and graduate jobs, supplemented by potential effects from the great recession. The growth of graduate jobs is linked to the rising demand for high skills, as concluded by the substantial research literature on skill-biased and task-biased technological change (e.g. Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Goos et al. 2014). However, questions surround whether the pace of change in demand has been lagging behind the rising graduate supply or indeed whether the growth in high-skills demand has decelerated or even reversed (Beaudry et al. 2016). Adding to public unease surrounding the prevalence of graduate overeducation alongside high costs of HE, its consequences may also be changing. In many countries, occupational upgrading has taken the form of an asymmetric polarisation of employment (Autor et al. 2003; Dustmann et al. 2009; Fernandez-Macias 2012; Salvatori 2015). The relative diminution of middle-tier jobs implies that the experience of being a mismatched (that is, overeducated) graduate could involve an increasing wage penalty relative to matched graduates, as the average quality of jobs below graduate level diminishes, while that of high-skilled graduate jobs rises. With rising graduate unemployment following the Great Recession comes also the fear that more graduates will take up non-graduate jobs and encounter fewer opportunities to progress into graduate jobs. To assess these concerns in respect of Britain, and to illuminate recent trends in the graduate labour market, the questions we pose in this paper are as follows: what has been happening to the aggregate balance between graduates and graduate jobs? What has been happening to the prevalence of overeducation among graduates over the medium term since the late 1990s? Has there been an increasing differentiation in the returns to HE, and have the negative effects of being overeducated become more severe? With this new indicator, we find that over the course of approximately a decade from the late 1990s, the number of graduate jobs rose almost as much as the rise in the supply of graduates. Moreover, graduate overeducation increased only by a small and statistically insignificant amount. The greater part of the rise in graduate jobs came from an increased prevalence of high-level occupations, but we find also some evidence of occupational re-grading. Nevertheless, we also find increasing dispersion in the returns to tertiary education over the decade and a significant deterioration in the experience associated with being overeducated, with substantive rises in the wage penalty and no decline in the persistence of overeducation. Together, the findings imply that, even though the average return to investing in HE has not fallen, the risk has increased. In the next section, we examine the concept of a graduate job, consider desirable properties for an indicator, and review existing classifications of graduate jobs. Section 3 describes our data and new classification method. Section 4 provides the British institutional context and presents our findings on the trends in graduate jobs and in graduate overeducation over an interval of just over a decade. Section 5 takes up the issue of the penalty facing overeducated graduates and whether this has been changing over the same period. Section 6 examines changes in the labour market transitions of graduates with respect to their overeducation status.",17

In particular, the search for the factors determining the misperception of unemployment or current inflation has pointed to the relevance of personality traits (Orland 2013), education, cognitive ability, income or wealth, and exposure to media, together with own experience and the situation prevailing in one’s region of residence (see Kunovich 2013; Duffy and Lunn 2009; Blanchflower and Kelly 2008; Conover et al. 1986). In turn, the analysis of the consequences of inaccurate perceptions of the economic situation has concentrated on individuals’ attitudes and behavior. Kunovich (2013) shows that misperception of the unemployment rate has an impact on people’s views on democracy, the role of the State, and labor conflicts. Duffy and Lunn (2009) report that individuals’ misperception of current inflation is negatively related to both consumption and savings intentions. We contribute to this literature by analyzing the implications of misperceptions of the state of the labor market on actual personal outcomes. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of the misperception of labor market tightness—unemployment rate—on individual wages. Our analysis relies on a direct measure of labor market knowledge imperfections to evaluate its impact on labor market returns. We exploit information gathered by the European Social Survey (ESS), which included in its 2008 wave a question on the respondents’ degree of information about the job market. More precisely, individuals were asked for an estimate of the unemployment rate in their country. We take the deviation between their answers and the actual unemployment rate in the country as the degree of misperception of the job market situation. This index is used to explore the extent to which labor market knowledge affects individual behavior and thus labor market outcomes. In particular, if a pessimistic view of the unemployment rate is associated with concern over becoming unemployed, it will influence workers’ decisions, namely on the reservation wage, which would be set too low. The ESS reveals that workers’ perceptions of labor market tightness, though related to the actual phenomenon, are remarkably imprecise. This evidence on widespread information misperceptions in the labor market is corroborated by (rare) surveys where this type of questions is asked (see Ipsos MORI 2014; Curtin 2008; Papacostas 2008; Fullone et al. 2008). In any case, evidence on its impact on economic outcomes is lacking. Our empirical strategy departs from the estimation of Mincer-augmented wage regressions, which include controls for the worker attributes, firm- and job-related attributes, and family demographics. Given that the outcome variable is measured in intervals, we estimate interval regression models and, as a robustness check, ordered probit models. We tackle potential endogeneity problems that may affect our initial estimates. Indeed, if individual- or country-level unobserved factors that influence wage setting are correlated with the degree of labor market knowledge imperfections, our initial estimates will be biased. Such will be the case if, for example, individuals perceive the unemployment rate by looking at individuals in their circle, namely their region or education level. We adopt a threefold strategy to handle this problem: controlling for the regional unemployment rate, which could influence an individual’s perceptions of the country unemployment rate and has been widely documented as a determinant of wages, according to the wage curve literature (Blanchflower and Oswald 1994); controlling for country fixed effects, which will capture any countrywide factors common to all individuals, such as the institutional setting, mobility costs, or labor market tightness; and controlling for worker ability, based on two proxy variables reported in the dataset by the survey interviewer. Section 2 describes the data and the key variables used, while Section 3 discusses specifically the indicator of labor market misperceptions. The empirical models are introduced in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results and discusses potential mechanisms. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",7

In the USA, between 3.5 and 6 million young adults, ages 16 to 24, can be classified as high school dropouts, those without a high school credential and not currently enrolled in school (Northeastern University Center for Labor Market Studies 2009, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014). While many of these young adults eventually earn a high school credential—a diploma or more often a General Educational Development (GED)Footnote 1 certificate—a long delay may place them at a serious disadvantage in competing for jobs and going on to college.Footnote 2 Early work experience is closely linked to future earnings and labor market success.Footnote 3 In addition, there is growing evidence of the limited value in the labor market of the GED without further educational attainment (Heckman et al, 2010). More dramatically, for those that do not reconnect to the educational system and attain at least a high school credential, the individual and societal costs are high. High school dropouts face higher rates of unemployment, poverty, criminal involvement, and health difficulties. As a result, this population contributes significantly less in taxes from earnings while requiring more public spending in other areas such as incarceration costs and public assistance benefits (Northeastern University Center for Labor Market Studies 2009). In response to the range of issues associated with dropping out of school, prevention and “second chance” programs have been developed to assist or reconnect this higher-risk youth population. These programs often offer a mix of education, training, employment, and supportive services to youth ranging in age from roughly 16 to 24 years of age. The programs themselves vary widely in terms of the specific populations they target (such as youth with disabilities or those involved in the justice system), the scale (such as large federally funded national programs vs. smaller community-grown models), the residential or non-residential setting, and the particular emphasis or combination of services offered. In recent years, there has also been an education shift in focus from GED obtainment as a goal towards high school diploma-granting opportunities and post-secondary education trajectories (Bloom, 2010). Ultimately, the goal is to help these youth successfully transition to adulthood with improved skills and/or credential and become productive, contributing members of society. This paper presents results of the multi-year evaluation of one of these programs targeted at high school dropouts, the large-scale, residential, National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program (NGYCP). The evaluation was led by MDRC, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization. This paper presents longer-term impacts on a range of educational and vocational outcomes for participants approximately 3 years after they joined the study. Shorter-term results published by MDRC showed promising results on high school credential receipt and employment, among other outcomes.",2

Together with the right to organize, collective bargaining is a fundamental principle and right at work, recognized by the international community. The Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98) is one of the eight fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). It guarantees collective bargaining as a voluntary process between independent and autonomous parties, and calls on governments to take “measures appropriate to national conditions […] to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers’ organisations and workers’ organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements’ (art 4). For workers, collective bargaining has a protective function - ensuring adequate pay, establishing limits on daily and weekly working time, and regulating other working conditions for those with weak individual negotiating power; a voice or participation function - the collective expression of grievances and participation in the success of the enterprise; and a distributive function - securing a fair share of the benefits of training, technology and productivity growth. For employers, collective bargaining has a key conflict management function - it provides a process for resolving disputes of interest. Managerial control tends to be more acceptable and effective when legitimised through joint rules (Flanders 1968). Collective agreements and wage regulations like a mandatory minimum wage put a floor in the labour market and thus limit cutthroat competition. This is the aspect defended by Keynes in the quotation above. Stabilizing wages reduces uncertainty about future costs and prices and can thus contribute to raising business and human capital investment decisions, which depend strongly on expectations. Collective bargaining, when sufficiently inclusive and coordinated, offers a mechanism for responsible wage setting, with outcomes that are compatible with price stability and low unemployment (Aidt and Tzannatos 2008; Flanagan 1999; OECD 2006; Traxler and Brandl 2012). Moreover, collective bargaining relieves the state from the complex task of setting standards and solving coordination problems in an area marred with conflicts and risks of non-compliance. It provides the possibility to tailor regulations to the circumstances in an enterprise or industry. In many countries and in EU law it is, moreover, possible to derogate by collective agreement from legal minimum standards on for instance working hours, employment contracting and employee information and consultation in the enterprise. Compared to individual bargaining or unilateral pay determination, collective bargaining is associated with higher earnings, more security for employees and more earnings equality. In the literature a gap between union and non-union wages, or more properly specified between workers covered and not covered by collective agreements, of 4 (Norway) to 20 percent (Canada) has been reported (Hartog et al. 2002). A study based on ISSP survey data for 1995–99 covering 17 countries found a union or collective bargaining ‘mark up’ varying from less than 1 percent, negative or insignificant in Sweden, Italy or the Netherlands, 4 percent in Germany, 7 percent in Norway and Spain, rising to more than 20 percent in Japan (Blanchflower and Bryson 2003). A recent study of German wage data found that the gap between the average wages of covered and uncovered workers had risen from 8 to 19 percent between 1999 and 2010, or from 1 to 10 percent if controlled for firm size. The authors concluded that the decline of collective bargaining in Germany in the past two decades - with the coverage rate decreasing from over 80 to under 60 percent - has contributed more to rising wage inequality than international trade (Felbermayr et al. 2014). Addison et al. (2014), using a different methodology and controlling for employee heterogeneity, report a smaller ‘wage gap’ in Germany of 3–4 percent during the first half of the 2000s. Their analysis shows that in a period of general standstill in wages, workers whose firms abandoned the sectoral agreement experienced a wage loss, albeit decreasing over time, whereas workers whose firms joined the sectoral agreement enjoyed a slightly increasing wage gain. Across countries, there is a strong negative association between bargaining coverage and wage inequality measured by the P1/P10 earnings ratio. Coverage accounts for 50 percent of the variance in wage inequality across the 32 OECD member states (Visser et al. 2015). If rising inequality has a negative impact on growth (IMF 2014; OECD 2014), then international and national policy makers should think twice before weakening the institutions that underpin inclusive and coordinated collective bargaining. Of these institutions, multi-employer bargaining above the level of single firms is the most important. The level of bargaining accounts for 70 percent of the cross-national variance in bargaining coverage in a sample of 48 countries (Visser et al. 2015). In this paper I examine what happened to collective bargaining during the Great Recession, placing the development of the past six years in a longer trend. I focus on developments in three interrelated dimensions that together define whether collective bargaining is inclusive and coordinated: (1) the scope or coverage of collective bargaining and extension of agreements to non-organized firms and workers; (2) the vertical structure or organization of collective bargaining (multi- or single-employer bargaining; the level(s) at which bargaining takes place; the relationship across levels; opening clauses and the involvement of non-union actors); and (3) the horizontal coordination of bargaining behaviour and outcomes across bargaining units. I distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory changes, acknowledging that change can result from a modification of the rules or government policies under which collective bargaining operates, or instead occur through behavioural changes within unions, firms and employers’ associations and interactions between them. The data are from the Institutional Characteristics of Trade Unions, Wage Setting, State Intervention and Social Pacts (ICTWSS) Database, version 5.0, updated till 2013 or 2014,Footnote 2 and cover 38 countries (Visser 2015).Footnote 3

These concerns have spurred serious consideration of policies to encourage job creation and higher income from work beyond the more immediate countercyclical policies that were adopted in response to the Great Recession. Among the policies generating continuing or renewed interest are hiring credits, higher (sometimes much higher) minimum wages, and a more substantial earned income tax credit (EITC) for childless individuals. This paper discusses these policy options, what we know about their likely effects and trade-offs, and what the unanswered questions are; the focus is on US evidence, although of course the lessons may apply to other countries as well. Its purpose is not to review the vast earlier literature on these policies, but rather, the focus is on recent evidence and—when appropriate—what we can learn from policies adopted during or after the Great Recession. When possible, it references earlier surveys of the larger body of evidence. The focus on the most recent evidence on policies to encourage job creation and higher incomes is informative both because it provides new discussion and analysis of emerging research on recently tried policies and because changes in labor markets and the policy environment can lead to longer-standing labor market policies having different effects now than in past decades.Footnote 2
 The research the survey covers is limited to the effects of the policies considered on the targeted groups and does not consider the general equilibrium effects of the taxes or other costs that would or do fund these policies and that could affect other groups or aggregate activity. For example, higher taxes to finance a more generous EITC might reduce labor supply of some (presumably higher-income) groups. Nor does it consider the effects of potential changes in the mix of who works on overall labor productivity. Such an analysis would be much more stylized and model-based, although it could potentially yield useful insights. However, abstracting from aggregate effects, the empirical work undergirding this survey tends to focus on strongly affected groups relative to others (e.g., single mothers, in the case of the EITC), and it seems likely that the kinds of effects the literature detects reflect mainly the direct effects of the policy, rather than the effects of the taxation that finances the policy. And when estimates are based on comparisons across states in how policies impact affected groups, the estimates should reflect general equilibrium effects (although we may still miss effects on groups not directly affected). That is, while the targeted group or partial equilibrium focus no doubt misses some aggregate effects, it seems unlikely to do much to bias estimated effects of policies on the affected groups.",8

During the expansion, many low-qualified jobs were created in the construction, food preparation and serving sectors, as well as in domestic services, at the same time that the country welcomed an impressive inflow of immigrants—approximately 500,000 per year between 2002 and 2007—who were quick to find jobs in the thriving economy.Footnote 1 What was the impact of this recession on the labor market assimilation of workers (relative to native workers)? This is the main objective of this paper. Using Spanish Labor Force survey data (EPA) from 2000 to 2011 and following three distinct immigrant cohorts--those who arrived between 2000 and 2003 (both included); those who arrived between 2004 and 2007, and those who arrived between 2008 and 2011--, this paper analyzes whether the worsening of immigrants’ employment conditions after the Great Recession is explained exclusively by the deterioration of the economy or whether it can be also attributed to a compositional differences across different cohorts of immigrants. Immigrants are defined as foreign-born individuals who are between 18 and 64 years old.Footnote 2
 For this purpose, Section 2 studies how newly arrived immigrants assimilate into employment, distinguishing on how economic conditions and immigrants’ individual characteristics influence this assimilation pattern. Section 3 evaluates immigrants' pathways from the lowest-skilled jobs into middle-skilled work, with a special emphasis on immigrants who lack high-level education. After investigating in which sectors immigrant workers are concentrated, the paper analyzes the key characteristics of immigrant-heavy sectors in Section 4. Section 5 analyzes whether immigrants' socio-demographic characteristics affect immigrants' labor markets. We conclude with a summary of the key findings and their implications for policymaking.",13

Among others, Japan has experienced increased rapid aging in the past few decades. Given this fast-aging population and resulting pressure on the social security system, the government of Japan has been trying to ensure that older people can continue to work longer. At the same time, there is a concern that the excessive protection of elderly employment may deprive the youth of employment opportunities. In theory, however, it is not necessary for employers to reduce the number of younger workers if the wages of older workers fall sufficiently to absorb the increased labor supply. Thus, this paper examines whether the increase in the number of elderly workers affected the employment of other age groups and whether there were any adjustments through elderly workers’ wages. Specifically, I focus on the changes around the revision of the Elderly Employment Stabilization Law (hereafter EESL) in 2006, which mandated employers to continue employment of their incumbents up to the pension eligibility age. Kondo and Shigeoka (2015) show that this policy intervention indeed increased employment rate among men in their early sixties, and the effect is mainly observed in employees in large firms. In the first half of the empirical analysis, I try to shed light on how the mandated continued employment due to the EESL revision affects the employment volume of workers in various age ranges and their part-time/full-time status. The idea is that if an establishment has more workers in their late fifties right before the EESL revision, it would have had more workers reaching age 60 after the EESL revision, to whom it had to offer continued employment. In the second half of the empirical analysis, I explore whether there was any adjustment in wages of elderly workers. Specifically, I examine whether the decline in earnings at age 60 became wider for cohorts eligible for mandated continued employment as per the EESL. Existing studies show mixed evidence about the substitutability between elderly workers and younger workers. On the one hand, Gruber et al. (2010) argue that there is no evidence of a trade-off between elderly employment and youth employment; rather, there is a positive association between them based on their study of 12 OECD countries. Munnel and Wu (2012) and Zhang (2012), who study data pertaining to the USA and China, respectively, also claim that there is no substitution between young and old workers. Earlier studies for Japan (Oshio and Sato 2010; Nagano, 2014) also show no evidence of a trade-off between young and old workers. On the other hand, Vestad (2013) shows almost one-to-one replacement of retired elderly and newly hired young workers in Norway, and Martins et al. (2009) show substitution between old and young female workers in Portugal. Consistent with the first line of the literature, I find that increased elderly employment is not associated with a decline in hiring of young full-time workers. However, I also find suggestive evidence that reemployed elderly workers may crowd out middle-aged part-time female workers. Furthermore, the analysis of earnings shows a significant fall in the earnings of male baby boomers (who reached age 60 after the EESL revision) in their early sixties. These results suggest that in response to the mandated continued employment by the EESL, firms primarily cut wages of elderly workers, and some firms reduced the number of female part-time workers. However, most firms did not decrease hiring of young workers. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the institutional background. Section 3 analyzes the employment of other workers using data from the Employment Trend Survey, and Section 4 analyzes earnings changes using data from the Basic Survey on Wage Structure. Section 5 further investigate the relationship between adjustment through hiring and earnings changes. Section 6 concludes.",7

We study this question on a random sample of workers who became unemployed during 2007 in Flanders, Dutch speaking region in the North of Belgium. The referral of job seekers to vacancies is a policy that is used by many countries. The referral of vacancies is an active labor market policy (ALMP) that aims at enhancing search efficiency and effort and therefore belongs to so-called category of “services and sanctions.” In a meta-analysis summarizing research on the effectiveness of active labor market policies (ALMPs), Card et al. (2010) conclude that services and sanctions is a particularly promising category of ALMPs, because, on the whole, they raise the transition rate to employment significantly, while being at the same time relatively inexpensive. Yet, this category is wide and comprises not only referrals but also many different actions, such as job search courses, job clubs, vocational guidance, counseling and monitoring, and sanctions in case of non-compliance with job search requirements. So, based on this meta-analysis, we cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of referrals. Specific analysis on the effectiveness of referrals is relatively rare. Based on a randomized experiment in Sweden, Engström et al. (2012) conclude that a large fraction (one third) of job referrals do not result in job applications. If the PES announces that it will contact the employer to verify whether referred vacancies have been applied to, the job application rate increases. However, the policy does not affect unemployment duration. Moreover, van den Berg and Vikström (2014) argue that verifying whether referred jobs have been applied to and are accepted or not can downgrade the quality of the job. Fougère et al. (2009) study whether or not in France vacancy referral provided by the PES crowds out the personal job search effort of the unemployed worker. Such crowding out could explain why vacancy referrals do not automatically boost the job-finding rate. Van den Berg and van der Klaauw (2006), for instance, find that in The Netherlands, the monitoring of formal job search crowds out informal job search. By contrast, Fougère et al. find that in France, contacts brought about by the PES are more often transformed into a hiring proposal vacancy than private search, especially for the low-educated and low-skilled workers. Hence, in France, vacancy referrals enhance the exit rate from unemployment, especially for disadvantaged workers, even if application to these jobs was neither monitored nor, consequently, sanctioned. Van den Berg et al. (2014) investigate the effects of repeated meetings between the unemployed and their caseworker on the transition rate from unemployment to employment in Denmark. They find large positive effects of the meetings. The authors argue that the strong increase of the job-finding rate right after the meetings is explained by the intensified referrals to vacancies during these meetings. However, the authors find that the positive effects of these meetings remain present up to 8 weeks later. For women, this effect even persists for a longer period, be it at a lower level. These long-run effects could not only be generated by more effective job search strategies that these interactions with caseworkers induce but also be related to the intensified monitoring after the meetings. In Germany, a refusal to apply to a vacancy referral can be punished by an UB sanction. Van den Berg et al. (2016) analyze the effects of these sanctions and of the vacancy referrals on unemployment duration and job quality. Their results suggest that sanctions increase the probability of finding a job but that the wages of sanctioned individuals are lower in the subsequent jobs. Receiving a vacancy referral not only has a positive effect on the job finding probability but also leads to less stable employment spells and lower wages. Vacancy referrals have a stronger impact on the probability of finding a job if the local unemployment rate is high. However, the authors also find an increased sickness absence shortly after vacancy referrals by caseworkers (during sickness spells, the minimum requirements on job search do not apply). Given that studies on this topic are scarce, additional research evidence on the topic is welcome. Moreover, the operational features of the referral procedures in other countries differ from those in Flanders. For instance, in France, the application to job referrals is not mandatory, whereas in Germany, this is mandatory and sanctioned. Since these operational features can affect the effectiveness of the scheme, it is important to gather more evidence on different schemes, so that the extent to which these features matter can be studied in a more systematic way. This study aims at providing a contribution to this evidence. We organize the presentation of this research in the following way. We first describe the institutional context within which the Flemish PES transmits referrals to unemployed job seekers. In Section 3, we describe the data that we use in the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the methodology which is used to identify the causal impact of referrals on the transition rate from unemployment to employment. We follow up by a presentation and a discussion of the results. We end by a conclusion which summarizes the findings and the implications that we can draw from them and which makes suggestions for future avenues of research.",2

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that employers provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities, yet only slightly more than one quarter of newly disabled older workers report receiving an employer accommodation that would help them stay at work after the onset of their disability (Hill et al. 2016). In this paper, we use data from a recent survey of vocational rehabilitation (VR) agency applicants (2015 Survey of Disability and Employment or SDE) to (1) establish that people with disabilities who are not working often report employment barriers that could be addressed by accommodations, such as lack of transportation and an inaccessible workplace, (2) explore the role of workplace accommodations in helping increase employment for people with disabilities, and (3) better understand the characteristics of those who may benefit from greater availability of accommodations. The SDE provides a unique opportunity to examine these relationships because the data include detailed information on employment barriers faced by people with disabilities, the availability of workplace accommodations in the current or most recent job, and extensive individual characteristics about the survey respondents. Our analysis involves three main components. First, we provide descriptive evidence that nonworking people with disabilities who have applied for VR services often report employment barriers that can be addressed by workplace accommodations, such as lack of transportation or an inaccessible workplace. Next, we use a regression analysis to examine the relationship between workplace accommodations in the current or most recent job and the current employment status of people with disabilities in order to show that the provision of workplace accommodations may help increase employment. Finally, we use descriptive statistics to examine the individual characteristics of people with disabilities who do not receive workplace accommodations and of those who face barriers that could be addressed by workplace accommodations in order to shed light on the population of people who may benefit from making workplace accommodations more widely available. The results of our analyses show that at least one third of nonworking people with disabilities report employment barriers that could be addressed by workplace accommodations, such as an inaccessible workplace and lack of transportation. The receipt of workplace accommodations, such as help with transportation, a flexible work schedule, or a personal care attendant, at the current or most recent job is positively correlated with being employed at the time of the survey, which suggests that providing these accommodations may be effective in helping people with disabilities work. Finally, those who are in poor health or have a physical disability only are overrepresented among those who do not receive workplace accommodations in their current or most recent job; furthermore, those who are in poor health, have lower levels of educational attainment, or have physical disabilities are more likely to perceive lack of accessibility as a barrier. These findings suggest that individuals with these characteristics may be good candidates to target for expanding the availability of workplace accommodations. Because the SDE sample consists of people with disabilities who applied for VR services in only three states, these findings cannot be generalized to people with disabilities nationally; nonetheless, this sample provides valuable insight into a group of people who have demonstrated an interest and ability to work by applying for VR. This is a particularly valuable group to examine because they are more likely to work if the employment barriers they report are identified and addressed. Understanding the characteristics of people with disabilities who do not currently have access to workplace accommodations may help VR agencies identify those who could potentially benefit from this type of assistance.",25

The relationship between attitudes and sickness absence,December 2017,Karen Evelyn Hauge,Marte Eline Ulvestad,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Paid sick leave and sickness benefits are central parts of the social security systems of the European welfare states. The first preliminary outline of a European pillar of social rights states that, “All workers, regardless of contract type, shall be ensured adequately paid sick leave during periods of illness” (European Commission 2016a, 13). Sick pay and sickness benefits are important as protection of an employee’s income during periods of illness or injury. Without this financial insurance, employees that cannot afford the loss of income might be forced to work while sick. This can further deteriorate the employee’s health and might also have other unfortunate consequences, such as the spreading of disease and lower firm productivity (Scheil-Adlung and Sandner 2010; Hemp 2004; Hansen and Andersen 2008). The entitlement to sick leave, sick pay and sickness benefits, and the duration and replacement level of the compensations, vary considerably between the welfare states. Nevertheless, all the EU member countries provide rights to sick leave and to sickness benefits and most of them also to paid sick leave. Sick leave is the right to be absent from work, while paid sick leave is the payment of (part of) the employee’s salary by the employer during sickness. Sickness benefits are covered by the social protection system (Spasova et al. 2016). The OECD countries spend on average around 0.8% of GDP on sickness benefits alone (OECD 2010, 58). In Norway, where the sickness benefit scheme is particularly generous, around 1.6–1.7% of GDP is allocated to sickness benefits annually (Bjørnstad 2013, 22). How these spendings can be reduced, or whether these spendings can be utilised in a better way, is currently being debated, both in Norway and in other developed countries (OECD 2010). While the necessity for short-term sick leave is often based on the employee’s own assessment, long-term sick leave is usually certified by a general practitioner. But whether an employee actually seeks medical help is usually dependent on the employee’s own initiative. This means that the employee’s sick leave might be influenced by own health assessment and the employee’s opinion of when sick leave is needed. Additionally, this implies that the sickness benefit schemes depend on trust in the employees and their assessments. Several studies have pointed to attitudes as an important factor for sickness absence. For instance, Dale-Olsen and Markussen (2010), who have studied trends in absenteeism over time for specific diagnoses, find that the number of sickness absence spells due to specific diagnoses has not changed much over time, but that the duration of each spell has increased by 20% in the period under study (1972–2008). The authors point to changing demands from employers and changing attitudes to explain why it would take longer to heal a broken leg in 2008 compared to in 1972. Henrekson and Persson (2004) find that increases in the generosity of sickness insurance benefits tend to be associated with more permanent sick leave. Also, Askildsen et al. (2005) show that the often seen negative correlation between sickness absence and unemployment rates are mainly caused by established workers changing their behaviour, rather than by the composition of the labour force. The fact that employees seem to exercise some flexibility in their absence behaviour opens up the possibility that attitudes might be a part of the explanation for variation in sickness absence. Although several studies have pointed to attitudes as an important factor for sickness absence, few studies address this relationship directly (Allebeck and Mastekaasa 2004). Holmås and et al (2008) study attitudes towards sickness absence in the Nordic countries, but do not study the relation between attitudes and absence behaviour. Hansen and Andersen (2008) analyse the relationship between attitudes and sickness presence (going to work while sick). Their measure of sickness presence, as well as sickness absence, is, however, based on self-reported data. A weakness with using self-reported data on absence is the possibility of misreporting, unconsciously or consciously, due to either not recalling correctly or a desire to present oneself in a positive way. Furthermore, most studies on sickness absence within economics rely on data concerning general practitioner (GP)-certified or long-term sickness absence, as Nationwide registers often are available for GP-certified or long-term sickness absence (where the employee is eligible for sickness benefits). Register data is an objective and reliable data source, but does not include self-certified sickness absence nor information about attitudes. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to use actual sickness absence data as opposed to self-reported data, for both self-certified and GP-certified sickness absence, and to match this with data on individual attitudes. Our study therefore contributes to the literature on sickness absence by studying the relationship between attitudes and sickness absence empirically and by using objective, employer-registered data on both self-certified and GP-certified sickness absence. Our study includes attitudes towards possible reasons for sick leave, towards cheating and towards work. Understanding the mechanisms behind sickness absence is important for several reasons. First of all, a possible relationship between attitudes and sickness absence is interesting in its own right. Secondly, the sickness insurance system takes for granted that self-certified sick leave is claimed by, and sick leave certified by a GP is provided to, people with reduced work capacity and that this measure of work capacity can be determined fairly objectively. However, if it turns out that individual attitudes towards sick leave are related to actual sickness absence behaviour, this might indicate that the term “reduced work capacity” is perceived differently and that it is, to some extent, a subjective perception that determines whether an individual is entitled to sickness insurance. Furthermore, it is important to utilise the welfare state’s resources effectively, as sickness benefits constitute a significant share of developed countries’ spendings. An important precondition for reducing sickness absence, and thereby its costs, is to understand the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we analyse whether and to what extent sickness absence is related to attitudes. To investigate this matter, we have collected data from two different sources. A survey, aimed at identifying relevant attitudes, has been conducted among employees within public healthcare in the city of Oslo, Norway. Additionally, detailed data on sickness absence for the respondents was assembled from the employers. By linking these two data sources, we obtain information on the actual absence behaviour, together with subjective assessments. The public healthcare sector, which is the largest sector within the public sector in Norway, comprises around half of all full-time equivalents in the public sector (Gran-Henriksen 2014). Furthermore, the public healthcare sector has a particularly high rate of sickness absence compared to other sectors in Norway. The average sick leave rate for all sectors in Norway in 2014 was 6.4%, while the average sick leave rate within public healthcare was 9.1% in 2014 (SSB 2015), making this an interesting sector to study. The sections of home care, assisted living and mental healthcare were chosen because these sections have good digital registers on personnel data, including all sickness absence of their employees. The main finding of the paper is that there is an association between attitudes and sickness absences but mainly for self-certified sick leave. The only attitude variable associated with GP-certified sick leave is low work satisfaction, which is associated with higher GP-certified sick leave. The level of sickness absence varies between different demographic groups (Allebeck and Mastekaasa 2004;Markussen et al. 2011). Perhaps most studied is the large difference in sickness absence observed between men and women. Additionally, other demographic characteristics, such as age, the level of education, the sector of work and the average number of working hours, have been found to be associated with specific attitudes towards sickness absence (Holmås and et al 2008). The data in this paper enables us to study whether attitudes can explain some of the observed variation in sickness absence between demographic groups, focusing on gaps in absenteeism between men and women, between younger and older employees, between those with lower and higher education and between immigrants and those born in the country of residence. In general, we do not find that attitudes are able to explain the observed differences in sickness absence between demographic groups. There is, however, some indication that attitudes can explain parts of the difference in self-certified sickness absence between employees with high and low education. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides details about the observed variations in sickness absence between demographic groups and the Norwegian sickness insurance system. Section 3 describes our questionnaire about attitudes towards sickness absence, the data and our empirical strategy. In Section 4, we present the results, and Section 5 concludes the study.",7

This feature not only has an impact on the current situation of those workers not receiving benefits such as health care, unemployment benefits, or extra transfers but also affects access to the pension system for the elderly. Since the work record allows agencies to properly enforce the requirements to obtain the pension mainly by checking the years spent in formality (contribution history), difficulties to meet these requirements have been noted in the academic and policy discussion (Forteza et al. 2009; Bucheli et al. 2010; Bosch and Manacorda 2012). This issue affects mainly those workers who either enter and exit the formal sector repeatedly or remain in the informal sector for many years. In the past, some workers were able to easily deceive the agencies with (false) witnesses, even if they did not meet the requirements1. This paper discusses the impact of retirement scheme changes on individual’s labor path decisions (between the informal and formal sectors) and pension eligibility. I will estimate the individuals’ decision path and whether they qualify for a pension under the pension scheme which was in force in Argentina between 1993 and 2008. Then, I will explore changes to the main variables of that scheme. In particular, I will explore changes in (i) the number of years contributing to the system and (ii) the minimum age. Both are requirements to obtain a pension. Furthermore, this paper deals with the reform of the pension system from a mixed system where two pillars coexist (a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system and an individual capitalization system) to a new system with only one of those pillars. In order to summarize the different systems, I consider the replacement rate as the main characteristic of each scheme and the different types of pensions Full, Advanced age, or Survivor. In Latin America, about 50% of salaried workers are employed informally, where informal workers are defined as those who are not covered by labor regulations, such as taxes, a right to the health system, and a right to receive a pension income at retirement age (Portes et al. 1989; Perry et al. 2007; Schneider 2012). This feature poses at least two major challenges to governments. First, governments are faced with the problem of meeting their current pension budget due to the lack of social contributions that are needed to provide social protection in old age. The second challenge is to deal with the fact that governments need to give the right incentives for future pensioners to meet the requirements. In order to understand how pension characteristics can shape an individual’s incentive to decide between the formal and informal sector, it is necessary to understand the nature of informality. There are three strands in the literature on informal work. The first idea holds that formal and informal markets have different rules which are respectively associated with a high and a low productivity sector, that the formal/informal decision is basically not up to workers, and that they work informally because they cannot get a formal job (La-Porta and Shleifer 2014). This concept has been discussed by a second strand of the literature which proposes a single market with workers deciding where to work based on their own characteristics, wages, and benefits. This strand is based on empirical literature such as Magnac (1991); Maloney (2004); Pratap and Quintin (2006), and Bucheli and Ceni (2010). The third strand is given the name of moderate dualism. The present paper follows this strand (as in Perry et al. 2007; Galiani and Weinschelbaum 2007; Amaral and Quntin 2006; Ceni 2013) to capture some ideas from both segmented markets and from a single market through heterogeneous individuals, some of whom can choose while others cannot. This paper firstly contributes to modeling the moderate dualism of informality through a partial equilibrium model in which workers decide to work either formally or informally. In single markets, depending on their education level and experience, workers have different wage functions and face differential market imperfections, such as different entry costs, probability of losing their job, and home production productivity. It follows that wages and market imperfections play a role in segmenting the market. This paper contributes to and is related to the literature about incentives in formal labor supply. The choice to work in the formal or in the informal sector is based on the cost and benefits of working formally (Holzmann et al. 2009; World Bank 2010; Bergolo and Cruces 2014). These papers focus on the specific effect of some social transfers (such as non-contributory pensions) in the considerable mobility between formality and informality and in how much to work in the formal sector and find that poor individuals choose to work informally in order not to lose some benefits. In this paper, a higher pension in old age acts as an incentive to spend more time in formal employment. In the tradition of discrete choice models (Keane and Wolpin 1997), I develop a dynamic behavioral model which captures the individual decision to work either in the formal or the informal sector under the characteristics of the pension scheme. The individual has to decide whether to work in the formal or informal sector or remain unemployed. This decision depends on the current wage applicable in each sector, the earning paths, and the main institutional characteristics of the pension scheme. Labor supply behavior in the context of informality has been analyzed in some recent papers for the Chilean case (Todd and Velez-Grajales 2008; Attanasio et al. 2011; Otero 2013; Joubert 2015). These papers assess the behavior of individuals or households among the covered and uncovered sectors2, when changing the rules of the pension system or shaping a pension design. Another contribution of this paper is the kind of dataset used in the analysis: instead of using administrative records, I use survey data. This allows me to work with a direct definition of informality and for the specific case of Argentina where informality is a critical problem. The definition that I use is directly related to the pension benefit, which I prefer because in developing countries, having a contract does not directly mean having a wide range of benefits. Besides, Argentina presents higher levels of informality than Chile, which is one of the main obstacles the model can deal with. Finally, I will only consider salaried male workers to avoid fertility-related decisions in the model. This paper also contributes to the analysis of the retirement decision and to estimating the pension coverage rates. The decision to retire takes into account the rewards (pecuniary) and benefits (non-pecuniary) of being a pensioner and of being a worker. Individuals know they have a finite lifespan, but if they continue working, they will receive a higher pension amount. French and Jones (2011) estimate a retirement dynamic model which includes the decision of how much to save and how much to devote to medical expenses, with special attention paid to the different systems of medical expenses and the role of health insurance. The paper points out the relevance of Medicare (in the USA) eligibility in labor decisions for individuals over 60 years old. In my estimation, most of the individuals decide to retire as soon as possible and there are no incentives in the benchmark to continue working. To estimate pension coverage, Bucheli et al. (2010) and Berstein et al. (2006) simulate work trajectories by using reduced form estimation methods. These papers estimate, for Uruguay and Chile respectively, a gap in coverage among females and the self-employed, especially. Forteza et al. (2009) show that in the pre-2008 pension scheme in Argentina, only 40% of men would reach at least 30 years of contributions. Bosch and Guajardo (2012) show that the share of individuals aged 65+ with a pension income decreases between 1992 and 2007 from about 85 to 65% among men (mainly due to self-employment). In this paper, I estimate the pension coverage for those individuals at age 65 and 70 and find that the majority of those who have completed primary school cannot obtain a Full pension. Among those who can, half continue working after the age of 65. Finally, this paper contributes to assessing how changes in pension schemes affect individual behavior. Governments determine pension schemes, which are defined by the minimum requirements to obtain a pension: the number of years contributing to the system, the minimum age, and the replacement rates. These three elements in the model determine the minimum length of working life and the condition to qualify for higher pension benefits when an individual reaches pensionable age. Lower replacement rates and loose rules reduce formality, and stricter rules increase it. Changes mainly occur in the last 10 years of an individual’s working life, when they are closer to reaching the minimum thresholds.",2

Evidence from the Portuguese unemployment insurance reform,December 2017,Álvaro A. Novo,André C. Silva,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 1999, the Portuguese government increased the maximum duration of unemployment benefits for workers with specific ages. We use this event to test if an equilibrium search model correctly predicts the effects of an increase in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits. We use the model of Alvarez and Veracierto (2000), a general equilibrium search model for which the unemployment insurance system is modeled through the replacement ratio, the criteria of eligibility, and the duration of unemployment benefits. We test the model to determine to what extent a policy maker can use the model to make predictions about changes in the unemployment insurance system. Following the argument in Lucas (1981), once the model reproduces the effects of simpler policies, we have more confidence in its predictions about more complex policy changes. The 1999 reform is a quasi-natural experiment as it created treatment and control groups in a way that resembles a controlled experiment. We first estimate the impact of the increase in the maximum benefit duration, following the literature on the effects of the unemployment insurance system on the labor market. We then use our results to test the search model. We find that the model is successful in predicting the effects on the unemployment rate, the labor force participation, and the levels of unemployment and employment. On the other hand, the average duration of unemployment decreased for the groups 15–24 and 40–44, while, as standard in search models, the model predicts an increase in the average duration of unemployment. In any case, the predictions lie within the confidence intervals for the estimates of the effects after the reform. For the group 30–34, the model correctly predicts the increase in the average duration of unemployment. In general, the differences between data and predictions are small.",

Lehrer,Weili Ding,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It would not be an exaggeration to say that the mere mention of the word genetics to an economist a decade ago could cause alarm. This alarm may have been a response in part to one recalling the general response to the Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers’ January 14, 2005, speech at an economics conference when discussing the under-representation of female scientists at elite universities.Footnote 1 This alarm perhaps was also triggered by memories of events approximately one decade earlier when Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray attracted substantial controversy following the 1994 publication of “The Bell Curve,” which was popularly (mis)interpreted as ascribing the link between race and IQ to genetic factors. Footnote 2 Even recently, economists working on issues related to genetic factors continue to attract interdisciplinary criticism. For example, Ashraf and Galor (2013) arguing for the importance of genetic diversity in explaining national income per capita drew a series of harsh responses from a long list of prominent scientists and anthropologists.Footnote 3 These three independent episodes occurred in a 20-year span have clearly indicated the controversy that one may encounter when interpreting or accounting for genetic factors within economic analyses. Thus, it would be unsurprising if individual researchers today would conclude that it is best to ignore genetic factors since the potential costs from the subsequent criticism and potential damage to one’s academic reputation could greatly outweigh any benefits one may receive from incorporating them. In short, genetic information becomes the hornet’s nest that most economists stay away from. In this paper, we argue that this would likely be the wrong response. Not only has the role of empirical work in economics increased sharply over the last 20 years but also has now a growing number of datasets that provide detailed information on genetic characteristics. Genetic markers are now being collected in multiple nationally representative social surveys that Conley (2009) argues can be deployed to (i) assess the direct impact of specific genetic influences on socioeconomic and behavioral outcomes, (ii) explore genetic–environmental interactions, and (iii) trace genealogies across time and space. Indeed, as we discuss below, economists have done substantial applied research related to the first two themes. Further, simultaneous to this underlying trend suggesting the growing importance of empirical economics has been the development of a multitude of econometric strategies that exploit various research designs to identify causal impacts. These applied econometric methods have transformed empirical practice not solely within economics but also in other disciplines such as political science and sociology. We suggest that as economists increase their familiarity with genetic data, it is likely that they can develop methodological tools to generate new strategies to shed new light on the role of genetic factors that will be of interest to those within economics and in many other scientific disciplines. This paper can be viewed as an extension of the comprehensive reviews presented in Benjamin et al. (2007, 2012a) and Lehrer (2016) that explore the use of genetic markers in studies within economics. While Benjamin et al. (2007) coined the term “genoeconomics” for this field, the view that we advance is somewhat less ambitious. We argue that genetic markers are simply a new way to get inside the black box of individual permanent unobserved heterogeneity within numerous fields in economics. For example, in studies that explore labor supply, researchers often employ fixed effects to reflect permanent unobserved differences in tastes or preferences across individuals. Similarly, when estimating wage equations, researchers often employ fixed effects to capture permanent productivity characteristics of the individual. Genetic markers may be truly what is meant by permanent unobserved heterogeneity since they are assigned at conception and (with the sole exception of monozygotic twins) differ markedly across individuals.Footnote 4
 While some economists have begun to incorporate data on genetic markers in their empirical analyses, their use remains scattered and limited to a handful of specific applications. On the one hand, this is somewhat surprising given the long history of research that explores how numerous traits and behaviors pass from one generation to the next. With data on genetic markers, perhaps one can understand how the transmission of genetic factors influences the transmission of outcomes. We should also state explicitly that recent work by economists with genetic data has attracted significant positive acclaim by researchers in other disciplines. Thus, our true aims of this survey are to reduce entry costs and hopefully attract other labor economists to consider integrating genetic factors within their studies. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide a brief scientific primer on genetic terminologies and then review the four major strands of research in economics that has used genetic data to date. Section 4 proposes three directions for future research among economists. A concluding section summarizes our arguments and draws links to how research using genetic data within economics is actually following trends in research within labor economics.",5

This paper analyzes the job creation program in Japan. This Japanese place-based job creation program is a bit unique. It is not a tax credit, but a subsidy for the individual job creation plan designed by a municipality. A detailed empirical evaluation of Japanese place-based policies for job creation has rarely been conducted prior to this study, due to a lack of data. Governments that hope to help residents in disadvantaged areas base their equity criteria on differences in local labor market outcomes across cities and regions. Neumark and Simpson (2015) argue that agglomeration economies, imperfect labor mobility or spatial mismatches, and network effects justify place-based policies. Most previous studies have emphasized assessing a subsidy’s impact on job creation, and most academic research and official government documents have evaluated how policies affect local employment, usually with the goal of computing the number of jobs created per dollar/yen spent. However, this emphasis has been insufficient. Kline and Moretti (2014a) argue that the job growth resulting from place-based policies induces migration into treated communities and increases living costs; thus, the benefit from a subsidy turns to landowners under perfect mobility. Solely evaluating the number of created jobs does not tell us whether a place-based policy improves opportunities for employment, increases the income or welfare of disadvantaged residents, or benefits the landowners, migrants, and workers who commute to the treated municipality. From this perspective, Busso et al. (2013) analyze the federal urban empowerment zone program and find that the empowerment zone program increases employment and wages without triggering corresponding increases in population and local costs of living. Few theoretical and empirical papers examine this issue. Therefore, this paper evaluates precisely the incidence of the place-based job creation program in Japan, including residents’ mobility. This paper compares the program’s effects on both resident workers and workers included commuting workers, and it examines the change in the number of residents and households. Moreover, this paper considers the efficient use of this program’s subsidy. Few papers have empirically studied the efficiency of place-based policies, but it is important to consider efficient use because the budgets of policy programs are always limited. Kline and Moretti (2013), using a theoretical model, show that the targeting of less productive areas implicit in place-based subsidies is efficient when hiring costs are excessive. Briant et al. (2015) demonstrate that spatially integrated neighborhoods increase the effect of the second wave of Zones Franches Urbaines (ZFU). Neumark and Grijalva (2013) assess many hiring credits and clarify that credits that allow for the recapture of payments if required goals are not met succeed in boosting employment. This paper focuses on population size (size of the aging population, size of the working age population, and population density) among regional characteristics and explores which municipalities are affected most by the program. The reason for this focus is that the place-based job creation programs that this paper analyzes are conducted in rural areas (as explained in detail later). These areas have an aging population problem. The aging population problem is one of the political, economic, and social issues in Japan and other countries, including China, India, and other developed countries, will face this problem soon. Although this program is efficient and used optimally, we must consider whether the program is a zero-sum game. If consumption demand increases in the treated municipalities because the program that this paper analyzes offers how-to seminars for local establishments to help them attract consumers to their local goods using local specialty agricultural products in many cases, thus increasing the number of jobs created, but the consumption demand decreases in neighboring municipalities, thus resulting in a decrease in the number of jobs, then the gain in the treated municipalities is canceled out by the loss in the neighboring municipalities, and the total gain at the national level is zero. Results in previous papers have been mixed. Bartik (1991) argues for a positive effect. Both Freedman (2012), who estimates the effects of new market tax credits, and Gobillon et al. (2012), who examines the French enterprise zone program that exempts wage tax if firms hire more than 20% local labor, find a small spillover effect; Neumark and Kolko (2010) and Ham et al. (2011) find no spillover effect; and Chirinko and Wilson (2008), Wilson (2009), and Goolsbee and Maydew (2000) show a negative effect on neighboring areas. These mixed results could be attributed to reallocation in the case of negative effects and positive externality effects in the case of positive effects and the fact that the literature examines different policy programs and uses different methods. Neumark and Simpson (2015) note the distributional effect of place-based policies because skilled workers are highly mobile and migrate to the treated cities, while low-income residents who are targeted leave the treated areas in addition to the greatest impact to be on businesses that are founded in enterprise zones or relocate into such zones. Hanson and Rohlin (2013) argue that the effect of enterprise zone programs arises from relocation. Givord et al. (2013) find that the second wave of ZFU in 2004 boosted the number of establishments in the treated areas by approximately 5–7% via births and relocations, but the relative impact on relocation is much greater and produces negative spillovers on nearby areas. Kline and Moretti (2014a) also discuss the related rationale of the agglomeration economy. Social welfare could be increased if the gain were greater than the corresponding loss. At a social optimum, the gains and the losses cancel each other out exactly. Kline and Moretti (2014b) show serious flaws in the agglomeration rationale for spatially progressive subsidies in US manufacturing. In addition to reallocation issues, if place-based policies positively/negatively affect neighboring areas, the estimation results based on comparisons between treatment groups and neighboring areas as a control group have estimation bias. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the place-based job creation programs that this paper evaluates. Section 3 presents the empirical approach for examining the incidence of the programs and demonstrating the regional features of efficient use. Section 3 explains the data, displays the fundamental evidence using figures, and explains the estimation results. Section 4 analyzes the externality effect of the programs. Section 5 presents the robustness check of the program incidence results from Section 3. Section 6 presents the conclusions.",3

In Sweden, disability insurance receipt increased to an all-time high of 10% in 2006 (Swedish Social Insurance Agency 2014). Moreover, according to the Labour Force Surveys, 10% of the working age population in Sweden is reported to have some kind of impairment that entails reduced work capacity.Footnote 1 Public expenditures on disability-related programs is substantial in many countries. In 2007, Sweden’s expenditures amounted to 2.2% of GDP, a figure that, among the OECD countries, was only exceeded by Norway’s 2.5% of GDP (OECD 2010). Within this group, the labour force participation rate is only 50% and the unemployment rate is more than twice that for those without disabilities (Statistics Sweden 2009). Hence, people with disabilities face considerable difficulties in the labour market.Footnote 2 To overcome some of the difficulties that people with disabilities face and to be able to reach the goal—presented in the United Nations Standard Rules for the Equalization of Opportunities of Persons with Disabilities—that people with disabilities should have the same opportunities to participate in working life as everyone else, special measures compensating for a reduced work capacity, such as wage subsidies, might be necessary. Sweden has a long tradition of labour market policies targeted explicitly to jobseekers with disabilities—ranging from in-work aids to subsidised employment—aimed at strengthening their position in the labour market. The objective of the present study is to study empirically the relationship between participation in a wage subsidy program targeted to jobseekers with disabilities and future labour market outcomes in terms of employment and disability retirement. Targeted wage subsidies aim to stimulate labour demand by compensating for the workers’ reduced work capacities or by reducing employers’ uncertainties about particular jobseekers’ work capacities. However, targeted wage subsidies can also play a stigmatising role by signalling a poorer work capacity than compensated for,Footnote 3 and while the wage subsidies most often are time-limited, many jobseekers with disabilities have a permanently reduced work capacity. Hence, the impact of wage subsidies on the future labour market outcomes of jobseekers with disabilities is an open empirical question. In an attempt to shed some light on this issue, we have identified all jobseekers with disabilities who participated in a wage subsidy program (lönebidrag) in 2000 and followed them during an 8-year pre-program period and a 10-year post-program period using Swedish register data. By applying inverse probability (of treatment) weighting (IPW) to rich administrative data, we have been able to compare this group to observably very similar jobseekers with disabilities who did not participate in the wage subsidy program. The two groups are not only nearly identical in terms of the usual background characteristics but also in terms of their 8-year labour market history (including, but not limited to, insured sickness absence and disability) and hospitalisation history. We have focused on two labour market outcomes: employment and disability retirement. While non-subsidised employment is the ultimate goal of the wage subsidy, it may nonetheless be an unrealistic goal given that the disability, along with the associated reduction in work capacity, in many cases is permanent or even deteriorating. For some, the realistic goal might instead be to be able to remain in subsidised employment over time. Likewise, disability retirement could also be viewed as an unwarranted (at least from a public policy perspective) but likely alternative outcome, especially in case of deteriorating work capacity. Given that the wage subsidy can be granted for 4 years and under certain circumstances, an even longer period, one would at least in the shorter run also expect considerable locking-in effects.Footnote 4 We find that participants in the wage subsidy program had a much larger subsequent overall employment rate. In the year of (potential) program enrolment, the gap was as large as 54 percentage points. Obviously, most of this difference is mechanical and corresponds to the program participation per se. However, although the gap closed during the years that followed, a 11 percentage point difference remained after 10 years. When excluding subsidised jobs from the employment outcome measure, the picture changed dramatically. In the year of (potential) program enrolment, the employment rate was instead 21 percentage points lower among the participants than among the non-participants. After 2 years, the gap had closed to 11 percentage points and then vanished gradually. Hence, any positive employment effect of program participation seems to have been outweighed by considerable locking-in effects, not only in the short run but also in the longer run. We also found a lower percentage of disability insurance receivers among the participants than among the non-participants. While the percentage of disability insurance receivers among the participants was 2 points higher during the year of (potential) program enrolment and the next year, this gap had reversed by the third year and remained at about this level during the rest of the 10-year period. Hence, the wage subsidy program seems to have promoted labour market inclusion somewhat by reducing the transition out of the labour force through the disability insurance program. There are only a few previous empirical studies on wage subsidies targeted to jobseekers with disabilities.Footnote 5 Due to the differences in study designs and outcomes, most of them are not comparable directly with this study. For example, several studies have focused on eligibility for wage subsidies, instead of actual participation in such a program. The findings from these studies seem to vary depending on the particular outcome under study: from negative or no effects on interview call-back rates (Deuchert and Kauer 2017; Baert 2016), no effects on disability insurance receipt (Gupta and Larsen 2010), to substantial positive effects on employment (Gupta and Larsen 2010).Footnote 6
Footnote 7
Footnote 8 Moreover, Gupta et al. (2015) found that lowering the subsidy level, in the same scheme as investigated in Gupta and Larsen (2010), decreased the number of subsidised employments, mainly through reduced hiring of subsidised workers.Footnote 9 An exception is Jaenichen and Stephan (2011) whose findings make an interesting comparison to ours. They investigated the effectiveness of wage subsidies in Germany targeted to “hard-to-place” workers, which included unemployed jobseekers with disabilities. While they also found locking-in effects of the wage subsidy program, they report large positive effects on regular (non-subsidised) employment following the expiration of the subsidy (i.e. after 7–12 months). Three years after program enrolment, the employment rate was 25–42 percentage points higher among the participants than among the non-participants. These estimates are strikingly different from the large negative estimates found in the present study. Jaenichen and Stephan (2011) refer to this effect as the combined effect of receiving the wage subsidy and getting a job. In an attempt to isolate the effect of the wage subsidy (net of the effect of getting a job), they also provide estimates conditional on taking up a (subsidised or non-subsidised) job. Necessarily, this largely increased the initial and mechanical locking-in effect. However, for the period following the expiration of the subsidy, the estimates on regular (non-subsidised) employment are considerably smaller than the previously reported estimates of the combined effect of receiving the wage subsidy and getting a job, but they are still positive and statistically significant.Footnote 10 The above discussion of the findings in Jaenichen and Stephan (2011) also highlights a probable reason for the scarce empirical evidence on the effects of wages subsidies targeted to jobseekers with disabilities. That is, it is exceedingly difficult, for several reasons, to identify the causal effect of participation. First, it is difficult to define an appropriate comparison group. This is mostly, but not exclusively, because participation in a wage subsidy program does not only imply participation in an active labour market program, but also implies becoming employed (with the wage subsidy). Second, the lack of objective and reliable measures of disability and work capacity makes it difficult to assess whether the study and comparison groups are, in fact, comparable. Third, it is difficult to identify the relevant outcome. Given that the disability, and the associated reduction in work capacity, in many cases is permanent, non-subsidised employment might not be a realistic goal. For some, the realistic goal might instead be to be able to remain in subsidised employment over time, but then a positive outcome becomes indistinguishable from participation in the program being evaluated. However, one might argue that given the many who are concerned by measures targeted to people with disabilities, and the size of the corresponding public expenditures, even descriptive evidence on the outcomes of these measures would be of policy relevance. Moreover, effect evaluations without exogenous variation in program assignment could instead provide additional analyses of how sensitive, or likely, the conclusions are to be explained by biases due to non-random assignment into the programs. The paper proceeds with a brief description of the institutional settings in Section 2, including descriptions of the Public Employment Service’s (PES’s) coding of jobseekers as occupationally disabled, the targeted wage subsidy program, and the disability insurance program. We describe our data and outline our estimation strategy in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. In Section 4, we present our main results followed by several sensitivity analyses. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.",2

To achieve this goal, the main strategy of almost all European countries has consisted of increases in the statutory retirement age, the tightening of minimum requirements to access anticipated retirement and financial incentives to continue to work beyond the minimum (Eurofound 2016; European Commission 2015; OECD 2016). Although some countries (Italy among them) have established an automatic link between longevity and retirement age, the compulsory extension of working life is obviously not an ad libitum viable policy. This policy, moreover, reflects a rather traditional retirement scenario, typically characterised by full-time work ending abruptly in complete leisure. This pattern may not be what workers, or a significant proportion of them, want and may not necessarily serve firms’ interests either. Concerning the first, who are the focus of our study, harsh discontinuity between working life and retirement, when the latter suddenly reduces working hours from full-time to zero, can indeed be regarded as a welfare-decreasing factor. If rigidities in both the pension system and the labour market prevent individuals from doing part-time work, workers may feel constrained to retire earlier than they would have done. People may prefer retirement to full-time work, but they may be willing to continue to work if they have access to a reduced effort level. Evidence on stated preferences for gradual retirement in the USA, based on an internet survey in 2005, shows that 38% of respondents aged 50 and over show interest in participating in partial retirement schemes (Brown 2005). Kantarci and van Soest (2008) present similar results for the Netherlands, where about 55% of working men aged between 51 and 65 years stated an interest in working part-time. Technological change, on its part, seems more favourable to flexibility than traditional productive methods. Policy interventions designed to foster flexibility in working schedules and to increase the possibility of combining a pension and work, with some sort of gradual retirement, would then be welfare-improving, without curbing firms’ profitability. Given workers’ heterogeneity, investigating the characteristics of the people who would be better off if they had access to a smoother scheme of retirement is the first step in designing appropriate policies. In this paper, we look at preferences for hours of work expressed by older individuals, whether in employment or already retired, and compare them to their effective working hours (which may be zero in the case of full retirement). The analysis gives us an estimate of the ‘discouraged’ labour supply that older workers could instead deliver, as well as a picture of the characteristics of workers willing to work longer. It also provides an empirical basis for measures at both government and HR management levels directed at encouraging workers to postpone their retirement instead of forcing them to work full-time. The literature on the desired labour supply is limited, perhaps because of the shortage of individual survey data eliciting this information. Some notable exceptions are Callan et al. (2009), Euwals and van Soest (1999) and van Soest et al. (2002), who use data on the preferred labour supply—respectively in Ireland and the Netherlands—to estimate labour supply, wage elasticities and the impact of tax reforms. van Soest and Vonkova (2014) exploit stated preferences collected by the Dutch CentER Panel about different hypothetical retirement trajectories with different ages of (partial or full) retirement and different replacement rates. They use the information to estimate parameters of the utility function in order to simulate the sensitivity of retirement decisions to financial incentives, showing substantial differences between results based on observed or desired labour supply. Our paper adds to the literature and to the policy debate by documenting the gap between the preferred and observed number of working hours, at both the extensive and the intensive margins. To this end, we exploit an ad hoc section of the 2004 wave of the Italian Survey on Household Income and Wealth to ascertain the desired labour supply of both older workers and retirees. Our data testify to a ‘displacement effect’, limiting older workers’ observed labour supply. Descriptive evidence shows that a large majority of individuals aged 56–70 works the desired number of hours (85% of the sample). A non-negligible fraction of retirees, however, would like to work, most of them with a part-time schedule, and older workers declare that they are willing to continue to work, albeit with a lower intensity. The gap between the observed and desired labour supply is likely to depend on factors affecting the disutility of labour and the utility of additional resources. Our results confirm that gender, education and family composition are relevant factors associated with the desired labour supply. The comparison between the observed and the desired labour supply gives a measure of the severity of the displacement effect affecting older workers with respect to their level of work. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of part-time jobs and of rules for a more gradual retirement in Europe. Section 3 sketches the theoretical framework and Section 4 describes the institutional framework. Section 5 illustrates the data and the variables of interest. Section 6 comments on the empirical findings separately for retirees (Section 6.1) and for workers (Section 6.2). Section 7 concludes and discusses some policy implications of our results.",
7.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor Policy,06 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40173-018-0102-z,A policy for the size of individual unemployment accounts,December 2018,Rubén Castro,Michael Weber,Gonzalo Reyes,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The main role for unemployment insurance (UI) is to attenuate liquidity constraints, a market failure that plays against some individuals; while many individuals can save and borrow to smooth their consumption, some cannot when facing unemployment shocks. Holmlund (2015) and Kyyrä et al. (2017) provide a detailed discussion, including the motivation for state rather than private provision of UI. However, UI introduces by itself a market failure called moral hazard: the unemployed do not take into account the alternative use of the resources when deciding on their labor behavior. Basically, the UI acts as a subsidy for the price of leisure and is distortionary, making unemployment more prevalent than it should be. Most of the numerous empirical literature finds support for the existence of moral hazard attached to UI; a detailed review can be found in Schmieder and Von Wachter (2016). Indeed, most UI systems include several mechanisms to fight moral hazard: a maximum length of unemployment benefits, shrinking the benefit rate as the unemployment spell gets longer, and requiring proof of job search, among others. In this context, a new mechanism to fight moral hazard emerged around the year 1990: the introduction of a self-insurance component, by means of individual unemployment accounts (IUAs). In this mixed system, an X% of contributions goes to the workers’ IUA, which pays for his/her unemployment benefits, until either they are exhausted (and the risk-pooling component starts to pay the benefits) or the worker finds a job. Any remaining funds from IUAs are withdrawn at retirement or before. The key idea here is that workers experience less moral hazard during the self-financing stage of their unemployment spells while all the consumption smoothing properties are preserved. This setting has been attracting the attention of developing countries; many are introducing their first UIs, amidst the particularities of their labor markets and institutions (Vodopivec 2013; Robalino and Weber 2013), and the mixed system is already present in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Jordan, Mauritius, Panama, and Peru.Footnote 1 Now, policy makers need to set the size of the IA component in their UI systems, but from the academic literature, it is not clear what the right size of the IA component is. This study is the first to propose a right size. Feldstein and Altman (1998), “the” foundational article for IUAs, perform a simulation based on data from the USA; they conclude that, under different simple scenarios for the impact in moral hazard, UI-associated taxes could be mostly transformed into IUAs. And some articles discuss a wide range of topics related to UI and IUAs in developing countries (notably Robalino et al. 2009, Vodopivec 2013, and Sehnbruch and Carranza 2015). But none of those authors propose a size recommendation for policy makers. Theoretical models of well-being, based on economic behavioral models applied to mixed systems (Orszag and Snower 2002, Bovenberg and Sørensen 2004, and Jongen 2009 are the available ones), provide a framework to set a value for the optimal X; however, as is also the case for risk-pooling UIs, this theoretic analysis is still somewhat far from policy recommendations about the parameters of the system. Indeed, current UI policy decisions are based mostly on standards and best practices. A key advancement in the literature is the optimal benefit formula proposed by Chetty (2006), stemming from the work of Baily (1978), who proposed a reduced-form expression for the optimal benefit level based on observable elasticities (rather than a deep primitives). In this study, we explore a different question: what percentage of the contributions should be redirected to UIAs? One possible answer could be explored by adding this “percentage of the contribution” into the social planner’s objective function in Chetty (2006). In this study, we also focus on a practical answer but we follow an actuarial perspective rather than an economic one. IUAs introduce an actuarial relief in the system because lower moral hazard implies lower spending in benefits but also introduce actuarial pressure because the new benefit (the withdrawals of funds from IUAs) implies higher spending. Our contribution is that X, the percentage of contributions to be derived from IUAs, could be set at the maximum value such that the actuarial impact from introducing IUAs is zero. Up to this actuarially neutral level of X, there are no well-being drawbacks, since contribution and benefit rules can stay the same, but beyond it, either a higher contribution rate (i.e., disincentive to formalize, naïve distortions of private savings, lower net salaries) and/or lower level of benefits or coverage (i.e., less protection) is necessary. In the following example, a risk-pooling UI has an actuarially neutral X of 23% (Fig. 1). Actuarially fair contribution rate by X (example). Source: author’s calculation We explore a standard job search model and found a simple conceptual formula for the actuarially neutral X and then use simulations to add more realistic properties (like risk-heterogeneity across wage levels). We focus on job creation moral hazard, leaving job termination moral hazard for future researchFootnote 2; job creation/termination stands here for all the dynamics underlying the beginning/ending of job relationships. The only empirical evidence regarding the moral hazard effect of a mixed system is Reyes et al.’s (2011) comparison of aggregated labor market behavior of IUA-financed versus non IUA-financed unemployed individuals in Chile. Nagler (2013) found employment duration effects from the introduction of the UI systems in Chile, although it is not clear what is the pooling-versus-mixed component of this effect. For our study, we take a conservative position, assuming that UIs’ moral hazard is low (setting a − 0.3 “job creation elasticity with respect to UI benefits”), which we discuss after presenting the model. Section 2 covers the methodology and summarizes the model that is detailed in the Appendix; Section 3 shows the results and Section 4 discusses the findings.",2

An international comparison,December 2018,Verónica Escudero,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Since the 1990s, there has been an increased acceptance in the developed world of the need for ALMPs to strengthen the link between social protection, labour market policies and employment. Today, these policies are widely regarded as an important tool in fighting unemployment. As a result, expenditure in ALMPs is sizeable in most advanced economies and continues to increase. Success of ALMPs, however, has not been invariably positive. Although some empirical evidence exists that points to a positive effect on the probability of finding employment (e.g. Layard et al. 2009; Lalive et al. 2005; Larsen 2002), the effects tend to be relatively small, making it unclear whether the positive outcomes are enough to compensate for the costs. Moreover, a central concern that remains is whether ALMPs are suitable to address longer-term matters such as skills and employability, especially among the least employable jobless individuals. This paper aims to contribute to this debate by examining the effectiveness of active labour market policies (ALMPs) in improving labour market outcomes, especially for low-skilled individuals from a macroeconomic perspective. The analysis is done by ways of a pooled cross-country and time series analysis based on 31 advanced countriesFootnote 1 for which detailed annual data on different ALMPs (putting particularly emphasis on those specifically targeted to low-skilled individuals) exists for the period 1985–2010. The study contributes to the empirical evaluation of ALMPs beyond what it is already known mainly in three ways: first, the paper includes aspects of the delivery system in the analysis to shed light on the role of implementation characteristics in explaining differences in the performance of ALMPs between countries. Second, it disaggregates the analysis by type of ALMP to capture their differential effects. Third, it is focused on the labour market outcomes of low-skilled individuals that have been among the least researched marginalized groups. Lastly, the paper provides an updated aggregate assessment approach by extending the time and country coverage of the dataset,Footnote 2 thereby unveiling new estimates of the overall net effect of ALMPs in the labour market. Much has been written about the effectiveness of active labour market measures based on evaluations carried out using micro-data, yet not enough about their effectiveness at the aggregate level. In fact, a well-established microeconomic literature exists today on the effects of these policies and their design and delivery systems at the individual level (Card et al. 2010 and 2017). In particular, the evidence to date suggests that training and private sector employment programmes have been generally effective, but mostly in the medium to long-term, while in the short-term effects are negligible. Meanwhile, job search assistance tends to have similarly positive impacts in the short and long runs. On the contrary, public work schemes have not proved very effective. For all types of active interventions, findings from micro-econometric analyses show that the design, targeting and implementation of a policy are paramount in ensuring its effectiveness (ILO 2016). At the macroeconomic level, conversely, much less research exists that allows to understand whether ALMPs matter in broad terms. As the role of ALMPs frequently involve substitution, displacement and other indirect effects, which generally cannot be addressed by microeconomic policy evaluations, capturing empirically the overall net effect of ALMPs on the wide labour market (i.e. including both on the efficiency of the matching process and on the size of the labour force) is of upmost importance. This comprehensive assessment of the effects of ALMPs is, however, nearly absent in today’s literature. First, some studies exist on the macroeconomic effects of labour market institutions and reforms, of which ALMPs are one component (e.g. Murtin and de Serres 2014; Blanchard and Wolfers 2000; Scarpetta 1996). This literature owes its origin to the innovative analysis of Layard et al. (1991), which studied the effect of activation on the structural unemployment rate, finding that ALMPs have a negative effect on long-term unemployment. Second, there are a few other studies that focus particularly on the effects of ALMPs, yet with no consensus with regard to the effect of these policies on unemployment rates. While the seminal study of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (1993) argues that results are not robust enough to be conclusive, Estevão (2003) found positive effects of ALMPs on the employment rate of the business sector in the 1990s (but not in the late 1980s), Baker et al. (2005) found only an insignificant impact and Bassanini and Duval (2006) find that some types of ALMPs, such as labour market training, are indeed associated with lower unemployment. Moreover, these studies have focused on whether total ALMP spending matters at the aggregate level, but (except for Bassanini and Duval 2006)Footnote 3 without delving into the great variation in effectiveness between different types of policies. This constitutes the third stream of the literature, where only a handful of studies have been documented that assess the overall effects of ALMPs while disaggregating between the different policies (Martin 2015). Finally, studies in which the effectiveness of ALMPs is linked to implementation aspects are even scarcer (Schmid et al. 2001; Calmfors 1994; de Koning and van Nes 1991). As such, existing knowledge on the aggregate effects of different ALMPs and the role played by design and implementation aspects in shaping those effects remains inconclusive. Deepening the understanding of the broader effects of ALMPs is, however, all the more relevant today. First, the persisting labour market consequences of the Great Recession has brought to the fore a renewed interest in the potential role of ALMPs in easing a wide range of labour market problems (Martin 2015; Armingeon 2007). Second, many advanced countries are under tight budgets, and given the mixed empirical evidence on the effectiveness of ALMPs, spending on these policies is under careful scrutiny. Third, the availability of longer time series allows to control better the sensitivity of policies to the business cycle (Schmid et al. 2001).Footnote 4 As such, the potential for capturing the full effects of ALMPs and deepening the understanding of their effectiveness has increased of late. Based on these new developments, the present paper is a renewed effort to capture the overall effects of ALMPs at a macroeconomic level with views to assessing their impact on the efficiency of the matching process and on the size of the labour force, while also taking into consideration their indirect effects (i.e. productivity and competition effects, deadweight loss, substitution, crowding-out and lock-in effects). I find that ALMPs matter at the aggregate level, including through appropriate implementation aspects. Start-up incentives and the cluster of policies aimed for the most vulnerable (job rotation, supported employment and direct job creation measures) show the most favourable results, both in terms of reducing unemployment and also in terms of increasing employment. They are also effective in raising participation, but only for the low skilled. Spending in employment incentives is also effective across the board, again with the exception of raising participation for the overall group, where the effect is not statistically significant. Importantly, results show that ALMPs are more effective for the low skilled than for the overall population; something that is noteworthy as we know little from the existing literature on the net effects on these policies on low-skilled individuals. Training, in contrast, seems to be effective mostly for the overall population; however, it has also positive effects for the low skilled through the interaction with implementation variables. In terms of implementation, the analysis finds that the allocation of resources to programme administration has favourable effects and that a disruption of policy continuity is associated with negative effects for all labour market variables analysed. Interestingly, the size of the coefficients arising from policy and implementation variables, once interactions are included, is noticeably higher, demonstrating that a correct implementation of policies enhances their beneficial effect.",24

In some countries, the debates have focused around the introduction of a national minimum wage. For instance, Germany, which did not have a national minimum wage, introduced one in 2015. Italy and South Africa are also discussing the opportunity to introduce a minimum wage at a national level. In other countries where statutory minimum wages already exist, the debates after the crisis have turned around their level. For instance, the Conservative Government in the UK decided to increase the minimum wage for adults to 60% of the median wage by 2020 (currently it is around 50%). In the USA, the fight for a 15$ minimum wage gained some ground and some cities have passed legislation to bring this to effect. In Europe, over many years, unions and associations have discussed the possibility of introducing minimum wages at the local level to better take into account the costs of living (e.g. London living wage) or harmonise European wage policies through a EU-level minimum wage. The research on the topic has mainly focused on the impact of minimum wages on employment (see, among many others, the seminal papers by Neumark and Wascher, 1992 and Card and Krueger, 1994) or on poverty (e.g. Sabia and Burkhauser, 2010 and MaCurdy, 2015), while more recently it also studied the effect on prices (Allegretto and Reich, 2015), profits (Draca et al. 2011) and productivity (Riley and Rosazza-Bondibene, 2015). Strikingly, the aspect of compliance of the established minimum wage rates has been largely overlooked in OECD countries. Ashenfelter and Smith (1979) first investigated the patterns of minimum wage compliance in the USA noting that “in the midst of numerous studies intended to establish the quantitative effects of the minimum wage law, it is remarkable that no one has bothered to establish that this law actually affects wage rates […] presumably reflecting the belief that employers fully comply with this law”. Ashenfelter and Smith (1979) found that compliance in the USA in the 1970s was substantial but not complete and concluded that “the most useful future analyses of the effects [of the minimum wage] will incorporate a thorough analysis of the compliance issue.” More than three decades after this seminal paper, compliance to the minimum wage as well as, more in general, the issue of the enforcement of labour regulations is still rarely analysed (Ronconi, 2010). Only few, and often tentative, estimates of non-compliance to minimum wage regulations are available and mainly for emerging economies. Moreover, existing analyses focus on minimum wages set at a national level and disregard wage floors set by collective agreements which in several European countries are the most important wage setting institution. This paper extends the analysis of non-compliance to sectoral minimum wages set by collective agreements in the case of Italy. In Italy, as in many other European countries, trade unions and employers’ organisations negotiate sectoral wage floors but little is known about their level, coverage and compliance. The contribution of this paper is therefore twofold: first, it provides a comprehensive and detailed portrait of sectoral wage floors in Italy by year, region, firm and workforce characteristics. Second, it estimates the degree of non-compliance with the sectoral minimum wages using three alternative data sources on wages matched to a dataset on negotiated wages and looking not only at the share of underpaid workers but also at the size of underpayment by year, region, firm and workers’ characteristics. The results show that sectoral wage floors in Italy are relatively high both in absolute terms and relative to the median wage. However, on average, around 10% of workers are paid 20% less than the minimum wage as established in the collective agreement of reference. Non-compliance is particularly high in the South and in micro and small firms, and it affects especially women and temporary workers. Moreover, wages at the bottom of the distribution appear to be largely unaffected by increases in sectoral wage floors. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises the existing literature while Section 3 presents the institutional setting and provides a detailed statistical portrait of sectoral wage floors in Italy between 2008 and 2015. Section 4 presents and discusses the estimates of the number of workers paid less than the sectoral minimum wages and some robustness tests using alternative data sources. Section 5 concludes by discussing the results and the policy implications for Italy.",14

Most workers’ rights are established in the National Constitution, while labor relationships are regulated by different laws. However, as in most developing countries, compliance with labor regulations is low in Argentina. According to workers’ report on their own working conditions, in 2015, around 31% of wage employees did not receive pension contributions, health insurance, and the annual extra monthly pay and were not entitled to paid vacation time (SEDLAC 2017). These figures suggest that there is a large difference between the written regulations and its effective implementation in the country. Strict labor regulations jointly with an imperfect enforcement can generate incentives to the firms for not complying with the labor law (Basu et al. 2010). That will depend on firms’ evaluation of the costs and benefits of evading the regulations (the expected monetary fine versus reduced labor costs). When the compliance with labor regulations is low, the enforcement of the rules becomes a concept that is closer to the regulatory environment that firms and workers face (Almeida and Carneiro 2009). Therefore, firms are expected to react to variations in the enforcement level, even when the written regulation does not change. In this paper I explore microdata from Argentine household surveys for the period 2005–2011 to analyze (i) how changes in the enforcement of labor market regulations affect different indicators of compliance with the labor law among men and women and (ii) how changes in enforcement generates adjustments of some labor outcomes (different than the compliance level) for men and women separately. I take advantage of the highly decentralized labor inspection system in Argentina which allows me to construct an enforcement measure (number of inspected firms per hundred formal firms) with variation at the province, productive sector, and time level. The econometric strategy links indicators of compliance with labor regulations and other labor market outcomes such as hourly wages, percentiles of the wage distribution, indicators of the provision of non-mandated benefits, and the structure of occupation by employment categories (wage employment versus self-employment), with the enforcement measure and with a rich set of individual socioeconomic and labor characteristics, and economic, institutional, and development characteristics of Argentine provinces. The mechanisms analyzed in this paper are the following. When formal firms face stricter enforcement, the cost of not complying with labor regulations becomes higher. The increased cost of informal employment, i.e., workers not receiving mandated benefits, leads firms to comply with the rules by substituting formal employees for informal employees (substitution effect) and to reduce the size of the labor force (scale effect). The increased compliance may impact men and women differently. First, labor regulations usually present some differences across gender, and that is the case in Argentina. Second, differences in some labor characteristics, such as average monthly earnings, may lead firms to avoid labor regulation among women more than men or the other way around. Adjustments in the size of the labor force may also have a different impact on men and women. Firms may prefer to lay off women more than men because their severance pay will be lower, i.e., women’s average tenure and monthly earnings are usually lower in comparison to men. An additional impact associated with the scale effect is that workers who lose their jobs may offer their hours of work to informal firms. This effect is possible because labor inspections are focused on formal firms in Argentina. The increased labor costs resulting from stricter enforcement can lead firms to make additional adjustments which can also differ among men and women. They can reduce hourly wages or decrease the level of non-mandated benefits, such as meals and housing. The main challenge to the estimation of the relationships of interest is that the enforcement measure is probably endogenous. To deal with this problem, I implement an instrumental variable strategy. The proposed instrument is a measure of the arrival cost of labor inspectors to the firms. Labor inspectors travel by car from the inspection agencies to the firms to be inspected. A combination of the extension of the road network and the traffic in each province provides a measure of the arrival cost to the firms. Results reveal very different effects of an increase in the degree of enforcement on the compliance level and other labor market outcomes among men and women. Higher enforcement leads firms to increase compliance with labor regulation among men. The shares of male wage employees covered by social security (pensions and health insurance) and employment regulations (annual extra monthly wage, paid vacation time, paid sickdays, wage equal or above the minimum and working hours equal or below the legal maximum) increase at the province-sector level, i.e., firms substitute formal wage employees for informal wage employees. Formal wages increase, informal wages decline, and self-employed men become wage earners to take advantage of the increase in the provision of mandated benefits. Among women, higher enforcement leads to a reduction in the provision of mandated benefits at the province-sector level. The scale effect dominates among them, and the decline in formal firms’ demand for formal and informal female wage employees leads to formal and informal wage reductions for women (although not significant for formal wages). Laid-off women move to informal firms where they do not receive mandated benefits and self-employed women become informal wage employees, probably attracted by the probability of obtaining better employment conditions in the future due to higher enforcement. All these findings are in line with the functioning of a two-sector economy model with competitive markets and no rigidities. The topic of gender differences in the analysis of labor market regulations is of clear importance for both developed and developing countries. I focus the empirical work on Argentina for three reasons. First, the availability of data allows me to construct a measure of enforcement with variation across provinces, sectors, and overtime for the period 2005–2011, when there is also microdata at the individual level on a wide set of mandated benefits for wage employees, some non-mandated benefits and hourly wages. With this data, I can test for men and women how the compliance with labor regulations reacts when the enforcement measure changes, and how other labor outcomes respond, probably due to firms’ need of adjustment. Second, the fact that the labor rules being enforced are common to all Argentine provinces generates an ideal framework to evaluate the effects of changes in the enforcement measure on labor outcomes using the province variation of the data. Third, equality of opportunities between men and women has been placed at the top of the policy agenda in recent years. The elimination of any type of violence against women, including the discrimination at the workplace, has been part of Argentine Congress meetings which is discussing laws in that direction. This paper makes important contributions to the literature analyzing heterogeneous labor market effects of labor regulations across gender, and to the literature studying the effects of enforcement of the labor law (not the law by itself) on labor outcomes. First, to my knowledge, there is no evidence linking the enforcement of labor regulations to labor outcomes of men and women, or using simultaneously the variation of an enforcement measure across geographic locations, economic sectors, and over time. Second, the results provide evidence on how the regulatory environment can impact the decisions that firms and workers make about participating in the informal sector of the economy. Finally, the empirical findings have important policy implications in terms of gender equality in the labor market. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature while Section 3 provides a description of the labor inspection system in Argentina. Section 4 discusses the theoretical mechanisms at play in the estimation of the relationship between enforcement of labor regulations and labor market outcomes for men and women. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy while Sections 6 and 7 discuss the results. Section 8 concludes.",2

This divergence relates to both the long-term growth as well as the business cycle. The divergence in the long-term growth pattern is illustrated in Fig. 1b, whereby the HP filter trend component of real per capita GDP is plotted for Greece and the OECD. And, the divergence in the business cycle is illustrated in Fig. 1c whereby the HP filter cyclical component of real per capita output is shown to be very volatile and persistent in Greece, while lagging procyclically relative to the OECD.Footnote 1 Moreover, as strikingly shown in Fig. 1, the recent recession plaguing most OECD countries has been considerably more severe in Greece than in the OECD. Over the last 8 years (2008–2014), the cumulative percentage GDP change in Greece and the OECD average has been − 27 and + 2%, respectively.Footnote 2 So, the obvious question is: Why are these phenomena happening? And, how can they be stopped? Real per capita GDP in PPP values (1970–2014). a Annual data over the period 1970–2014. b Per capita GDP is in constant 2010 prices, constant PPPs, and detrended with the HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 100. c Output gap is defined as the ratio of the HP filter cyclical component over the corresponding HP trend In this paper, we follow the assessments of influential economists such as Olivier Blanchard (2012, 2015) and Edmund Phelps (2015) and seek answers to these questions in the way the Greek politicoeconomic system is organized and, in particular, the way it affects the country’s total factor productivity.Footnote 3 In a precursor and a companion to this paper Kollintzas et al. ((2012) and (2017), respectively) proposed a theory that explains the dismal behavior of Greece’s GDP per capita path, over the last four decades, as well as the economic crisis plaguing presently its economy. According to this theory, the politicoeconomic system of Greece is the main culprit. In essence, since the re-establishment of democracy in 1974, Greece developed its own brand of capitalism. Although this initially may have helped the country grow, this eventually handicapped and finally jeopardized its ability to grow as well as its ability to deal with the sovereign debt crisis that broke out in 2010. This happened because the politicoeconomic system that emerged had two remarkable features: First, it allowed for the creation and operation of certain groups of economic agents we shall refer to as “elites” or “insiders.” These insiders enjoyed considerable market and/or political power. Examples of main groups of insiders are civil servants and employees of public sector corporations (i.e., the so called “ΔΕΚΟ”) as well as professionals of certain sectors, organized in powerful unions and professional associations, respectively. Second, although each group of insiders behaved independently in the market for its labor services (i.e., ignoring the effects of its actions on the other groups of insiders and society as a whole), it, nevertheless, cooperated with all other groups of insiders within the dominant political parties and government so as to influence government decisions. We refer to this politicoeconomic system as the “insider–outsider society” or simply IOS.Footnote 4 The main consequence of IOS is to lower the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) and in extreme cases to lower even the level of TFP. The workings of IOS, that could at the same time serve as a narrative of what actually happened in Greece, may be summarized as follows: In non-competitive markets, the powerful civil servant and public corporation unions succeed in securing very high wages and incomes for their members. These wages lead, in turn, to very high prices for all state services (e.g., law and order, licensing, utilities, and almost all basic networks (e.g., power, water and sewage, phone, garbage disposal, rail, sea transport, oil refineries, natural gas)). The latter are both basic inputs in the economy’s production process. Hence, this implies important factor allocation distortions that jeopardize total factor productivity and overall competitiveness. In competitive, by their very nature, markets, economic power is expressed through market regulation in such a way as to ensure minimum compensations and preferential tax treatments for the members of important professional associations (e.g., doctors, lawyers, notaries, engineers, pharmacists). These closed professions are typically unionized and limit entry into their ranks, through a variety of institutional barriers to labor mobility. Most importantly, however, they enjoy special tax privileges that enables them to avoid taxes. Minimum compensations work like the wages in the public sector and ΔΕΚΟ and preferential tax treatments increase disproportionally the tax burden of outsiders, leading likewise to lower total factor productivity and increased production costs throughout the economy. At the same time, the major political parties and government are influenced by the powerful unions and professional associations. In such a way, these elites cooperate in the governance of the country to ensure their interests (e.g., financing wages and salaries, develop and maintain the underlying public infrastructure and obtain favorable market restrictions and tax exemptions). But all this results in relatively high taxes and/or budget deficits and government borrowing. This leads to further distortions in the economy, further reducing total factor productivity, output, and growth. In relatively low stages of development, the advent of IOS may promote growth. However, as the power of insiders grows stronger, the detrimental effect of the abovementioned distortions becomes dominant. At such a point, the stronger the power of insiders, the lower is the level of TFP. To comprehend the particularity of the Greek case, it is worth noting that such a strategic interdependence does not happen in Anglo-Saxon countries, because there, unions / professional associations have little power. And, does not happen in the Scandinavian countries where, although strong, unions/professional associations work together, thereby taking account of possible negative effects of their decisions on the whole of society. It is then this decrease in total factor productivity stemming from both market and fiscal policy distortions that explains the “low flight” of the Greek economy over the past 40 years, as well as the severity of the recession and the ineffectiveness of policies to deal with the crisis. In this paper, we investigate whether there is formal empirical support for the view that the reason Greece’s growth and business cycle behavior is different than the OECD is because its politicoeconomic system behaves like the insider–outsider society of the theory, unlike that of most OECD countries. Obviously, in order to do this, we need to identify variables that can serve as indicators of the degree a real world politicoeconomic system behaves like the insider–outsider society of the theory. Our empirical strategy approach then is threefold. At a first stage, we review what the literature suggests as being the basic determinants of the behavior of these IOS indicator variables and split these determinants into two broad categories, namely those that do and those that do not directly relate to our IOS theory. Once we establish that the IOS indicator variables have a different behavior in Greece relative to other countries, we investigate whether these differences remain, once the first group of determinants not related with the IOS explanation are taken into account. Since the answer is positive, we then investigate whether these differences can be accounted for by the second group of determinants that directly relate to the IOS explanation. At the second stage of our empirical investigation, we examine the relationship of these IOS indicators with total factor productivity, output, and output growth. Finally, in the third stage of our empirical investigation, we analyze the business cycle implications of the IOS indicator variables. More specifically, in this paper, we identify certain public finance features of Greece that make this country stand out among a representative group of OECD countries. And, we connect these features to the dismal behavior of its GDP per capita path, over the last four decades, as well as its present crisis. Specifically, Greece stands out among OECD countries having the highest public sector wage premium, defined as the ratio of the average wage in the public relative to the private sector (WPR). In addition, Greece stands out among OECD countries having the lowest self-employed taxation gap, defined as the ratio of the effective tax rate on the income of the self-employed over labor income (TSL). High values of the public sector wage premium might be related to the influence exerted by public sector employees organized in powerful unions. And, low values of the self-employed taxation gap might be related to the influence exerted by self-employed, organized in powerful professional associations. According to the theoretical work of Kollintzas et al. (2017), these features may be indicative of an “insider–outsider society,” whereby the politicoeconomic system is characterized by groups of selfish elites that enjoy market power but at the same time cooperate in influencing the government, in order to maintain and promote their privileges over the rest of the society. Their theoretical model incorporates the insider–outsider labor market structure of Lindbeck and Snower (2001) and the concept of an elite government of Acemoglu (2006). The combination of these two concepts has important implications for the workings of the economic and political systems and leads to labor misallocation and inefficient fiscal policies. The latter two, in turn, are associated with low total factor productivity (TFP) and output growth. Running panel regressions, we find substantial evidence that the relationship between WPR and TSL and a number of explanatory variables commonly used in the literature is different in Greece relative to other OECD country groups and most importantly that these differences are consistent with the IOS theory. In particular, we show that, unlike the other OECD countries, explanatory variables related to wage setting institutions, competition conditions, public finances, and external imbalances can account for the behavior of WPR and TSL in Greece and to a lesser extent in Spain and Portugal, in a manner that is consistent with insider–outsider society theory. Thereby, we establish that WPR and TSL are likely candidates as proxies for the strength of the insider–outsider society. Then, we proceed to investigate the role of WPR and TSL for the behavior of TFP and output growth. In doing so, we regress each one of these variables on TFP. And, we run Barro regressions incorporating WPR or TSL in the list of explanatory variables commonly used by this literature. We find that for Greece as well as Spain and Portugal, WPR and TSL have an adverse effect on both TFP and output growth. Finally, the relationship between these variables and the business cycle (shock propagation mechanism) is investigated via a panel VAR analysis. Again, the impulse response function (IRF) analysis suggests that the shock propagation mechanisms of both WPR and TSL for Greece and to a lesser extent Spain and Portugal are quite different from the rest of the OECD countries. For example, in Greece, unlike the other OECD countries, a positive temporary shock in WPR causes TFP and output to fall and the public and current account deficits to increase. We take both (i.e., the TFP/output growth and the shock propagation mechanism) results to provide strong evidence that Greece and to a lesser extent Spain and Portugal behave like the insider–outsider society of the theory. This paper relates to the literature on the causes and remedies of relatively low growth of per capita GDP in Greece. In particular, it shares with the growth accounting studies of Dimelis et al. (1997), Bosworth and Kollintzas (2002), Kollintzas et al. (2012), Gogos et al. (2014), and Leounakis and Sakellaris and (2014) the result that TFP is to blame for this low growth outcome. It is also consistent with the result of Sondermann (2012) that TFP growth in Greece and Portugal falls behind that of the other Euro Area countries. Further, this paper shares with Alogoskoufis (1995) the view that the low TFP growth in Greece was a consequence of the “bad institutions” that characterized the politicoeconomic system developed after 1974. The economics profession largely regards the Greek crisis as a sovereign debt crisis, manifested in the high and unsustainable levels of the debt to GDP ratio in the sense of Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). To this end, this paper relates to the unsustainability issue in two ways. First, by explaining the relatively slow output growth brought about by low TFP growth. Second, by explaining one of the reasons leading to the increase in government deficit and debt, namely, financing government wages and public infrastructure of insiders.Footnote 5 In that sense, this is a contribution to the extensive literature on the Greek crisis. But, with the exception of Ioannides and Pissarides (2015), that also consider the role of market structure and labor institutions, this literature emphasizes other aspects of the causes and remedies of the deep recession.Footnote 6 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the data and study the behavior of WPR and TSL, two variables that capture important features of the insider–outsider society. In Section 3, we examine the importance of WPR and TSL for TFP and long-term growth. In Section 4, we investigate the role of WPR and TSL for the shock propagation mechanism. And, Section 5 concludes.",11

Mathä,Stephen Millard,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Short-time work (STW) programmes are schemes aimed at preserving employment in firms temporarily experiencing weak demand. The Great Recession saw a significant increase in the number of employees on STW schemes and the number of countries introducing or extending schemes. Furthermore, even where such schemes were not available, for example within the UK, employers still acted to reduce the hours of their workers while maintaining their links with them through the use of zero-hour contracts. This paper investigates the impact of STW schemes and the temporary use of short-time work more generally in Europe. The research makes two key contributions. First, we document the extent to which short-time work schemes were used by firms to adjust labour demand over the 2010–2013 period, whether as part of a government-sponsored STW programme or not. Second, we quantify the relationship between STW scheme take-up and firm characteristics, worker characteristics, economic factors, such as the scale and nature of shocks, and institutional factors. The main institutional factors we consider are the importance of employment protection legislation and the extent of downward nominal wage rigidities at the country-sector level. The research builds on existing cross-country studies of STW schemes by Arpaia et al. (2010), Hijzen and Venn (2011) as updated by Hijzen and Martin (2013) and Boeri and Bruecker (2011). However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to use firm-level cross-country data to look at the determinants of STW usage and take-up. To examine these issues, we draw on the data from the third wave of the Wage Dynamics Network survey (WDN3).Footnote 1 The WDN3 dataset contains micro data on over 25,000 firms across 25 EU countries, surveyed during 2014. The survey asks firms how they adjusted their labour demand and wage levels in the face of the economic shocks experienced during 2010–2013. WDN3 data allow us to examine both subsidised and unsubsidised reductions in working hours at the firm level. In our analysis, STW occurs when firms use subsidised reductions in working hours to reduce labour inputs. To provide context for our paper, in the next section, we give an overview of research on the take-up and impact of STW schemes during the Great Recession. In Section 3, we present a simplified version of the model in Balleer et al. (2016), within which we can think about some of the theoretical implications of STW programmes. We discuss the WDN data, together with the data we use on the detail of existing STW programmes and employment protection legislation in our group of countries, in more detail in Section 4. Section 5 presents our empirical framework and results. Section 6 concludes.",8
