Buiter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his famous lectures on monetary theory “The Two Triads,” Sir John Hicks tried to establish a mapping between the three classical functions of money—means of payment or medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account or numéraire, and the three Keynesian motives for holding money: the transactions motive, the speculative motive and the precautionary motive (Hicks 1967).Footnote 1 The mapping was never completed: the role of money as the numéraire or unit of account remained an orphan. This should not surprise us. The role of the numéraire is one of the least researched and least well understood topics in economics. Consider the following key questions: why and when does it matter what real, financial or imaginary object provides the unit that serves as the numéraire? How is the numéraire (or how are the numéraires) determined or chosen in both barter and monetary economies? Is there a reason for the common but not universal empirical association, in systems with central bank fiat money, of the numéraire and the currency issued by the central bank? Is it surprising that, historically, even in non-fiat money systems, the unit of account has tended to be a commonly used medium of exchange? From within the canon of conventional neoclassical economics, including New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomics, these questions have not been answered satisfactorily, if at all. Yet in both New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomics the numéraire plays a crucial role. In both approaches, the maintained assumption that fiat money issued by the central bank (currency) is the numéraire, combined with the assumption that the nominal interest rate on currency is constrained to equal zero, sets a zero floor under the nominal interest rate, that is, the interest rate on instruments denominated in terms of the numéraire. The further assumption that there is a non-zero real demand for currency (sometimes derived from quasi-primitive restrictions on the ability to trade real goods for real goods), means that the nominal interest rate (the interest rate in terms of the numéraire) will, in general, be welfare-relevant. All this applies even when there are no nominal price or wage rigidities. Even with flexible prices it matters what the numéraire is. If the numéraire were bread, for instance, it would be the bakers rather than the central bank that would determine the rate of inflation, assuming they could bake with sufficient speed and flexibility to set the own rate of interest on bread. If in addition money wages or prices were sticky in terms of the bread numéraire, the bakers’ guild would have a non-trivial monetary stabilisation policy role. The welfare significance of the numéraire when there are nominal wage or price rigidities survives even in a cashless economy, interpreted here as in Woodford (2003) as the limit of an economy in which central bank currency serves as both means of payment and numéraire, as the demand for currency as a means of payment goes to zero. The fact that the choice of numéraire has implications for the existence of a liquidity trap would not be of practical interest if the liquidity trap were a theoretical curiosum. There can be little doubt that the liquidity trap was perceived in this way for much if not most of the second half of the 20th century. But no longer. Means and methods for removing the zero floor under the nominal interest rate became more than intellectual curiosa when the Bank of Japan’s Discount rate fell to effectively zero in September 2001, a level at which it stood until July 2006.Footnote 2 When the Federal Funds rate target of the Federal Reserve fell to 1.00% in July 2003 there was a non-negligible risk that the zero lower bound could become a binding constraint on the ability to conduct conventional expansionary monetary policy in the US. Similar concerns were expressed when the ECB’s policy rate was cut to 2.00% in June 2003. Clearly, the urgency to find a way to remove or bypass the zero lower bound has diminished since then, although even at the time of writing (January 2007), the Bank of Japan’s policy rate stands only at 0.25%. The potential problem of the zero lower bound becoming a binding constraint on the conduct of expansionary monetary policy has not disappeared, however. Central Banks throughout the world are committed to the pursuit of price stability, often (though not always, as the case of the US demonstrates) through the adoption and pursuit of a low and stable target for the rate of inflation.Footnote 3 With the world-wide decline in long-run risk-free real interest rates, the pursuit of a low rate of inflation is likely to imply a pattern of, on average, low nominal interest rates. This creates a non-negligible risk that the economy could be impacted by a contractionary shock so severe, that even cutting short nominal interest rates to zero would not represent an adequate monetary policy response. This motivates continued study of alternative mechanisms for setting negative nominal interest rates. The modalities for setting negative nominal interest rates in turn highlight the importance of the extent to which the numéraire function can be unbundled from the means of payment/medium of exchange function. It goes without saying that for something to serve as a medium of exchange and means of payment, it will have to be willingly held between transactions and therefore will have to be a store of value. The key (un)bundling therefore is between on the one hand the numéraire and on the other hand the store of value that serves as means of payment and medium of exchange.Footnote 4
 In a comment on Buiter and Panigirtzoglou’s (2003) paper on implementing negative nominal interest rates by imposing a carry tax on currency, Professor Davies (2004) points to an interesting alternative mechanism for removing the zero lower bound on nominal interests rates. This mechanism, which Davies attributes to Eisler (1932), does not require the administratively costly, cumbersome and intrusive payment of negative interest rates on currency. Instead it involves the unbundling of the medium of exchange/means of payment function of currency, sterling, say, from its numéraire/unit of account role. The zero lower bound is associated with the means of payment/medium of exchange role of cash: the bearer bond property of currency makes it difficult to pay interest (positive or negative) on currency.Footnote 5 Instead, in the Eisler economy envisaged by Davies, the authorities abolish sterling as a medium of exchange/means of payment by retiring all sterling currency. Sterling continues to be the numéraire in key private transactions (especially wage settlements and domestic price contracts for goods and services) and the authorities use the short sterling nominal interest rate, without a zero lower bound, to pursue a sterling inflation or sterling price level target. A new currency, the drachma, say, is introduced to serve as the medium of exchange/means of payment in lieu of sterling. Drachma currency, like sterling currency before it was abolished, has a zero nominal interest rate. Both drachma-denominated and sterling-denominated interest-bearing bonds are issued freely by the authorities. The authorities control and set the nominal interest rate on sterling bonds and the exchange rates (spot and forward, current and future) between drachma and sterling. Even with the interest rate on drachma bonds subject to a zero floor set by the zero interest rate on drachma currency, the interest rate on sterling bonds can be negative if the authorities make a credible commitment to appreciate the sterling-drachma exchange rate. This paper argues that Davies’s proposal contains two potential weaknesses. The first is his assumption that the monetary authorities determine the unit of account, or, more precisely, choose the object(s), real or financial, some quantity of which serve as the unit of account.Footnote 6 The second is his assumption that it is the behaviour of the price level in terms of that unit of account that matters for economic welfare, or more specifically, that the authorities should pursue price stability (in principle a zero rate of inflation going forward, in practice a low rate of inflation for some real world price index) in terms of that numéraire. The plausibility of both assumptions is questionable. This matters not just in the Eisler universe, which does have a means of payment/medium of exchange (currency, for short), although it does not assign the unit of account/numéraire role to the currency, but also in a world without currency, in a cashless economy. One approach to the numéraire in a cashless economy is to view it as disembodied, abstract numéraire or virtual currency, phlogiston, say.Footnote 7 In that case the authorities cannot set the interest rate in terms of the numéraire. The alternative approach, adopted in this paper, following Woodford (2003), is to define a unit of the numéraire as a unit of some fiat interest-bearing financial instrument issued by the government. In the Eisler economy and in its cashless special case, a unit of the sterling numéraire would be a unit of the short sterling bond—or a financial instrument that is a perfect substitute for the short sterling bond, e.g. commercial bank reserves with the central bank. The determination of the numéraire and its significance is a much-neglected issue in monetary economics. The great monetary economists of previous generations distinguished carefully between what one of them, Patinkin, called “the abstract unit of account” and the actual, physical (and today also digital), medium of exchange.Footnote 8 The abstract unit of account “...serves only for purposes of computation and record keeping. This unit has no physical existence;” (Patinkin 1965, p. 15). Patinkin refers to prices in terms of the abstract unit of account as accounting prices and prices in terms of the medium of exchange, as money prices. In what follows, accounting prices will also be identified with contracting prices and invoicing prices. Theoretical studies of ‘cashless’ economies have become something of a growth industry (see e.g. Woodford 2003, and the literature cited there). Nominal rigidities (that is, price and/or wage rigidities in terms of the numéraire—rigid accounting and contracting prices) play a central role in the New Keynesian literature (see e.g. Clarida et al. 2001; Woodford 2003; Golosov and Lucas 2003). It is therefore appropriate to issue a reminder about the complete absence of deep structural microfoundations of the determination of the numéraire, how it emerges (or is selected) and how it matters for economic behaviour. In this paper I formalise Davies’s proposal and discuss some of the wider implications of the emergence of numérairology—the microfoundations of monetary economics without money. Among the central questions the new cashless monetary economics, like the old monetary economics with money, must address are the following. (1) How is the numéraire determined? Who or what chooses the numéraire or how does it emerge spontaneously from the trading and exchange interactions of purposefully acting but not necessarily unboundedly rational private agents? (2) What determines whether the numéraire be a pure abstract unit of account (like phlogiston), a financial instrument with a means of payment/medium of exchange function, a financial instrument without any special means of payment/medium of exchange function, or a real good or service valued intrinsically as a consumer good or as a productive input? (3) What determines whether there is just one numéraire or more than one? (4) Even if there is only one numéraire, can the government set a short nominal interest rate in terms of that numéraire, that is, can there be ‘monetary policy’ (defined as nominal interest rate policy) in a cashless economy? (5) Under what conditions is the general price level determinate in a cashless economy? This paper argues that the answer to questions (4) and (5) are simple, but that the questions to answers (1), (2) and (3) are difficult. Existing answers to question (1) are found to be wanting.",6

Therefore, it is typically taken for granted that facilitating international risk sharing is desirable and that a lack of such risk sharing indicates inefficiencies. The main theme of this paper is that there is also a potential cost to international risk sharing. This is because, by lowering a country’s benefits from its output, international risk sharing reduces the country’s incentives to produce and thus may cause inefficient government behavior. Hence, there is a trade-off between risk sharing and incentives, similar to the one that arises in a domestic context. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of this trade-off. This is an important objective, because, first, if international risk sharing causes distortions in production, complete risk sharing may be sub-optimal. Such a result may help to understand the small degree of risk sharing across countries, which has been pointed out by several authors. For example, only around 5% of income shocks in OECD countries are insured (Sørensen and Yosha 1998) compared to the 100% income insurance that portfolio theory would suggest. Up to now, no widely accepted resolution for this international risk sharing puzzle exists.Footnote 1
 Second, the analysis may inform about whether households’ risk sharing choices are socially optimal and whether there is a case for government intervention. Earlier work has found that in a closed economy markets solve the risk sharing-incentive trade-off in an efficient way (Kocherlakota 1998; Calcagno and Wagner 2006), but this result may not extend to an international setting. We show that when households can trade assets that condition on output, equilibrium risk sharing is characterized by output diversification in perpetuity. Under such risk sharing, domestic households hold claims to world output in all future periods and have sold claims to the output of their own country. This form of risk sharing is particularly problematic for government incentives. First, it does not allow for the costs of production to be shared among countries. Since at the same time a country’s benefits from production are reduced to the extent that it is diversified, governments have an incentive to lower inputs into production. This may be either directly (for example, through reduced public investment) or indirectly, by discouraging households from supplying inputs (for example by taxing labor). Second, because households’ optimal risk sharing involves diversification of perpetual claims to output (otherwise they would not be insured against permanent shocks), a country does not suffer any future costs from inefficient policies, which would normally help to mitigate moral hazard issues. For example, if government policies cause an outflow of capital that results in lower domestic income in future periods, the country would not internalize this as claims to its income are held by households from other countries. We also show that equilibrium risk sharing is inefficient from a social perspective. The reason for this is that an individual household ignores the impact of its risk sharing decision on government policies.Footnote 2 Therefore, it does not obtain risk sharing that is less detrimental to incentives, even if this would be possible. Suppose, for example, that besides assets conditioning on output, all domestic production inputs could also be traded. Complete risk sharing could then be obtained without creating any incentive problems by diversifying a country’s net income (that is, output net of costs), as the costs of providing inputs would then be shared with foreigners. However, an individual household has no incentive to obtain such complex risk sharing, as output diversification already achieves complete risk sharing. To illustrate the magnitude of the incentive problems, we show that the potential costs of government moral hazard can be large. In particular, they can easily outweigh the gains from risk sharing and can cause the optimal degree of risk sharing to be low. Therefore, the low degree of risk sharing in the data does not necessarily indicate an inefficient level of risk sharing. Another implication of our analysis is that financial integration and financial innovation that allow for better risk sharing may reduce welfare. This is because they may facilitate risk sharing beyond the socially optimal level.Footnote 3 Recently, so-called Economic Derivatives have been introduced (see, for example, The Economist 2002). These instruments allow individuals to hedge country risks, for example, by trading a country’s GDP. While this innovation surely brings about considerable gains by improving diversification, our results indicate that it may also imply significant costs. The concern that international risk sharing may entail costs by causing inefficient government policies is not a new one (see Shiller 1993; Wincoop 1999; Drèze 2000). However, there has not been a formal analysis of such costs yet. This paper contributes in particular by studying how they trade-off with the benefits from international risk sharing and by considering the consequences for the optimal degree of risk sharing. Several papers have analyzed the implications of moral hazard for the pattern of risk sharing and capital flows across countries. In Gertler and Rogoff (1990), moral hazard on the side of the government can explain why capital may flow from poorer to richer countries, even though rates of return in the latter are lower. Atkeson (1991) has shown that capital outflows in a crisis can be an efficient outcome (even though suboptimal in terms of risk sharing), when risk sharing is impeded by moral hazard and a lack of contract enforcement. Tirole (2003) uses government moral hazard to explain the structure of external financing in developing countries. These papers study the pattern of risk sharing that a benevolent social planner would implement. By contrast, the point of departure in the present paper is risk sharing that is initiated by households. We analyze how such risk sharing interacts with government incentives and show that it has very different welfare implications. While this paper is concerned with distortions in production in general, several previous contributions have suggested specific channels through which inefficiencies can arise, mostly in the context of cross-ownership of assets rather than explicitly risk sharing. Examples are distortions in corporate governance and bankruptcy laws (Tirole 2003), in crisis prevention (Tirole 2002, 2003), in labor protection (Atkeson 1991), in the taxation of firms (Huizinga and Nielsen 1997), in public inputs (Sachs 1989), in the incentives to undertake economic reforms (Calvo 2000), and in debt service (Kremer and Mehta 2000). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we demonstrate the moral hazard problem that arises from international risk sharing. Section 3 examines the equilibrium of household risk sharing and government policies. In Section 4 we discuss some mechanisms that may in practice help to mitigate government moral hazard. Section 5 studies the optimal degree of output diversification and analyzes the connection to the observed lack of international risk sharing. The final section contains the conclusions.",4

This evolution reflects learning by doing, reaction to crises, as well as changes in our understanding of prudential supervision. The Laissez Faire view of the role of central banks has gravitated from a “benign-neglect” view of economic stabilization (Lucas 1987, 2003) towards the Taylor rule, wherein monetary policy is set by a rule rather than discretion. To recall, about two decades ago Robert Lucas showed that the costs of business cycles in a calibrated macroeconomic model are trivial, implying that there may be little role for central banks’ stabilization policies or for fiscal policy. In the early 1990s, Taylor’s influential paper surmised a simple rule as a plausible guide for central banks’ policies (Taylor 1993). This happened against the background of a remarkable decline in macroeconomic volatility and cost of risk during the 1990s and early 2000s, a trend that has hence been referred to as “the great moderation.” The “great moderation” induced observers to presume the beginning of the end of costly business cycles. Key policy makers, led by Fed’s Chair Alan Greenspan, advocated a non-activist role of central banks. The implication was that central banks should refrain from policies aimed at curbing the appreciation of real assets (“asset inflation”), focusing instead on “goods inflation.”Footnote 1 This reflected the spirit of late 1990s and early 2000s, when the presumption was that private intermediation with minimal regulatory oversight provide superior results. The view fitted well with Lucas’ take on the cost of the business cycles, and the difficulty in identifying ‘bubbles’ in real time. The Lucas assessment of business cycle costs was challenged by Ramey and Ramey (1995) and other studies. They had consistently found that volatility exerts a significant negative impact on long-run (trend) growth, which is exacerbated in poorer countries.Footnote 2 In a similar vein, studies found that the 1997–8 crisis had lingering adverse growth effects on affected countries (Cerra and Saxena 2008). The narrow view of central banks’ roles have been seriously challenged by the global liquidity crisis of 2008–9, propagating a rigorous debate about the desirable course of prudential regulation and central bank policies. By force of history and by virtue of learning by doing, the pendulum is now shifting towards a more nuanced view. The emphasis is switching towards recognizing central banks’ responsibility in implementing prudential regulations and policies aimed at reducing volatility and susceptibility of economies to crises.Footnote 3
 In this paper, we take such a nuanced view of the role of central banks. The fact that ex-ante we are unable to identify “a bubble” or a crisis does not negate the role of policies aimed at reducing the probability and the adverse impact of unsustainable real appreciations. Applying Bayesian logic, policy makers should react to signals that indicate heightened probability of a crisis, even if there is no way of knowing a-priori the timing and depth of the crisis. The intellectual underpinning of this approach involves costly financial intermediation. In order to finance investment, firms can turn to external sources, such as bank loans, equity or corporate bonds, or rely on internal funds, such as retained earnings. However, capital markets tend to be thin or practically non-existent during sudden stops and deleveraging crises, thereby constraining investment to be funded internally or by banks. As was shown by Townsend (1979) and Bernanke and Gertler (1989), more costly verification and enforcement of contracts combined with higher economic volatility increase the cost of external funds, thereby reducing investment. When recessions occur, internal funds dry up leading to a greater contraction of investment than would occur with well-functioning capital markets. This in turn induces concavity in the association between shocks and investment. Under such circumstances, more volatile shocks would reduce average GDP and, potentially, the economic growth. This mechanism is only one plausible way of accounting for possible adverse effects of volatile shocks on economic performance.Footnote 4 Taking this perspective, central banks should charter policies that would reduce the impact of volatility on economic performance. In the next section we overview prudential supervision in emerging markets (EMs) exposed to capital inflows, and deleveraging vulnerabilities. We identity conditions under which prudential supervision that reduces economic volatility has sizable beneficial effects. We end the paper with a discussion linking our results to recent policy trends.",3

A Skeptical View,July 2011,Joshua Aizenman,Rajeswari Sengupta,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Against this background, we evaluate the patterns of the current account to GDP ratios of China and Germany, as a function of lagged conditional variables in a panel analysis, for 1970–2009 [see Tables 1 and 2]. The relatively short duration of our sample constrains our approach, and hence we sequentially add lagged conditioning variables to a bivariate regression. The set of controlling variables is mostly from Chinn and Prasad (2003) and Gruber and Kamin (2007). See the Appendix for data sources. To avoid correlation with the dependent variable, we lag the conditioning variables. The controls are:
 The US current account, reflecting the possible impact of the US as the demander of last resort. Larger US current account deficits are expected to be associated with a more positive current account balance of other countries. World and domestic GDP growth rates. An increase in the growth rate relative to other countries should be associated with a more negative current account balance, as it tends to be correlated with higher return on capital, increase in investment and the potential for higher future income, and decreases savings. Country’s net foreign asset position (NFA), expressed as a ratio to GDP. Higher Country’s NFA position increases its net investment income, and therefore tends to improve its current account balance. Government budget balance. Higher fiscal surplus (or lower fiscal deficit) tends to improve current account balance. Demographic factors (old and young dependency ratios). To recall, the life-cycle theory of consumption and saving implies that young households borrow, middle-age households save for retirement, and households in retirement dis-save. Therefore relatively young and relatively old countries are more likely to run current account deficits [see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996, Chapter 3)]. These effects may be captured empirically by controlling for youth dependency ratio (the ratio of the population ages 0–14 to the working age population, ages 15–64), and old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of the population 65 and older to the working age population). Domestic credit to GDP ratio (to proxy for domestic financial depth), and trade openness. Lack of financial development and lack of trade openness limit investment opportunities and hence encourage capital outflows [see Prasad et al. (2006) and Chinn and Prasad (2003)]. We also estimate the current account patterns of China and Germany by applying the Seemingly Unrelated Regression [SUR] Model, for 1970–2009 [see Table 3].
 One result that is common to all our estimations is the key importance of a common global factor—the US current account. In the SUR model, the current account/GDP surpluses of China and Germany are found to be moving in tandem with the US current account/GDP deficits, with a coefficient that is close to one. This implies that a rise in US current account/GDP deficit by 1% is associated with an equal rise of the current account/GDP surpluses of China and Germany. The growth rate of the global GDP seems to be playing an important role for Germany, but not for China. These results are in line with the key role of the US as the demander of last resort during our sample period.Footnote 6

Bernard and Jensen (2004) report that 15% of the exporting firms leave the export market every year in a sample of American firms between 1984 and 1992. Almost 5% of the firms have left the export market already the year after entry and do not return again on the export market afterwards (calculations from Table 5 of (Bernard and Jensen 2004)). Irarrazabal and Opromolla (2006) find that 16% of the exporting firms leave the export market every year in a sample of Chilean firms between 1990 and 1996. They do not calculate which fraction of quitters from the export market had just entered the export market. Other evidence on quick exit can be found in Eaton et al. (2007). They show in a panel of Colombian firms between 1996 and 2005 where each single export transaction is recorded that ‘the survival rate among first-year exporters is typically around one-third, and in some cases is much lower ((Eaton et al. 2007), p. 19).’ Hence two-third of the starting exporters drop out within a year. Indirect evidence on the quick exit of firms from the export market after entry comes from duration analysis on detailed export categories. Besedes and Prusa (2006) show with a US dataset between 1992 and 2001 of detailed product categories that around one third of imports (depending on the data) in a product category for differentiated products stop again within 1 year. Nitsch (2007) finds in a sample of German imports between 1995 and 2005 that 40% of the newly emerging import product categories stop within 1 year.Footnote 1
 So, empirical evidence shows that there is a lot of exit from the export market shortly after entry. Broadly, two reasons for exit from the export market can be identified. On the one hand, variables affecting profitability in the export market display variation. Negative shocks to such variables can induce firms to drop out of the export market. Baldwin (1988) and Baldwin and Krugman (1989) for example model fluctuations in exchange rates. Their model shows that sunk export costs lead to persistent trade effects of exchange rate shocks. Irarrazabal and Opromolla (2006) make productivity a stochastic process in a Melitz-type model of trade to explain that firms can leave the export market again after entrance. On the other hand, firm exit from the export market can be due to the fact that firms simply do not have (enough) information about profitability in the export market. The model presented in this paper follows this view. Firms cannot assess the popularity of their good in the export market before they enter the export market. After entrance, the popularity of their good could be too low to produce profitably. An example of this type of exporting uncertainty is the withdrawal of Wal-Mart from the German and South-Korean export market. After a presence of some years on these foreign markets incurring huge losses, Wal-Mart gathered enough information to realize that their ‘product-type’ was not popular enough in these foreign markets. Nguyen (2008) also follows an approach where firms drop out of the export market after they get to know their profitability on the export market. The difference is that in our model firms get to know their profitability by incurring sunk entry costs, whereas in Nguyen (2008) firms get information about their profitability by selling in the foreign market. Below there is a comparison of the approach in Nguyen (2008) and in the current paper. The model in this paper is a firm heterogeneity model (in the spirit of (Melitz 2003)) taking into account exporting uncertainty. There is heterogeneity in the taste parameter (the CES-weight) of a variety instead of in productivity and the taste parameters of the same variety are different in the domestic and exporting market. Firms are uncertain about the popularity of their good, reflected in the taste parameter, before they start producing ánd before they start exporting. Sunk costs have to be paid to learn the popularity of the good both in the domestic and exporting market. The economic literature provides ample evidence for the existence of sunk export costs (See for example (Baldwin and Krugman 1989); (Roberts and Tybout 1997); (Das et al. 2007); (Albarran et al. 2009)). In a survey study of exporting firms in the UK, (Kneller and Pisu 2008) find that firms report market exploration costs as an important barrier to trade. In particular, 26% of the firms that started exporting mention ‘obtaining basic information about an export market’ and 41% mention ‘the marketing costs of doing business in an overseas market’ as a barrier to trade. Hence, sunk export costs consist (partly) of market research costs. Differences in taste parameters have a more natural interpretation than differences in productivity: preferences are different across countries. It is assumed that the taste parameters on the different markets correlate, albeit imperfectly. The correlation between taste parameters is a function of the cultural proximity between countries. Felbermayr and Toubal (2010) show in empirical work that a higher level of cultural proximity leads to higher levels of trade through a larger similarity of preferences.Footnote 2
 The model’s solution contains an additional endogenous variable, the cutoff taste parameter below which a firm does not consider exporting. A firm with a taste parameter above this cutoff value starts exporting but can be unsuccessful when its product is not popular enough on the foreign market. This drives the exporting uncertainty. The model generates three cutoff taste parameters, a domestic cutoff taste parameter, a cutoff taste parameter to start exporting and a cutoff taste parameter to be successful in exporting. The effects of changes in the different types of trade costs display interesting patterns. The effect of lower iceberg trade costs is as expected: the domestic cutoff value increases, whereas both exporting cutoff levels decrease. But the effects of lower sunk export costs and of lower fixed export costs are different on the two exporting cutoff values. Lower sunk export costs decrease the cutoff level to start exporting and raise the cutoff level for successful exporting, whereas lower fixed export costs decrease the cutoff level to start exporting and the cutoff level for successful exporting. The implication is that both lower sunk and fixed export costs lead to a higher probability that a firm will start exporting. But lower sunk export costs decrease the probability of success in the export market, whereas lower fixed export costs raise the probability of successful entry into the export market. The different effect of changes in sunk and fixed export costs on the success rate of exporting can be explained as follows: lower sunk export costs do not affect operational profits from exporting. Therefore, they raise the cutoff level to be successful in exporting to restore the ex ante free entry condition. Still, because of the lower sunk export costs it becomes attractive for more firms to try to start exporting. The result is that more firms start exporting, but the hurdle to be successful is higher. Therefore, the success rate declines. With lower fixed export costs instead the operational profits from exporting rise. Therefore, the cutoff level to be profitable in exporting declines. The cutoff level to start exporting also declines, but the effect on cutoff level for successful exporting is so large that of the larger number of firms that start exporting also more firms will be successful. The different types of trade costs are a function of different types of trade barriers. Therefore, the derived comparative statics have implications for the effect of changing various types of trade barriers. Iceberg trade costs are a function of tariffs and per unit nontariff barriers. Fixed export costs are related to the regulatory burden of trade that appear each period like the costs of complying with customs procedures, acquiring licenses to import. Sunk export costs are a function of the regulatory burden of trade facing an exporter when starting to export, like collecting information on import procedures. The welfare effects of lower trade costs are for all three types of trade costs positive. This is remarkable for a decrease in sunk export costs, as they make entrance into the export market more probable, whereas success in the export market becomes less likely. Hence, more resources are dissipated in the entry process. The welfare effect is still positive, because in a Melitz type of model a higher demand for resources, also if used ‘non-productively,’ is the driving force for a welfare increase. It bids up real wages and squeezes thereby the least productive firms out of the market leading to higher average welfare. The policy conclusion is that programs to stimulate entrepreneurs to focus on foreign markets by helping them in dealing with regulations, procedures and information problems when starting to export do have positive welfare effects. And the welfare effects are also positive if a large fraction of the firms that start exporting do not succeed. This paper contributes to the literature on models with both exporting uncertainty and firm heterogeneity. Crozet et al. (2007) model uncertainty about the political environment to explain that less productive firms who were ‘lucky’ not to face bribes can enter a market whereas certain more productive firms cannot. In the already mentioned work of Irarrazabal and Opromolla (2006) firms’ productivities are a stochastic process. Some exporting firms will have to leave the exporting market because their productivity experienced a negative shock. Finally, there is structural estimation empirical work proving the importance of sunk export costs where firms are heterogeneous and face shocks to various variables (see for example (Roberts and Tybout 1997); (Das et al. 2007)). The paper differentiates itself from these other models by starting from the view that uncertainty is due to a lack of information on exporting profitability. There is ample empirical evidence that both sources of uncertainty, lack of information on, and shocks to, variables affecting profitability are important. Firm level data show that a considerable fraction of exit from the export market is shortly after entry, although estimates differ across studies. Also, not only firms that leave the export market immediately after entrance are support for the approach in this paper. Firms can stay in the market for some years before they know whether their product is popular enough and whether they can be profitable (firms could incur losses in a foreign market for some years until they are convinced they cannot be profitably like the Wal-Mart example mentioned). Moreover, data on duration of detailed export categories show that a large fraction of export flows become zero quickly after entry. This paper is also related to the literature on the role of networks in trade. Rauch and Watson (2003) propose a model where buyers are involved in costly search for potential importers. After being matched with an importer they get to know the cost of the importer. They can either buy a small amount from the importer generating zero surplus or invest a lump-sum amount to get to know whether the importer can process a large order. If the answer is yes a larger surplus from trade can be generated. The model by Rauch and Watson (2003) can also explain a large fraction of exiting firms from the export market soon after entry. The model proposed below is similar. An important difference is that in the model below sellers take the initiative to try and sell a product profitably, whereas in Rauch and Watson (2003) buyers approach possible importers. Another difference is that in the model below, exports will be larger to countries that are culturally closer having more similar preferences, whereas in Rauch and Watson (2003) exports to countries with closer business ties and denser networks will be larger.Footnote 3
 Rauch (1999) dismisses a type of model similar to the one in the present paper where producers produce varieties that are most popular in the home market and their popularity in other markets declines with (cultural) distance. He puts forward two pieces of evidence. First, he shows that a dummy for colonial ties between countries raises trade whereas a dummy for common language has hardly a significant effect. In his reading colonial ties proxy business ties whereas a common language proxies similar tastes. This implies that the empirical evidence supports the network view in his work and dismisses the tastes view in the present paper. But it is disputable whether business ties are exclusively proxied by colonial ties whereas similar tastes are exclusively proxied by common language. A common language also eases business ties and colonial ties are likely to lead to more similar tastes as well as to more intense business ties. Second, he refers to a study by Gould (1994) who finds that immigration into the USA raises bilateral trade with the country of origin of the immigrants. The effect is stronger on exports from the USA than on imports, however, favoring a network view over a shared tastes view. But this evidence does not prove that the shared tastes view is not important. Indeed (Felbermayr and Toubal 2010) use empirical evidence to show that cultural proximity of countries raises trade both because this leads to lower trade costs (implying closer business ties emphasized by (Rauch 1999)) and because it implies more similar tastes. Hence, both channels seem to be important. The work by Nguyen (2008) is similar to the current paper. Nguyen (2008) also proposes a model of firm heterogeneity in popularity with different although correlated popularity across markets. The main difference with the current paper is that in Nguyen (2008) firms learn their popularity in a market by selling one period, whereas in the current paper firms get to know their popularity by incurring sunk entry costs. Two distinct empirical literatures are useful in comparing these two approaches. First, the international management literature on strategies to enter export markets provides support for both approaches. As discussed by Dana (2006) the early literature on exporting strategies stresses the gradual approach to exporting, also dubbed the Uppsala process model. Firms gradually commit more resources to the export market as they acquire experiential knowledge being active in foreign markets. This model of foreign market entry fits into the theory of Nguyen (2008). But some papers cast doubt about the gradual approach and argue that firms move quickly into export markets leapfrogging stages of internationalization by investing large sums of money at the initial stage of entry into the export market, see for example (Hedlund and Kverneland 1985; Millington and Bayliss 1990). Second, several papers provide strong evidence for the existence of sunk costs of exporting, for example (Baldwin and Krugman 1989; Roberts and Tybout 1997; Das et al. 2007). In particular, these papers show that firms exporting in the previous year are much more likely to export the current year, holding constant other factors. This implies that new entrants have lower expected profits than incumbents, because they have to incur sunk costs in their first year of exporting. This empirical finding is difficult to reconcile with a model of learning through exporting without sunk costs like (Nguyen 2008). If firms have correct priors before starting to export, the probability to be in the export market will be independent of export presence in the previous year. Like Nguyen (2008) also Eaton et al. (2008) and Albornoz et al. (2010) propose a model of learning through exporting to provide an explanation for (among others) the fact that a large fraction of exporting firms leaves the exporting market shortly after entry. But the focus of these papers is more on the growth dynamics of exporters after entry. The next section points out preferences, demand, revenues and profits and solves the closed economy model. Section 3 solves the open economy model. Section 4 outlines the effects of changes in different types of trade costs. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.",1

An Introduction,February 2012,Michele Fratianni,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"National currencies tend to dominate foreign currencies as means of exchange partly because the bulk of transactions is local and partly because governments discriminate in favor of the currency they issue. Currency substitution — the replacement of domestic money with a (better) foreign money — is a slow process even when it is permissible. At the international level, where legal restrictions matter much less, national currencies can compete and seek to reach international status. In the search for the preferred currency, transaction costs are one of the most relevant considerations. These costs decline as the transaction domain of a currency expands; call this the network value of money. Currencies that are not widely used have a low network value and are at a competitive disadvantage against widely-used currencies. Once a currency reaches a dominant network value, it may gain from inertia: upcoming currencies, with similarly low transaction costs, may not be able to upstage the dominant currency quickly (Rey 2001). There is some historical evidence that, in the competition for international status, very few monies survive both as international media of exchange and stores of value. The Athenian drachma (the “owl”) was the first world currency; the Byzantine solidus was the unchallenged coin from the fifth to the seventh century; Roberto Lopez (1951) called it the dollar of the Middle Ages. But the international role of the solidus was eventually challenged by the Islamic dinar, which eventually made the cross over. Both remained international monies until the twelfth century. In the thirteenth century, the Italian coins came to prominence: the Genoese genoino, the Florentine fiorino, and the Venetian ducato. The three coins circulated side by side, in a sort of triumvirate, for quite some time (Cipolla 1956). In the 19th century, the British pound became the leading international currency in sympathy with the economic and political power of Britain. British preeminence came to an end after World War I as the United States emerged as the leading nation. The emergence of the dollar as an international money dates to the time of World War I. The essay by Barry Eichengreen and Marc Flandreau (2012:57, in this volume) provides detailed evidence that the market for dollar acceptances came alive by 1915, nudged by the interventions of the Fed. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that “lock-in” effects, generated by network externalities, are not sufficiently strong to prevent the emergence of newcomers, although one is not sure whether the dollar and New York would have been effective challengers, as early as in the 1920s, to the pound and London respectively without the Fed’s helping hand. International currency cross-overs do not lead necessarily to the incumbent currency fading away quickly. After World War I, the pound retained its key-currency status for at least four more decades (Eichengreen 2005). As late as 1965, 20 per cent of official reserves were denominated in pound. Thus, in addition to surmountable “lock-in” effects, there is strong inertia in favor of the incumbent international currency. All of this historical evidence suggests that the world of international currencies is closer to an aristocracy than to a monarchy: the position of the leading currency can be contested, but once a successful challenge has been launched the once leading currency does not fall into oblivion. International-currency status is too broad a generalization. A refinement by functions helps us to understand better differences in contestability and persistence. The now standard taxonomy of the different functions of an international currency, attributable to Cohen (1971), is to invoice internationally traded goods and services, to trade in foreign exchange markets and in its role as the instrument of intervention currency on the part of monetary authorities, to denominate assets held by both monetary authorities and the private sector, and to serve as a reference currency in defining fixed exchange rates. Using this classification system, we can visualize international currencies forming a pyramid (Cohen 2012, in this volume and earlier writings). At the peak sits the top currency, the US dollar, which fulfills all of the above roles dominantly and globally; below are the “patrician” currencies—the euro and the yen—that fulfill the same roles but with less intensity and more at a regional than at a global level, and then on a third tier one finds “elite” currencies –the pound and the Swiss franc—that fulfill only some of the roles with even less intensity. Similar currency pyramids can be constructed for earlier periods. Under the pre-WWI international gold standard, for example, the British pound was the top currency and the French franc and German mark the patrician currencies. What are the benefits of issuing a top international currency? Much of the quantifiable benefit accruing to the United States from the international role of the dollar comes from being the banker of the world (Despres et al. 1966), that is the chief seeker of short-term funds from the rest of the world and the chief source of long-term funds to the rest of the world. In addition to short-term liabilities, the United States can issue fixed-income obligations that are leveraged to effect investments abroad in the form of illiquid foreign direct investments and equities that have great potential for capital gains (Gourinchas and Rey 2005). The sizeable excess rates of return on U.S. assets over U.S. liabilities capture part of the “exorbitant privilege” of having a dominant international currency. But there is more than pecuniary gains. As Benjamin Cohen (2012:13, in this volume) puts it, “…the foundation of monetary power is the capacity to avoid the burden of adjustment required by payments imbalance –an ability to delay adjustment or deflect its costs onto others” (page 18). In other words, the key-currency country is distinct in that it can ignore the external constraint, if not forever for at least a long time. Yet, despite these benefits it is not obvious that countries of patrician or elite currencies are eager to make the additional investment to move up in the currency pyramid ladder. Two historical episodes, one involving Germany and the other Japan, suggest that currency internationalization may be viewed more as a burden than a privilege. In the nineteen seventies and eighties, the Bundesbank repeatedly opposed internationalization of the German mark reasoning that such a process would make the domestic demand for money unstable and put its objective of achieving low inflation rates at risk. In Japan, opposition to the internationalization of the yen (at approximately the same time of German opposition), instead, came from the export sector that feared a loss of competitiveness resulting from an appreciation of the yen. The obvious question is: How can one reconcile the assessments of “privilege” and “burden” associated with the status of a top international currency. The answer may come from a sectoral analysis of the distribution of benefits and costs. The essay by Eric Helleiner and Anton Malkin (2012:33, in this volume) start with the premise that policymaking on currency internationalization “…is influenced not just by calculations of the national (or regional) interest but also by lobbying from specific sectoral groups within issuing jurisdictions who experience these costs and benefits in different ways.” Lobbying efforts, as one would expect, rise as net benefits or net costs rise for a given group. Net benefits from currency internationalization accrue to part of the domestic banking sector (money-center banks) and the traded sector, which enjoys a lower cost of hedging exchange rate risk. On the other hand, a discrete step-up in internationalization, followed by an appreciation of the (internationalized) domestic currency, has a negative impact on the competitiveness of the export sector, which therefore has an incentive to oppose internationalization. Opposition to internationalization comes also from the non-traded sector if domestic goals are perceived to lose relative to currency stability. For example, currency internationalization implies a liberalization of domestic credit markets and the abandonment of credit allocations. Helleiner and Malkin argue that the internationalization of the Chinese yuan finds a serious obstacle, not only in Chinese manufacturing that fears an appreciation of the yuan, but also in the central government that “maintains a firm grip on credit creation and on the ways in which banks make lending decisions…This organization of credit is a key to China’s overall economic growth model…” (page 52). In sum, since there is no assurance that perception of the net benefits of currency internationalization reflect the aggregation of the net benefits of the various sectors of the economy; a “privilege” or a “burden” may be the outcome of different sectoral weights attached to the impact of currency internationalization. Different assessments of “privilege” and “burdens” may be reconciled by the passage of time. What was once a privilege (for the aggregate) can turn into a burden. The financial crisis of 2007–2009 inspired some American authors to reassess the net benefits the United States receives from a global dollar. These authors, whose works are reviewed by Helleiner and Malkin, believe that the time has come for the dollar to pass the baton of international currency leadership to other national currencies or to the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The reasons range from fears that the United States, worried about the deterioration of the international reputation of the dollar, may limit the scope of domestic policy autonomy to an improved quality of fiscal policy achieved by a hardening of the soft external constraint associated with the exorbitant privilege of the dollar. To be sure, there is no indication that such sentiments are shared by US policy makers. But even if they were, there is no national currency ready to replace the US dollar. The euro, the highest ranking patrician currency, has the serious, if not fatal, handicap of not being backed by a political union. Lack of fiscal and political unification in the euro area is exacerbating the current sovereign debt crisis and putting at risk the very existence of the common currency. Japan has neither sufficient economic and political power nor the appetite to see the yen come to the top. The road to complete the yuan internationalization is long and, as we have seen, it is not clear that such a step is in the interest of the Chinese leadership. Absence of good national alternatives to the dollar may be consistent with a hypothesis that a top international currency is a sort of international public good with large fixed costs that can be borne only by dominant nations, where the qualifier dominant encompasses not only economic muscle but also military power. Cohen (2012) notes that economists have traditionally neglected the connection between international money and geopolitics. Yet, a strong presence in the world enhances the formation of global rules of the game, an environment propitious for a dominant international currency. Adam Posen (2008), cited by Cohen, is a proponent of the currency-geopolitics connection: The United States’ political leadership in security, commercial and even cultural affairs globally has a critical impact on the usage of the dollar in the monetary realm. Other governments’ reserve currency holdings and exchange rate management are importantly influenced by security ties, and thus decisions to link to the dollar (and to accumulate dollar reserves for intervention) from Taiwan to Saudi Arabia to Panama depend as much on foreign policy as economics. Private decisions to invest in the United States, both at the corporate level and by individuals, are supported by the desire to gain insider access to key decision-making processes and to membership in transnational elites; in fact, it is this desire for membership and access that is a major source of the financially unrewarding investments made by foreigners in the United States — and thus of the United States’ exorbitant privilege to pay for its current-account deficits in its own currency. The European Union, let alone the euro zone itself, is unable or unwilling to offer these systemic or security benefits beyond a very limited area, and thus is fundamentally limited in its ability to attract currency adherents, despite the success of the euro on its own terms as a currency and store of value. (page 80). Giovanni Pittaluga and Elena Seghezza (2012:89, in this volume) formalize this connection with a model of a political hegemon that substitutes for a supranational authority. The mechanics of their search-theoretic construct is relatively straightforward. There are two countries in the world, trading one good with two national monies. One money, issued by the home country, is used only domestically, and the other, issued by the foreign country, has the potential for becoming international because the foreign country invests in institutions that create and maintain trust in its currency. This trust affects the probability of an exchange of goods for foreign money. Both countries tax exchanges by expropriating, with a given probability, a portion of the money (i.e., seigniorage). The home country taxes only domestic residents, whereas the foreign country taxes both domestic and foreign residents. The larger tax base of the foreign country serves to pay for the public good “international monetary order.” The welfare of the two countries responds positively to consumption and negatively to the relative gains from foreign country’s seigniorage. The authors make the critical assumption that countries care about their relative power position: if the difference in power is small, relative gains from seigniorage matter a lot; conversely, if the difference in power is large, relative gains matter little. Relative power drives the welfare solutions. A foreign hegemon (i.e., a big difference in power) provides large trade opportunities and imposes little disutility on the home country. The foreign country gains as well because its currency is widely used and seigniorage covers the cost of the international public good. As countries become more equal, welfare falls. In an n-country setting, seigniorage would have to be divided among many foreign countries that potentially compete to isssue an international currency, leaving individual amounts that could prove inadequate to pay for the production of trust in international monies. In sum, the benefits of having a dominant currency stem from the ability of the political hegemon to invest in the costly international public good and pay for it by taxing the international community. This is the reason that the euro, according to Pittaluga and Seghezza, is an improbable threat to the dollar. Under the impetus of the G20, the SDRs have come back to life after years of dormancy. In August of 2009, a new allocation of SDRs, equivalent to $250 billion, was distributed. For the G20 and the IMF, SDRs are now expected to play a significant role in strengthening the working of the international monetary system. It is too early to say whether the time has come for the SDR to contend for a position as a top international currency. Michael Bordo and Harold James (2012, in this volume) review the prospects of basket currencies, including the SDRs, to replace existing reserve currencies and conclude that: “The world looks to the dollar because it is the largest and most liquid market of the world, and because of its political security. Almost everyone, including many Americans, agree that the international role of the dollar is a terrible solution to the world’s currency problems. It is just that every alternative is even worse.” (page 126) Yet, the idea of a supranational money, issued and managed by a collection of nations, endures. It is true that the SDRs, in their present form, are neither money nor credit. That form, as Bordo and James remind us, reflects the highly polarized national positions at the time of the creation of that instrument, which was “surrounded by a protective web of regulations” (page 120). The ambiguous nature of the SDRs was facetiously likened to the zebra problem: is the white set on black or the black set on white? It is also true that the reason why SDRs were conceived–a response to the debate on the adequacy of international reserves of the nineteen sixties—is no longer with us. What remains outstanding, however, is the quality of the dollar standard; more on this subject below.",9

Kouretas,Athanasios P. Papadopoulos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since 1997, the Department of Economics of the University of Crete has organized annual international conferences on Macroeconomic Analysis and International Finance. The articles included in this special issue are refereed versions of papers presented at the 16th International Conference on Macroeconomic Analysis and International Finance held at the University Campus, Rethymno 24–26 May 2012 in collaboration with Open Economies Review. The central theme of this conference was Challenges and Risks in the International Monetary System. We open this Special Issue of Open Economies Review with an overview of these papers. In “Systematic and Liquidity Risk in Subprime-Mortgage Backed Securities”, Dungey, Dwyer and Flavin argue that the misevaluation of risk in securitized financial products is central to understanding the financial crisis of 2007–2008. They analyze the evolution of a number of factors that have been shown to have affected collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) based on subprime mortgages. The authors build on a theoretical pricing model under which CDOs can be represented as a three factor model, with common shocks, credit-rating shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. They introduce a fourth factor, the vintage factor, which reflects risks associated with the dates during which securities were created. The authors argue that a key feature of subprime-mortgage backed indices is that they are distinct in their vintage of issuance. Using a latent-factor framework, the authors find that the behavior of subprime-mortgage backed securities was influenced by these four main factors. In 2006, each of those factors has a discernible role in asset returns. The common factor (i.e. a common shock to all markets) becomes more important when the financial turmoil begins; it is found to have a larger effect on AAA tranches than in the pre-crisis period. Dungey, Dwyer and Flavin further examine the common factor’s relationship with observable factors, including real estate prices, the Implied Volatility on the S&P 500 (VIX) index and interest-rate spreads which reflect the financial crisis, and they find that liquidity and counterparty risk, as represented by the spread between the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate, is sufficient to describe the relationship between the common factor and the financial crisis as reflected in interest rate spreads. Moreover, they undertake a counterfactual analysis of the evolution of the common factor under the assumption that the LIBOR-OIS spread had remained at pre-crisis levels throughout. Their estimation leads to the conclusion that the common factor is 20 % lower at the end of 2009 than it would have been if LIBOR-OIS had not been elevated during the financial crisis. Likewise, their estimations show that the actual value of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) index is about 40 % lower and VIX some 50 % higher than in the simulated model with a stable interest-rate spread. The decreases in the common factor, decreases in the REIT index and increases of VIX are the estimated effects of the elevated values of LIBOR-OIS during the crisis, not effects of lower housing prices. In “U.S. Monetary Policy: A View from Macro Theory”, Gavin and Keen address two questions about U.S. monetary policy; First, can monetary policy elevate output when it is below potential? and second, is the zero lower bound on interest rates a trap? They employ a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to answer these two questions. With respect to the first question, their estimates lead them to conclude that monetary policy can increase output when it is below potential, but this effect is only temporary and probably not welfare-enhancing. The answer to the second question is more complicated because it depends on the type of policy adopted by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the authors argue that the outcome also depends on whether the inflation rate or the real interest rate adjusts over the longer run if the policy interest rate is held near zero for an extended period. Finally, they use the Fisher equation to analyze possible outcomes for situations in which the central bank has promised to keep the interest rate near zero for an extended period. Serletis, Istiak and Gogas, in their paper, “Interest Rates, Leverage and Money”, criticize the mainstream approach to the conduct of monetary policy which is based on the New Keynesian model and is expressed in terms of a short-term nominal interest, such as the Federal Funds rate in the United States. The authors argue that the New Keynesian model ignores the role of leverage and downplays the role of money in basic monetary theory and monetary-policy analysis. However, as the Federal Funds rate has now reached the zero lower bound and the Federal Reserve appears to be facing a liquidity trap, the issue of whether there is a useful role of leverage and monetary aggregates in monetary policy and business cycle analysis arises. The authors conclude that there is a need of financial-stability policies to manage the leverage cycle and reduce the procyclicality of the financial system. An additional argument made by the authors is that, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and Great Contraction, there is a need to move from the New Keynesian framework and return to the quantity-theory approach to monetary policy, based on properly measured monetary aggregates, including the approach involving the Divisia-monetary aggragate recently adopted by the new Center for Financial Stability. In “Discretionary Government Consumption, Private Domestic Demand, and Crisis Episodes”, Agnello, Furceri and Sousa analyze the dynamic impact of discretionary government consumption purchases on private demand. These authors deal with three issues. First, they analyze the impact of government consumption shocks on output, consumption and investment in both the short and the medium terms. Second, they present empirical evidence pertaining to those shocks in a large set of advanced and developing economies. Third, they assess the changes in the response of output, consumption and investment to fiscal shocks during periods of crises relative to those responses in non-crisis periods. Their empirical strategy consists of a two-step approach. Using a panel of 132 countries from 1960 to 2008, the authors show that discretionary changes in government consumption lead to crowding-in effects in the short run. However, crowding-out effects take over in the medium run although the crowding-out is never strong enough to offset the overall expansionary impact of government consumption completely. The authors also show that, regardless the type of crisis, crowding-in effects are magnified once the authors control for the extreme events caused by a crisis, and dominate during the first years of the crises. Overall, the results lead to the conclusion that there is a potential trade-off between the short- and medium-term effects of discretionary changes in government consumption during periods of crises. Barnett, Liu, Mattson and van den Noort, in “The New CFS Divisia Monetary Aggregates: Design, Construction, and Data Sources”, extend previous analysis on the design and construction of new Divisia monetary aggregates and the development of the field of aggregation-theoretic monetary aggregation. The authors provide evidence that the components of the Divisia monetary aggregates developed by the authors in association with the CFS—Center for Financial Stability—for the United States closely reflect those of the current and former simple-sum monetary aggregates provided by the Federal Reserve. The first five levels, M1, M2, M2M, MZM, and ALL, are composed of currency, deposit accounts, and money market accounts. The liquid asset extensions to M3, M4-, and M4 resemble (in spirit) the discontinued M3 and L (which is a broadly-defined liquidity monetary-aggregate measure) aggregates, which include repurchase agreements, large denomination time deposits, commercial paper, and Treasury bills. Furthermore, when the Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 and L, the U.S. monetary authority also stopped providing the consolidated, seasonally-adjusted components of M3 and L. In addition, the Fed no longer provides the interest rates on the components of M3 and L. Therefore, the authors argue that because of the lack of the component quantity and interest-rate data, choosing data for the construction of the CFS aggregates has not been easy and has sometimes required regression interpolation. The authors document the current decisions of the CFS regarding United States data sources with particular emphasis on Divisia M3 and M4. In “What Drives Clarity of Central Bank Communication about Inflation?”, Bulir, Cihak and Jansen examine whether the clarity of central bank communication about inflation varies with the economic environment. The analysis is based on the use of readability statistics and content analysis. The authors study the clarity of communication on the inflation outlook for seven central banks across three continents during the past 10 years. The main finding is that there exist significant and persistent differences in clarity over time and across countries. However, they do not succeed in identifying any determinants of clarity that are robustly-relevant across the sample of central banks. Overall, the findings of the analysis suggest that a single model for clarity of central bank communication is not appropriate and, therefore, in studying clarity of communication, country-specific and institution-specific factors are highly relevant and should be employed. In’t Veld, Larch and Vendeweyer, in their paper “Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers: What They Are and What They Do”, provide a new look at the debate about the size and effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilizers in light of the recent global financial crisis. In particular, in the euro area, where monetary policy is centralised and discretionary fiscal policy making is constrained by the EU fiscal rules, knowing the size and the effectiveness of automatic stabilisers is crucial for the making and execution of fiscal policy. While automatic stabilisers are a fairly established concept in the fiscal policy literature, there is still no consensus about their actual nature and their effectiveness. The authors argue that differences in opinion mirror a deeper disagreement over the way the government budget would be constructed if the automatic stabilizers did not exist. The author address this issue by adopting two alternative counterfactual budgets, which give rise to two different conclusions about the extent of automatic stabilisation. The simulation of a structural model provides strong evidence that the degree of smoothing is conditional on the specification of the counterfactual budget. In the final paper of this Special Issue, Vogel, Roeger and Herz, in “The Performance of Simple Fiscal Policy Rules in Monetary Union”, investigate the stabilising potential of simple fiscal-policy rules for a small open economy in monetary union in a two-region DSGE model with nominal and real rigidities. The authors consider a set of simple fiscal instrument rules for government purchases, transfers, and consumption, labor and capital taxes analogous to interest-rate rules employed in the conduct of monetary policy. The main finding of the paper is that a dichotomy exists in the welfare effects of fiscal policy for liquidity-constrained and intertemporally- optimising households, i.e. policies that enhance the welfare of one group tend to reduce the welfare of the other. Furthermore, the moderate average welfare gains from optimal policy contrast with potentially large welfare losses from non-optimal policy. In addition, fiscal policy rules that respond to employment fluctuations may be preferred to fiscal rules responding to indicators of price competitiveness. The authors’ simulations also give emphasis to the crucial impact of the budgetary closure rule on the welfare consequences of fiscal business-cycle stabilisation.

At the same time, inflation rates appear highly synchronized across countries. This observation prompted researchers to argue that international inflation rates are in fact driven by economic forces common to all countries. Whether global inflation dynamics really show signs of being coupled to a global inflation cycle is subject to a number of recent empirical papers. Ciccarelli and Mojon (2010), among others, use a dynamic factor model to study the driving forces behind the apparent comovement of international inflation rates. Based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for 22 OECD countries over the period 1960-2008 they find that indeed almost 70 % of inflation variability is explained by just one common factor driving all inflation series. The remaining share of inflation volatility is due to country-specific determinants. The title of their paper is instructive: “global inflation”. Other papers such as Neely and Rapach (2011) and Mumtaz and Surico (2012), whose contributions will be sketched below, support this view. They even find an increase in the degree of international comovement in inflation since the 1980s. In this paper, we use an alternative empirical model, a dynamic hierarchical factor model recently developed by Moench et al. (2013), to revisit the comovement of inflation over the period 1996-2011.Footnote 1 Our results are striking: rather than being driven by a single global factor, inflation is predominately explained by idiosyncratic determinants. According to our results, “local inflation” is a much better characterization of the evidence than “global inflation”. How do we arrive at this conclusion? We use the dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose CPI inflation rates in a large panel of countries into (i) a global factor common to all inflation series and all countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given sub-section of the CPI, i.e. energy price inflation, food price inflation and CPI inflation net of food and energy items, (iii) a country group factor driving the particular CPI basket in either industrial or emerging economies and (iv) a country-specific component. With its pyramidal structure, the model allows for the possibility that the global factor affects the country-group factor and other subordinated factors but not vice versa. To illustrate this property of our model, consider the emergence of China as a major trading partner of almost all countries in our sample which affected inflation rates around the globe and would be reflected by the global factor. This effect, however, is different across CPI components. While increased competition from Chinese exports dampened core inflation, additional demand from Chinese households and firms might have accelerated global food and energy price inflation, respectively.Footnote 2 Hence, a change in the global factor has a differentiated impact on the alternative CPI type-specific factors. This cannot be captured by conventional dynamic factor models. Using data for industrialized and emerging economies from 1996 to 2011 we establish three core findings: First, with the exception of energy price inflation, about three fourths of inflation volatility is due to country-specific determinants. For CPI inflation net of food and energy, often referred to as a measure of core inflation, the global factor and the factor specific to this CPI sub-basket account for 10 % of the variance in industrialized economies and for less than 1 % in emerging markets. Second, energy price inflation, at least in industrial economies, is indeed dominated by common factors. This suggests that the “global inflation”-findings of the literature mentioned before are an artifact of not allowing for energy price to be driven by a specific factor and the non-hierarchical structure of conventional dynamic factor models. Moreover, determinants specific to industrial or emerging market economies matter most for the dynamics of energy price inflation. Third, about 22 % (16 %) of the variance of food price inflation in industrial (emerging) economies is explained by the global food price factor. Again, however, the bulk of food price inflation is due to idiosyncratic driving forces. This is particularly interesting given recent concerns about accelerating food price inflation caused by “speculative” forces over which a single country has no control. Our contribution is threefold.Footnote 3 First, we apply a novel factor model that explicitly takes account of the hierarchical structure of the data. This allows for global factors to affect CPI basket-specific, country group-specific as well as country-specific factors. The opposite, however, is not possible. Second, we split overall CPI inflation used in other studies into energy price inflation, food price inflation and inflation based on the remaining CPI items. Given the swings in energy and food prices seen over the last decade, it is not an innocuous assumption to restrict these series to be driven by one single global factor. Our model identifies a global energy price and a global food price factor that coexist with a global factor for the remaining CPI items. In our pyramidal structure, all three of these CPI basket-specific factors are potentially driven by a single world factor, while they can affect all subordinated economy group-specific factors belonging to a certain CPI type. Third, we assess whether the inclusion of the Great Recession since mid-2008 changes the pattern of international comovement. Our results question the policy conclusions drawn by Ciccarelli and Mojon (2010) and others, who stress the role of monetary policy coordination for successfully stabilizing idiosyncratic inflation dynamics. In fact, the period between 1984 and 2007, also known as the Great Moderation, saw an unprecedented convergence towards a consensus view on monetary policy. According to this paradigm, monetary policy should aim at keeping inflation low and stable by appropriately steering the short-term nominal interest rate. Often this view was implemented by pursuing a medium-term numerical inflation objective. Although cross-country differences in the definition of price stability and the weights attached to conflicting policy objectives remained, the importance of stable prices was widely acknowledged. If there is less comovement in inflation than previously thought, either the monetary policy stance across countries was less homogenous or shocks were less global in nature than previously thought. Our results stress the primary responsibility of domestic monetary policy for controlling domestic inflation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the recent literature on international inflation dynamics in dynamic factor models. Section 3 introduces our dynamic hierarchical factor model and presents the data set. The main results are reported in Section 4. In Section 5 we analyze the robustness of our findings. The impact of the Great Recession on the synchronization of inflation rates is evaluated in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.",23

26.0,3.0,Open Economies Review,07 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-015-9348-x,Financial Stress Indices and Financial Crises,July 2015,Robert Vermeulen,Marco Hoeberichts,Jakob de Haan,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Financial crises have been around since the development of money and financial markets. They come in different forms: banking crises, sovereign debt crises, and currency crises. The costs of financial crises in terms of output lost and fiscal costs are very high. Laeven and Valencia (2013) estimate the output loss of banking crises in advanced countries at 32 % of trend income and the fiscal costs at 4 % of GDP. Policy makers therefore try to prevent financial crises using several instruments to monitor financial stability, including financial stress indices. The general aim of a financial stress index (FSI) is “to measure the current state of instability, i.e., the current level of frictions, stresses and strains (or the absence thereof) in the financial system and to summarize it in a single (usually continuous) statistic” (Holló et al. 2012: 4). According to Balakrishnan et al. (2011: 44) “an episode of financial stress is defined as a period when the financial system is under strain and its ability to intermediate is impaired. Financial stress tends to be associated with at least four fundamental characteristics: large shifts in asset prices, an abrupt increase in risk and/or uncertainty, liquidity droughts, and concerns about the health of the banking system. The events affecting financial market conditions can be varied and have external or domestic origins, such as risk-reassessments of investors, changes in such events shape the supply or demand of funds in financial markets—and therefore asset prices—and may thereby afflict multiple segments of the financial system.” Similarly, Hakkio and Keeton (2009) refer to increased uncertainty about the fundamental value of assets, increased uncertainty about behaviour of other investors, increased asymmetry of information, decreased willingness to hold risky assets, and decreased willingness to hold illiquid assets in describing financial stress. Financial stress indices are widely used by policymakers as an instrument for monitoring financial stability. As Kliesen et al. (2012: 371) argue: “FSIs try to monitor financial instability by creating a time series of values in which increases indicate the increased likelihood of a crisis.” According to Oet et al. (2012: 2), such a “monitoring instrument may specifically support the ability to intelligently observe systemic risk and to continuously assess financial system conditions. This tool would enable the public to observe drivers of stress in the financial system, and—by providing alerts—help to diffuse the information uncertainty and give the risk managers time to counteract.” Several papers have come up with a FSI, be it for one country (e.g., Illing and Liu 2006) or for several countries (e.g., Cardarelli et al. 2011). Another strand of academic research has come up with early warning models for financial crises, which aim to provide policy makers with signals about upcoming financial crises (see Babecký et al. 2013 and references cited therein). Most research on early warning models uses crises dummies as dependent variable (Kauko 2014). However, financial crises occur at low frequency in industrial countries, which makes it hard to examine regularities. Therefore, a FSI can be used as left-hand side variable in an early warning model (instead of a crisis dummy). This paper examines the relationship between financial stress indices and financial crises for a sample of 28 OECD countries using a new FSI and a novel database of financial crises, which is constructed based on influential academic papers and cross-checked with the input of national experts (cf. Babecký et al. 2014). So far, only limited attention has been given to this issue. This is remarkable as the usage of FSIs as policy instrument to monitor financial stability or as dependent variable in early warning models presumes that FSIs are related to financial crises (Kliesen et al. 2012). As will be discussed more extensively in Section 2, only three studies (Illing and Liu 2006; Morales and Estrada 2010; Louzis and Vouldis 2013) have examined this issue. Whereas previous studies are all based on one country, we use a multi-country framework. As pointed out by Claessens (2009), single-country studies suffer from the problem that there are only a few financial crisis periods. As pointed out above, a financial stress index measures the current state of stress in the financial system by combining several indicators of stress into a single statistic. In constructing our financial stress index for 28 OECD countries, we use four criteria: the index should cover the entire financial system and indicators included should be available for many countries for a long period at a quarterly frequency, be comparable, and be related to financial crisis in line with theoretical expectations. Our results suggest that even though our FSI is clearly related to the occurrence of crises, there is only a very weak relationship between the FSI and the onset of a crisis, notably the onset of a banking crisis. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 offers an overview of the by now large literature on stress indices, their usage and limitations. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 examines the relationship between our FSI and financial crises. Section 5 offers our conclusion.",39

(2009) approaching the analysis from a panel perspective. From this vast literature, a consensus has formed on broadly the most important factors regarding bank profitability, focusing on bank- or industry-specific factors, or the broader macroeconomic conditions prevailing in a country. Arrayed against this literature is a relatively more recent foray by some authors into researching country-level institutional factors that may drive bank profitability. Papers such as Beck and Levine (2005), Akitoby and Stratmann (2010), and Beltratti and Stulz (2012) argue for the powerful influence of various institutions on the path of financial sector development, as well as affecting the outcomes generated by financial institutions. This research on institutions and profitability has thus far concentrated on either single countries (such as Athanasoglou et al. (2008) on Greece and Dietrich and Wanzenried (2011) on Switzerland) or on widely dispersed and heterogeneous samples, as with Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2004), who examine banks from 72 countries over the period from 1995 to 1999. However, the impact of institutions on profitability may be different in a particular set of countries vis a vis another group. For example, in developed countries such as the US or Singapore, the institutional environment may be less important for banking performance, mainly due to the fact that the institutions in these countries are very stable (one of the traits comprising an “institution” being this notion of semi-permanence). But what of other countries, where the institutional framework is either incipient or in a state of flux? What if the institutional framework is merely two decades old and still has not attained levels seen in Canada or Australia? This scenario is precisely the case in the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU), which have put in place broader market frameworks in a comparatively shorter period of time. Even given their heterogeneous nature after 25 years of transition, these countries continue to share the experience of recent systemic reform in both the broader economy and specifically in reference to financial sector institutions (Hartwell 2013). Bank reform itself was part of the institutional transition, and a significant factor in driving individual bank profitability in the years following macroeconomic stabilization (Brissimis et al. 2008). But beyond bank-specific reforms, did the broader institutional environment in transition have a larger impact than in the OECD countries on bank profitability? How did progress in systemic institutional change, the core of transition, translate into bank performance? This question is particularly salient given the recent global financial crisis, which was mostly grown in developed countries and then imported into emerging markets (including transition economies) via trade and financial sector channels. It is possible that institutional development was even more crucial to the performance of bank profitability in transition economies during the crisis, explaining the differential effects of the crisis on bank profitability across the transition space (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4). Indeed, there was considerable variation across banks in transition, with Polish banks showing higher levels of profitability than their Czech counterparts even in the crisis years. In the Balkans, Bulgaria’s banks never recovered from the crisis, as evidenced by their latest banking crisis in September 2014, while further east, Ukrainian banks, never very profitable in the aggregate, were also badly hit by the financial crisis. Given these different trajectories, the hypothesis that transition economies that had moved much further in broader institutional reforms would have more profitable banks, even during the crisis, seems eminently plausible. Average bank profitability in the Czech Republic, 2006–2012 Average bank profitability in Poland, 2006–2012 Average bank profitability in Bulgaria, 2006–2012 Average bank profitability in Ukraine, 2006–2012 The purpose of this paper is to test this hypothesis and to examine the performance of banks in transition during the global financial crisis and immediately thereafter. I argue that bank performance can be understood as a function of a country’s underlying institutional structure, which may have been crucial in helping banks in transition weather the deluge; in particular, I examine whether and how contracting institutions (property rights) and political representation (democratic accountability) impacted bank profitability in transition during this time. The results presented below find, in contrast to Beltratti and Stulz’s (2012) findings, that investor-specific property rights were important for all countries, but were most significant for bank profitability during the crisis. Additionally, greater levels of democracy appear to be correlated with lower bank profitability, an effect that is related to the ability of interest groups to influence the pace of reform. This paper makes a novel contribution to the literature in three ways: first, this paper applies proven methodologies specifically to the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU). This is therefore the first study examining bank profitability in transition after a major crisis, a fact that helps differentiate it from such papers as Fang et al. (2014), which focuses on bank risk up to the crisis (1997–2008).Footnote 1 Secondly, the frontier of knowledge on institutions, and in particular in quantitative institutional economics, has been pushed outward in recent years (see Hartwell 2013), meaning that we have much more accurate (or at least complete) ways to quantify institutional development. This paper makes use of these innovative indicators in a manner heretofore unexplored in the literature. Finally, earlier studies on bank profitability have failed to incorporate model uncertainty into their analysis, an issue given the possibly large set of variables that can influence banking performance. This paper is the first to my knowledge to utilize Bayesian methods to discern a “correct” model of bank profitability in transition during a crisis. The paper is organized as follows: the next section provides an overview of the theoretical basis for institution affecting bank profitability in transition, as well as an overview of some of the previous literature in this area. Section III outlines the data and empirical strategy for testing these relationships, while Section IV examines the results and performs a large number of robustness tests to check the validity of these outcomes. Section V concludes with some policy implications for banks and policymakers.",8

Turnovsky,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The last three decades have been a period of dramatic trade liberalization. This has primarily taken the form of a steady reduction in tariffs, accompanied by declining non-tariff barriers, particularly by developing economies. These developments have been associated with an increase in inequality, as Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) have documented in detail. As these authors have also discussed, due in large part to data limitations, empirical studies have been restricted almost entirely to wage inequality, focusing in particular on the rising wage differential associated with the skill premium. Clearly the consequences of trade liberalization for distributional issues are important. In this paper we address the effects of tariff reduction on both the level of activity and broader measures of income inequality in a neoclassical growth model of an open economy, in which heterogeneous agents accumulate physical capital as well as internationally traded bonds. In a general setup in which aggregate quantities and their distributions across individuals are simultaneously determined, the analysis of their joint responses to a policy change such as a tariff reduction becomes intractable; see e.g., Sorger (2000).Footnote 1 However, if one adopts the prevalent assumption throughout much of contemporary growth theory – specifically, the homogeneity of the underlying utility function – we can exploit the aggregation results due to Gorman (1953), thereby rendering the problem tractable. Under this assumption the macroeconomic equilibrium and distribution are determined sequentially. First, summing over individuals leads to a macroeconomic equilibrium in which aggregate quantities are determined independently of any distributional measures. This equilibrium structure has led Caselli and Ventura (2000) to characterize the resulting distribution as a “representative agent theory of distribution”. But the tractability of the aggregation also depends upon the source of the agents’ heterogeneity, which we take to be their initial endowments of physical capital and internationally traded bonds. In general, endowments are a key source of inequality, as Piketty (2011) and others have recently stressed, and in this international context, agents’ initial endowments of the two assets seem the most relevant. Having determined the macroeconomic equilibrium, we then derive the time path for relative wealth across agents, which we can then transform to a measure of wealth inequality. The dynamics of this measure depend on agents’ relative labor supplies along the transitional path, and the consequences for the differential savings rates across the distribution of the heterogeneous agents. Finally, the evolution of income inequality is then determined by the interaction of the evolving wealth distribution with the changing share of income from wealth in total personal income. Using this framework, we first derive a number of theoretical implications, linking the effects of tariffs on economic activity and inequality. It is straightforward to show that in the long run, a reduction in the tariff on the imported consumption good increases output, employment, capital, and wealth all in the same proportions, which depend upon the degree of openness of the economy in the commodities market. To the extent that the labor supply increases during the transition (in contrast to completely adjusting on impact) this will tend to reduce wealth inequality. In addition to this effect, income inequality is likely to increase due to a reduction in the aggregate consumption expenditure-wealth ratio, and the fact that the rich save relatively more (consume relatively less) than do the poor. A key factor influencing the impact of tariffs on distribution concerns the speed with which the tariff reduction is implemented. This is important, since in practice there is substantial variation in the rate at which trade liberalizations have proceeded.Footnote 2 We consider two scenarios. In the first, the tariff reduction is completed instantaneously, and we compare this to the alternative case where it is implemented gradually over time. While the time path affects only the transitional path of the aggregate variables, it has not only transitional but also permanent consequences for both wealth and income inequality. We find that a gradual reduction in the tariff rate intensifies the effects on wealth inequality, and reduces them on income inequality. This is due to its effect on expectations that people form regarding the future levels of tariffs and labor supply as the economy grows. Because of the complexity of the model, it is necessary to conduct the dynamic analysis using numerical simulations. In calibrating the model, our intent is to set parameters so as to approximate a plausible initial equilibrium structure that will facilitate our understanding of the channels through which tariffs influence the equilibrium, rather than to replicate any specific economic episode. In particular, we assume an initial average tariff rate of 10 %, which approximates the average tariff rate in 1990 of the 45 countries in the Forbes (2000) sample. Starting from that point, we consider both the instantaneous and the gradual elimination of the tariff. In either case we find that in the long run, output and the aggregate capital stock increase by about 2-3 %, depending upon parameter values. In contrast, wealth inequality declines by under 1 % if the tariff elimination is completed immediately, and by about 1.5–3 % if implemented gradually. The comparable changes for income inequality are increases of 2–4 % and 1-2 %, respectively. Studies investigating the impact of tariffs on the aggregate economy date back to Mundell (1961). His analysis and its earliest extensions were static, employing some variant of the Mundell-Fleming model; see e.g., Boyer (1977), Chan (1978), Krugman (1982). The initial analysis of tariffs in a dynamic framework was Eichengreen (1981) who, using a currency substitution model, emphasized the intertemporal tradeoffs imposed by a tariff. Subsequent analyses by Sen and Turnovsky (1989), Gardner and Kimbrough (1989), Engel and Kletzer (1990), have analyzed tariffs in the context of a macrodynamic model based on intertemporal optimization. More recently, Fender and Yip (2000) and Hwang and Turnovsky (2013) analyze the effects of tariffs in the two-country “new open economy model” pioneered by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, 2000).Footnote 3 All of this literature has assumed homogeneous agents (or cohorts), and hence none of these studies address the distributional consequences of tariff policy. As already noted, over recent years, there has been a growing literature exploring the relationship between trade liberalization policies and inequality, yielding a range of results. For example, Savvides (1998) finds that among less developed countries, more open economies experienced increased income inequality during the late 1980s. However, he found that trade policy has had no effect on income inequality in developed countries. At the same time, Harrison and Hanson (1999) find that trade reform has increased wage inequality for the case of Mexico, which contradicts the prediction by the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Likewise, Beyer et al. (1999) show that for the Chilean economy, openness widens the wage gap between unskilled and skilled workers, which in turn raises income inequality. Milanovic and Squire (2005) find that tariff reduction is associated with more wage inequality in poorer countries, while the reverse applies in richer countries. Bourguignon and Morrison (1990) analyze the relationship between income distribution and foreign trade in developing economies. They find that endowments in mineral resources, foreign trade distortions as well as secondary schooling are major determinants of differences in income inequality across developing countries. Furthermore, they show that protectionism seems to increase income inequality. Edwards (1997) presents a similar argument. Using data from Deininger and Squire (1997), he shows that the correlation between trade distortions and inequality is positive although not strongly statistically significant. His analysis seems to be robust to different measures of trade openness despite the data limitations. In contrast, Stewart and Berry (2000) claim that liberalization has increased income inequality within nations. They point out that countries’ initial conditions and their policy setups play a significant role in how liberalization affects income inequality. They explain that if a country has a high-skilled labor force, then income inequality may be alleviated. However, as is the case of most middle-income countries, if there is concentration of a factor of production that is intensively used and the labor force is not high-skilled, then these countries show a sharp worsening in income distribution. Finally, in a recent paper Lim and McNelis (2014) use a panel to estimate the impact of trade-openness and other controllers on the income Gini coefficient. They find a non-monotonic behavior that depends upon the level of development of the country, analogous to that proposed in Kuznets’ (1955) seminal contribution. With few exceptions the existing literature focuses on the political economy aspects of trade liberalization rather than the explicit role of tariff reduction, as is the focus here.Footnote 4
 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the analytical framework, while Section 3 derives and characterizes the macroeconomic equilibrium. Section 4 characterizes the distributions of wealth, and income, and derives the main analytical results. Sections 5 and 6 illustrates these results with numerical simulations describing the effects of the elimination of tariffs. Section 7 concludes, while technical details are presented in Appendix A and B.",3

Mallick,Mohammed Mohsin,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper evaluates the real effects of inflationary shocks in an economy at both theoretical and empirical levels. We address this issue from three directions. First, the paper provides empirical evidence from Canada, the UK and the US, that inflation negatively affects consumption (both durable and non-durable) and income, and positively influences the current account balance in each country. Our country selection is mainly based on availability of long high frequency time series data on aggregate durables and non-durables consumption. Using the standard correlation coefficients and estimating the impulse response functions from a structural vector error-correction (SVEC) model, we claim that these relationships are valid in the long run, except the current account balance which appears insignificant in case of Canada with a negative sign. Second, the paper attempts to provide a plausible theoretical explanation by augmenting a standard Ramsey type monetary growth model with durable and non-durable consumption that could potentially explain those empirical facts. Third, following Uhlig (2005), we further estimate impulse response functions by imposing sign restrictions as suggested in our simple model. The impulse response functions from the sign-restriction based structural VAR models in fact strengthen our initial empirical observations. Since a time-invariant VAR may not identify a possible regime shift (or an unconditional mean shift), we assessed the impact of unanticipated shocks by employing the time-varying SVAR methodology in Primiceri (2005). The results however remain consistent across different methods. Using seasonally adjusted HP-filtered quarterly data, the correlation coefficient between US inflation and real consumption of durable and non-durable goods is found to be −0.29 and −0.21 respectively. Similarly, real output is negatively correlated with inflation with the estimated coefficient of −0.23. The US real current account balance and inflation, on the contrary, are positively correlated with a coefficient of 0.34. In the UK and Canada, we find similar correlation coefficients of −0.48 and −0.26 between inflation and durables respectively. For all other macro variables in Canada and the UK, the coefficients are in the similar vein. Correlation coefficients with lags ranging from 0 to 10 are good representations of short run effects. To trace the effects of inflation on any individual variable over the longer time horizon, we estimate the impulse response functions within a structural vector autoregressive setup. The estimates reveal that in the long run inflation negatively drives output and the consumption of durable and non-durable goods. Current account is positively affected by inflation in the long run. From the impulse response functions it is also clear that consumption of durable goods tends to be more sensitive than non-durable consumption to inflationary shocks during the early adjustment transitional period. We propose a simple optimizing model of a small open economy that is consistent with these empirical phenomena. In our model economy, output is produced with a Ricardian production function. Output could be used as non-durable goods or could be transformed into durable goods with linear technology. The representative household can make labor-leisure decisions and consumes both durable and non-durable goods. We further assume that households face a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint on their consumption expenditures. Under this setup it is shown that a higher inflation would lead to lower steady state level of consumption of both goods and the stock of durables. The reason is that with a CIA constraint on consumption expenditure, higher inflation increases the opportunity cost of holding real balances. This in fact will increase the relative price of both goods compared to leisure. Also, on impact, there is a very large substitution of leisure for consumption, and a substantial decrease in labor input. This decrease in labor will lower the long run output level in the economy. The net foreign asset position of the country will improve during the transitional period. In addition, following Uhlig (2005), we have also estimated structural VAR models by imposing sign restrictions as obtained in our model. Imposing sign restrictions for model identification put the model for empirical validity. The estimated impulse response functions from these structural VAR models (including time-varying SVAR) are very much consistent with our initial claims. The study is motivated by certain empirical observations and theoretical developments in the literature. Durables and semi-durables make up about 20 % of total consumption expenditures in industrial countries, and durable goods are known to be a big part of the business cycles, yet most of the intertemporal optimizing (open economy) models incorporated mainly non-durable goods, and a few with only durable goods. Many researchers reported that durable goods exhibit initial excess volatility in response to monetary shocks. For example, De Gregorio, et al.(1998) pointed out that in Chile, Israel, Argentina expenditure on durable goods more than doubled from the beginning of the (stabilization) programme to the year in which consumption peaked, while total consumption increased by only 25 % to 30 %. In the context of a closed economy, the excess volatility in durable consumption has also drawn significant attention among researchers. Especially it has been recognized that residential investment (including investment in other consumer durables) leads investment over the business cycle. Though it is well documented that these two sectors co-move positively over the business cycle,Footnote 1 real business cycle (RBC) researchers are often less successful to account for the different investment dynamics. With vector autoregression (VAR) analysis, Erceg and Levin (2006) documented the effects of external shocks across the two sectors of the economy. In US quarterly data, they found that the durable goods sector is much more interest-sensitive (roughly five times as large) than the non-durable sector. We also intend to examine this sector specific sensitivity following inflationary shocks in a small open economy framework. The introduction of durable goods in a standard optimizing framework allows for a more realistic evaluation of the effects of monetary policies. In the asset pricing literature, the important references include Dunn and Singleton (1986), Ferson and Constantinides (1991) and Heaton (1995). Mankiw (1987) incorporates consumer durables along with non-durables in the neoclassical growth model in an attempt to examine the dynamic impacts of fiscal policies on real interest rates in a closed economy setup. Interestingly, there is no significant attempt in the open economy macroeconomic literature that offers an optimizing model with both durable and non-durable consumption to examine the implications of monetary policies. This paper intends to fill these gaps. Our finding have other interesting implications as well. The non-neutral and negative effects of inflation on real growth are cornerstones in many economic models in the asset pricing literature that propose a negative co-movement of stock prices and expected inflation. A negative response of long-run real growth to inflation produces positive inflation premium. This makes long-term nominal bonds risky, and is viewed as one of the leading economic explanations for a positive slope of the nominal term structure in the data. See e.g. Piazzesi and Schneider (2006), Hasseltoft (2012), Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013) and others who provide empirical evidence for this channel for a single non-durable consumption good. Recently, Eraker, Shaliastovich, and Wang (2014) extended the literature in the context of durable consumption as well. They also showed that the negative correlation between inflation and consumption is highly pronounced when consumption goods exhibit durability.Footnote 2 Though, these papers focus exclusively on asset prices, which is different from this study, our findings seem very useful. The paper is organized as follows. Our empirical findings are documented in section 2. Section 3 develops an open economy model to explain the empirics. In section 4 we evaluate the empirical validity of our model through the sign VAR approach as proposed by Uhlig (2005) and the time-varying SVAR due to Primiceri (2005), followed by concluding remarks in Section 5.",23

We show this feature both for the group of Eurozone countries and a group of industrialized countries outside the Eurozone. Table 1 presents the bilateral correlations of the business cycle components of GDP in the Eurozone. The business cycle component is obtained by using a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter on GDP data. We apply a similar procedure for the group on industrial countries outside the Eurozone. It is striking to find how high these correlation coefficients are. This is especially the case within the Eurozone were we find many correlation coefficients of the business cycle components exceeding 0.9. On average we find that this correlation coefficient is 0.82, suggesting a very high degree of synchronization of the business cycles within the Eurozone. This is confirmed in Fig. 1 showing the evolution of the business cycle components of GDP growth in the Eurozone. This clearly shows that Eurozone countries have experienced more or less the same business cycle movements since 1995. If there is a difference between these countries it is to be found in the amplitude of the business cycle movements (see De Grauwe and Ji 2016 for an analysis of the implications of these different amplitudes). We are aware of the fact that measuring business cycles is fraught with difficulties (see Giannone et al. 2008). However, our findings are consistent with others (see de Haan et al. 2008; Belke et al. 2016). Business cycle components of GDP growth. Source: De Grauwe and Ji (2016) Outside the Eurozone we observe smaller bilateral correlations of the business cycles than in the Eurozone. However, these correlations can still be called quite high. They often reach levels of 0.6 or more. Poland stands out as the only country with negative correlations. The average of all the correlation coefficients in Table 2 is 0.61. Thus it appears that in the group of industrial countries outside the Eurozone business cycles are also quite synchronized. There exists empirical evidence that the degree of synchronization of the business cycles is influenced by the degree of trade integration. Frankel and Rose (1998) found that increasing trade integration leads to more synchronization of the business cycles. This has been confirmed by other empirical studies (see Artis and Cleays 2005; Bordo and Helbling 2004). Trade integration is one explanatory factor, but it does not explain everything. This is made clear by Figs. 2 and 3 which plot the bilateral correlation coefficients obtained from Tables 1 and 2 with the bilateral trade flows (as a percent of the sum of the GDPs of the pairs of countries involved). We observe that there is a positive relation between the degree of bilateral trade integration and bilateral correlations. This relation, however, is weak and explains only a small fraction of the variation in the bilateral correlations. Clearly there are other mechanisms at work driving the synchronization of business cycles. It is the intention of this paper to uncover these other mechanisms. Correlation of business cycle and trade links in 11 Eurozone countries. Source: authors’ own estimation using data from OECD and IMF, direction of trade Correlation of business cycle and trade links in 12 stand-alone countries. Source: authors’ own estimation using data from OECD and IMF, direction of trade Mainstream macroeconomic models (both real business cycle models and DSGE models) have found it difficult to replicate the observed high synchronization of business cycles in the industrialized world. This problem was first pointed out by Backus et al. (1992) who found that standard open economy versions of real business cycle models could not explain the high level of synchronization of the business cycles across countries (see also Canova and Dellas 1993). Open economy versions of DSGE-models have experienced the same problem (see Kollmann 1995; Alpanda and Aysun 2014). Of course one can solve these problems in these models by assuming high positive correlations of exogenous shocks. But this is not really an explanation as it forces the designers of these models to admit that high correlations of the business cycles across countries are produced outside their models. This is not a very satisfactory analysis. There have been attempts to explain the high synchronization of the business cycles across countries by introducing financial integration in the models (see e.g. Stockman and Tesar 1995; Gertler et al. 2007; Devereux and Yetman 2010; Kollmann, et al. 2012; Alpanda and Aysun 2014). This goes some way in explaining this synchronization. But again too much is “explained” by introducing highly correlated exogenous financial shocks (see Rey 2014). In this paper we want to go further. We want to analyze the mechanism through which business cycles are synchronized across countries that trade with each other. We will do this using a behavioral macroeconomic model similar to De Grauwe (2012) but in a two-county setting. We will show that the transmission of business cycle movements is made possible by a dynamics that leads to correlation of “animal spirits” across countries. We will develop this model in the context of two different monetary regimes. The first one is a monetary union between the two countries. The second one assumes two “standalone” countries each one with their own central bank. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a two-country version of our behavioral macroeconomic model. Section 3 discusses the solutions of this model and sections 4 uses the model to analyze the factors that affect the international synchronization of the business cycles. Section 5 presents empirical evidence and section 6 concludes.",24

Bilateral trade flow values are studied by good. Trade flows will be reported according to some product classification, so a good will be a code of the product classification at its maximum level of disaggregation. The goods are ordered by their traded value at the beginning of the study period. To avoid dependence on the choice of the base year, the traded value is averaged over 3 years. Subsequently, the ordered products are cumulated into 10 bins, each representing 10% of the total value of exports from country m to country n in the base year. These 10 sets of goods do not change throughout the sample period. The key to the KR methodology is to observe the evolution and final level of the trade share of the first bin, i.e. the set of least traded goods. This is the new goods margin, comprising both goods with zero trade value and goods with a small, but positive trade value. The least traded goods set comprises the vast majority of goods (codes) of the product classification. The ordering of goods means that it successively takes fewer goods to fill a bin with 10% of the traded value. These subsequent bins contain goods with a significant volume of trade in the base year and can be understood as the intensive margin of trade, although KR do not pay them much attention. Dalton (2017) applies the KR methodology to the trade between Austria and the ten new entrants to the EU in 2004. He uses Eurostat’s Comext data (see Eurostat 2016). Comext provides trade data at the 8-digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) level, a European product classification based on the international 6-digit Harmonized System (HS). The 8-digit CN classification cannot be used due to its continuous and numerous changes, so the 6-digit HS, used by Dalton, is arguably the best choice. The HS product classification comprises approximately 5000 categories at the 6-digit level. The sample period is 1999–2009, therefore goods are ordered according to their average trade over 1999–2001, but the goods that comprise each of the 10 bins are defined according to 1999 data. Dalton first analyses exports flows from Austria to the ten EU entrants and then repeats the analysis with imports flows to Austria. He pays special attention to four of its border countries, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. Two aspects of Dalton’s results caught my attention when I read the paper. First, looking at the bar plots used to illustrate the changes in the distribution of trade value among the 10 bins (as in KR; see Fig. 1 below in this paper), I was relatively surprised with the major growth in the trade share of the new goods margin in all cases. At the same time, the bins representing the intensive margin of trade (and especially the bin comprising the top products) showed a reduction in their trade shares, approaching zero in some cases. That is, the role of the new goods margin appeared to be inflated, while the role of the intensive margin seemed to be deflated. In fact, these results reported by Dalton (2017) are different to those obtained by the same author in a previous version of the paper (Dalton 2013; not cited in the final version). However, so long as Dalton (2013) is based on trade data reported at a less disaggregated level (4-digit Standard International Trade Classification revision 2, comprising 786 codes), the discrepancy would be justified. The second aspect that caught my attention was the number of goods in the bar plots. Summing the number of goods in the 10 bins gives the ‘theoretical’ number of goods, 7385. Is this a plausible number of HS codes? No, it is not, and this issue made me wonder whether Dalton might have mixed different versions of the HS. The HS product classification was developed and is maintained by the World Customs Union (WCU), and is updated every 5–6 years. In Dalton’s sample period (1999–2009), three different HS versions were successively in use: the 1996 HS (comprising 5113 6-digit codes), 2002 HS (5224) and 2007 HS (5052). So the number of products reported by Dalton does not match any single HS version. Would it be the case if the three different HS versions were mixed into one? No, it would not either. The amendments introduced with each revision suppose a change in a certain number of codes, which receive a new code. Approximately 10% of the HS codes change in every HS revision (see Yu 2008). Using the correlation tables between HS editions provided by the WCU, or the update of CN codes tables provided by Eurostat through its metadata server ‘RAMON’,Footnote 1 the number of different HS codes comprising the ‘mixed HS’ can be determined, giving a figure of 5709 codes. This figure is still far from the number of goods apparently used by Dalton, 7385. The presence of alphanumeric codes would fill the gap. Comext data reports some trade flows with alphanumeric codes. Eurostat (2016) explains that alphanumeric codes are mainly used to identify confidential or adjusted data, or when the classification of the trade flow at the maximum level of disaggregation is not possible due to some allowed simplified declaration.Footnote 2 For instance, code 85SSS7 (precisely the most important alphanumeric code in the present study case) refers to some electrical machinery that cannot be associated with a complete 6-digit HS for reasons of confidentiality. As long as these codes cannot be perfectly tracked by the researcher, the usual practice is to discard them. However, if this is not the case, the alphanumeric codes have to be counted to determine the theoretical number of goods in the exercise. Analysing Austrian import and export flows with the ten EU new entrants as a whole, there are 113 different alphanumeric codes in the period 1999–2009. I replicate Dalton’s (2017) results using the mixed HS classification without discarding alphanumeric codes. The theoretical number of goods is then 5709 + 113 = 5822. Tables 1 and 2 shows the trade share evolution of least traded products for Austrian exports and imports with the ten new entrants to the EU. These tables almost identically reproduce Tables 1 and 2 in Dalton’s paper. Therefore, Dalton used a mixed HS product classification (mixing three different versions of the HS, 1996, 2002 and 2007), and did not purge the alphanumeric codes. The theoretical number of products deduced from Dalton’s paper (7385) does not have much sense in my opinion. The present paper would not be worth the trouble, however, if only the theoretical number of goods were questionable. The key issue is that mixing different versions of the HS product classification leads to overestimating the new goods margin. When different HS versions are merged into one, the new codes introduced in later versions will have nil associated trade in the earlier years. This means that trade flows classified using the new codes will spuriously form part of the least traded goods. This distortion is especially serious when the shifted codes include some of the most important trade flows. Let us see a specific, very clear-cut example to illustrate this point. In Austrian exports to Slovakia, 1996 HS code 271000 (which comprises several petroleum products) represents the largest traded value in the period 1999–2001. In the 2002 revision of the HS, code 271000 is split into four new codes (271011, 271019, 271091 and 271099). When yearly Comext data (with each yearly dataset classified according to the corresponding HS version) is merged into a single dataset in order to apply the KR methodology, the four new codes will have nil value in the period 1999–2001 and will form part of the first 10% bin, whereas the former code will form part of the intensive margin of trade (in fact, it will be in the top 10% bin), and will have nil value in 2002 and afterwards. The new products margin is then spuriously inflated and the intensive margin of trade is deflated. This issue explains Fig. 3 in Dalton’s paper, concerning Austrian exports to Slovakia (see my reproduction in Fig. 1). Composition of exports: Austria to Slovakia (comparison of product classifications) It is also worth noting that the application of the KR methodology to the specific sample period 1999–2009 highlights the problem. Using the averaged traded valued over the period 1999–2001 is truly unfortunate, because a HS revision took place in 2002. Another averaging period would mitigate the problem, although the dysfunction of using an inconsistent product classification would still remain, of course. Furthermore, the spurious increase in the trade share of the least traded products in 2002 leads Dalton to make some comments about the timing of the impact of EU enlargement that are somewhat questionable (see Figs. 5 and 10 and the last paragraph of Section 3.1 in Dalton 2017).",2

Benefits include reduced exchange rate volatility, trade uncertainty, and relative price variability; harmonisation of interest rates; and increased welfare from augmented international competition (Eichengreen 1990). Costs include loss of independent monetary and budgetary policies and thereby the ability to combat idiosyncratic shocks and smooth business cycles, as well as inhibiting currency devaluation to bolster competitiveness (Feldstein 1997 and De Grauwe 2013, 2016). Although legally committed to adopt the common currency, several countries postpone or opt out of this obligation. Advanced economies like the United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated explicit exemption agreements, while others such as Sweden and Poland do not fulfil certain convergence criteria and therefore remain noncompliant with their Treaties of Accession.Footnote 1 The only outstanding convergence criteria by which Sweden does not comply is membership in ERM II. However, even though the Swedish krona is officially in free float, it has in effect remained closely aligned with the euro. Figure 1 shows the exchange rate of the SEK against the EUR since the inception of the common currency. Although an arbitrary central exchange rate corresponding to the one prevalent on January 1, 1999 is used as a reference anchor, one can see that even with modification to this central rate, the SEK remains comfortably within the envisioned 15% band, with the exception of a slight deviation in 2009. Therefore, as ERM II membership is the only formal condition preventing Swedish EMU membership, official adherence to this exchange rate regime appears readily implementable. The SEK/EUR exchange rate with 15% bands around its 1999 level Given the relative ease with which Sweden could join the monetary union in addition to its current stance, following the British referendum to leave the EU, as the largest EU economy outside of the Euro Area it makes for an interesting case to study the hypothetical implications of EMU membership. Compared to some other prospective joining countries, Sweden also presents the opportunity to assess potential implications of currency union accession for a relatively more economically advanced non-member. Using the novel synthetic counterfactual method of estimation, it is found that Sweden would have borne non-negligible costs from EMU membership, exemplified by around 10% lower productivity, exports, investment, and consumption, as well as 8% greater government expenditure and imports on a yearly basis since the introduction of the euro, leading to significant cumulative reductions in potential economic activity. Having regard to the growing literature highlighting shortcomings of the EMU, it may be that the estimated costs associated with membership are due to these shortcomings, or “design flaws” (De Grauwe 2013). However, given significant recent reforms and implementation of policies and institutions such as the Banking Union, the European Stability Mechanism, as well as the Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution Mechanism, some of these shortcomings have been corrected such that the net balance of economic costs and benefits of EMU membership may have shifted. Assessment of whether these recent measures have been successful in resolving the shortcomings and support net economic benefits of currency union membership remains for future research. The paper is organised as follows. The next section describes the primary flaws of the EMU that may have contributed to the costs observed for Sweden, some empirically found benefits of EMU membership, and a review of relevant counterfactual analyses.

A number of measures has been taken at EU level to reinforce the coordination of economic governance in the bloc and enhance regulation of the financial sector, aiming to better cope with similar crisis scenarios in the future. Most of the policy response, following the agenda-setting impulse by the European Council, was enacted through EU legislation, thereby requiring approval from the European Parliament. The aim of this paper is to analyse MEPs’ voting behaviour on a key number of final legislative votes in the area of economic governance reform. Elected parliamentarians, when deciding whether to vote for or against legislation, must balance the wishes of the overall electorate, those of their specific constituencies within it, pressure from party leaders and their own peculiar ideological leanings (Levitt 1996). While researchers tend to agree that ideological inclination – under the form of party group affiliation – is the primary determinant of vote choice for Members of the European Parliament, these legislators are also agents with multiple principals, trying to balance out the pressure coming from various sources. One of the potential determinants of vote choice is an MEP’s nationality. Whereas several studies have confirmed the weakness of nationality as such a factor influencing voting behaviour in the EP, we expect this established tenet not to hold in the case of fiscal policy. As opposed to policy areas where EU competences are solid and have long been established, fiscal integration is a sector close to the fortress of national sovereignty and the hugely symbolic ‘power of the purse’. EU integration in this area, in other words, potentially has much higher consequences on a state’s capability to tax and spend, severely impairing its fiscal autonomy. If consequences for their own Member State are so crucial, we expect MEPs’ specific constituency (their nation state of origin) to play a much higher role than usual on legislation related to fiscal discipline. This is particularly the case when fiscal restrictions might have a differential impact on Member States due to their varying pre-existing fiscal position and the intensity of the economic crisis which has hit them. While our research does not overall challenge the primary finding that party affiliation is the main determinant of vote choice in the EP (like in any other legislature), we aim to better disentangle the different components of vote choice. This analysis is all the more crucial when legislative votes refer to measures having differential impacts on the different countries MEPs come from. As far as economic governance is concerned, all regulations and directives forming the Six-Pack and the Two-Pack are analysed, together with the key vote required to establish the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).Footnote 1 Whereas scholarly work has traditionally showed MEPs voting behaviour to be primarily driven by ideology (more specifically, by the MEP’s party group affiliation), we expect to find MEPs’ national origins to play a counterbalancing role and – at least partially – weaken intra-party position on key fiscal integration matters, where a conflict of interest might exist between creditor and debtor member countries. We hypothesise the potential presence of a tension between EP party affiliation and national identity with regard to economic governance issues, because national sovereignty plays a crucial role in the fiscal space domain. Sovereign states are driven by their own interests with regard to fiscal policy, since their preferred policies are deeply linked to their specific economic conditions, and European legislation constraining the possible choices in the fiscal realm has a different impact on Member States’ economies, depending on their specific economic cycle conditions. Our research hence aims to identify possible distinctive voting patterns alongside EP political affiliation in this particular policy area. In order to do so, we operationalise these “secondary” factors under the form of economic variables signalling a distress in the MEP’s country of origin economic conditions, and we also investigate whether MEPs coming from crisis-ridden (PIIGS) countries display a different voting behaviour than others, anticipating the much higher domestic implications of the EU-imposed fiscal policy reform. The European Parliament has become a privileged object of analysis for political scientists over the last decades, with waves of scholarly attention closely mirroring the ever-increasing reinforcement of its powers since it was first directly elected in 1979. A vast literature exists on legislative politics in the European Parliament, aimed at the identification of the most significant dimensions shaping political and legislative behaviour in the assembly of the EU. Research on voting behaviour in the EP has become an established field over the years, with the mainstream literature agreeing that party group affiliation is the main voting determinant for MEPs. In spite of methodological issues partially undermining these analyses, a consensus exists on an ever-increasing level of intra-party cohesion in the EP and on the weakness of national identities in explaining MEPs’ voting patterns. Nevertheless, our research builds on some recent qualitative work pointing in the opposite direction and takes a look at voting behaviour on a specific subset of legislative votes where national identity is expected to create strong cleavages. Whereas our results do confirm traditional conclusions, we also find that national interests and country-level economic variables can be strong predictors of MEPs’ votes. Our models show variables related to these predictors to be statistically significant in a considerable number of cases, opening up new avenues for future research on territorial cleavages in the European Parliament. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 a brief summary of the existing literature on voting behaviour in the European Parliament is presented. In Section 3 recalls the EU-level measures to tackle the crisis by enacting economic governance reform. Section 4 provides information on the database, methodology and hypotheses. Section 5 presents the results of our analysis and Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.",5

Evidence from an intertemporal modelling framework using the dollar-pound exchange rate.,November 2017,Ioannis Litsios,Keith Pilbeam,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Trying to estimate the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) remains a major challenge in modern international finance. A fundamental problem is that the equilibrium real exchange rate is not observable. In addition, according to Rogoff (1996) deviations of the actual real exchange rate from its long-run parity could be linked to the behaviour of macroeconomic fundamentals. In fact, many theoretical models have been constructed based on the premise that the ERER is a function of macroeconomic fundamentals. The standard models in the literature on the determination of the ERER emerge from a simple balance of payments equilibrium equation, the so-called statistical equilibrium; see for example McDonald (2000). The most simple model is the purchasing power parity (PPP) model which implies that the real exchange rate does not change in terms of tradable goods prices but allows for deviations based on price indices made up of both tradable and non-tradable goods. However, the empirical evidence suggests that deviations from PPP can be both substantial and persistent in nature.Footnote 1 Given that PPP is not able to explain the behaviour of the ERER it has been argued that such a measurement can be derived from an economic model in which macroeconomic fundamentals are explicitly present. Different approaches like the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) of Clark and MacDonald (1998) and Driver and Westaway (2004) and the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) developed by Williamson (1994) have emerged. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing an alternative approach to the determination of the real exchange rate in the long-run. As opposed to the current literature, which is heavily based on various extensions of the balance of payments equilibrium real exchange rate equation, our proposed theoretical framework offers a portfolio balance approach to the determination of the real exchange rate in the long run by constructing a two country model with optimizing agents where wealth is assumed to be allocated optimally in an asset choice set that explicitly includes investment in an array of financial assets namely, money, bonds and shares. The model specification introduced in this paper allows the construction of explicit equations for both domestic and foreign real money balances, domestic and foreign bond returns and domestic and foreign share prices to generate a relationship for the determination of the real exchange rate in the long-run. In this paper, we show that the theoretical model that we derive is empirically well supported by using the dollar-pound rate, indicating that asset prices and returns can play a substantive role in the determination of the real exchange rate in the long-run. Although Dellas and Tavals (2013) have recently shown a theoretical and empirical linkage between asset prices and exchange rate regimes, and Fratzscher et al. (2015) provide empirical evidence in favour of the scapegoat theory of exchange rates in understanding exchange rate fluctuations, our approach is to show an explicit link between asset prices, monetary factors and the real exchange rate.Footnote 2
 The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents an intertemporal optimization model, as a contribution to the understanding of the determination of the real exchange rate in the long-run. Section 3 discusses the dataset and empirical methodology for examining the predicted relationship. Section 4 discusses the results from the empirical estimations and Section 5 concludes.",2

Due to their significant increase during the past few decades, the role of international capital flows in exchange rate dynamics received considerable attention in this line of literature (see, for instance, Brooks et al. 2004; Calvo et al. 1993; Caporale et al. 2015; Combes et al. 2012; Jongwanich and Kohpaiboon 2013; Gyntelberg et al. 2014; Kosteletou and Liargovas 2000).Footnote 1 There is evidence that large capital inflows lead to real exchange rate appreciation, but not all types of capital flows may have the same effects (Combes et al. 2012). This paper investigates the relationship between one type of international capital flows, namely international fund flows, and exchange rate dynamics. International fund flows are cross-border investments in domestic equity and bond instruments by global funds, including mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds, insurance-linked funds and hedge funds (Li et al. 2015). We focus on international fund flows for the following reasons. First, due to increased financial integration and capital market liberalization, international fund flows have increased rapidly since the 1990s. The assets under management by international funds (covered by the EPFR Global database) increased more than 150 times, expanding from 0.15 trillion US dollars in 2000 to 25 trillion US dollars in 2015. Compared with long-term capital flows, fund flows are more volatile and play an increasingly important role in the transmission of shocks (Jinjarak et al. 2011; Raddatz and Schmukler 2012; Gelos 2013). Given the rapid incrase and high volatility of fund flows, it is of great academic and policy relevance to investigate their impact on exchange rate dynamics. Second, existing studies suggest that financial portfolio investments play a more important role in exchange rate dynamics than other types of capital flows such as FDI and bank loans (Combes et al. 2012; Jongwanich and Kohpaiboon 2013). International fund flows are mainly portfolio investments. The following questions are addressed in this research: (i) What is the relationship between international fund flows and real exchange rate (RER) dynamics? (ii) Is this relationship different for developed and developing countries? To answer these questions, we employ dynamic panel data models. We use fund flow data from the EPFR Global database. These data are monthly, which enables us to detect the influence of fund flows on exchange rate dynamics very accurately. Our sample consists of 53 countries over the period from January 1996 to June 2015, including 18 developing countries and 35 developed countries. We find strong evidence for co-movement between fund flows and bilateral real exchange rates vis-à-vis the USD. This holds both for equity flows and bond flows. However, bond flows have a more significant relationship with RER appreciation than equity flows in developing countries, while in developed countries equity flows play a more important role. We also examine the role of the exchange rate regime and financial openness.Footnote 2 Our results suggest that under a more flexible exchange rate the RER appreciation associated with fund inflows is higher, both for equity and bond flows. Furthermore, we find that the coefficient on equity flows tends to be higher in countries with high financial openness, while the coefficient on bond flows is smaller in these countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses related studies. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 examines whether fund flows are related to exchange rate dynamics and section 5 investigates the role of the exchange rate regime and financial openness in this relationship. Section 6 concludes.",1

According to Leamer (2007) fluctuations in the housing market activity are the core cause of the business cycle and the data on residential investment can be successfully used as an early warning sign of an oncoming recession. For that reason a lot of effort has been devoted to analyze the impact of house price fluctuations on different aspects of the economy: the volume of consumption and investment (Case et al. 2005), the allocation of means of production (OECD 2005) or the supply of credit in the banking sector (Bernanke et al. 1996). The importance of the housing market is also discussed in studies on monetary integration, especially in the context of asymmetric responses of individual economies to demand shocks affecting the real estate market (Maclennan et al. 1998) or in the context of the impact of interest rate cuts on the creation of imbalances in the housing markets in Spain and Ireland after euro accession (Conefrey and Gerald 2010; Rubio 2014). There are also some overview analyses on the importance of the housing market structure and its dynamics for the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy (Iacovello and Minetti 2008) as well as for the efficiency of countercyclical monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies (Crowe et al. 2013). Even though the literature on the role of the housing market in the economy is extensive, the number of studies analyzing the role of the rental market is scarce. A few papers, which focus on individual countries, show that the development of the rental market affects the flexibility of the housing sector, hence is important for the resistance of the economy to shocks (Kofner 2014; IMF 2009). There are few cross-country econometric analyses on the relationship between rental market characteristics and boom-bust cycles in the housing sector. For instance Arce and López-Salido (2011) build a theoretical model to show that the availability of rental housing reduces the risk of a house price bubble. Their results are empirically confirmed by Czerniak (2014), who uses a panel logit model for a group of developed countries to show that institutional and socio-cultural factors, including the size of the rental market, influence the probability of a housing bubble. More insight on this matter has been provided by Cuerpo et al. (2014), who analyze how private rental market regulations (i.e. different aspects of rent controls and tenant-landlord regulations) influence the response of house prices to four socio-economic determinants: population growth rate, income dynamics, housing investment as well as fluctuations in real long-term interest rates. They indicate that stricter rent controls increase the response of house prices to changes in all the explanatory variables. On the other hand, their results point that tenant-landlord regulations are of lower importance. Another strand of the literature investigates the relationship between the structure of the rental market and labor mobility. For example, Caldera Sánchez and Andrews (2011) find that an increase in the availability of rental housing leads to higher residential mobility, hence to more efficient allocation of the labor force. Similarly, Barceló (2006) estimates that at an individual level labor mobility, defined as a change in the employment status, is considerably smaller for an owner than for a private tenant. Furthermore, she shows that social housing tenants are less mobile in comparison to tenants in the private market. These results suggest that an effective rental market should decrease the vulnerability of the economy to demand fluctuations, and in the long-term horizon should also diminish the level of structural unemployment. This hypothesis has been empirically tested by Blanchflower and Oswald (2013), who run a panel data regression to explain the differences in the unemployment rate across US states. They find that a rise in the homeownership rate is a good predictor of the subsequent increase in unemployment. As indicated by the authors, the potential reasons of this relationship are not limited to the lower level of labor mobility, as in Barceló, but also due to greater commuting times (areas with more homeowners experience greater transport congestion) and fewer new businesses in states with larger owner-occupation ratio, which is due to resistance of homeowners against new factories in their neighborhood. We contribute to the above literature by analyzing how differences in the development of the rental housing market across European Monetary Union (EMU) countries affect business cycle synchronization. For that purpose we test whether the size of the rental market has an impact on house prices fluctuations and the variability of activity in the construction sector. In particular, we investigate if differences in rental housing availability influence how the housing sector reacts to demographic, demand and monetary shocks across European Monetary Union (EMU) countries. Towards this goal we construct a database for twelve EMU member states over the years 1995–2014 and run a set of panel regressions. Our main result is that the size of the rental market is an important determinant of house price dynamics and the volatility of activity in the construction sector. In the sensitivity analysis we extend our sample for ten other OECD countriesFootnote 1 to check if the size of the rental market affects economic fluctuations also outside EMU. The empirical results are complemented with discussion on how heterogeneous developments in the rental market across member states of the euro area might affect the stability of the entire region. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the tenure structure of the housing market across EMU member states and its correlation with selected indicators of housing market and macroeconomic stability. Section 3 discusses the specification of panel regressions and estimation strategy. Section 4 presents the baseline results of panel data regression for EMU countries. The sensitivity analysis with respect to changes in estimation method or country coverage is included in Section 5 The last section concludes and provides some interpretation of the results in the form of possible policy interpretation.",15

Shah,Ian Corrick,Abdul Saboor,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This article was presented at the fourth ISCEF (Paris, April, 14–16, 2016, www.iscef.com) The question of the existence and nature of the association between inflation and real output growth (hereafter ‘growth’) has been of great interest over recent decades. This question is significant, for example, for those monetary authorities which aim to achieve an inflation target without unnecessary disruption of real activity. Several theoretical and empirical studies have explored the link between inflation and economic growth (Bruno and Easterly 1996; Grier and Perry 1998; Mallik and Chowdhury 2001; Fountas et al. 2006; Grier and Grier 2006; Fountas and Karanasos 2007; Fountas 2010). As expected, there has been substantial argument over the reality and magnitude of the association between inflation and growth. The empirical and theoretical findings concerning the relationship between inflation and growth are inconclusive. Many studies support the view that the relationship between inflation and growth is non-linear, indicating a positive association at low levels of inflation and a negative association at high rates of inflationFootnote 2. There is general consensus among economists that permanent and anticipated changes in the inflation rate have no effect on real economic activities in the long-run, although high inflation exerts a negative impact on output in the short-run.Footnote 3 Bruno and Easterly (1996, 1998) found no evidence of any consistent relationship between inflation and growth at any level. However, the evidence suggests that growth declines rapidly during high inflation periods but then stabilises once inflation declines. Considerable evidence suggests that a continued high inflation rate might have a harmful effect on real growth, even in the long-run.Footnote 4 It has been argued that the negative long-term association between inflation and growth is based on the assumption that high inflation influences the price signalling mechanism, leading to a misallocation of resources in market economies. Researchers have also often highlighted the costs of inflation uncertainty, related to high inflation and the lack of central bank credibility (Ball 1992). Grier and Grier (2006) and Hartmann and Roestel (2013) examined the effect of inflation uncertainty on output growth and found that inflation uncertainty considerably lessens growth. It is worth questioning what would be the inflection point (threshold level), at which the direction of the inflation-growth relationship would change. Fischer (1993) argued that moderate inflation facilitates growth while high inflation produces uncertainty and damages economic performance and there is some further evidence of this (Blanchard et al. 2010). Inflation targeting is a monetary policy regime that has had significant implications for sustainable price stability. Recently many central banks have amplified the importance of inflation targeting as a major economic policy in which the focus is on high and continued growth as well as stable inflation. Anti-inflation policy is costly, causing reductions in output and employment due to sluggishly adjusting prices and wages, as well as reduced demand for goods and services, because higher interest rates encourage saving and discourage consumers and investors from spending and borrowing. Svensson (2010) supported flexible inflation targeting, whereby central banks not only aim at stabilizing inflation around the given target but also the stability of real economic activity. There has also been consideration of the related question of which measure of inflation is most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Many suggest that stabilizing inflation in the sticky-price sector is a better policy and that the flexible-price sector can be ignored, arguing that in sticky-price sectors, price setters are slow to update and do not react immediately to economic changes (Aoki 2001; Mankiw and Reis 2002; 2003; Benigno and Benigno 2004). Once the aim of stable inflation is established and credibility is enhanced, the monetary policy regime should be concerned with minimizing the variability of growth (Shah and Ahmad 2016). The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the likely changes of output arising from policy actions depend in part upon the state of inflation and that therefore monetary policy timing can be chosen to reduce the resulting variations in output. Firstly, in this context we compute an indicator which is the difference between expected and output-neutral inflation, based on decomposition of VAR residuals. Secondly, we suggest that policy-makers could use this indicator to assess the likely consequences of monetary actions; in particular, it is an indicator of the output loss (gain) which might arise from an anti-inflationary action (expansionary action), depending upon the current state of inflation expectations. We define the indicator as the Net Inflation Effect on Output (NIEO). Finally, we run a three-variable VAR model to assess the impact of interest rate shocks on growth and inflation, in order to determine how the monetary policy shocks affect macro-variables in these countries. If it is found that the monetary transmission mechanism within these countries is very strong then this will give further emphasis to the importance of the NIEO when considering monetary policy actions. The empirical analysis considers ten countries, including three countries which have experienced high inflation in the last three decades, each with different inflation dynamics over the last 25 years - Argentina, Iran and Venezuela. Argentina suffered from a period of hyperinflation in 1989–90 and suffered high inflation (about 33%) and depression (GDP declined at −16.3%) in 2002. Iran has experienced high inflation episodes of more than 50% in 1995 and about 40% in 2013. Venezuela has experienced two major episodes of high inflation during the period under study, when annual inflation exceeded 100% in 1989 and 1995. All three have typically had high average inflation throughout the last three decades. The analysis relates this inflation experience to the monetary policies which have been followed in these countries. For each of the ten countries the VAR model has been estimated by multiple least squares and NIEO has been calculated according to these estimates. It is found that the NIEO is generally positively correlated with the headline inflation rate and is strongly significant during periods of high inflation. It is also found that interest rate changes do have a substantial effect on the macro-variables. For each of the countries, the NIEO is used to argue that if interest rate changes had been enacted at different times the effects of these changes on output might have been more beneficial. The specifics of these cases are discussed amongst the empirical results. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical definitions of expected inflation and output-neutral inflation and explains how these are used to compute the NIEO; Section 3 explains the empirical method used to compute the NIEO indicator; Section 4 presents the properties of the data and considers the statistical significance of the results; Section 5 discusses the analysis of the impact of interest rate shocks on inflation and growth; Section 6 details the empirical results in terms of the relationship between the computed NIEO indicators and the monetary policy followed in each of the three countries and the final section concludes.",

Which Trade Model Best Matches the UK Facts?,July 2018,Patrick Minford,Yongdeng Xu,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the last few years debate has raged over whether EU trade arrangements are beneficial, in particular to the UK. The EU is a customs union and so erects trade barriers around its Single Market where economic activity is regulated according to EU rules. The welfare effects of a customs union have always been controversial. According to classical trade theory global welfare is reduced compared with free trade as is the average welfare of citizens inside the customs union; however one country’s citizens may gain from the union if it is a net exporter to others in the union, as then its terms of trade gain may offset the losses experienced by its consumers (Meade 1955). However in recent times a new line of reasoning has become popular amongst trade economists: this ‘gravity model’ (e.g. Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare 2014) regards trade as an outcrop of internal trade, the only difference being that it crosses borders. Otherwise it grows naturally due to the specialisation and division of labour within neighbouring markets. Viewed through the lens of the gravity model a customs union merely makes official what is already a fact of neighbourly inter-trade. Other sorts of trade, with more distant markets, grows analogously but more weakly, the greater the distance; size of distant markets may make up for their distance to some extent, because they are a ‘neighbourhood’ that naturally leads to inter-trade. ‘Gravity’ in trade creation can be thought of as a function of distance and size. In this view of trade it makes no sense to put obstacles in the way of trade with close neighbours such as the EU in the hope of boosting trade with distant markets via new trade agreements that lower trade costs. The disruption from the former will reduce welfare whilst the gains from the latter will be small, simply because the reduced trade costs will have little effect in switching demand from existing products in the presence of weak and imperfect competition. Clearly these two models, the classical and the gravity models, are different and so may well have different welfare implications. However, whilst trade economists have recently tended to favour the gravity model over the classical, there has been no convincing empirical test of the two models as overall predictors of the data. Gravity modellers do point to the Tinbergen (1962) gravity regressions as evidence in favour of the gravity model. However these regressions have long been familiar to trade economists, and classical trade models too can generate trade data in line with these regressions. Thus we face here an identification problem: two models can both generate the same data, at least that would be the claim of their proponents. We need an empirical test that can discriminate powerfully between the two models. To state this requirement is to ask for something that hitherto has not been attempted by trade economists: it has seemed simply too difficult to subject these large non-linear general equilibrium models, often with many hundreds of equations, to any such test. It is after all hard enough to solve them for particular policy constellations, let alone have them generate predictions that can be compared with the facts of trade. So it is quite understandable that trade economists have not felt any urgency in testing their models other than in informal and quite casual ways. This is a case however where cross-fertilisation can occur in economics; in other areas of the subject there have been substantial steps taken in developing methods that can allow large models to be tested against the data. These areas are econometrics, macroeconomics and computer studies. The power of the computer has grown steadily and massively over the past few decades and brought within reach highly computer-intensive methods of model estimation and testing. The use of Monte Carlo experiment has enabled economists to gauge the effectiveness of these methods in small samples, which of course the trade economist is like the macroeconomist condemned to. One example of this progress is in Bayesian estimation in which priors are assigned representing theorists’ knowledge. However, for an area of such controversy as trade models today, it would be hard to construct priors that would command any agreement. Instead we are at a scientific inflexion point where we need to have tests that convincingly decide what the world is like, so that this knowledge can later be embedded in priors for future research. Such tests are ‘frequentist’, that is they reject models that do not generate the known data with adequate frequency or probability. Macroeconomic models share many features with trade models: they are large, complex, based on maximising behaviour of agents, may be non-linear, and the time-series data which they require is limited in quantity. It so happens that a great deal of work has been done in applying frequentist methods to macroeconomic models. Two main methods are candidates for the roles of estimation and testing: maximum likelihood and indirect inference. Le et al. (2016) review the two approaches and their small sample properties; they conclude that maximum likelihood has poor small sample properties, with both substantial estimation bias and low testing power. By contrast indirect inference has low estimation bias in small samples and large-scale testing power. They review an increasing number of examples where indirect inference has been applied (such as Le et al. 2011) and show how policymakers could have benefited from considerable assurance about the robustness of their models. Indirect Inference is a relatively unfamiliar procedure but is being increasingly used because of these properties. In essence it uses the same tools as Bayesian estimation, namely simulation of the model being tested by the method of bootstrapping in which the actual model errors are repeatedly resampled as the best guide to their underlying distribution: one can think of bootstrapping as a practical way of applying Monte Carlo methods of simulation when the underlying error distribution is not known. In Indirect Inference the facts of the data behaviour are estimated separately from the model being tested; this estimated model of the data is known as the ‘auxiliary model’ and it is designed to capture the key relationships in the data that the modellers need to match with their theory-based (‘structural’) model under test. The test procedure is highly intuitive. First we estimate the auxiliary model which records the relationships found in the data for the sample period we are dealing with. Then we simulate the model repeatedly to generate ‘parallel histories’ of this sample period; each of these parallel history samples then has the same auxiliary model estimated on it, the logic being that each ‘sample’ could have occurred and therefore could have given a different set of auxiliary relationships. Finally the many different estimated auxiliary relationships give us their ‘joint distribution’—that is, the probability of different combinations of them according to the structural model. From this joint distribution we can determine how likely it was that this model generated the actual relationships we found in the data. To put it quite informally we create the world according to the model and then we ask how likely the actual world we see would be according to that model. If the likelihood is low- typically we choose a cut-off probability of 5%- then we reject the model. In this paper we have applied this method to testing the gravity and classical models on available UK post-war annual data from 1965 to now. It is the first time to our knowledge that any trade model has been tested by modern computer-based methods and so we feel that it should be a useful contribution to the debate. To anticipate our main conclusions we find that both the models pass our main test fairly easily, the gravity model having the lower probability (its probability drops further as the gravity elements are strengthened and if the test’s power is raised enough it is rejected); however both models behave quite similarly and their key policy conclusions on tariffs do not differ. The paper proceeds with the following sections. We begin by describing the two models and discussing how we might set them up as alternatives. We go on to describe the classical model we choose here in full detail. In the next section we do the same for the gravity model, explaining exactly where it departs from the classical model. After a short section showing the data, we proceed to a section describing the auxiliary model and then to the section where the models are tested by indirect inference, going through the mechanics of the whole process and revealing the results. We then move to our conclusions.",8

For most countries and for the world as a whole, the estimates of the elasticity of real trade volumes with respect to real GDP are substantially higher than one (Irwin 2002; Kwack et al. 2007; Freund 2009). During the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 the decline in world imports and exports was exceptionally large and nearly four times greater than the decrease in global GDP. Standard international business cycle models are unable to account for the severe fall in trade during the crisis and for the highly procyclical trade to GDP ratio. This paper investigates the impact of financial frictions on the dynamics of international trade over the business cycle and their role in the great trade collapse of 2008–2009. A number of explanations have been put forward to account for the dramatic decline in world trade during the global financial crisis and the high trade income elasticity in general. They focus on vertical production linkages (e.g. Bems et al. 2010), compositional effects (Erceg et al. 2008; Levchenko et al. 2010; Engel and Wang 2011; Bussière et al. 2013; Eaton et al. 2016) and inventory adjustment (Alessandria et al. 2010). These factors have been shown to exert a strong effect on cyclical fluctuations in international trade and to have played a major role in the decline of world trade during the crisis. Nevertheless, they still leave a large part of the great trade collapse and the trade income elasticity unexplained. A number of empirical studies based on aggregate data (Chor and Manova 2012) and firm-level statistics (Bricongne et al. 2012; Paravisini et al. 2015) have suggested that the substantial increase in the cost of trade finance observed during the financial crisis contributed to the decline in trade during that time. Financial shocks have been shown to have an adverse impact on trade also in other periods of financial turbulence (Iacovone and Zavacka 2009; Amiti and Weinstein 2011). Berman et al. (2013) show that the impact of financial crises on international trade is greater when shipping times between the exporter and importer countries are longer. This also suggests that trade is significantly affected by financial frictions specific to international transactions. This paper examines the role of credit market imperfections in trade fluctuations within a general equilibium framework. It introduces working capital financing frictions into an open-economy model with heterogeneous firms in which international trade is more dependent on external finance than domestic sales. The contribution of this study is two-fold. Firstly, the paper proposes a novel mechanism generating a countercyclical external finance premium which arises due to the presence of firms’ cash flow constraints, irreversible fixed costs of production and uncertainty concerning firm-specific levels of productivity. In the model developed, financial frictions manifest themselves as labour wedges—discrepancies between the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and the marginal product of labour. Chari et al. (2007) show that these wedges account for a major part of business cycle fluctuations. Secondly, the paper demonstrates that changes in the cost of external financing in response to changing macroeconomic conditions affect the relative prices of imports and exports, as compared to the prices of goods produced and sold domestically, thereby amplifying the effects of real and financial shocks on international trade and contributing to procyclical movements in the trade to GDP ratio. While usually absent from trade and macroeconomic models, trade finance plays a crucial role in facilitating international trade. According to Auboin (2009), 80–90% of international transactions involve some form of credit, insurance or guarantee, whereby about 80% of total trade finance is of short-term nature. The long time lags between production and the receipt of sales revenues involved in international trade, which result from long shipping times and the widespread use of an ‘open-account’ payment system in which the exporter is paid only after delivery, as well as the relatively high costs of assessing counterparty risk associated with foreign trading partners, means that international trade is more dependent on external financing than are domestic sales (Amiti and Weinstein 2011). Although initial attempts have been made to provide microfoundations for trade finance and to understand its implications for the behaviour of international trade (Ahn 2011; Schmidt-Eisenlohr 2013; Eck et al. 2014; Antràs and Foley 2015), this paper is the first to examine the impact of financial frictions on trade at business cycle frequency within a general equilibrium framework.Footnote 1 In contrast to previous studies, the proposed model makes it possible to analyse how working capital financing frictions associated with international trade affect the transmission of shocks in an open economy and cyclical fluctuations in international trade. The mechanism through which financial frictions influence the behaviour of international trade in the model developed in this paper is intuitive. There are two types of firms operating in each economy—domestic retailers, who sell their goods in the domestic market, and exporters, who sell their goods abroad. In order to operate in a given period, firms need to pay in advance a fixed cost of production. They also have to pay for a fraction of their variable costs of production before receiving revenues from sales. Firms need to finance a part of their working capital externally, through short-term bank loans. Due to longer time lags in international trade, documented extensively by Hummels and Schaur (2013) and Djankov et al. (2010), exporters have greater working capital financing requirements and therefore are more dependent on external finance than domestic retailers. Firms are heterogeneous and face uncertainty concerning their individual level of productivity which is only revealed after the irreversible fixed costs of production have been paid and after loan contracts have been arranged. In consequence, in each period a fraction of firms with the lowest productivity incurs losses and defaults on their debt. In order to compensate for the losses generated by defaulting firms, commercial banks charge a premium on their loans. As the fraction of defaulting firms depends on aggregate macroeconomic conditions, the external finance premium varies over time and is negatively correlated with aggregate output. Countercyclical changes in this premium affect firms’ marginal cost and prices. Due to the fact that exporters finance a greater fraction of their working capital externally, their prices are more sensitive to changes in the cost of external finance than those of domestic retailers. As a result, the relative price of imported to domestic goods is countercyclical and the trade to GDP ratio moves procyclically. Furthermore, due to the fact that the external finance premium contributes to the difference between the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and the marginal product of labour, changes in the cost of external finance for firms generate procyclical changes in the labour wedge, which are well documented in the data (e.g. Hall 1997; Shimer 2009). The study demonstrates that credit frictions are able to explain a significant part of the fluctuations of international trade over the business cycle. Changes in the external finance premium resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions amplify the impact of demand and productivity shocks on trade and generate trade income elasticities of 1.3. The behaviour of international trade is also directly influenced by financial shocks. An increase in the loan financing costs for banks due to increased risk in the financial sector lead to even larger changes in international trade relative to output. The analysis shows that financial frictions substantially contributed to the great trade collapse of 2008–2009. The prediction of the model that trade finance affects the behaviour of international trade through the marginal cost channel is consistent with the behaviour of relative prices during the global financial crisis. Ahn et al. (2011) show that in 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, the period of the greatest decline in international trade, producer prices of exported goods in the European Union, the US and Japan increased substantially, as compared to producer prices of goods sold domestically. Haddad et al. (2010), who decomposed the decrease in international trade into changes in prices and quantities as well as product entry and exit for a number of countries, provide evidence that during the financial crisis import prices of manufactured goods increased, particularly in sectors highly dependent on external finance. Using French firm-level data, Berman et al. (2013) show that export prices increase and export volume declines when the destination country experiences a financial crisis, which is also consistent with the financial accelerator mechanism for imports and exports suggested in this paper. Not only are the model dynamics consistent with the behaviour of international trade and relative prices during the crisis but they are also in line with the movements in the labour wedge during that time. Kobayashi (2011) and Pescatori and Tasci (2011) demonstrate that the financial crisis was accompanied by a sharp decline in the discrepancy between the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and the marginal product of labour in the US. In the model developed, real and financial shocks during the crisis are able to explain the large decrease in the labour wedge observed in the data. The empirical performance of the model and, in particular, its ability to capture the dynamics of international trade, relative prices and wages, was examined with the use of Indirect Inference. The Wald test comparing the estimates of an auxiliary VAR model based on the actual data and based on data simulated from the structural model, could not reject the null hypothesis that the model provides an accurate representation of the data. Monte Carlo simulations confirmed considerable power of the test. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses empirical evidence on the cyclical properties of international trade flows and on the changes in international trade, output and prices during the financial crisis of 2008–2009. Section 3 describes the model developed for the purpose of the analysis. Section 4 explains the mechanism through which financial frictions incorporated into the model affect macroeconomic fluctuations. In Section 5, the calibration of the model parameters is outlined. Section 6 presents quantitative results. First, the model’s implications for the transmission of real and financial shocks to the economy are examined, with a particular focus on international trade flows. Second, the Indirect Inference testing procedure is applied to evaluate the empirical fit of the model and the extent to which it is able to replicate the key features of the data. Finally, the contribution of real and financial shocks to business cycle fluctuations and the dynamics of international trade during the global financial crisis are investigated. The final section concludes.",1

Chaunu (1960, pp. 268-9) estimated that somewhat over one-third of the silver from the New World ended up in the “Extreme Orient,” which means predominantly to China. That could make as much as around 27% of world output going to China altogether. That is an enormous percentage. According to the literature, arbitrage between gold and silver played a vital role in explaining this impressive phenomenon. Consider, for example, the following quotation from Richard von Glahn (2003, p. 197), perhaps the most widely cited expert on Chinese monetary history: The gross disparity between the price of silver (measured in gold) in China and on the international market had been the source of the enormous arbitrage profits that was the impetus behind the massive drain of New World and Japanese silver in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. [A footnote reference to Flynn 1986 follows.] …. But the centuries-old disparity in silver/gold ratios came to an end in the middle of the eighteenth century. The price of silver (measured in gold) at Canton sank from 138 percent of the international price in the 1730s to 97 percent in the 1750s, and remained roughly at par throughout the rest of the century. The parity between silver/gold exchange ratios in China and in the international market lends further support to the conclusion that supply and demand for silver in China were in stable equilibrium. In the same vein, Flynn and Giràldez (2002, p. 395) describe the convergence of silver/gold exchange ratios in China and the rest of the world around 1640 as meaning that “global shipments of silver were no longer motivated strictly by arbitrage considerations.” These are most curious statements. Take any two countries, A and B, say, China and “Europe”. From first principles, we know that if transactions costs of moving gold and silver between them are negligible, arbitrage will cause the silver/gold exchange ratios in the two to be little apart and to move together. If instead the transaction costs are non-negligible, arbitrage will set an upper and a lower bound to the difference between the two ratios. If the difference between the two falls outside the two bounds, arbitrage will tend to bring the ratios to the bounds. If the difference falls inside the bounds, arbitrage will be unprofitable and absent. On this basis, we can make two basic inferences. First, if the ratios of the two relative prices move in close harmony over time, arbitrage is very likely to operate since otherwise the result would be highly improbable, especially if the difference between the two is small. Second, if the two ratios move along separate paths, it is highly likely that transaction costs are large and we are mostly inside the bounds, where other factors than arbitrage explain the metallic flows. Is there anything more we can say? In particular, can we say anything about the sign of the movements and the volumes? Indeed, we can make a strong prediction about the sign but can say little about the volumes. The sign should follow from the difference in relative prices. Suppose that the silver/gold exchange rate is lower in China than in Europe (less silver per unit of gold). Next, let us suppose that the export of any third good from China in return for silver is profitable to both China and Europe. Then whether or not the export of this third good in return for gold is also profitable to both, the sale for silver must be more profitable and will dominate. Therefore, silver will flow from Europe into China in preference to gold, no matter how wide or narrow the bands between the silver/gold price ratios are (never mind the slight bias in favor of shipping gold because it is the more valuable of the two metals and the less costly to transport). It follows that the difference between the two exchange ratios tells us nothing about the volume of the flow of silver from Europe into China but only about the sign. What about the possible impact of a movement in the difference in the exchange ratios between China and Europe? Suppose that the silver/gold exchange ratio rises in China relative to Europe, shouldn’t the flow of silver into China fall? Indeed, it should, that is, if there is any arbitrage in the first place and if, in addition, it is the only or the dominant influence on the silver flow. Otherwise, if arbitrage is absent or there are many other influences besides it, some of similar or greater weight, then this is not the case. Next, let us turn to the facts. Figure 1 juxtaposes estimates of annual silver inflows into China from the two main sources, Europe and Japan, at the top with values of silver/gold exchange ratios for China, Europe and Japan at the bottom for 1550–1820. (Unfortunately, the information about the exchange ratios for Japan, from Yamamura and Kamiki (1983), only goes from 1550 to 1639.) The reason for the end date of 1820 is that the flow of silver finally turned into an outflow at about that time.Footnote 3 1550–1820 therefore marks a period of uninterrupted accumulation of silver from abroad in China. The data for the silver inflows comes from von Glahn (1996a, 2003) up to 1700 and from Yamamura and Kamiki (1983) beyond. These figures include strictly inflows of silver from production in Latin America or Japan. Like von Glahn and Yamamura and Kamiki, I treat all imports from Latin America, whether they arrive directly across the Pacific or indirectly via the Atlantic, as coming from Europe. For the silver/gold exchange ratios, the source is Peng (1993–4) for China and it is Soetbeer (1879) for Europe. Von Glahn (1996a) used Spooner’s (1956, p. 339) data for France rather than Soetbeer’s for Germany as a measure of the European silver/gold exchange ratios. But I prefer Soetbeer’s data because it covers the entire study period while Spooner’s data does not. Further, the two series are virtually identical over the years where they coincide. The notes to Fig. 1 contain more detail and the Appendix offers the exact numbers, going back to the fifteenth century and forward to 1850 in some cases. Note: The estimated imports of silver from Europe into China come, respectively, from von Glahn (1996a), Table 13, p. 140, for 1550–1600; same source, Table 23, p. 232, for 1601–1700; von Glahn (2003), Table 9.2, p. 195, for 1701–1806; and Dermigny (1964, II, p. 735) (von Glahn’s source for 1701–1806) for 1807–1820. Those from Japan come from van Glahn (1996a), same tables as those for Europe for 1550–1700, and from Yamamura and Kamiki (1983), Table 7, p. 344 for 1701–1820. The silver/gold exchange rates for China come from Peng (1993–94), p. 608 for 1550–1635, p. 768 for 1650–1700, p. 767 for 1701–1800, and p. 768 for 1801–20. These exchange rates also include one observation from Yamamura and Kamiki (1983), Table 9, p. 345: the one for 1637–1640. The silver/gold exchange rate for Germany, standing for Europe, all come from Soetbeer (1879), p. 123 for 1550–1680, and pp. 129–30 for 1681–1820. The silver/gold exchange ratios for Japan come from Yamamura and Kamiki (1983), Table 10, p. 346, except for 1630–39, which comes from Kobata (1965), p. 254. The Appendix contains the original data. It brings in more data and offers more detail about the estimated imports As regards the silver/gold exchange rates, the series for China and Europe have been the focus of attention heretofore. If we judge from first principles alone, we can see from the bottom of Fig. 1 that over 1750–1820, or at the end of the period, arbitrage between gold and silver between Europe and China is much in evidence. Beginning in 1750, the two ratios drew close together and subsequently moved in tandem. (See Deng 2008, p. 329, for evidence that this continued for the rest of the nineteenth century.) However, up to 1750, the graphs would mainly suggest instead wide bands between the arbitrage points of at least 50% most of the time. Perhaps arbitrage played a role in explaining why the bands were no wider. But even this need not be the case. The exchange rates could have been always within the upper and lower bounds for profitable arbitrage, while separate forces acted upon the two rates. The 1600–1650 period is particularly interesting, since prima facie it gives the impression of no significant arbitrage between China and Europe, as we can hardly imagine that the arbitrage points between the two would have shrunk to virtually nothing from 1600 to 1640 only to return to their previous level in 1650. (We will come back to this time stretch shortly.) Next, let us look at the top of Fig. 1 as well. The top traces the inflow of silver from Europe alone (via Latin America) and from both Europe and Japan (the larger of the two sources until 1685) together into China. It is plain at a glance that a higher positive percentage difference in the exchange rate in Europe (+) over the one in China (−) (greater arbitrage opportunities of moving silver to China and gold the opposite way) had no positive association with inflows of silver into China, neither from Europe nor from Europe and Japan combined. In fact, the correlation seems to go the other way: more profitable arbitrage opportunities seem to be associated with lower inflows of silver into China. Indeed, the statistical correlation between the arbitrage opportunities (the ratio of the European rate minus the Chinese rate to the Chinese rate) and the flow of silver into China is strongly negative. The coefficient is −0.65 for flows coming from Europe and − 0.47 for the total inflows (from Europe and Japan combined) in 1550 to 1820. If we prefer to focus on the period of 1600 to 1750 (because the gross profit rates from arbitrage are all near-zero from 1750 to 1820 and there is a single observation for inflows from 1550 to 1600), the two respective coefficients become −0.27 and − 0.61. Those results are also highly robust.Footnote 4 This opposite relation clearly calls to mind the possibility of a negative supply effect of large inflows of silver into China on the price of silver relative to gold in the country (higher ratios of silver to gold) rather than anything to do with arbitrage.Footnote 5 In conclusion, the raw data yields no evidence of arbitrage between gold and silver before 1750. The only way to find out anything about the subject in the earlier years, 1550–1750, is to examine the evidence further. As a preliminary, note that arbitrage would require gold outflows from China corresponding to the silver inflows. Even such outflows, though, would not necessarily spell arbitrage. For example, the gold could go out from China to Europe in payment for woolens while the silver came in from Europe to pay for silk, without any arbitrage ever taking place between the metals. In this respect, we are lucky, however, since the Chinese hardly imported anything but silver from either Europe or Japan during the period (though it did import significant values of other goods from Southeast Asia and from Russia). Therefore, we can interpret any gold outflows from China toward Europe or Japan as reflecting arbitrage between gold and silver. Flynn and Giràldez consistently emphasize arbitrage between the two metals between China and Europe in 1580–1640 in their many discussions of the subject (for example, Flynn and Giràldez 1994, pp. 74–76, Flynn and Giràldez 1995a, p. 432, Flynn and Giràldez 1996a, p. 313, Flynn and Giràldez 1997, pp. XVI-XVII, and Flynn and Giràldez 2002, pp. 396–398). Nonetheless, to the best of my abilities to determine, there were no important European imports of Chinese gold in this period (which saw large European imports of gold and silver from the Peruvian and Mexican mines instead (Vilar 1974, p. 179)). The only important sale of gold in return for silver by China during this time was in trade with Japan and India, not Europe (see, for example, Kobata 1965 and Yamamura and Kamiki 1983 for Japan, and Souza 1986, p. 54, for India).Footnote 6 Things differ for 1650–1750, when Chinese gold evidently flowed out to Europe fairly regularly. However, this flow remained fairly insignificant until the second half of the period, 1700–1750 and only became large and important around 1720–1740 (see Dermigny 1964, vol. 2, pp. 407–433).Footnote 7 Thus, if I am correct, the period of 1700–1750, perhaps more exactly 1720–1740, is the only one in the whole 1550–1750 interval when arbitrage between Europe and China was important. The 1580–1640 experience is of particular interest because at its close, in the early 1640s (perhaps as early as 1637), the silver/gold ratios in China and Europe drew together for the very first time since 1550. However, as I have already intimated and will now try to show, this was sheer accident.Footnote 8 The fundamental forces driving the Chinese exchange rate at the time were in the Far East. In the first place, the equation of the two ratios in the early 1640s was an event of short duration, soon reversed. The European ratio had remained fairly still near 14 to 1 during the 1620–1640 interval and remained in the 14/15 range for the rest of the century (see Fig. 1). The Chinese ratio is the one that moved. It had been around 8 or 10 to 1 in the 1620s. It then rose to 13 to 1 in the late 30s or early 40s, thus attaining the then-current level of 13.13 to 1 in the Spanish Empire (Cross 1983, p. 400, and Atwell 1982, p. 82). Next, however, the Chinese ratio fell right back to 10 to 1 in relatively short time, where it stayed for the rest of the seventeenth century. Von Glahn (1996b, p. 433) refers to the equation of the two ratios as “short-lived”; De Vries (2003, p. 95) describes it as “brief”.Footnote 9 On the face of it, something may well have happened in and around China independently of Europe. In fact, Kobata (1965) and Yamamura and Kamiki (1983) confirm this possibility. As Kobata points out, at the end of the sixteenth century, silver/gold exchange rates in the Philippines, Sumatra, Siam and Indo-China in Southeast Asia were below the Chinese level. He quotes a ratio of 6 to 1 for northern Sumatra in 1610 (p. 255) as opposed to around 8 to 1 for China. The Japanese one at the time was around 11 to 1 (Yamamura and Kamiki 1983, p. 346). Then in the following years, through trade, including no doubt significant arbitrage, the exchange ratios in Southeast Asia, China and Japan converged and attained about 13 to 1 by 1640 for two reasons, both centered on Japan. One was the considerable increase in the supply of silver from Japanese mines that resulted from the important discoveries of new deposits of the metal in the country dating back to the 1530s and the subsequent adoption of improved technology for separating the silver from lesser minerals. The other was that the rulers in Japan in the 1580s and in the first half of the sixteenth century decided to favor mining, even by exporting silver for other goods (compare Atwell 1982, pp. 68–72). Under these two influences, silver depreciated heavily in the whole region relative to gold. In the 1630s, Japan became an exporter of gold (Yamamura and Kamiki 1983, p. 350); thus the arbitrage between China and Japan ceased. The relevant trade, including the arbitrage while it lasted, consisted of the export of silver by Japan to China and Southeast Asia in return for purchases of gold and silk (mainly silk) from China and spices, sugar, silk and a range of other products from Southeast Asia. The trade was also carried largely, but by no means exclusively, by Portuguese ships. Very significantly, however, once Japan ceased to buy Chinese gold, the Chinese silver/gold exchange rate went right back from 13 to 1 to 10 to 1 levels in relatively short time. It is difficult to see what bearing the temporary merging of the Chinese rate with the European one has on all this. As an interesting sidelight, India also became an important destination for Chinese gold in the 1620s along with Japan. In that decade, the silver/gold exchange ratio rose in India from around 10/1 to the 12/1 to 14/1 range (Moosvi 1987, p.65) whereas the ratio remained in the 8 to 10 range in China. Consequently, some Chinese gold in the Southeast Asian trade headed for India instead of Japan, and this trade continued into the 1630s, when Japan had ceased to be a destination for any Chinese gold. Souza (1986, p. 54) provides convincing evidence of the importance of the movement of Chinese gold to India (another reputed “sink” for the world output of both gold and silver) in this interval. However, to all indication, this trade also ceased in the 1640s. As regards the years 1650–1750, we may begin with the following two quotes (same page) from Peng (Peng 1993–4, p. 766): During the last half of the seventeenth century, an ounce of gold cost 15 ounces of silver in Europe, but still only 10 in China. Once the European merchants who had come to China had taken care to acquire the goods they had come for, they would use the remainder of their money for Chinese gold jewelry, which made an excellent investment. During the first century or so of Qing [thus approximately 1650-1750], there were few European merchant vessels which came to China without buying gold there, particularly with the private funds of the ships’ officers. The East India Company regulated the goods that ships officers might carry. … They were only permitted to bring gold and musk back from China because the space occupied by those articles was not great. From these observations, we get the strong impression that arbitrage of the two metals between China and Europe from 1650 to 1700, while it existed, was not a primary objective. However, as regards 1700–1750, the story changes, mainly for 1720–1740. There is plain evidence (largely from Dermigny 1964, vol. 2) of European ships sailing out to the Far East with the express purpose of bringing back Chinese gold as a major part of the return cargo. Since the differences in the ratios of silver/gold prices in 1720 were still much the same as they had been since 1650, the arbitrage points must have narrowed. The impression of such narrowing is reinforced by the fact that the differences in the exchange ratios continued shrinking after 1720, especially from 1740 onward, and after 1750, the ratios remained closely tied together, never to widen again, for the rest of the period. The basic point, I believe, is that even a 50% difference between silver/gold exchange rates did not necessarily suffice to promote significant arbitrage. It is also not difficult to see why. De Vries (2003, p. 89) cites observed ratios of revenues to costs on imports from China, or ratios of sales price in Europe to purchase price in Asia, going from 3.4 to 1 in 1600 to 2.4 to 1 in 1750 for the European trading companies plying the Cape route to Asia as a group (Table 2.13). Chaudhury (1986, p.76) cites similar ratios of 2 to 4 to 1 on all imports from Asia to Europe for the English East India Company (EIC) in the first half of the eighteenth century. Yet, because of associated costs, even these enormous mark-ups only led to rates of return on capital of around 20%, that is, on successful operations. According to Chaudhury (1978, p. 440), the annual profit rates of the East India Company for 1710 through 1745 peak at 22.2%. Based on Chaudhury’s data, De Vries calculates average rates of 12.5% in the 1710s and 5.7% in 1736–1745 (p. 91).Footnote 10 One passage in Dermigny (1964, vol. 2, pp. 424-425) is exceptionally to the point. There he focuses on ships carrying back gold from Canton to London between 1729 and 1741. For a sample of 16 vessels, he reports an average gross margin of 30% on imported gold (which would be consistent with silver/gold exchange rates between 11 and 12 to 1 in China while they were 15 to 1 in Europe) and almost 150% for the rest of the merchandise, that is, 5 times higher. He does not report rates of profit. But it is quite clear from his discussion that as the price of gold rose relative to silver in China in the 1740s, which it did, the gold imports would be the ones to go first, not the rest. Two other pieces of evidence may be cited. The EIC had evidently considered importing gold from China in the 1670s as it was importing the metal from other parts of the East. But the company decided against it because, as Chaudhury explains (Chaudhury 1978, p. 181): “The duration of the voyage from Europe to China and back was too long to permit a substantial margin of profit.” He also quotes concordant opinion of contemporary EIC management dating as late as 1698. As the other piece of evidence, von Glahn (1996a) explains that much earlier, in 1609, when there were significant opportunities for profitable arbitrage of gold for silver between China and Japan, a Spanish official wrote that “if this [Chinese gold] was brought to New Spain, or to Castile, a profit of 75 or 80 percent would be made” (p. 130). However, von Glahn observes in passing that the plan “apparently did not win converts in Madrid” (p.131). The point is clear. Space on ships is scarce. Carrying gold is at the expense of carrying something else. The revenues on any return voyage must cover all of the costs of administration, fixed capital, labor, security and risks at sea (or land), for the required time (at least 18 months and possibly two years) and none of these costs can be assigned to any single transported good but must still be met for the entire operation to be profitable. Therefore, even a 75–80% gross margin on gold, to say nothing of a 50% one might not suffice. In sum, the big stimulus for Chinese-European trade was silk for silver.Footnote 11 The lure of arbitrage between gold and silver was a modest factor before 1700 or 1720. Matters evidently changed in the 1750s when arbitrage started to keep the silver-gold exchange rates between China and Europe from spreading apart on a continuous basis. Perhaps it became easier to exchange claims on silver and gold between Europe and China without physical movement of the metals. This has never been properly explained.",

We contribute to the literature that analyses the labour market response to global production sharingFootnote 2 which has recently become one of the main research themes in labour economics and international economics (see Acemoglu and Autor 2011 Radlo 2016 or Van Reenen 2011 for a review and Ehrenberg and Smith 2016, chapter 16: 559–586 for a description of mechanisms). Increasing cross-country industrial interdependence due to offshoring and production networks has even been dubbed “the next industrial revolution” (Blinder 2006), while today’s geographically dispersed production and trade can be described as a “Factory World” (Los et al. 2015a). Unsurprisingly, labour market research has focused on potential cross-border job substitution and the employment outcomes of production sharing (Acemoglu et al. 2016; Harrison and McMillan 2011; Michel and Rycx 2012) or the impact of production fragmentation on earnings and wages (Baumgarten et al. 2013; Crinò 2010; Ebenstein et al. 2014; Geishecker and Görg 2013; Geishecker et al. 2010, Hummels et al. 2014; Parteka and Wolszczak-Derlacz 2015; Wolszczak-Derlacz and Parteka 2018).Footnote 3 This paper ties most directly into the latter aspect: the influence of cross-border production sharing and the resulting production links on domestic workers’ wages. However, we deviate from the “classic” analysis of the offshoring-wages nexus (Feenstra and Hanson 1996; Feenstra and Hanson 1999 or, more recently, Baumgarten et al. 2013) by focusing more closely on the role played by the involvement of countries and industries in global production networks and global value chains (GVCs). Models of sequential, multistage production as well as the theories of nations’ interdependence driven by vertical specialisation (Antràs and Chor 2013; Kohler 2004; Costinot et al. 2013) yield ambiguous theoretical predictions of the response of factor prices to participation in GVCs (see section 2.1). Accordingly, this is an important empirical question to be addressed with the data. To measure the strength of GVC ties, we rely on what Feenstra (2017) calls “second generation” measures of production fragmentation – indices developed within a global input-output framework (Hummels et al. 2001; Johnson 2014; Johnson and Noguera 2012; Koopman et al. 2014; Los et al. 2016). In particular, we use the foreign value added (FVA) embodied in exports,Footnote 4 which indicates “the extent to which countries are tied into global value chains” (Feenstra 2017: 2). The measurement of an industry’s involvement in cross-border production chains through FVA content dispenses with the dubious “proportionality assumption” typically used in indices based on the share of imported inputs in production (where the ratio of imports to domestic inputs is assumed to be the same in every industry; see Winkler and Milberg 2012). Moreover, measuring the relative size of different components of export decomposition (among them FVA) across countries and industries is “a way to gauge the differences in the role that countries play in global production networks” (Koopman et al. 2014: 489). The advanced economies tend to occupy upstream positions in the value chain (which is reflected in relatively little FVA in their exports), while the less developed tend to be downstream (Mattoo et al. 2013: 62; Koopman et al. 2010). Using such data for different countries, then, we can interpret our findings as a gauge of the way their relative position in GVC affects factor prices. Los et al. (2015b) document that the share of value added outside the country of completion has increased in almost all product chains since 1995.Footnote 5 However, despite the abundant recent literature on GVCs (see, among many, Amador and Cabral 2016; Amador and di Mauro 2015; Baldwin et al. 2012; Johnson 2014; Johnson and Noguera 2012; Los et al. 2015a; Mattoo et al. 2013), as far as we know there have been no explicit assessments of the FVA-wage nexus, especially in a micro-level setting allowing for a broader cross-country and cross-industry comparative perspective. Our paper seeks to fill this gap, investigating the micro-level dimension of wage determination (Mincer 1974) augmented by measures of industries’ involvement in GVCs, and, importantly, going beyond country-specific studies of the wage effects of production fragmentation (such as Geishecker and Görg 2008; Baumgarten et al. 2013; Ebenstein et al. 2014; Hummels et al. 2014). We have constructed a unique dataset matching micro-level and industry-level data for a number of economies (ten countries: nine in Europe plus the U.S.). Following the task-focused approach to labour market analysis (Baumgarten et al. 2013; Autor 2015; Becker et al. 2013; Becker and Muendler 2015), we do not only categorise workers according to educationFootnote 6 but additionally explore workers’ heterogeneity in terms of occupations and tasks. As is thoroughly discussed in a recent OECD report on the importance of skill types in GVCs (OECD 2017), the mix of specific skills determines the degree to which workers from different countries gain or lose from participation in GVCs. We contribute to the literature by quantifying the labour market consequences of increasingly substantial GVC ties by using microdata for workers from many countries and industries. Previous studies on the response of wages to global production sharing with large country samples (e.g. Polgár and Wörz 2010 on the EU25; Parteka and Wolszczak-Derlacz 2015 on the EU27; Wolszczak-Derlacz and Parteka 2018 on 40 countries) deal only with average industry-level wage data and thus miss the individual dimension of wage determination mechanisms. On the other hand, given the complicated nature of micro-analysis (limited access and high cost of data; problems of cross-country comparability and time consistency; computational difficulties stemming from the size of micro datasets), few studies have managed to avoid the problematic nature of aggregated data. The micro-level evidence to date (described in Section 2) is largely country-specific and limited to developed countries: the U.S. (Ebenstein et al. 2014 and Autor et al. 2014); Denmark (Hummels et al. 2014); Britain (Geishecker and Görg 2013); Germany (Geishecker and Görg 2008 and Baumgarten et al. 2013). Yet less developed economies, such as those of Central and Eastern Europe present in our dataset, are also increasingly involved in GVCs (Hagemejer 2017; Olczyk and Kordalska 2017), so the effects of cross-border production ties on their workers’ wages should not be ignored. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 places our contribution in the context of the theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 presents our unique linked worker-industry dataset and the crucial descriptive statistics on value added and wages. Section 4 describes our augmented micro-level wage models and presents the estimation results, and Section 5 concludes.",11

In estimation the parameters of the structural model are chosen to best match its simulation with the selected data. In testing the simulation of the model with a given set of parameter estimates is compared with the selected data. This gives a joint test of the given parameter values and the structure of the model. Rather than using asymptotic theory, by simulating the model many times, in estimation, it is possible to derive numerical distributions of the estimated parameters and, in testing, the numerical distribution of the test statistic can be employed. The use of indirect inference in estimating and testing macroeconomic and other structural models is not a well-known empirical tool among economists. It attracted attention in the 1990s as a way of estimating nonlinear models and a variety of papers were written then on its estimation properties, essentially seeking to discover whether it could mimic the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood (it did). But its potential role in testing models, especially in small samples, and its properties as an estimator in small samples, was not explored until the work described here which began around 2000. It is particularly useful for testing DSGE models which, as they are commonly estimated by Bayesian methods, tend not to be subjected to any formal statistical test. Le et al. (2016a) have provided a survey of testing DSGE models using indirect inference. In this paper we extend their survey by covering recent research which addresses a number of questions that have arisen in the use of indirect inference. The earlier survey discussed the power of indirect inference tests in small samples, comparing this with the power of tests based on frequentist likelihood methods. It also suggested ways in which modellers could use this power to determine the robustness of their model, especially when used for policy analysis. It was assumed in that survey that the auxiliary model would be a VAR of low order in a few variables while the structural model would be a DSGE model, whether of small size as in Clarida et al. (1999), or large as in Smets and Wouters (2007). Since then the method has been applied to microeconomic and trade models where the features of the structural model are quite different; we do not explicitly consider these models here, but the questions we examine and the answers we give can be easily extended to them. We address the following issues. In section 2 we discuss some important methodological issues in testing DSGE macroeconomic models such as whether it is worth testing DSGE models when, as some claim, they are irredeemably mis-specified a priori and, if it is, how best to estimate and test DSGE models. In section 3 we compare the power of indirect inference tests with the main alternative frequentist method, the likelihood ratio test in small samples. Asymptotically, the two cannot be distinguished under the usual assumption that the model is true. In part, but for completeness, this section recaps material from our earlier survey. In section 4, we review the evidence related to a variety of issues that arise when carrying out the indirect inference test, such as how many and which variables should be used in the auxiliary model, and whether moments, IRFs or a VAR are preferable auxiliary models. In section 5 we review the relationship between indirect inference and identification. In section 6 we conclude with a review of our main findings. Some of these issues have been addressed in published papers, including our own, in which case we have drawn on these in summary form to bring them into this conspectus of available work. We hope this will be helpful to applied economists using indirect inference.",16

Boonman,Jan P. A. M. Jacobs,Alberto Romero,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The high costs of financial crises for the public sector as well as private investors has led to a large number of empirical studies that intend to detect crises in a timely manner, such that a crisis can be avoided, or its impact can be mitigated. Typically Early Warning Systems (EWSs) are employed for this purpose, these are quantitative models that predict extreme events based on statistical information and mechanisms from the past. For overviews see Kaminsky et al. (1998) or Abiad (2003).Footnote 1 EWSs for financial crises have been criticized for several reasons, one of which is that they are only useful for detecting past crises (Frankel and Saravelos 2010). An important reason is that the data used by forecasters to construct the EWS are not available in a timely manner. Also indicators are selected with the benefit of hindsight.Footnote 2 EWSs are typically tested out-of-sample using the most recent data, known as current-vintage data. When the EWS detects crises using current-vintage data but fails to detect crises for the out-of-sample prediction period, then the EWS provides a false sense of security. We focus on a particular type of financial crisis, the currency crisis, which is defined as a large, sudden depreciation or devaluation of the exchange rate, or an episode with high pressure on the exchange rate that may result in large losses of international reserves and/or a hike in domestic interest rates to defend the exchange rate (Berg et al. 2005). Currency crises not only occur in countries with fixed exchange rate regimes, but also in countries with flexible exchange rates which, in principle, should be more resistant to currency crises. One would expect continuous market adjustment to limit the buildup of pressures leading to extreme currency overvaluation and subsequent large discrete currency declines as may occur under fixed exchange rate regimes. Pegged and intermediate exchange rate regimes are indeed associated with greater susceptibility to currency crises, particularly in developing and emerging market countries with more open capital accounts (Ghosh et al. 2010). However, many countries with floating exchange rates have experienced currency crises. A possible explanation is the fact that countries reporting their currencies as floating are often quite reluctant to allow their currencies to float due to so-called fear of floating behavior (Calvo and Reinhart 2000), and de facto follow a pegged exchange rate regime (Glick and Hutchison 2011). In this paper, we investigate the performance of EWSs for currency crises with real-time data, which reflects the notion that data (indicators and forecasts) are subject to revisions in the course of time. We assess the sensitivity of EWS currency crisis predictions to the choice of two alternative data sets. As our first data set, we employ current-vintage data which implies using information of the most recent vintage. The second data set that we employ contains real-time indicator forecasts, for this we convert annual forecasts for period t published in the beginning of the period t in quarterly forecasts, for details see Section 3.2 below. We investigate two types of commonly used early warning systems for currency crises: the signal approach and the logit model. We apply each EWS to a panel of 15 countries, five from Latin America, five from Asia, and five from Central and Eastern Europe, in the period 1991–2017, employing data on a quarterly frequency. We estimate our EWSs on the in-sample period (1991Q1–2010Q4), using 10–15 economic and financial indicators that correspond to different generations of currency crises (Kaminsky 2006; see also e.g. Zhao et al. 2014, Section 2.1) and are typically employed in studies on EWSs for currency crises. Then we predict currency crises for the out-of-sample period (2011Q1–2017Q4) with two types of real-time data explained above. To review the performance of alternative EWSs on forecasting currency crises in emerging economies in the late 1990s Berg et al. (2005) use only information that was available at the time. No information about actual outcomes is used in the forecasts. They use the internal IMF July 1999 forecasts and subsequent internal forecasts to compare the performance of alternative EWSs. Gunther and Moore (2003) compare the performance of an EWS for banking crises in the period 1996–1998 using first releases (first official publication of the data after the period has ended) versus current-vintage data that was available in May 2000 and find that the EWS with current-vintage data performs better than the EWS with first releases. Reagle and Salvatore (2005) test the robustness of predicting the Asian 1997–1998 financial crisis without and with data revisions. They estimate a probit model for a cross-section of a group of 54 emerging economies with three sets of data: the original, unrevised 1996 World Bank data, and the 1999 and 2004 updates of the 1996 World Bank data. They conclude that data revisions lead to significant changes in the model’s estimates, which presents a problem for researchers that should be recognized and addressed. The importance of using early estimates in EWSs has been acknowledged in the literature, but real-time data have not been implemented on a widespread scale. Frankel and Saravelos (2012) comment that predictions issued in real-time would be impressive, but also especially difficult. Lo Duca and Peltonen (2013) remark that real-time data sets that contain information on the revisions of data after the first publication do not exist yet for several countries in their sample of developed and emerging economies. Data availability issues seem to be the major reason why implementation has not been widespread; early estimates for emerging economies are not publicly available. Alessi and Detken (2011) use quasi real-time data. Although it sounds similar to real-time data, the authors actually mean current-vintage data. In their words:  The caveat is that we use the most recent vintage of data and not a true real time data set with unrevised data. Nevertheless, we use conservative lags to proxy for standard publication lags and thus real time data availability. [...] The performance of real variables could possibly be worse in a true real time setting compared to a quasi real time setting, as real variables can be heavily revised (i.e., the quality of current-vintage data can be much better than the quality of real-time vintages). [page 524] Lo Duca and Peltonen (2013) also use quasi real-time data, in their case to predict financial stress events. Holopainen and Sarlin (2016) use quasi real-time data to predict banking crises. Their contribution to the crises EWS literature is to assume that the forecaster uses all available accounting and market-based information with a lag. Our approach differs from Berg et al. (2005) in several ways. First, we explicitly focus on the difference between indicator forecasts and current-vintage data when making out-of-sample predictions. Second, we use the consensus forecasts of Haver Analytics, whereas they use internal predictions from the IMF, which are not publicly available. Third, we consider a longer period. As a consequence, our sample includes more and different currency crises, both from the 1990s (e.g. Mexico 1994-1995, Russia 1998, Brazil 1999) and the next decade (e.g. Argentina 2001–2002, and the Global Financial Crisis that hit most emerging economies in 2008–2009). Including more crises makes our analysis more complete, because of the variety in the crises (Kaminsky 2006). In contrast to Gunther and Moore (2003) and Reagle and Salvatore (2005) we use forecasts of indicators to predict currency crises whereas they focus on first releases of indicators to predict banking crises. Similar to Reagle and Salvatore (2000, 2005) we use panel data, but they estimate a probit model using cross-sections. Panel data have advantages over cross sections and time series, in particular increased sample variation and accommodating unobserved heterogeneity through fixed effects. Our results can be useful for policymakers as attention is drawn to the issue of data availability. Since current-vintage data is not available when predictions have to be made, a realistic out-of-sample evaluation of EWSs requires early estimates (i.e., forecasts) of the indicators. Our results show that crisis prediction results are worse when using early estimates. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the two types of EWSs we employ in this paper. After the description of the data in Section 3, we present and discuss the empirical results in Sections 4 and 5. Section 6 concludes.",13

These appreciations have not only been associated with “expensive yen recessions” – endaka fukyo (円高不況) in Japanese – resulting from negative effects on exports; since the late 1980s, the strong yen has also raised concern about a de-industrialisation of the Japanese economy. Indeed, the share of manufacturing in total output has declined from 26.7% in 1980 to 20.5% in 2015, while the share of manufacturing in total number of employed persons has declined from 27.0% to 16.2% between 1970 and 2016 (Fig. 2). The decline in the share of manufacturing in total employment or GDP is not unique to Japan. It is indeed a phenomenon that can be seen across industrialised economies, with varying degrees. What makes Japan a particularly interesting case to analyse is that the yen’s real effective exchange rate has shown much larger volatility than the currencies of other large advanced economies. Between 1980 and 2018, the standard deviation of Japan’s annual real effective exchange rate was 17.0, compared to 12.3 for the U.S., 10.4 for the United Kingdom, and 5.3 for Germany. Exchange rate effects on manufacturing may therefore have been more pronounced than elsewhere. Real effective exchange rate of the Japanese yen, 1964–2019 (2010 = 100) Value added in manufacturing as share of GDP and share of manufacturing in total number of employed persons While the strong yen and its potentially de-industrialising effect have received much attention in the political and economic policy discourse in Japan, there has been surprisingly little research on this in the academic literature. As pointed out by Hamada and Okada (2009: 200), most research on Japan’s “lost decade” and hollowing out of the Japanese industry “have been broadly focused on its real and domestic aspects, such as total factor productivity (TFP), growth decline, non-performing loans, and governance.” Hamada and Okada (2009: 200) argue that monetary and exchange rate policy have played an important role in this, and that “Japanese industries endured a heavy burden” due to a greatly overvalued real exchange rate. Against this backdrop, the article aims to investigate the effects of yen fluctuations on industrial production and the hollowing out of the Japanese industry. The major contribution of this study is an econometric analysis using new data for industry-specific real effective exchange rates (RIETI 2018) to gauge the effects of yen fluctuations on the output and exports of different Japanese industries at monthly frequency. As recently shown by Fort et al. (2018) for the US economy, changes to manufacturing employment have differed considerably across sectors. The use of monthly, industry-specific data allows us to better capture potential effects of real effective exchange rate movements. We also use annual data since 1970 to investigate potential long-term effects of yen exchange rate changes on manufacturing employment. Following Rowthorn and Coutts (2004: 767), we define de-industrialisation – to which we also refer as “hollowing out” – as “a secular decline in the share of manufacturing in national employment”. The topic is not only of relevance to the Japanese economy, it also bears relevance for other advanced economies. Indeed, recent years have seen an intense discussion in several member countries of the Eurozone about purported negative effects of a too high euro exchange rate on manufacturing and employment (e.g., Belke and Volz 2015). For instance, Bénassy-Quéré et al. (2014: 7) estimate that for France “a 10% depreciation in the euro in relation to a partner country outside the eurozone increases the value of the average exporter’s sales to this country by around 5-6%”, with most of this effect realised in the same year as the depreciation. Likewise, the U.S. has recently seen a renewed discussion on de-industrialisation, with a prominent role of the dollar exchange rate in this discourse (e.g., Campbell 2017; Levinson 2017). A better understanding of any exchange rate effects on Japanese manufacturing should also provide insights for economic and monetary policy elsewhere. The reminder of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the literature on the effects of exchange rate changes on de-industrialisation. Section 3 comprises our empirical analysis. The empirical part is split into two sections: Firstly, we conduct an empirical analysis with annual, aggregate data from 1970 to 2016 that allows us to investigate potential long-term effects of yen exchange rate changes on manufacturing employment. Secondly, we use monthly, industry-specific data from January 2001 to June 2017 to gauge the dynamics of yen exchange rate changes on Japanese sectoral manufacturing employment. Section 4 summarises and concludes.",3
31.0,2.0,Open Economies Review,20 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-019-09557-3,Testing the ‘Fear of Floating’ Hypothesis: A Statistical Analysis for Eight African Countries,April 2020,Ahmad Hassan Ahmad,Eric J. Pentecost,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a perfectly floating exchange rate regime there should be no change in international reserves held by the central bank, whilst in a fixed exchange rate regime there should be no change in the exchange rate. In either ‘perfect’ regime there will be no relationship between the change in the nominal exchange rate and the change in the stock of international reserves. Therefore when a country declares a floating exchange rate regime and simultaneously reserves are changing it is suggestive of some intervention in the foreign exchange market to influence the level of the exchange rate. In this case we would expect to be able to identify a negative relationship between reserve changes and exchange rate changes, with reserves being depleted to prevent or at least slow the depreciation of the exchange rate. This negative relationship between reserve changes and exchange rate changes was initially dubbed ‘fear of floating’ by Calvo and Reinhart (2002),Footnote 1 because developing countries seemed be more tolerant of volatility in international reserves, domestic interest rates and commodity prices than they were to exchange rate volatility. For fear of floating to be a realistic possibility then the level of maintained reserves is critical if the authorities’ are to be able to effectively intervene in the foreign exchange market. Throughout the 1990s international reserves as a share of GDP in developing countries was above that and rose faster than, the same ratio in advanced economies (Jeanne and Ranciere 2006). By 2005 the gap had closed a little, but on average developing countries ratio of international reserves to GDP was about 7% higher than that of advanced countries, most of whom had floating exchange rate regimes. Moreover, the authorities in developing countries intervene in their foreign exchange markets with large amounts of foreign currency relative to the level of market turnover, the money base, and the stock of the domestic bonds outstanding.Footnote 2 Not only is the level of reserves an unlikely constraint, but according to the IMF (2001) intervention by developing countries could bring about a greater impact on the path of exchange rate than in the developed economies because the authorities in these countries do not sterilize their interventions. This has been confirmed by recent literature. For example, Montes and Ferreira (2019) not only found intervention in Brazil’s exchange rate markets was significant, but also indicative of a ‘fear of floating’ in the country. The ‘fear of floating’ argument, however, contradicts Nogueira and León-Ledesma (2009) who contend that the apparent exchange rate interventions are not due to ‘fear of floating’, but are meant to achieve the inflation target objective of the central bank. In addition, Bleaney and Tian (2014), using regression analysis verified the exchange rate regimes of several countries and concluded that their results are consistent with the IMF classification.Footnote 3 Another important feature of foreign exchange rate interventions in developing countries is the position occupied by the central banks in developing countries (Chandavarkar 1996). Central banks in these countries buy and sell foreign exchange for a number of reasons, including support for the balance of payments and with the aim of influencing the exchange rate level or to dampen exchange rate volatility.Footnote 4 On the whole, governments or their agencies in the developing economies are an important source of foreign exchange because of the relative large size of the government economy. It is also argued that the most important reason for governments in developing countries often participate in the foreign exchange market, is defending their exchange rate policy objectives. It was discovered that on a number of occasions, government of developing countries or their agencies borrow from abroad with the main purpose of defending their exchange rate policy and not to finance their fiscal deficits. Taylor (1981) identified this type of transaction in the foreign exchange market by the developing countries way back in the early 1980s. In this paper we attempt to discover whether there is still evidence of a fear of floating in a number of African economies, some of which declare a de jure floating rate system, given their increased experience with floating regimes since the mid-1908s. In other words, we try to test the idea that the fear of floating identified in the 1990s was simply due to the central banks continuing to follow traditional policies that they used under the Bretton Woods system, possibly because they lacked confidence that floating exchange rates would be stable rates. A lack of evidence of a negative association between reserve changes and exchange rate changes may confirm a change of behaviour and increased confidence in international markets. On the other hand, further evidence of a fear of floating might suggest that our sample economies continue to value a stable currency over international reserve or commodity price stability.Footnote 5 One reason for this may be their concerns with other macroeconomic developments such as currency crises and more recently, the growing stock of outstanding debt as 24 African countries now exceed the 55% debt to GDP ratio advised as prudent by the IMF (Financial Times (FT) 2018; Onyekwena and Ekeruche 2019; Coulibaly et al., 2019). In our sample, only Ghana exceeds this threshold (with a debt to GDP a of about 70%,) but both Kenya and South African are on the threshold. The paper uses a threshold VAR model where endogenously determined threshold is computed and the sample split into low and high regimes for each country. Consequently, the paper can determine in which of the regimes that fear of floating exists. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses the data set and Section 3 uses some descriptive statistics to assess the validity of the fear of floating hypothesis in our sample of countries. Section 4 uses a threshold VAR model to examine the potential non-linear relationship between reserve changes and exchange rate changes. Section 5 concludes arguing that there is some evidence of a continuing fear of floating.",2

Today, credit is everywhere and stands as an essential tool to promote investment and economic prosperity. However, history has taught us that this apparent virtuous cycle eventually comes to an end with unforeseen consequences to the economy. It is a dangerous gamble as showed by the recent global financial triggered, in part, by a swift increase of mortgage loans in the United States. Some credit booms are indeed followed by moments of intense financial distress banking and economic crises (Jordà et al. 2011; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Boissay et al. 2016; Jordà et al. 2016). Our data reports this to be the case for one out of four credit expansions identified from 1975 to 2016. The significant number of disaster events contributed decisively to the belief that credit booms need to be monitored and better understood. One fundamental question regarding credit expansions is how to anticipate their benign or malignant nature, and researchers have tried to identify differences between them but with limited success. All in all, the most consistent conclusion found in the literature is that harmful credit booms (or bad credit booms) tend to exhibit larger magnitudes and longer durations. Barajas et al. (2009) found that around 40% of credit expansions lasting between 9 and 12 years end up in a crisis and for those over 13 years this is a virtual certainty. When analyzing the length of credit booms, Arena et al. (2015) report that approximately half of those that end in a banking crisis last for over six years while only 25% of benign booms last this long. The conclusion that longer expansions have a higher probability of being associated with a banking crisis is reported by several studies (see Gourinchas et al. 2001; Castro and Kubota 2013; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2016; Meng and Gonzalez 2017). However, as far as we are concerned, only Castro and Kubota (2013) use adequate statistical methods as an attempt to address this issue. Relying on a continuous-time Weibull duration model, they provide evidence of positive duration dependence in credit booms, in general, and in those that end badly, in particular. This paper contributes to the literature on credit booms in various directions and goes beyond Castro and Kubota’s (2013) work in several ways. First, we employ a discrete-time duration model that allows for the inclusion of (time-varying) economic explanatory variables. This provides a more complete control of the economic environment. Second, we use a different set of criteria to define episodes of credit booms (different thresholds and detrending techniques). Third, regarding bad credit booms, Castro and Kubota (2013) only show the presence of duration dependence in their dynamics; in this study we move a step forward and compare bad with good credit booms dynamics. This approach makes it possible to provide the (lacking) statistical evidence that bad credit booms tend to last longer than good ones. Fourth, we extend the duration analyses to the build-up and unwinding phases of the credit cycle, assessing whether they are fundamentally alike or not. This particular analysis also allows us to identify whether different patterns emerge when credit cycles are split into those that generate harmful outcomes and those that do not. Finally, we rely on a more extensive quarterly dataset covering 67 countries from 1975q1 to 2016q4. The empirical analysis provides strong evidence that harmful credit expansions are indeed more prone to last longer than those that land softly. It also shows that their build-up and unwinding phases differ, thus generating distinct credit cycles. This study concludes that duration can be used as an early warning instrument to evaluate the benign or malignant nature of credit booms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the literature while Section 3 presents the econometric model. Section 4 describes the data and methodology. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes. The investigation on credit booms has been conducted mainly through data analysis and the literature has highlighted the association between credit expansions and macroeconomic dynamics. Rises in capital inflows, productivity shocks and general improvements in the economy, allied to excessive optimism, are found to explain the build-up of such events (see, for instance, Mendoza and Terrones 2008, 2012; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2016; Amri et al. 2016; Avdjiev et al. 2018; Castro and Martins 2019). Additionally, financial reforms associated with financial liberalization and domestic differences such as expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, less flexible exchange rate regimes, debt composition and weak supervision of the banking system are also associated with periods of abnormal credit growth (Elekdag and Wu 2013; Arena et al. 2015; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2016; Avdjiev et al. 2018). Estimating a fixed effects logit model over a panel of developed and developing countries, Castro and Martins (2019) show that credit booms depend not only on the quantity of credit but are also influenced by its relative price. Likewise, economic growth and economic openness also build-up the conditions for the appearance of lending booms. They also report that economies that can generate more liquidity are less likely to be affected by credit booms. Banking crisis are often associated with excessive credit expansions. The circumstances in which this happens has been an important topic of research. Dell’Ariccia et al. (2016) point out that a higher level of financial depth increases the probability of a boom ending badly. Arena et al. (2015) found that when credit booms end in banking crisis, macroeconomic fluctuations seem to be larger and exhibit more sudden declines. According to Meng and Gonzalez (2017), this is also the case when the dimension of the financial sector grows, particularly above macroeconomic consistent levels. Yet, they report no association between bad booms and macroeconomic and financial policies – exception made to the quality of regulations and supervision of the banking system. In a recent work, Castro and Martins (2018) found that credit booms that are driven by high levels of capital inflows and/or by increases in the ratio of credit to deposits and those that are generally supported by lower interest rates tend to have an increased likelihood of ending up in a full blown banking crisis. However, the opposite seems to happen when right wing parties are in office. The authors also report that, bad credit expansions are less likely to occur under the watch of more independent Central Banks. However, the literature has struggled to find consistent differences between good and bad credit expansions. Some papers – like, for example, Gourinchas et al. (2001) – actually report no relevant changes in key macroeconomic variables between them. Overall, the difficulty in finding consistent predictors that can support or extend theoretical models has restricted the ability for empirical studies to present more credible policy recommendations. Nevertheless, most studies seem to agree that credit booms gone badly are associated with larger magnitudes and longer durations, but to reach this conclusion most of them rely on comparative descriptive statistics and graphical analysis. The exceptions are Meng and Gonzales (2017) and Castro and Kubota (2013). The former collapse their panel data into a cross-section and estimate probit models where the dependent variable takes value of 1 if a credit boom episode is followed within two years by a banking crisis (and 0 otherwise) and add to the regressors a variable measuring the length of each boom. The later uses a continuous-time Weibull duration model to confirm the length nexus of credit booms. None of them provides a comparative analysis between the duration dynamics of bad and good credit booms. This paper embraces that endeavour and confirms statistically the existence of differences in the duration pattern of good and bad lending expansions. For the duration analysis developed in this study, we rely on Prentice and Gloeckler’s (1978) discrete-time version of the proportional hazards duration model,Footnote 1 with the respective discrete-time hazard function given byFootnote 2: where T is the duration variable and t denotes the moment in time when the value of each independent variable is observed. Given that time is discrete, t corresponds to the amount of time (measured in quarters) during which the event has been “running” or has been “active”, i.e. the amount of time since the beginning of the event or the time span.Footnote 3 This model is equivalent to the complementary log-log (or cloglog) function, where λt(= ln ht) represents the logarithm of an unspecified (baseline hazard) function of time; xit is a vector of time-varying regressors. One suitable and quite popular specification for λt is the discrete-time analogue to the continuous-time Weibull model, which yields: where p parameterizes the duration dependence parameter.Footnote 4 If p > 1 (p < 1), the conditional probability of a turning point occurring increases (decreases) as the phase gets older, i.e. there is positive (negative) duration dependence; if p = 1 there is no duration dependence. Therefore, by estimating p, we can test for duration dependence in credit boom phases. Prentice and Gloeckler (1978) and Allison (1982) show that the discrete-time log-likelihood function for a sample of i = 1, ..., n spells/booms can be written as follows: where the dummy variable yit is equal to 1 if credit boom i in a given country ends at time t, and 0 otherwise. We estimate this model by Maximum Likelihood, substituting Pij by (1) and λt by (2). This implies that the discrete-time log-likelihood function will be conditional on both time and the conditions observed for the different control variables at time t. Data and methodology To proceed with the duration analysis, we collected quarterly data for 67 countries from 1975q1 to 2016q4 on real credit.Footnote 5 We use quarterly information on credit because it is more appropriate to assess cyclical movements and volatility associated with crisis episodes. The measure of credit considered is the deposit money bank claims on the private sector taken from the line 22d of the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). The amount of credit is expressed in real terms by dividing the nominal credit by the CPI index. The next step is to identify credit booms to compute the respective duration. Following Castro and Martins (2019), we use the criteria developed by Gourinchas, et al. (2001) – and later updated by Barajas et al. (2009) – to identify credit booms.Footnote 6 This method identifies a credit boom by looking at the growth of credit in the economy, proxied by the bank credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP, L/y. Thus, Gourinchas et al. (2001) define a credit boom as an episode where the deviation of the ratio L/y from a country-specific trend in country i at period t (with the trend being calculated up to that period t) exceeds a determined threshold. In particular, we define that a credit boom takes place if the ratio of private credit to GDP meets the following condition: the deviation of L/y from its estimated trend is greater than 1.5 times its standard deviation or the year-on-year growth rate of L/y exceeds 20%. The HP-filter is used to compute the trend, where the value of Lagrange Multiplier employed in the maximization problem is λ = 1600 (for quarterly data). By organizing the data into spells of credit we can compute their duration, i.e. the number of quarters in which a country is experiencing a credit boom (DurCreditBoom). For comparative purposes, we also consider other more restrictive thresholds: 1.75 and 2.0. Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics for the number of episodes identified with this method (Obs.), their mean duration (Mean), standard deviation (S.D.), minimum (Min.) and maximum (Max.), accounting for different thresholds: 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0. OECD and Non-OECD countries and different periods of time are also considered in this analysis. Simultaneously, we distinguish between credit booms that end up in a systemic banking crisis from those that benefit from a soft landing. Like Barajas et al. (2009), we define the first episodes as bad credit booms and the others as good credit booms. Based on the identification strategy of Barajas et al. (2009), we consider bad booms as credit booms that are followed by a systemic banking crisis either immediately or within eight quarters of their final period. Episodes of systemic banking crises are obtained from Laeven and Valencia (2008, 2010, 2012), extrapolated to quarterly data and updated for the more recent years following their procedure.Footnote 7 Depending on how restrictive the threshold is, we can identify between 176 and 220 credit boom episodes over our entire sample period. Around two-thirds of the episodes took place in developing or emerging economies and, over time, most of the episodes of lending booms occur in the 1990s. On average, credit booms last around eight quarters but they are longer in the 1990s and 2000s (around 9 quarters). However, their mean duration is very similar when we compare the OECD with the Non-OECD countries. From Table 1 we can also infer that not all lending booms end up in a crisis. In fact, only approximately 1 out of every 4 credit booms coincides or is followed by systemic banking crises. Another interesting feature is that, on average, those booms last more (11 quarters) than those that end up in a soft landing (around 7 quarters). Barajas et al. (2009), Dell’Ariccia et al. (2016) and Meng and Gonzalez (2017), among others, notice that bad credit booms are larger and usually last longer than good credit booms. A visual analyses of the histograms reporting the duration of all, bad and good credit booms presented in Fig. 1, seems to confirm this idea: a higher proportion of good booms lasts less than two years while a substantial fraction of bad ones still lasts more than two years (the sample average of all credit booms). However, we do not know whether this difference is statistically relevant or not. This is an important issue that this study intends to address using a proper duration model. Duration of credit booms As credit booms have been consistently associated with sharp increases in capital inflows that consequently raise the supply of loanable funds (Calderón and Kubota 2012; Gourinchas and Obstfeld 2012) and ultimately led to financial crises,Footnote 8 the growth rate of foreign direct investment (FDIgr) is used as proxy for this inflow of capital in our duration model. We expect them to be positively associated with the duration of credit booms. A better economic environment can also promote the build-up credit booms (Mendoza and Terrones 2008, 2012; Baron and Xiong 2017; Meng and Gonzales, 2017) and in that sense make them longer. To account for this effect, the growth rate of real GDP (GDPgr) is also added to the model. Moreover, the duration of credit booms might also be driven by external accounts. Meng and Gonzales (2017) show that an improved current account balance favours the occurrence of credit booms. However, this does imply that they will be longer. A positive stance may mean more cash or deposits available and less need for further credit. So, credit booms might be shorter when the current account balance improves. This effect is accounted for by adding the current account balance as percentage of GDP (CA_GDP) to the model.Footnote 9",2

(2014) found that there has been an increase in co-movement in a large range of non-energy commodity prices since 2004, perhaps enhanced by the financialization in the commodity markets.Footnote 1 Thus, prices that should apparently not be correlated increased their common evolution in time. According to their study, the variance of commodity prices explained by the common behavior of 44 non-energy commodity prices, jumped from 9% between February 1992 and November 2003, to 23% between December 2003 and December 2012. This means that after 2004 the common behavior of non-energy commodity prices accounts for a larger share of those fluctuations. Delle Chiaie et al. (2017), Yin and Han (2015) as well as Ma et al. (2015) also found that the variation explained by the co-movement among commodities (or common factor) has increased for most of the commodities since 2004. Co-movement existing in a large set of commodity prices might be driven by global demand shocks and, more recently, by speculation, while co-movement existing in commodity prices within smaller categories might be driven either by supply shocks or by the effect of the creation of index funds by category of commodities in the financialization period. According to Diebold et al. (2017), commodity prices are determined by traditional supply and demand considerations. While demand for commodities is driven, in part, by a common global demand, commodity supply is driven by sectoral or idiosyncratic considerations. The collapse in the commodity prices during the Great Global Recession of 2007–2008, and the sharp increase on most of them after 2001, due to the demand growth from China, are examples of how common global demand shocks affect overall commodities. In contrast, weather conditions and decisions of major exporting country governments (e.g., export and/or import taxes) are examples of how supply shocks might affect prices in a specific group of commodities, such as agricultural commodities or metals. As common factors are unobserved we test what type of co-movements are more important in commodity prices by means of a forecasting exercise. It is therefore of interest to explore whether co-movement in prices of raw materials has some predictive power over each commodity price and if the predictive power is higher with global or sectoral common factors. To analyze the consequences of these co-movements in forecasting, we compare several models against a baseline benchmark alternative. We aim to explore the predictability of commodity spot price changes measured on a monthly basis. For this purpose, we use a Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) to extract latent factors that drive the co-movement on commodity prices. We evaluate two variants: a large-scale DFM that uses the whole commodity price data to estimate their co-movement and a small-scale DFM that takes into account only the communalities into commodities of the same category. Then, we evaluate whether the co-movements across the overall commodity prices as captured by global factors, or the co-movements across smaller and more homogeneous categories as captured by own industrial factors, help in forecasting commodity prices. Our measure of forecasting performance is the out-of-sample root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) for one and twelve-step-ahead forecasts. The closest paper to ours is Delle Chiaie et al. (2017). However, bearing in mind that our purpose is forecasting and that we do not know the number of common factors, we do not impose a priori structure for the common factors. On the contrary, we let the data speak and establish the number of factors according to the eigenstructure of the variance-covariance matrices of commodity inflations. Although the literature on commodity price forecasts is extensive, it provides only scant empirical evidence of the role of co-movement in commodity prices as a possible source of predictability in commodity price inflation. The recent literature has focused on evaluating whether macroeconomic and financial variables have some predictive power over commodity price spot indices, with mixed results. Chen et al. (2010) found that exchange rate fluctuations in a group of commodity-dependent countries have robust power in forecasting commodity price indices. Groen and Pesenti (2011) used a large set of macroeconomic variables, apart from exchange rates, to evaluate their predictive power over commodity indices. They did not find a robust validation of Chen et al. (2010) previous conclusions. Moreover, although the inclusion of multivariate macroeconomic variables improves the forecasts, it does not produce an overwhelming advantage of spot price predictability when compared with the random walk model. Gargano and Timmermann (2014) found that the predictability power of macroeconomic and financial variables depends on the state of the economy. Another branch of the literature has focused on whether futures prices are good predictors of future spot prices. Chinn and Coibion (2013) evaluate the forecasts of a range of commodity prices finding that futures prices for precious and base metals display very limited predictive content for future price changes. In contrast, futures prices for energy and agricultural commodities do relatively better in terms of predicting subsequent price changes. In regard to oil prices, Alquist and Kilian (2010) use two models: one that considers the current level of futures prices as predictor and the second which is based on the futures spread, to conclude that oil futures prices fail to improve the accuracy of simple no-change forecasts. A much smaller body of literature has used factor models in forecasting commodity prices or returns. West and Wong (2014) fit a static factor model to evaluate the extend of co-movement of 22 commodity prices. They found that commodity prices tend to revert towards the factor. They also compare the predictive ability of the factor model to models that use macroeconomic variables. West and Wong (2014) found that the factor model does better at longer (12 month) horizons. On the other hand, Delle Chiaie et al. (2017) also evaluate the co-movement in a large set of commodity prices (they called it the global factor) and the co-movement existing in a specific group of commodities (they called it the block factor). They found that the global factor accounts for a larger fraction of commodity price fluctuations in episodes associated with global economic activity, while the block components explain most of the fluctuations during episodes associated with supply. To verify the robustness, they evaluated their modelling strategy performing an out-of-sample validation, finding that the factor model performs well at short horizons. We use Kalman filter techniques for both large and small-scale DFMs. Large-scale DFMs are estimated by means of the hybrid procedures of Doz et al. (2011, 2012) that are able to apply the Kalman filter to large-scale systems increasing the efficiency of the estimated common factors by modeling their dynamics. Small-scale DFMs are also estimated by means of the Kalman filter modeling as well as the dynamics of the idiosyncratic components if needed. Then, the main difference between small-scale and large-scale DFMs relies not in the procedure to estimate the common factors (Kalman filter techniques in both cases), but in the number of series, the increased homogeneity of the series within each group and the inclusion of idiosyncratic dynamics in addition to the common ones. We have checked the robustness of our results to using Principal Components for the estimation of the common factors in large-scale DFMs. Our contributions to the literature are the following. First, we shed some light on which type of co-movement is useful for forecasting purposes: the co-movement of overall commodities, which captures global demand fundamentals and speculation, or the co-movements present within categories, as it captures supply shocks or commodity index funds by category. Second, by considering two different periods, we check whether the increase in co-movement existed in the post-financialization period upsurges the forecasting performance of the dynamic factor models. To understand and forecast changes in commodity prices is important not only for commodity dependent countries, due to the fact that commodity price swings directly affect their overall economic performance, but also for commodity importing countries, because commodity prices impact inflation. Furthermore, the role of co-movement in forecasting commodity price changes might add important information to investment managers seeking to diversify portfolios of financial assets and also to commodity producers considering diversifying their production. Finally, we also check that co-movements are also maintained using data from the post-crisis period only. Our paper considers the following research questions: First, does co-movement in commodity prices have predictive power over commodity price inflations? Second, is it global or sectoral co-movement in commodity prices what has predictive power? Third, do factor models gain predictability in the post-financialization period? Finally, are co-movements due mainly to the crisis? We aim to answer these questions using dynamic factor models. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the different models we use along the paper. In Section 3, we describe the data and the methodological procedure we propose. In Section 4, we report the estimation and forecasting results. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude.",3

In both cases, he promises, ‘I will follow economic tradition and demonstrate the ideas via models – tales or fablesFootnote 1 … But I will not use formal language, which would make the models easier to understand for the few who are familiar with this language, but would pose an impenetrable barrier for all the rest.’ It is in this spirit that two influential accounts of near-collapse of shadow banks in US financial crisis of 2008 are examined here. This is not intended, however, as an intellectual exercise of comparing market and non-market mechanisms for allocating resources. Rather it is to see what we might learn from the health crisis - by comparing two influential but sharply contrasting accounts of the market for banking services and of what went wrong in the financial crisis; then seeing what the current experience of the Covid pandemic might imply about their relative credibility. Four aspects of the current pandemic are considered: how it began from a small biological shock; how it gets spread by contagion; the significance of externalities; and how it may end with a vaccine. But the reader is left to form his or her own judgement. One of the narratives to be discussed has been developed by distinguished academics, Mark Gertler of Columbia University and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki of Princeton University, in a series of technical papers appearing in leading economic journals and handbooks since 2015. This, the Scholars’ Tale, holds that US shadow banksFootnote 2 provided highly efficient financial intermediation – with lower spreads between expected asset returns and borrowing costs than commercial banks, for example. Following hard on the heels of an unanticipated negative productivity shock, however, the financial sector suffered a systemic ‘bank run’, attributable to a ‘sunspot’ – a metaphor for some random, pay-off irrelevant, extrinsic trigger. In short, shadow banks are portrayed as efficient but fragile institutions exposed to extraneous random shocks for which they bear no responsibility. A starkly different picture is painted in the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) set up by US Congress to investigate the origins and course of the crisis. It stresses the significance of information asymmetries, and the disingenuous role played by the Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in particular. Early in the Final Report, FCIC ( 2011, p.xxv) one reads: The three credit rating agencies were the key enablers of the financial meltdown. The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. … Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms. From 2000 to 2007 Moody’s rated nearly 45,000 mortgage related securities as triple-A. This compares with six private sector companies in the United States that carried this coveted rating in early 2010. Specifically, the FCIC alleges that competition for business between different rating agencies enabled investment banks to secure unrealistically optimistic ratings for assets that they held and sold; and that this overvaluation played a key role in the ensuing crisis. This, the Congressional Tale, later received academic support from George Akerlof and Robert Shiller as a case study showing how those with better information can profit at the expense of the less well-informed.Footnote 3 In the push to provide credit to subprime borrowers, they argue, investment banks, protected by the shield of limited liability, were tempted to assemble highly-rated but very risky securitised assets for sale to other investors and to hold in their own portfolios. Crisis arrived when such practices came to light. Unlike the ‘sunspot’ model of banking crisis endorsed by Gertler, Kiyotaki and co-authors, the account of Akerlof and Shiller is concerned with the formation of beliefs in a setting of imperfect information. Could these narratives of crisis not first be compared one against the other – in a type of intellectual beauty contest where contestants seek to be most persuasive? To this end, the stage is set in the next section by outlining a basic two-sector framework, where shadow banks using borrowed funds compete with non-bank ‘direct’ lenders, leading to a market equilibrium with substantial intermediation. In section three comes the beauty contest, where each narrative offers its own distinctive twist to the framework, and shows how this can lead to banking collapse. In section four, the light that experience of the current medical epidemic may throw on these competing narratives of financial crisis is considered. Section five concludes.",3

Since the 1970s, the damage-related costs of these events have risen dramatically. Record losses of some US$380 billion were recorded in 2011, the year of the Tohoku earthquake in Japan, equivalent to 0.9% of global GDP (Guha-Sapir et al. 2015). It is widely documented in the previous literature that these catastrophes put the short-run macroeconomic performance of many countries mainly under considerable downward pressure since they will severely hit countries’ economic growth rates, their external performance, price level, financial system, and fiscal sustainability (see among others Felbermayr and Grösch, 2014; Skidmore and Toya 2002; Noy 2009; Loayza et al. 2012; Lis and Nickel 2009; Noy and Nualsri 2011; Gassebner et al. 2010; Oh and Reuveny 2010; Klomp 2017; Wang 2017). Because natural disasters seriously challenge the economic performance of a country, it is expected that these events will influence the monetary policy decisions made by the central bank. The most important aim of the monetary authorities in the period after a natural disaster is to stabilize the economy again. However, there is only one concern since natural disasters create a classic monetary policy challenge: how to accommodate the real shock in the short run with the objective of anchoring inflation when these two competing objectives demand opposite policy actions. On the one hand, natural disasters cause a shortfall in the output produced, leading to a temporary negative deviation of the balanced growth path (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014; Loayza et al. 2012; Klomp 2016; Fomby et al. 2013). To spur economic recovery, the central bank might stimulate aggregate demand by using an expansionary monetary policy. However, loosening the monetary stance at a time when domestic output is temporarily low may risk fuelling inflation. On the other hand, natural disasters raise the marginal costs of domestic producers, creating upward pressure on the price level (Cavallo et al. 2014; Heinen et al. 2019; Parker 2018). To stop the inflation rate from rising any further, central banks should adopt a more contractionary monetary policy. However, by following this policy, the output will depress even more. This dilemma demonstrates that central banks are not able to stimulate the economy and stabilize inflation at the same time after a disaster shock. The optimal policy in the period immediately following a disaster should, therefore, balance this trade-off. Keen and Pakko (2011) evaluate the optimal interest rate response by the Federal Reserve after hurricane Katrina that struck the US economy in 2005. Their findings of a calibrated DSGE model indicate that the optimal monetary policy response should involve raising the short-run nominal interest rate. This contractionary policy is mainly motivated by the anti-inflationary bias of the Federal Reserve, suggesting that the nominal interest rate should respond primarily to higher inflation rather than to lower output. In contrast, several other studies find the opposite results. For instance, White (1997) argues that because the first-round effects of inflation following most disasters are only temporary, local, and concentrated in specific sectors, monetary policy should prioritize growth over low inflation. Thus, whether monetary policy should be loosened or tightened in the wake of a natural disaster is contested and, theoretically, a priori not directly clear as it depends on many characteristics of the monetary policy followed. One key element in this debate is whether the monetary policy decisions are taken by an independent central bank or contrariwise by a more politically constrained central bank. During the last two decades, many countries have implemented reforms designed to grant their monetary authorities greater independence from direct political influence. It is widely believed that central banks otherwise will give in to pressure from politicians who may be motivated by short-run electoral considerations or may value short-run economic expansions highly while discounting the longer-run inflationary consequences of expansionary policies (Walsh 2005). If the ability of politicians to distort monetary policy results in excessive inflation, countries with an independent central bank should experience lower rates of inflation. Indeed, there is voluminous empirical evidence justifying this claim by suggesting that central bank independence (CBI) may be instrumental in realizing low inflation (see Cukierman 2008, Crowe and Meade 2007 and Klomp and De Haan 2010a for summaries).Footnote 1 These central banks can, therefore, build a reputation for credibility, thereby reducing the time-inconsistency problem. In turn, as CBI causes a more contractionary monetary policy that should be reflected in lower output. However, little empirical evidence is found between measures of real economic activity and central bank independence (Alesina and Summers 1993; Pollard 1993). One can, therefore, argue that central bank independence appears to be a free lunch.Footnote 2 Most empirical studies, up so far, are mainly concerned with the long-run impact of central bank independence on the inflation rate or real economic performance. However, in the long-run, the impact of economic shocks is assumed to be zero as they will be averaged out over time. In contrast, the contribution of our study is to explore whether central bank independence is also able to mitigate shocks immediately in the period when they have happened. For this purpose, we use a quasi-experiment in which the frequency of earthquakes is taken as our measure of shocks hitting the economy. According to the extensive literature on retrospective voting, politicians are kept responsible by the electorate for the economic loss created by a natural catastrophe. However, at the same time, voters reward government officials when they react quite promptly by taking decisive actions in the aftermath that will improve economic recovery (i.e., Healy and Malhotra 2009; 2010; Reeves 2011; Garrett and Sobel 2003; Gasper and Reeves 2011). So, this will give politicians a great incentive to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of a disaster by having more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.Footnote 3 To achieve this, governments might put some considerable political pressure on the central bank in the aftermath of a natural disaster to loosen its monetary policy. However, in countries with an independent central bank, the monetary policy should be resistant to this political pressure (see, for instance, Masciandaro and Passarelli 2019). Consequently, a large part of the disaster impact is absorbed through the reduced output to stabilize the price level in the aftermath in countries with an independent central bank. In turn, in countries with a central bank that is more subject to political interference, it is expected that the output is more stimulated due to electoral considerations resulting in a higher price level in the short run. Although the empirical evidence on the relationship between CBI and the economic performance after a natural disaster is lacking, there are some classic examples and anecdotes. For instance, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand loosened its monetary policy in the days after the Canterbury earthquake to stimulate the wider economy. The central bank of New Zealand is recognized as a rather politically dependent central bank since the government still has a considerable influence on central bank objectives. In contrast, in the period before hurricane Katrina, the Federal Reserve (FED) was following a pre-defined path of increasing the funds rate. The hurricane did not alter this contractionary policy.Footnote 4 The FED is regarded as more independent from political interference in setting its policies.Footnote 5 The choice for earthquakes as our indicator of natural disasters is based on a number of reasons. First, these disasters occur rather exogenously as they cannot directly be influenced by human behavior and are not related to the ongoing process of climate change. Second, although earthquakes happen only along the fault lines between two tectonic plates on land or the ocean floor, it is still hard to predict or forecast the timing of an event or develop an effective early warning system. Third, it is difficult to take precautionary measures that reduce the vulnerability of the population for geophysical disasters other than enforcing strict building codes and zoning rules. Fourth, earthquakes are more equally spread across Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and industrialized countries compared to other disasters such as floods or droughts. This reduces the possibility that our empirical results, later on, suffer from a sample selection bias. Finally, compared to other natural disasters, earthquakes have the largest real economic impact. Based on the estimated damage figures reported by EM-DAT, the amount of damage per affected caused by a single earthquake is, on average, about 2.5 times larger than, for instance, for a major flood. Even more, about half of the reported total amount of damage related to natural disasters is attributed to earthquakes (Guha-Sapir et al. 2015). We estimate a simultaneous equation model, including more than 90 countries between 1975 and 2015. Meanwhile, we construct an exogenous measure on the frequency of geophysical disasters based on the information provided by the “Global Significant Earthquake Database” collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Our most important findings suggest that the increase in the inflation rate is smaller when monetary policy is conducted by a more independent central bank. At the same time, countries with an independent central bank have to deal with a wider output gap after an earthquake compared to countries where the government does not influence the monetary policy. Based on these findings, we can conclude that central banks that are less under political control put more weight on lowering the inflation pressure after an earthquake at the expense of the short-run output. However, it turns out that part of this effect can be explained by several monetary policy characteristics. For instance, central banks that follow a specific monetary policy rule (i.e., fixed exchange rate or inflation targeting) are more likely to adopt a contractionary policy than central banks that have more discrete powers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss our theoretical foundation underlying our hypothesis and review the existing empirical literature on the economic impact of earthquakes. In section three, we describe our data and methodology used. In section four, we report our estimation results on the relationship between earthquakes, economic outcomes, and central bank independence. Finally, we end in section five with our conclusion and discussion.",6

It also had to rely on a number of official or unofficial programs of financial assistance provided in various forms by the EU, the ECB and the IMF. Although GDP growth managed to rebound in 2017, the recovery was fragile (driven mainly by net exports and private consumption) even before the eruption of the new economic crisis triggered by the covid-19 shock in early 2020. For instance, at the end of 2019, private investment remained at around 11% of GDP only, public debt was around 175% of GDP, external liabilities were around 140% of GDP, unemployment was around 17% and, perhaps more importantly, Greece scored poorly in institutional quality vis-à-vis other EU and OECD countries.Footnote 2 Besides, as part of the various bailout programs, around 70% of Greek public debt is owned by public institutions of the EU and the ECB. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we search for the drivers of the Greek sovereign debt crisis. This includes driving forces and propagation mechanisms through which the driving forces shaped equilibrium outcomes and in particular the big output loss between 2008 and 2016. Second, we conduct a decomposion exercise to quantify the relative contribution of various driving forces, as they are in the data, to this output loss. Third, building upon the first two steps, we search for counter-factual policy scenaria that could have possibly given better outcomes between 2008 and 2019. Putting all this together, our main aim is to identify the barriers to, and the engines of, growth. This helps us to draw some policy lessons that could also be useful in the face of the new challenges posed by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic crisis.Footnote 3 To place our work in context, we need to recall the key events in Greece over the euro period. The Greek sovereign debt crisis should not have come as a surprise; it had all the symptoms of a typical international crisis (see e.g. Lorenzoni (2014)). Greece was already in imbalance when the global financial crisis erupted in 2007-8. From the late 1990s to 2008, the country enjoyed an exceptional economic boom and declining unemployment. But this was driven by a big rise in private demand and pro-cyclical fiscal policies, both of which were financed by borrowing from optimistic banks in Greece and Northern Europe. The demand-driven boom led to accumulation of large private, public and external debts. It also led to rises in wages, prices and unit labor costs and hence to losses in competitiveness. In addition, and perhaps this went unnoticed, Greece displayed a big asymmetry in institutional quality (as described above) relative to its EU partners. Then, in 2009, amid an unfavorable environment (the “sudden” recognition of the above imbalances, unpleasant news about the country’s public finances, big riots in Athens in December 2008 combined with political polarization, the release of reports by the European Commission and rating agencies expressing fears of sovereign insolvency, etc), confidence was undermined, expectations were reversed, GDP collapsed, debts-to-GDP exploded, and all this became a vicious cycle. Greece, along with Ireland and Portugal, was shut out from private capital markets and the Greek government had to resort to its first official fiscal bailout provided by the EU and the IMF in early 2010. Nevertheless, the fear of default rose again, insolvency was admitted by all and, in 2012, the Greek government defaulted on its bonds held by private creditors. But again this was not enough. Greece had to receive two more official fiscal rescue loans provided by other EU states, EU institutions (EFSF, EFSM, ESM) and the IMF in 2012 and 2015. At the same time, and this has been since the very beginning of the global financial crisis, the ECB provided a plethora of supportive quantitative, or balance-sheet, policies (e.g. direct or indirect intervention in the market for Greek government bonds; the support of private banks through a full allotment lending policy, the relaxation of collateral requirements and the provision of ELA; the issuance of cross-border liquidity that compensated for abrupt private capital inflows and known as TARGET2 liabilities; etc). All this complex financial (fiscal and monetary) assistance was offered at much more favorable terms than markets would have imposed on Greece. On the other hand, it was conditioned on a severe fiscal austerity plan monitored by the EC, the ECB and the IMF. Although the real motives behind the financial assistance, as well as the rationale of severe fiscal austerity, have been lively debated (see e.g. Alesina et al. (2019, chapter 8)), this so-called Economic Adjustment Program, combining austerity and assistance, enabled Greece to remain in the euro area. However, fiscal austerity and economic depression, fuelled by political polarization and populism, were associated with a further worsening of institutional quality. The latter is reflected into indices measuring, for example, the rule of law, regulatory quality, and political instability and violence, which show a sharp deteriorarion during the debt crisis years. Notably, these are the indices typically used to construct measures of the degree of protection of property rights and, as is widely recognized, property rights shape incentives and are fundamental drivers of sustainable growth.Footnote 4 Finally, after a difficult decade, Greece exited its Economic Adjustment Program in August 2018 but, as said above, its moderate recovery path that started in 2017 has been abruptly disrupted by the pandemic shock in early 2020. Our model will try to embed most of the above distinct features of the Greek economy. The vehicle of analysis is a medium-scale micro-founded macroeconomic model of a small open economy participating in a currency union. In addition to a number of real and nominal frictions commonly used by the quantitative macroeconomic literature, the model incorporates, in an attempt to mimic the Greek case, a rather detailed public sector including public employees as a separate income class; problems of institutional quality in the form of ill-defined property rights that trigger anti-social activities; the possibility of sovereign debt default; and international financial (fiscal and monetary) assistance combined with fiscal austerity. To understand better the menu of macro policy instruments used, we model separately the Treasury (fiscal authority) and the national central bank participating in the Eurosystem (monetary authority). In other words, the model incorporates the main ingredients of the Economic Adjustment Program as described above, namely, fiscal austerity combined with international financial assistance, where the latter includes the official fiscal bailouts as well as balance-sheet monetary policies by the Eurosystem. The revenue from the official fiscal bailouts partly make up for the loss of government revenue from being shut out from private capital markets and this happens at non-market interest rates. At the same time, financial frictions (modeled as in Curdia and Woodford (2011)), as well as the issuance of TARGET2 liabilities as part of the monetary base of the national central bank (as studied by Sinn and Wollmershauser (2012), Sinn (2014) and Whelan (2014, 2017)), provide the channels through which quantitative, or balance sheet, monetary policies, as allowed by the ECB, can have real effects and thus work like the official fiscal bailouts. An informal description of the model is in Section 2.1. Our simulations show that the Economic Adjustment Program (namely, the fiscal austerity mix combined with the official fiscal bailouts and the various types of monetary accommodation provided by the ES), jointly with developments in institutional quality (specifically, the deterioration of protection of property rights), can account for most of the cumulative loss in GDP between 2008 and 2016. In particular, departing from 2008, when we feed our model with the Economic Adjustment Program and an index of property rights, both as recorded in the data, the model, via its propagation mechanisms, produces around 22% fall in GDP between 2008 and 2016 as compared to around 26% in the data. The Economic Adjustment Program accounts for 12% and the deterioration in property rights adds another 10%. On the other hand, counterfactual scenarios during the debt crisis imply the following. First, things could have been much worse. Despite the conflicting views about the content of the bail-out program, especially regarding its fiscal austerity preconditions, our numerical simulations imply that financial assistance (provided by other EU counties and institutions, the ECB and the IMF) has helped the Greek economy to avoid the worst. For instance, if the fiscal needs were financed by, say, higher income taxes rather than by the three official fiscal bailouts, the loss in output would have been tremendous, other things equal. Also, even if one is willing to make the unrealistic assumption that the Greek government were able to keep selling its bonds to the private market, the high market interest rates it would have to pay would have led to a bigger output loss than that in the data. Besides, when we make the assumption that the ECB did not follow an accommodative monetary policy towards Greece, the model ceases to exhibit a (stable) solution implying (to the extent that one trusts our model) that this scenario would be nonfeasible, other things equal. Second, things could also have been better. The output loss could have been significantly smaller if some things had been done slightly differently. In particular, the output loss during 2008 and 2016 could have been around 9% only (always relative to the departure year of 2008), if the country had followed an alternative fiscal policy mix (for example, a cut in income taxes, or an increase in public investment, both financed by a cut in tranfer payments), if reforms in the product market had been adopted and implemented in a faster and/or more effective way so as the degree of product market liberalization to get closer to that in the core EZ countries; and, above all, if institutional quality had not deteriorated since 2008 but had simply remained at its pre-crisis level. It has to be emphasized that improvements in these areas did not have to be in the area of fantasy; in our counterfactuals, we assume small changes vis-a-vis the values in the data. That is, small changes could have made things much better. As already mentioned, there has been a rich literature on the Greek debt crisis. Papers close to ours, which have also used micro-founded macroeconomic models, include Arellano and Bai (2016), Gourinchas P-O et al. (2017), Papageorgiou and Vourvachaki (2017), Economides et al. (2017), Glomm et al. (2018), Dellas et al. (2017) and Chodorow-Reich et al. (2019). A common finding of most of these papers, which is also a result shared by our work, is that roughly half of the loss in output between 2008 and 2016 is explained by the fiscal austeriry package adopted. Our work enriches this literature along several dimensions. One key difference is the way we model economic policy. Here, we take a more balanced view by taking into account, not only the costs of fiscal austerity as the above papers have done, but also the role, and the potential benefits, of international financial assistance, where the latter has been both fiscal (fiscal bailouts) and monetary (ECB support) as well as both explicit (e.g. official rescue programs) and implicit (e.g. TARGET2 liabilities). We do so because one cannot study fiscal austerity without taking into account the other side of the coin which is international financial assistance; as said, the former was the precondition for the latter in the economic adjustment program agreed between Greece and its creditors. We also study the role of the deterioration in institutional quality that occured at the same time and has been triggered by the fiscal austerity measures (and further fuelled by populism from several political sides). Another difference is that several of the above papers, especially Gourinchas P-O et al. (2017), Economides et al. (2017) and Chodorow-Reich et al. (2019), employ a large menu of shocks to explain the crisis, including shocks to TFP, to interest rates on public debt, to default rates, to banks’ funding costs, etc. Here, by contrast, most of these variables are endogenously determined. In our paper, when we study the debt crisis, there are two driving forces only (the time-paths of the economic adjustment program and an index of institutional quality, both as recorded in the data), and then the propagation mechanisms of our model provide the channels through which these two driving forces shape macroeconomic and distributional outcomes. For example, to the extent that weak property rights distort private incentives leading to resource misallocation, this distortion shows up as an adverse productivity shock endogenizing the effective TFP. Putting all this together, despite a lively debate on the role of financial assistance and institutional quality in policy circles, there have not been theoretical general equilibrium models tailored to study these issues in a unified framework; our paper tries to fill this gap. But our work is more than a country study. We also contribute to the literature on the nexus among fiscal, public finance and balance-sheet monetary policies. And we do so in the context of an open economy being a member of a currency union like the EZ. Most of the related papers, reviewed in Section 2.6 below, have studied this debated nexus in the context of a closed economy, mainly the US. On the other hand, the models used by the ECB have focused on the link between private banks and the ECB staying away from fiscal financing needs (see e.g. Coenen et al. (2018)). Here, by contrast, building on this literature, as well as on the work by Reis (2013, 2017) and Sinn (2014), we study how balance sheet monetary policies can affect fiscal and country resources in a model that exhibits the key features of the Eurosystem. We show that the role of the ECB in the Greek debt crisis was vital. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The model is in Section 2. Parameterization, data and the solution for the year 2008 are in Section 3. Departing from this solution, Section 4 presents positive results over 2008-2019, while counterfactuals are in Section 5. Section 6 closes the paper. An Appendix contains algebraic and data details (this appendix is available online).",4

Unless an effective vaccine is adopted we will follow the path of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and not be out of the woods for another year. The advent of the pandemic in Europe and the U.S. in March 2020 led to a global financial crisis once most countries locked down their economies. The crisis has a number of dimensions including: domestic liquidity; international liquidity; a sudden stop; sovereign debt default; a most serious recession and challenges to the global monetary order. So far, the domestic and international liquidity crises have been well managed by central banks following tried and true policies. The recent experience of successful central bank cooperation evolved from a two century history that I describe in this paper.Footnote 1 By central bank cooperation is meant: lender of last resort actions;the sharing of information and techniques of central banking and the discovery of common problems. By coordination is meant policy actions formally agreed upon and taken by groups of policy makers to achieve beneficial outcomes for the international monetary system as a whole. I first survey the history of central bank cooperation and coordination across historical regimes: the classical gold standard 1880–1914; the interwar gold exchange standard 1924–1939; the Bretton Woods System 1944–1973; and the present fiat money managed floating exchange rate regime. With this background I then focus on the two recent global financial crises: the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–2008; and the current Covid 19 pandemic since March 2020. The key lessons from the historical survey are: Monetary policy cooperation is successful when done in a rules-based environment e.g. the classical gold standard 1880–1914 and the Great Moderation 1985–2006. Monetary Policy Cooperation is less successful when either the rules do not work or they are not followed, e.g. the interwar gold exchange standard, the Bretton Woods system, the 1970s and 1980s. Monetary policy coordination does not work well when it involves a departure from domestic policy fundamentals, e.g. the 1927 Long Island meeting between the governors of the core country central bankers. The coordinated rescues of the emerging market countries in the financial crises of the 1990s were mainly bailouts and not based on Walter Bagehot’s famous principles. Central bank cooperation arranged through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) helped to create an epistemic community which has learned to follow rules-based policy. International currency swaps developed to manage exchange rates in the Bretton Woods period have evolved during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 and the current crisis in 2020 into the leading tool to manage international liquidity crises.",3

Two particularly popular frictions have been an endogenous discount factor (EDF) in agents’ optimization problem and a debt-elastic interest rate (DEIR) at which domestic agents borrow from abroad.Footnote 1 But, then, as is also well known, if one uses an appropriate parameterization, the choice of the friction, and hence of the model, is trivial because they predict identical steady states and transition dynamics at business-cycle frequencies.Footnote 2 What I show in this short paper is that, once I add a collateral constraint, this equivalence does not hold any more and so the choice between an EDF model and a DEIR model ceases to be a trivial issue. I build upon the baseline small open economy model. I first add an EDF and a DEIR mechanism as in the above literature and, in turn, I also add a simple financial constraint, as in e.g. Mendoza (2002), which is also used by the literature on sudden stops.Footnote 3 The latter means that domestic agents cannot borrow more than a fraction of their assets from the world capital market so that, when it binds, it is like having a sudden stop. To demonstrate the different implications of the two mechanisms, I first solve and evaluate the two models (i.e. the EDF and the DEIR) by comparing their steady state solutions both when the collateral constraint is binding and when it is not binding. Then, I solve and evaluate their dynamics. In particular, I assume that both models happen to be at the financially unconstrained steady state equilibrium (which is the same across models) and are then hit by a temporary adverse shock to TFP. Again, I compare the two models with and without the collateral constraint, where, in the case with, I use the methodology of Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2015) to allow for an occasionally binding collateral constraint. My main results are as follows. The presence of the financial constraint breaks the equivalence between the EDF and the DEIR model and, more generally, breaks the celebrated result of being indifferent about the way of making the small open economy model stationary. This applies both to the steady state and to the transition. Given this, the comparison of the dynamics of the two models reveals that the EDF model predicts a slower recovery of a financially constrained economy from a temporary adverse TFP shock relatively to the DEIR model, which also helps to bring the small open economy model closer to the stylized facts. Therefore, once I add collateral constraints, a proper mix of parameters is not enough to make these popular model specifications equivalent. The non-equivalence result arises from the Euler equations for foreign bonds and capital, in the sense that the introduction of the collateral constraint adds extra distortions also known as asset pricing wedges, which differ qualitatively across the EDF and the DEIR models. This is a reminiscent of the literature on balance sheet monetary policies. Once one adds financial frictions (like borrowing constraints, transaction costs, segmented markets, moral hazard, etc.) into Wallace (1981) baseline model, different balance-sheet monetary policies can lead to different asset pricing wedges and this allows these policies, and their mix, to affect the real economic activity (see Walsh 2017, chapter 11.5, for a review). The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the economic environment. Section 3 solves the model(s). The final section closes this short paper.",

Governments, authorities, and banks have undertaken unprecedented measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. As a result, public and private sector borrowing rose markedly in 2020 and is projected to continue rising even more in 2021. Over the first three quarters of 2020, government debt in the euro area increased by a staggering $1.5 trillion. This raised concerns that such a large amount of accumulated debt will weigh on successfully relaunching economic activity and keeping investment low, which is set to revive the debate on the negative effect debt could have on the economy (Reinhart and Rogoff 2010). Our paper tackles this research question by studying the impact of both public and private debt on private investment, since providing incentives for private investment will be imperative to kick-starting economic recovery following the COVID-19 related crisis. Private investment in the EU dropped significantly when the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) erupted in 2007, and has failed to recover to pre-GFC levels ever since (Fig. 1).Footnote 1 Between 2007 and 2013 real GDP dropped by 0.12% in the EU, 1.51% in the euro area, and 9.40% in the group of most indebted countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain - PIIGS). Similarly, private gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), expressed in constant prices, decreased by 13.73% in the EU, 15.58% in the euro area, and 21.62% in the PIIGS countries.
 Private investment and debt as a percentage of GDP for the EU28, 1995–2016 There is no consensus on the reason why private investment collapsed following the GFC. One potential explanation for this conundrum relies on the uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions due to excessive debt levels (Bricongne et al. 2020).Footnote 2 While private investment plummeted, debt metrics surged. Between 2007 and 2013, the stock of public debt increased by 48.90% in the EU, by 54.84% in the euro area, and by 76.69% in the PIIGS countries. Correspondingly, private debt increased by 6.85% in the EU, by 6.90% in the euro area, and by 0.47% in the PIIGS countries. Private investment has generally been low during periods of high public debt levels (left-hand side chart of Fig. 1). The picture is more mixed when private debt is taken into account (right-hand side chart of Fig. 1). The two variables co-vary between 1995 and 2006, but when the GFC erupted, private debt remained quite stable although at a high level, whereas private investment dropped significantly. Private investment, both by corporations and households, is important for mainly three reasons. First and foremost, private GFCF makes up a relatively large share of GDP,Footnote 3 and remains an important determinant of long-term growth (Khan and Reinhart 1990). Hence, large drops in investment result in lower or even negative GDP growth. Moreover, investment in R&D results in technological progress that, in turn, yields productivity increases (Krugman and Mankiw 1994). Productivity increases might also emanate from private investment being helpful in reallocating resources from less productive sectors to more productive ones (Banerjee and Hofmann 2018). Second, from a policy perspective, high levels of investment in targeted sectors (such as renewable energy and artificial intelligence) are required to ensure EU competitiveness in specific areas, with the ultimate goal of sustaining high income levels. Third, to support the economic recovery from the COVID-19 related crisis, it is essential to revive private investment. The idea is not only to provide a short-term economic stimulus, but also to address long-term challenges, such as de-carbonization, and preparing for unforeseen events in the future (Andrijevic et al. 2020). This paper aims to expand the literature on what has driven the collapse in private investment, focusing particularly on the potential detrimental impact of both private and public debt. Myers (1977) was the first to identify the so-called debt overhang hypothesis, which generally pertains to the negative impact of excessive corporate debt on corporate investment. When deciding whether to finance new investments with debt, a firm’s equity-holders consider that any increase in the firm’s value must be shared with the firm’s creditors. The smaller the benefits that go to the equity-holders because of this, the less attractive that investment is (Occhino 2010). On the other side of this incentive channel, there are also potential benefits as firms might take advantage of debt in terms of tax advantages. Without any disadvantages to counteract this benefit, firms should fund themselves exclusively through debt. However, this never occurs due to substantial risks associated with very high levels of debt financing such as increasing the probability of default or the debt overhang effect. Apart from this incentive channel, there are other mechanisms through which high corporate debt might be an impediment to investment. High debt levels usually translate into a higher risk perception of creditors (Merton 1974), which results in an increasing debtors’ risk premium and cost of funding. The rising cost of capital might culminate in a lower number of projects, for which the expected return is higher than the cost of funding. Due to this decrease in profitable investment opportunities, companies will invest less. Additionally, the ensuing higher debt servicing costs for heavily indebted companies will simply leave less funds available for corporate investment (Maki 2002). Corporate debt dynamics are strictly interconnected with household debt dynamics. Deleveraging in the corporate sector usually results in reduced investment and increased savings. Increased savings imply reduced wage costs, which affects household behavior (Bricongne and Mordonu 2017). Rising household debt also has the potential to destabilize an economy and impede private investment. Highly leveraged households are considered vulnerable to interest rate shocks: if their borrowing cost increases, they will invest less than households with limited leverage. More specifically, households that consider themselves excessively indebted will try to deleverage by reducing housing investmentFootnote 4 and consumption, which might result in decreased demand for companies’ products. This effect is particularly pronounced in countries that are characterized by a large share of adjustable rotate mortgages, such as Greece, Italy or Spain (Albertazzi et al. 2019). Corporations will internalize this behavior and will not invest in additional production capacity. Should the deleveraging process fail and highly indebted households default on their mortgage en masse, banks that lent money to them might get into trouble. Even for sustainable borrowers, this would result in reducing credit, which in turn has an impact on investment (Aiyar et al. 2017). Private investment could also be affected by high levels of public debt through a variety of channels (Traum and Yang 2015; Fatás et al. 2019). If the pool of loanable funds is limited, the public and private sector will compete for scarce resources when they tap financial markets. As the government increases its borrowing, it leaves less funds available for the private sector. This then pushes up borrowing costs for the private sector, which result in lower private investment. Additionally, high levels of public debt can cast doubts on the fiscal sustainability of a specific country. Households and companies might subsequently consume and invest less in anticipation of future tax increases (Barro 1996). The private sector generally considers public debt to be an indicator of economic uncertainty (Ahlborn and Schweickert 2018): if sovereign debt goes up, the economic outlook deteriorates and, particularly in a future mired in economic uncertainty, the incentive to invest will be lower. In the paper, we study whether the EU suffers from a debt overhang, in which high debt results in low private investment by exploiting a panel of 28 EU countries between 1995 and 2016. We also control for the occurrence of external shocks that might have caused debt to increase and private investment to decrease. Next, we study the role of credit conditions on the interaction between debt and private investment as the presence of financial frictions and credit rationing could strengthen a potential debt overhang effect. We explore the role of the financial channel further by examining whether a debt overhang effect is alleviated when financial institutions receive a bailout. Finally, we examine whether a debt overhang effect could be mitigated when countries are financially more open. This paper adds to the existing literature by: taking into account both public and private debt as potential drivers of declining private investment, focusing on the entire EU, and tackling the issue of endogeneity by using a GMM model to exploit the instrumental variable approach based on the linear GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991). The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature. In Section 3 we describe the data. Section 4 contains the econometric approach. Section 5 discusses the main results, provides a number of robustness checks and adds several extensions. Section 6 concludes.",9

Local uncertainty may influence economic performance through private decisions about consumption, investment and capital flows, but it may also affect the economy indirectly through changes in various economic policies. The effects of global economic uncertainty can equally be further amplified through various channels that transmit across countries.
 The crisis that started with the Covid-19 pandemic is one example of how uncertainty about the economic outlook and about the policies taken to combat events like a pandemic and a resulting economic downturn may prove important for the dynamics of an economy. Uncertainty about future economic developments can shoot up during crises or major economic and political events, but changes in uncertainty can also happen without any apparent cause. Since open economies are affected by both foreign and domestic shocks, it is important for policymakers to understand how the domestic economy may be affected by uncertainty shocks that originate at home and those from abroad. Monetary authorities, for instance, would benefit from knowing how shifts in global and local uncertainty affect exchange rates and the dynamics of inflation. Such analysis would be also informative for international investors, who must assess the returns and risks in various markets. Quantifying uncertainty is a complex matter, and the economics literature has produced numerous measures or proxies of economic uncertainty (see the discussion in Jurado et al. 2015). One of the more frequently used measures is the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index documented in Baker et al. (2016). Various versions of the EPU index have been produced, but the original one, which is used in this paper, is based entirely on extracts of words from articles in major newspapers in the country analysed. The index is not derived from macroeconomic or financial variables and so it may be seen as a subjective measure of economic uncertainty in the economy. Several papers have examined the effects of uncertainty shocks for the US economy or the economy of a selected country (Jurado et al. 2015; Baker et al. 2016; Caldara et al. 2016; Basu and Bundick 2017). These studies usually apply a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) framework and typically find that an unexpected rise in uncertainty has a negative impact on real economic activity. These papers do not however consider how uncertainty shocks affect exchange rate movements. Another group of studies have analysed the effects of global economic uncertainty shocks on local economies, also typically using the structural VAR methodology. An early study by Colombo (2013) examines the spillovers from US EPU disturbances to the euro area economy. In the same vein, Stockhammar and Österholm (2016) investigate the effect of US EPU shocks on the Swedish economy, while Stockhammar and Österholm (2017) extend the analysis to nine small, open economies. However, these papers do not consider domestic EPU shocks and do not include exchange rate movements in the model specification. There are also articles that explore the role of global and local uncertainty shocks, but focus only on a single country. Cheng (2017) for example investigates how foreign and domestic EPU shocks affect the dynamics of the South Korean economy, including the real effective exchange rate. Nilavongse et al. (2020) meanwhile analyse the effects of EPU shocks on UK macroeconomic variables, including the exchange rate of the British pound. Given that these studies have a single-country focus though, it is difficult to assess how far the main findings can be generalised for a larger group of economies. This paper adds to this discussion by analysing and comparing the macroeconomic effects of domestic and foreign uncertainty shocks in four open economies with floating exchange rates, i.e. Canada, South Korea, Sweden and the UK. Our selection of countries is based on three criteria: they are developed countries, they have a floating exchange rate, and the EPU series are available for them.Footnote 1 The economies of the countries are relatively small, but exhibit sizeable foreign trade and cross-border financial flows. For each country, we estimate and simulate a structural Bayesian VAR model that describes the dynamics of five local macroeconomic variables and five US ones. This allows us to address three questions. First, is the effect of a US EPU shock on the domestic economy the same across the countries? Second, what is the macroeconomic response to domestic EPU shocks? Third, are global or domestic EPU shocks more important for macroeconomic dynamics? Our focus is predominantly on real economic activity, but we also consider the dynamics of prices, interest rates and real exchange rates. The paper contributes in a number of ways to the growing literature on how uncertainty or sentiment shocks affect macroeconomic performance. First, spillovers of economic uncertainty shocks have often been analysed using models that describe the dynamics of an individual economy (Stockhammar and Österholm 2016; Cheng 2017; Bakkar et al. 2021), while our study considers four open economies, so the results can be compared across the countries. Second, we use a relatively large VAR model that provides a detailed description of the local and US economies relative to the smaller VAR models typically used in other studies (Stockhammar and Österholm 2016, 2017). Third, we analyse in detail the role of the exchange rate as a mechanism for adjusting to economic uncertainty shocks. Finally, we provide the results of variance decompositions, which are a gauge for the quantitative importance of the economic uncertainty shocks for the dynamics of the variables of interest. The simulation results from the structural VAR models reveal that an unexpected rise in global economic uncertainty, seen as a US EPU shock, has a negative impact on real sector activity in all the economies analysed, though the impact differs somewhat across the countries. Domestic uncertainty shocks also tend to exert a negative effect on local production, but the reaction is heterogeneous across countries. Deeper investigation highlights the important role played by the exchange rate in the process of adjustment. Most notably the real effective exchange rates in the United States and in the domestic economies react very differently to uncertainty shocks. A surge in both the US and domestic EPU indexes always triggers a depreciation of the domestic currency, while a rise in the US EPU leads the US dollar to appreciate. The outcome can be interpreted as resulting from the status of the US dollar as a safe haven. What is even more important is that we find the effects of both foreign and domestic EPU shocks on local currencies to vary substantially across the economies analysed. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the data and Sect. 3 the methodology. Section 4 discusses the effect of a US economic policy uncertainty shock on the US economy. Section 5 considers the effect of foreign and domestic economic policy uncertainty shocks on the four economies analysed. Section 6 presents the results of the forecast variance decompositions. Section 7 discusses some alternative specifications and robustness checks. Section 8 provides the final comments.",2

According to the model, in a rational expectations setting, economic agents have incomplete information about prices in the economy, and monetary shocks are a principal cause of economic fluctuations. However, in recent years, most economists believe that monetary shocks are not the principal cause of business cycles. In fact, the modern core of macroeconomics consists of the real business cycle model, developed by Kydland and Prescott (1982), and the new Keynesian model. According to the (original) real business cycle model, under the classical assumption of fully flexible nominal wages and prices, most aggregate fluctuations are efficient responses to real shocks. The opposing new Keynesian approach advocates models with sticky prices, and points to economic downturns like the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Great Recession during the late 2000s, and the recent crisis from the COVID-19 lockdown, and argues that it is implausible for the efficient level of aggregate output to fluctuate as much as the observed level of output, thereby advocating government stabilization policy. There are many criticisms of the modern core of macroeconomics. As Serletis (2016, p. 462) puts it, “one is the assumption that economic agents act in isolation and the only interaction between them is through the price system. This is clearly unrealistic as it fails to capture the interdependence, interaction, and economic networks of the real world. Another is the aggregation assumption according to which the behavior of the aggregate (or macro) economy corresponds to that of the representative economic agent, consistent with the reductionist belief that ‘the whole is the sum of its parts.’” Another serious criticism pertains to the formalization of the origins of business cycles. Typically, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models attribute short-run fluctuations to shocks to fundamentals like preferences, technologies, or government policy. This, however, is highly unsatisfactory. As Angeletos and La’O (2013) recently put it in their Conclusion, “if taken literally, these shocks seem empirically implausible. Instead, short-run phenomena appear to have a largely self-fulfilling nature—one that leads many practitioners to attribute these phenomena to more exotic forces such as ‘animal spirits,’ ‘sentiments,’ or ‘market psychology,’ and one that standard macroeconomic models have failed to capture.” In this paper, we follow Angeletos and La’O (2013) and Nam and Wang (2019) and explore the view that sentiments of optimism and pessimism are an important source of economic fluctuations. We accomplish this by estimating the dynamic effects of stock market shocks on macroeconomic variations in the G7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Although there is a large number of studies that investigate this relationship for the United States such as, for example, Rigobon and Sack (2004) and Bjørnland and Leitemo (2009), among others, research conducted on the other members of the G7 has been fairly limited. We fill the gap in the literature, and focus specifically on the following questions: What are the effects of positive stock market shocks on key real macroeconomic variables (consumption expenditure, investment spending, and output)? What are the effects on interest rates? What are the effects on unit labour costs? How do the effects differ across the G7 countries? We provide new evidence, on the relevance of stock market shocks as an important driver of business cycles, in the context of structural vector autoregression (VAR) models. We use three different identification strategies. In the first approach we address the interdependence between interest rate shocks and stock market shocks, using short-run and long-run restrictions, following Bjørnland and Leitemo (2009). In the second approach, we use pure sign restrictions, as in Uhlig’s (2005) Bayesian VAR model, assuming that share price shocks are associated with increases in real consumption expenditure and investment spending, consistent with wealth effects and Tobin’s (1969) q theory of investment. Finally, to avoid the model identification problem of the pure sign restrictions approach, noted by Fry and Pagan (2011), and misidentification of the shocks of interest, noted by Wolf (2020), we implement the theory and numerical algorithms for zero and sign restrictions, recently developed by Arias et al. (2018). We provide evidence that optimism shocks lead to increases in real consumption expenditure, real investment spending, and real output in the G7 countries, a result which is robust across the three different identification strategies. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides details on the data used in our empirical analysis. Section 3 is divided into three subsections, with the first (briefly) discussing the structural identified VAR model with zero restrictions, the second the Bayesian VAR partially identified with pure sign restrictions, and the third the empirical methodology that achieves identification via both zero and sign restrictions. Section 4 presents the empirical results and conducts robustness checks. The last section briefly concludes the paper.",2

The Evidence Reconsidered,February 2022,Patrick Minford,Zhirong Ou,Zheyi Zhu,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper reports on a searching empirical test of the consumer risk-pooling hypothesis, in many two-country currency set-ups. This hypothesis states that consumers make use of state-contingent bonds to insure themselves against shocks and that as a result the real exchange rate between two countries is closely correlated with the relative consumption of their residents. This can be shown formally – following Chari et al. (2002) – to be \(\sigma (c_{t}-c_{t}^{\ast })=q_{t}-v_{t}\), where qt is the log real exchange rate, ct and \(c_{t}^{\ast }\) are the log home and foreign consumptions, σ is the inverse of elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption, and v is the difference between the logs of the two countries’ time-preference errors. On this issue it is generally agreed that there is no evidence for the hypothesis or even for a weaker version (in which non-contingent bonds are used) in the form of uncovered interest parity (UIP) \( E_{t}q_{t+1}-q_{t}=(R_{t}-E_{t}\pi _{t+1})-(R_{t}^{\ast }-E_{t}\pi _{t+1}^{\ast })\), where Rt (\(R_{t}^{\ast }\)) is the home (foreign) nominal interest rate, πt+ 1 (\(\pi _{t+1}^{\ast }\)) is the home (foreign) inflation.Footnote 1 However, with highly sophisticated financial markets freely capable of providing insurance it has seemed a puzzle that existing evidence does not favour any version. The empirical testing in this work has been via predictive tests on the exchange rate based on single-equation regressions, where among others one of the main difficulties in assessing this evidence has been that all the variables in these regressions are endogenous. This problem was circumvented by Minford et al. (2020) (MOZ hereafter) where they embedded the risk-pooling hypothesis and its weaker (UIP) variant in a full DSGE model and tested the model as a whole. The model took the familiar three-equation IS, Phillips Curve, Taylor Rule New Keynesian set-up of Clarida et al. (1999) extended to embrace the US, Europe and the rest of the world, essentially a two-country model for the US and EU which we briefly recap below. They used the method of Indirect Inference to estimate and test the two model versions for the US and the EU pair of economies. What they found was that both strong and weak hypotheses were accepted on the test, with risk-pooling the most probable. They accounted for the discrepancy between these findings and the rejection of both hypotheses in conventional single-equation tests by showing, in a Monte Carlo experiment on that two-country model, when either hypothesis was true, that certain widely-used single-equation tests would be heavily biased towards the hypotheses’ rejection. The MOZ findings are a striking contrast to those by Burnside (2019) who rejected the UIP relation for a dozen pairs of industrialized economies on single-equation tests. They are a fundamental challenge to the ‘empirical consensus’ – now barely questioned – that UIP fails to fit, based on which many including Burnside attempt to solve the ‘puzzle’ with a variety of model features. In this paper, we question this consensus by providing a comprehensive assessment of the MOZ findings, applying the full-model, Indirect Inference test to the currency pairs examined by Burnside, which has never been done before. We find that, while Burnside spuriously rejects UIP in most cases , this hypothesis, as well as its strong form of consumer risk-pooling, are both generally accepted as part of a full model according to Indirect Inference. The two hypotheses perform about equally well, with one being slightly better than the other depending on the currency pair, and on average the stronger risk-pooling hypothesis having a somewhat higher probability. The unbiased MOZ method suggests generally opposite findings to what were found by the biased Burnside method, except in the rare cases of the EU (both accept), and New Zealand and Switzerland (both reject). What we find here therefore provides strong, rigorous evidence in favour of consumer risk-pooling and UIP. We argue that, given the important policy implications of these hypotheses, particularly risk-pooling, and the fact that both these hypotheses fit the data well, policy-makers engaged in issues in international monetary economics should take these hypotheses much more seriously. The remainder of this paper is organized as the following: Section 2 recaps the model that formed the backdrop for the testing in MOZ; Section 3 explains the method of Indirect Inference; Section 4 sets out the findings on the selected currency pairs, side by side with the single-equation findings of Burnside (2019); Section 5 concludes.",1

As of April 21, 2021, there are over 143 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 190 countries, with more than 3 million deaths.Footnote 1 The widespread containment and mitigation measures designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus have severely affected international travel and tourism, which had become a leading engine economic growth and the major source of foreign exchange earnings in many countries across the globe (Fig. 1).Footnote 2 Other infectious diseases have had significant economic effects worldwide, including several pandemics in the 20th and twenty-first century caused by an influenza virus or a coronavirus. Although the mortality rate for COVID 19 is found to be lower than past epidemics, it has had unprecedented health, social, and economic consequences, given its high contagion rate and global spread. Looking forward, while past pandemics have generally been short lived, how each country comes out of the current crisis will depend on policy choices made during the pandemic, the required adjustment, and the economic and institutional strength prior to COVID-19. Therefore, analyzing the evolution of international tourism flows during past epidemics can shed light on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.
 International Tourism Inflows Epidemics have always been a fact of life, and the COVID-19 outbreak is not the first infectious disease with profound economic effects across the world. While many factors contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, cross-border movement of people has always been a potent vector of transmission throughout history (McNeill 1976; Wilson 1991; Wilson 1995; Richter 2003; Snowden 2019). Numerous diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential, including avian flu, cholera, Ebola, malaria, and coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and now COVID-19, can spread easily through international travel in an increasingly interconnected world and affect consumer behavior and travel patterns at a global scale with far-reaching economic and financial repercussions. There is a large body of literature on gravity models in international trade, but scarce research on modeling bilateral tourist movements in a gravity framework, especially taking into account the effect of infectious diseases. Most studies in this context look at the impact of disease outbreaks, such as the SARS and avian flu epidemics, on tourism in a specific country or region over a short period of time (Zeng and De Lacy 2005; Cooper 2006; Wilder-Smith 2006; Kuo et al. 2008). This paper is most closely related to Roselló et al. (2017) that analyzes the benefits of eradicating diseases in terms of tourism flows and revenues during the 2000–2013 period, although using dummy variables that do not capture the scale and dynamism of infectious diseases. To learn from past episodes, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) expanding the dataset in terms of country coverage and time-series dimension to 38,184 pairs of countries over the period 1995–2017, (ii) measuring the actual number of confirmed infectious-disease cases (Ebola, malaria, SARS, and yellow fever) scaled by population, and (iii) estimating the impact on international tourism flows with alternative methodologies, including the pseudo poisson maximum likelihood (PPML), the two-stage least squares (2SLS) with instrumental variable (IV), and the ordinary least squares (OLS), in a gravity framework that controls for macroeconomic factors, geographic and cultural characteristics, and historical ties. The empirical analysis finds strong evidence that international tourism is adversely affected by the scale and dynamism of infectious diseases and the magnitude of this negative effect is statistically and economically significant. In the case of SARS, a 10% increase in the number of confirmed cases leads, on average, to a reduction of 4.7% in international tourist arrivals across all countries. These results withstand several robustness checks, including alternative specifications and estimation methodologies, to address omitted-variables bias and potential endogeneity. In particular, partitioning the sample into income groups highlights heterogeneity in how the risk of infectious diseases affects international tourism flows. While infectious diseases appear to have a smaller and statistically insignificant negative effect on tourism flows to advanced economies, the magnitude and statistical significance of the impact of infectious diseases are much greater in developing countries, where such diseases tend to be more prevalent and health infrastructure lags behind. Using SARS as an example, the results indicate that a 10% increase in the number of confirmed infections led to a decline of about 8% in international tourist arrivals to developing countries—almost twice as much as the average impact on all countries. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of the data used in the empirical analysis. Section III introduces the salient features of our econometric strategy. Section IV presents the empirical results, including a series of robustness checks. Finally, Section V offers concluding remarks with policy implications. The empirical analysis presented in this study is based on an unbalanced panel of annual observations for 38,184 pairs of countries during the period 1995–2017.Footnote 3 Bilateral tourism flows for 172 countries of origin and 222 countries of destination are taken from the WTO database, yielding a dataset of over 261,488 observations over the sample period. The main explanatory variable of interest is the number of confirmed infectious-disease cases, including Ebola, malaria, SARS, and yellow fever, which is obtained from the WHO database. Following the literature, real GDP, the real effective exchange rate (REER), population and life expectancy are introduced as control variables, drawn from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) database and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Standard gravity variables such as bilateral distance between countries, common official language, colonial history and geographical contiguity are taken from the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales (CEPII) database, as presented in Mayer and Zignago (2011). Geographic distance is measured as the great-circle distance in kilometers between the capital cities of each country pair. Binary variables for language, colonial history and geographical contiguity are assigned a value of 1 if a country pair share a common official language, a colonial tie, and an adjacent border and a value of 0 otherwise. Descriptive statistics for the variables used in the empirical analysis are presented in Table 1. There is a significant degree of dispersion across countries in terms of international tourist flows and considerable heterogeneity in the occurrence of infectious diseases. It is essential to analyze the time-series properties of the data to avoid spurious results by conducting panel unit root tests. Accordingly, the stationarity of all variables is checked by applying the Im et al. (2003) procedure, which is widely used in the empirical literature to conduct a panel unit root test. The results, available upon request, indicate that the variables used in the analysis are stationary after logarithmic transformation.
 The gravity model framework is widely used in the economic literature to analyze the patterns of international trade and capital movements, as well as migration and tourism flows (Tinbergen 1962; Anderson and van Wincoop 2003; Bergstrand and Egger 2007; Gil-Pareja et al. 2007; Head and Ries 2008; Santana-Gallego et al. 2010). Bilateral flows between two countries tend to increase with per capita income and decline with transportation costs as proxied by physical distance between the countries. This gives a simple gravity model, in which the number of tourists traveling in one direction between two countries depends on the economic sizes of the countries and the geographical distance between them. Building on Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006), the baseline gravity specification takes the following form in a panel data context:
 in which Tij denotes international tourist flows between countries i (origin) and j (destination); GDP is the level of per capita income in origin and destination country, respectively; Distij is the physical distance between countries i (origin) and j (destination); the ηi, φj and μt coefficients designate the country fixed effects capturing all time-invariant factors in origin and destination country and the time fixed effects controlling for common shocks that may affect international tourism across all countries in a given year, respectively. εijt is an idiosyncratic error term that meets the standard assumptions of zero mean and constant variance. Since the objective is to understand the effect of infectious diseases on international tourism, the parsimonious gravity model is augmented with additional control variables along with the number of confirmed infectious-disease cases:
 where Xijt denotes a vector of control variables, including the REER, population, life expectancy, and binary variables for common language, colonial history and geographical contiguity; Virijt denotes the number of confirmed cases of Ebola, malaria, SARS, and yellow fever scaled by population in origin and destination countries. To account for possible heteroskedasticity, robust standard errors are clustered at the country-pair level.Footnote 4 Most gravity models are estimated with cross-sectional data, which may lead to biased results due to potential correlation between explanatory variables and unobservable country characteristics as it does not control for heterogeneity. Panel data estimations help address such econometric concerns by controlling for country and time fixed effects (Egger 2000). Therefore, in this paper, the gravity model is estimated with the PPML estimator recommended by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and the 2SLS-IV methodology using the lagged infectious disease as instrument to account for potential endogeneity.Footnote 5 As a baseline, the gravity model described in Eq. (3) is estimated using the PPML model, which has several important advantages as compared with other estimators by dealing appropriately with heteroscedasticity, model misspecification and excess zeros. Table 2 presents the estimation results starting with a specification including only macroeconomic and demographic variables and standard gravity factors in column (1) as a point of reference. The number of infectious diseases in origin and destination countries is then introduced into the regression in column (2) for Ebola, column (3) for malaria, column (4) for SARS, and column (5) for yellow fever. The results demonstrate a consistent picture with the signs of all estimated parameters corresponding to their expected values across different specifications. Most of the coefficients are highly significant, and the model’s performance in terms of goodness of fit is found to be highly satisfactory.
 The level of income in both origin and destination countries have a positive impact on bilateral tourism flows, suggesting that international tourism is significantly related to the two countries’ economic size. Distance between the countries, on the other hand, is negatively associated with bilateral tourism flows, representing an obstacle for international travel as expected. The greater the distance between the two countries, the smaller the flow of tourists across the two countries, due to higher cost of travel. This is also consistent with the positive effect of the geographical contiguity variable, indicating that tourists tend to travel more to closer destinations. Cultural similarities and historical ties—proxied by common official language and colonial relations, respectively—are found to have the expected positive effects on bilateral tourism flows. Likewise, demographic factors—measured population in origin and destination countries and life expectancy in destination countries—contribute positively to international tourism. With regard to the main explanatory variable of interest, estimation results establish a significant effect of infectious-disease episodes on international tourism flows, but with variation in magnitude and statistical significance depending on the nature of the disease. The estimated coefficients on malaria and yellow fewer are considerably smaller in magnitude, whereas the coefficients on Ebola and SARS are found to be both statistically and economically significant. These results are robust to alternative estimations and specifications, including after controlling for health infrastructure. In the case of SARS, for example, a 10% increase in the number of confirmed cases leads, on average, to a reduction of 4.7% in international tourist arrivals (Table 2). There is, however, significant heterogeneity across country groups in the impact of pandemics on tourism, depending on the level of income and health infrastructure. These estimated differences in how infectious diseases affect international tourism flows likely reflect disease-specific characteristics:
 Vector of transmission. While malaria and yellow fever are transmitted by mosquitoes, Ebola and SARS—similarly to COVID-19—are spread from human to human. Accordingly, while malaria and yellow fever may be endemic in rural areas, Ebola and SARS could spread more easily in densely populated cities and airports. Existence of treatment or vaccine. Although a vaccine for yellow fever and treatments for malaria exist, to the authors’ knowledge there is no such treatment or vaccine against Ebola or SARS. Consequently, infection risks of these diseases have a greater effect on international tourism flows, especially to countries with weak health infrastructure. Temporary outbreak vs. endemic presence. When a disease is endemic like malaria and yellow fever, there is no point in delaying travel as long as precautions can be taken. Outbreaks of Ebola and SARS, on the other hand, are temporary in nature and, without any treatment or vaccine, incentivize tourists to delay visiting a particular country until the outbreak is over. The robustness of baseline results is checked by estimating the gravity model alternative specifications and estimation methodologies. First, since tourist arrivals may influence the spread of infectious diseases, the model is estimated with the 2SLS-IV methodology using the lagged infectious disease as an instrument to account for potential endogeneity. Second, the sample is truncated at the 5th and 95th percentiles to remove the potential impact of extreme outliers. Third, the gravity model is estimated for a sub-sample of 1995–2007 to exclude the period after the global financial crisis. Fourth, an additional health-related control variables—the number of hospital beds per 1000 people—is introduced to address omitted-variable bias and capture the impact of health infrastructure. To exhibit a concise table, some of these robustness checks are presented only for SARS, but the results remain consistent for other infectious diseases. The 2SLS-IV estimation, presented in Table 3, increases the magnitude of the cumulative coefficient on the infectious disease (SARS)—to −0.465 compared to −0.043 in the baseline estimation, strongly supporting the contemporaneous impact of infectious diseases on international travel both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. Other robustness checks, presented in Appendix Table 5, show that the negative and economically significant relationship between infectious diseases and international tourism flows remains unchanged in the context of 38,184 pairs of countries during the period 1995–2017, with some changes in the magnitude of estimated coefficients. Estimating the model with the truncated sample and for the period excluding the global financial crisis yields higher coefficients on the infectious-disease variable. Adding the number of hospital beds into the regression model reveals that health infrastructure in destination countries matter for bilateral tourism flows.
 Finally, partitioning the sample into income groups and geographical regions highlights heterogeneity on how the risk of infectious diseases affects international tourism flows. These estimation results, presented in Appendix Table 6, show a substantial contrast between advanced economies and developing countries. Although infectious diseases appear to have statistically insignificant effect on tourism flows to advanced economies, the magnitude and statistical significance of the impact of infectious diseases are much greater in developing countries, where such diseases tend to be more prevalent and health infrastructure lags behind.Footnote 6 For example, in the case of SARS, a 10% increase in the number of confirmed infections led to a decline of about 8% in international tourist arrivals to developing countries—almost twice as much as the average impact on all countries. These findings show systemic differences among geographical regions: the disease impact on international tourism flows is significantly greater in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean than the rest of the world.",13

The Case of Interprovincial Trade in Canada,February 2022,Catherine Boulatoff,Talan B. İşcan,Yulia Kotlyarova,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"National economies have become increasingly more service oriented (Fuchs 1968; Schettkat and Yoncarini 2006). This has led to two different views about the future of global trade, which has historically been dominated by trade in commodities and manufactured goods (Findlay and O’Rourke 2007). According to one view, services require prohibitively high transportation costs (think haircuts), and as the share of national output in services increases, global trade will slow down and even shrink as a share of global GDP (Lewis et al. 2018). According to the more sanguine view of global trade, however, as the shares of manufacturing and agriculture in GDP decline, services will be the main source of growth in global trade, an expectation in part due to the assumption that transportation, insurance, and storage costs may be overall lower for services (Goldfarb 2013; Palladini 2015) and in part due to the momentum created by the 1995 General Agreement on Trade in Services (World Trade Organization 2013; Francois and Hoekman 2010). Given the merits of each viewpoint, the determinants of global trade in services have attracted growing attention. Recent comparisons of firms in manufacturing and service sectors show that service firms on average have relatively lower export participation rates, a higher return to size, and lower survival rates in export markets (Tito 2019). Available estimates suggest that impediments to cross-border gross trade in services are higher than those in goods sectors, in many cases by a multiple of two to three (Miroudot et al. 2013), and ad valorem equivalents of costs that are inferred to impede trade in services are on average very high—as high as 2,000% in several industries (Benz 2017), though these cost estimates are higher for gross trade as opposed to value-added trade (Duval et al. 2015). While these findings reinforce the traditional treatment of the service sector output as internationally non-traded, there is still considerable uncertainty about the drivers of cross-border trade in services. In this paper, we contribute to the body of literature on trade in services by examining the impact of geographic distance, jurisdictional borders, and economic size on Canadian interprovincial trade in services at the industry level from 2007 to 2013. Using a gravity model, we find that the average elasticity of trade in services with respect to distance is − 1.1, which coincides with the median estimate of average elasticity of merchandise trade with respect to distance (Head and Mayer 2014). However, we also find considerable heterogeneity across industries: the point estimates of service trade elasticity of distance are significantly higher in Arts and Health, while distance matters much less for Telecommunications and Information Technology. Distance matters for interregional trade even in industries such as Finance, Leasing, and Software. This relatively high estimate of the elasticity of service trade with respect to distance emerges in a context where cross-border service trade is fairly strong and has increased slightly over time. The strong negative association between distance and service trade may thus temper the views of those who see services as the new frontier in global trade. While the impact of distance on cross-border merchandise trade has been extensively studied, direct evidence on the impact of distance on trade in services by industry is surprisingly limited (Kimura and Lee 2006; Walsh 2008; Anderson et al. 2014). Part of the reason is that service trade across national borders is poorly tracked, and we lack comprehensive international data on trade in services (Francois and Hoekman 2010), let alone bilateral data that can be used to estimate the elasticity of international trade in services with respect to distance at the industry level.Footnote 1 Our high-quality data address the limitations of available international data on bilateral trade in service industries. Distance is of course one of the determinants of service trade. Trade in services might also be driven by “border” effects, first identified by McCallum (1995) in the case of cross-border manufacturing trade and verified since by others (Helliwell 1997; Head and Mayer 2014). While often difficult to identify individually, the border effect tends to capture factors such as region-specific information, tastes, social and distribution networks, and agglomeration economies.Footnote 2 Our estimates suggest that interprovincial trade in services is not driven by border effects. In all our model specifications, the effect of interprovincial border on trade in services is statistically insignificant.Footnote 3 Our estimates are based on interprovincial trade data that exhibit considerable concentration of service trade in terms of both regional and industrial specialization: the top three destinations of service exports from a region typically account for more than 70% of total service exports, and the top three service industries account for over 60% of total service exports from any given region. Even after controlling for exporter and importer region fixed effects common to all industries and years, our estimates show that the elasticity of trade with respect to exporter and importer GDP is highly industry specific. Another reason typically put forward to account for trade in services is trade policies (Francois and Hoekman 2010). There is considerable evidence showing that restrictive trade policies have non-negligible impact on trade (Miroudot and Shepherd 2014; Gervais 2018). Beyond trade policy, country-level differences in regulatory measures may also affect trade flows (Kox and Nordås 2007; van der Marel 2016a). Our use of interprovincial data on service trade minimizes the impact of trade policy and differences in regulatory measures, and our analysis shows that international trade in services may be affected by geographic distance, above and beyond those imposed by national trade policies and regulations. Our research complements a number of studies that explores several dimensions of trade in services. Based on bilateral trade in services of 10 OECD countries with other economies (1999–2000), Kimura and Lee (2006) compare the estimates for total service trade with those from merchandise trade, and find that distance has a greater impact on bilateral trade in services. Using OECD data for the period 1999–2001 period, Walsh (2008) finds that the gravity model fits both service and merchandise trade flows equally well, although there does not appear to be an independent impact of distance on service flows across international borders. Also, van der Marel (2016b) compares Canada’s geographic concentration of exports in services and in goods using a gravity model. Nordås (2018) uses the gravity model to study the intra-Nordic service trade. Anderson et al. (2014) use industry-level interprovincial and Canada–US bilateral trade data from 1997 to 2007, and compare the impact of an international border and distance on trade in goods versus services. They find that an international border reduces all trade, and distance has a relatively more negative impact on trade in services compared to goods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a context for our empirical analysis by summarizing the trends in service trade across provincial and territorial borders. Section 3 outlines our gravity model and discusses several empirical and theoretical aspects of our specifications. Section 4 presents our empirical findings. Section 5 concludes.

33.0,2.0,Open Economies Review,10 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-021-09627-5,"Exchange Rate Pass-Through, Monetary Policy, and Real Exchange Rates: Iceland and the 2008 Crisis",April 2022,Sebastian Edwards,Luis Cabezas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The nominal exchange rate plays a dual role in the macroeconomic adjustment process. On the one hand, it is at the center of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. On the other hand, changes in the nominal exchange rate help accommodate shocks (both external and domestic) through changes in the real exchange rate (RER). These two roles are particularly important in (very) open economies with inflation targeting regimes. For the exchange rate to play these two roles effectively, the pass-through needs to be different for different types of goods: it has to be (significantly) higher for tradables than for nontradables. If the pass-through is similar (or the same) for both categories of goods, changes in the nominal exchange rate will not be translated into adjustments in the real exchange rate, and the country will face a costlier external adjustment process.Footnote 1 This situation may arise even if the nominal exchange rate is an effective channel for transmitting monetary policy, and even if the pass-through coefficient is very low.Footnote 2 Historically, in a number of countries with relatively high inflation the pass-through has been very high (close to 1.0) and has affected nontradable goods as much as tradable goods. This has been especially the case in Latin America.Footnote 3 Most studies of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) have focused on aggregate data, and have tended to ignore these two functions of the exchange rate. In fact, very few studies have concentrated on the implications of the pass-through for external adjustment and real exchange rate accommodation. Forbes et al. (2018) have pointed out, that many central banks – including some in the most advanced countries – do not rely on systematic quantitative studies of pass-through when considering the effects of monetary policy actions. Instead, they base their analyses on rough rules of thumb. According to Forbes et al. (2018, p.5): “[I]n the US a 10%-dollar appreciation has been estimated to result in a fall in US consumer prices of around 0.5% (equivalent to a pass-through coefficient of 5%). In the UK, the Bank of England (BoE) has used estimates of the pass-through from exchange rate movements to UK consumer prices of around 20% to 30%.” A number of studies for Iceland have found an exchange rate pass-through coefficient of roughly 0.4, higher than the coefficient used for policy design and evaluation in many advanced nations. (See the discussion in Section 4 below). In this paper we use detailed data for Iceland to analyze a number of often neglected aspects of exchange rate pass-through. In particular, we investigate how changes in the nominal exchange rate are transmitted into different components of the consumer price index. Our analysis is very granular, and in the baseline estimates (Section 4) we distinguish between 12 sub-indexes in Iceland’s CPI. In Section 6 we consider even more disaggregated data, and report results for 65 indexes that go from highly tradable goods to nontradable services. This detailed analysis allows us to understand whether in Iceland the exchange rate has efficiently performed its two roles during the last 20 years or so. More specifically, we are able to rank goods by the size of the pass-through coefficient, from highest to lowest. In addition, we investigate whether there have been changes in the magnitude of the pass-through coefficient during the last 20 years. We focus, in particular, on two points in time: Iceland’s financial crisis of 2008, and the adoption of a flexible inflation targeting regime by the Central Bank of Iceland in 2009–2010. Following Sargent (1982), one would expect if there is a credible change in the monetary regime, the exchange rate pass-through coefficients would change in a significant way; these changes may even take place before the official (or legal) change in the monetary regime.Footnote 4 Because of its recent history, Iceland provides an ideal case study for investigating in great detail issues related to exchange rate pass-through. Of particular interest is the fact that in 2008 Iceland faced a dramatic banking and currency crises, which was tackled successfully using somewhat heterodox tools, including capital controls. (Edwards 2018). One of the consequences of the crisis was that in 2009–10 the Bank of Iceland introduced important changes to the inflation targeting framework that had been in place since 2001. Between that year and 2008, a rigid inflation target of 2.5% was in place, the króna was allowed to float freely, and there were no capital controls. The Central Bank of Iceland’s main policy tool was the short term interbank interest rate. However, this monetary regime did not work properly. Real interest rates were high, the króna depreciated rapidly, the inflation target was overshot every year after 2004, and the exchange rate was extremely volatile. Economic conditions between 2001 and 2008 were aptly summarized by the International Monetary Fund’s Article IV Consultation report: “inflation is high and expectations are unhinged.” (International Monetary Fund 2008, p. 24), The 2009–2010 reforms were wide-ranging and affected governance, transparency, communications, and operating procedures. The new framework was called Inflation Targeting Plus. At the governance level, the three-member Board of Governors was replaced by a single Governor, and a five-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with two external members. Under the new procedures, MPC decisions are announced the same day at a press conference, and the minutes of the meetings are released two weeks later. MPC members testify publicly in parliament twice a year, where they present their views on the economy and monetary policy. As Pétursson (2019, p. 375) has pointed out, this was a significant change relative to historical practices: “until 2009 minutes of monetary policy meetings were not published and information on the voting and individual views of the three-person decision-making body was not available.” At the operational level, the 2009–10 Inflation Targeting Plus framework introduced flexibility in the target, recognized the exchange rate as one of the most important transmission mechanisms for monetary policy, and adopted a managed float exchange rate policy. An enhanced system of macro prudential regulations that followed the guidance of the Bank of International Settlements was put in place, and capital controls on inflows were enacted as temporary measures aimed at managing capital movements and reducing exchange rate volatility. (Central Bank of Iceland 2017; Pétursson 2019; Edwards 2018, 2019). Our main findings may be summarized as follows: the pass-through into headline inflation is significantly lower than most previous works on Iceland have estimated/considered. We find a short run ERPT of the order of 0.15 and a long term ERPT of approximately 0.23. We also found that the ERPT is different for different sectors and that there was a structural break (with a significant ERPT drop) just prior to the strengthening of the flexible inflation targeting framework, in 2009–2010. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present a brief historical background of monetary and exchange rate policies in Iceland. We also provide some basic and preliminary analysis of the data. In Section 3 we develop a minimalist model to illustrate the dual role of the exchange rate in the adjustment process. In Section 4 we present the empirical results of our pass-through analysis. We report estimates using instrumental variables on error correction equations, and VARs for 12 price indexes. In Section 5 we address the question of structural breaks in the pass-through coefficients around the time the country adopted inflation targeting plus (2009–2010). In Section 6 we deal with extensions and robustness analysis. In this Section we present estimates of the pass-through coefficient for 65 very disaggregated sub-indexes of the CPI. Section 7 contains concluding remarks. In the Working Paper version of this article we include two appendixes where we report results for unit root tests and for alternative specifications for the error correction equations; see Edwards and Cabezas (2021).",5

Capital intensity of these goods are critical for the impact on wage gap when we consider capital market reform. If we neutralize that or assume that the skilled sector is capital intensive, sequence of reforms does not matter for the directional change in the wage gap but the magnitude does get affected. By sequencing of trade and capital account liberalization, we refer to the order in which these reforms are introduced in any economy. It has been observed that many developing and emerging economies face challenges regarding the appropriate order in which trade and capital account should be liberalized. For the earlier literature one may look at Diaz-Alejandro (1981), Mckinon (1982), Edwards (1984), Bruno (1985) etc. for discussions on this issue. It has been observed that different economies have approached this issue of order of trade and capital account liberalization in different manner. On the one hand, there are many developing economies (for eg. India, Brazil, China, Chile, Philippines, Bangladesh, Mexico and Thailand) that have liberalized trade first by lowering the trade barriers and then opened their capital account for foreign capital inflows. On the other hand, there also exist some economies like Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay that have opened the capital account first and then opened trade account by lowering the trade barriers. The underlying idea of this paper is that in these two kinds of economies, the impact of trade and foreign capital inflows on wage inequality will be different and depends on the order in which these reforms are undertaken. It is important to recognize here that temporal differences in reforms could be a reaction to the existing economic situation. However, it is to be noted that even if it is the economic compulsion that determines sequencing of reforms, it does not take away anything from our results because whatever be the compulsion and the background of the policy decision if there is a sequencing involved and the model is specified as ours, one must confront these results. While the main driver can be something else, groups of countries do demonstrate a pattern of sequencing. But rising wage gap has become a world-wide phenomenon. Our study clearly showed the possibility of such a case and other results with sequencing and simultaneous adoption of policies. Economists have already contributed to the understanding of the impacts of trade and capital account liberalization reforms on wage gap in various countries. There have been many empirical studies such as Vallejos and Turnovsky (2017), Mishra & Das (2013), Wu and Hsu (2012), Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007), Winters et al. (2004), Lundberg and Squire (2003) etc. Furceri & Loungani (2015) shows that capital account liberalization increases the inequality and reduces the labor share in medium and short-term using the panel data for 149 countries for the period 1970–2010. Larrain (2015) also found that capital account opening increases wage inequality in a sample of 20 primarily European countries from 1975 through 2005. But hardly one would find a paper that looks at the sequence of reforms in trade theoretic context. Theoretically various papers have looked at the issue of trade, immigration and capital market reforms for developing countries but not really at the sequence of reforms and wage gap as we model in this paper. As a sample one may look at, Feenstra and Hanson (1995), Marjit and Acharyaa (2003), Marjit et al. (2007a, b), Hellier (2019), Marjit and Kar (2005, 2019), Mandal and PrasadFootnote 1 (2019), Marjit et al. (2020), Das et al. (2020) etc. Studies like Dinopoulos et al (2011), Whang (2016) and Burstein and Vogel (2017) in the literature have looked at the impact of intra-industry trade and trade liberalization on the skill premium and output of the firms. However, it is important to note that none of the studies have looked at the impact of sequencing of reforms on skilled-unskilled wage gap as we have modelled in this paper. We start by developing a two-sector general equilibrium model of a small open developing economy. In such an economy, the unskilled goods are imported and skilled goods are exported. This country also imports an intermediate good that it uses for the import competing skilled sector. The trade pattern, where skilled goods are exported by developing economies, have been motivated from the idea that exports from the developing word do depend on skills. Matsuyama (2007) using model of “skilled-bias globalization” discusses why export destinations may require varying levels of skills. Also, Brambilla et al. (2012) and Chaudhuri & Marjit (2017) discuss various mechanisms of how exports from developing countries become more skilled as they open up for trade. The latter paper shows how exports can necessitate screening of workers with heterogeneous skills. For an example, one could also look at software services exported by India or exports of machinery and transport equipment’s in China’s export basket..Footnote 2 We examine the net impact of the external reforms w.r.t trade and foreign capital inflows on wage inequality under the three sequencing scenarios – i) Trade liberalization precedes capital account liberalization ii) Capital account liberalization precedes trade liberalization and iii) Simultaneous trade and capital account liberalization. Our findings differ from the study by Dinopoulos et al. (2011) in the following manner. Firstly, they have discussed the effect of movement from autarky to free trade on output and skill premium in intra-industry trade model with Chamberlinian mechanism of income distribution with internal economies of scale, product differentiation, and free entry and exit. However, our model considered two sector three factor model with presence of intermediate goods in the presence of perfect competition and examined the impact of not just movement from autarky to free trade instead the impact of sequencing of both capital account and trade liberalization reforms. Secondly, their findings suggest that the intra-industry trade leads to increase in output of the representative firms and further output-skill complementarity or substitutability decides the impact on skill premium. Moreover, their model is based on Chamberlinian mechanism which operates through changes in each firm's output, so their findings were found to be relevant for both the home and foreign country. Our model has considered only the small open developing economy and the findings from our study emphasizes that technological characteristics of skilled and unskilled labor-intensive goods decides the qualitative impact of sequencing of capital account and trade liberalization reforms whereas the quantitative responses can be different. Similarly, Burstein and Vogel (2017) found that the trade liberalization increases the skill premium to increase by considering a multi-country quantitative trade model that extends the standard H–O model with heterogeneity in productivity across firms within sectors. Again, this study has just focused on the impact of trade liberalization in a parametrized model of 60 countries unlike our study which have focused on the impact of sequencing of trade and capital account reforms on skilled-unskilled wage inequality both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our paper identified the pattern of sequencing very clearly which is the motivation of our study. We show that sequencing may not matter if the skilled sector is more capital intensive. Trade or Capital account policy both lead to the same outcome. The insights from our findings could be useful for the underdeveloped countries which are still in the process of liberalization to better understand how they should sequence their trade and capital account reforms so that skilled-unskilled wage gap should not widen. Our approach and the result have not been discussed in the literature. The main contribution of our paper is that whatever be the pattern of sequencing, wage gap must rise if skilled sector is K- intensive. Remaining paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 develops the Model with two sectors in the presence of an intermediate good. It has one subsection. Subsection 2.1 discusses the impact of order of reforms w.r.t trade and FDI on wage inequality. Section 3 discusses the robustness of the theoretical framework through model variations. The last section winds up the paper with the concluding remarks. Mathematical calculations are, however, relegated to the appendix.",2

Wickens,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The extent of price rigidity is a central feature of modern macro models, with strong implications for choosing optimal monetary policy regimes. In this paper we discuss how this central issue has failed to be resolved by empirical estimation and testing due to the imposition of strong priors about the degree of price flexibility. There is a long tradition of assuming general price flexibility in thinking about the economy as a whole. This included Austrian economics (White 2003), classical macroeconomics pre-Keynes and Real Business Cycle theory (Kydland and Prescott 1982). Under fully flexible prices and general equilibrium; supply/demand shocks affect output but the effects are dampened by immediate equilibrating price reactions. This tradition was interrupted by the Keynesian revolution after the Great Depression, in which a general presumption was that prices and wages were slow to adjust. Under this wage and price rigidity, demand drives output; price reactions occur later, affecting demand, which then further drives output. It may be noted that full price flexibility is not intended to mean that prices change continuously but rather that markets clear continuously at prevailing prices, including the effects of accompanying strategies with elements such as advertising, loyalty rewards, store offers, and financing deals, which between them create an ‘effective price’. It might be thought that the extensive micro data on prices (Le et al. 2021) showing that many prices change infrequently with a minority changing with high frequency settles this controversy in favour of price rigidity models. However, the price flexibility model is potentially consistent with this micro data, because market-clearing is not directly observable while the non-price elements above are in practice not surveyed regularly like prices; thus the model makes no predictions about price change frequency, merely that whatever effective price changes occur achieve market-clearing. Furthermore, the models we are dealing with apply to macro data and use micro-founded assumptions about the actions of representative agents designed to predict average, i.e. macro, behaviour on an ‘as if’ basis (Friedman 1953). These models can therefore only be tested on their ability to mimic macro behaviour. The significance of different assumptions about the degree of price flexibility can be illustrated by considering the impulse response functions of various shocks on output under the two contrasting assumptions of standard New Keynesian price/wage rigidity and full price/wage flexibility where there is no delay in price adjustment to changing marginal costs or in wage adjustment to the changing marginal utility of leisure. We show in Fig. 1 the differing output effects of a large selection of shocks under both assumptions (a replica of Fig. 6 from Le et al. 2021). Notice how output reacts more and for longer under rigidity to shocks that affect demand. Output IRFs to various shocks under NK and Flex-Price models",1

The monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) to offset this extraordinary shock has been effective in improving banks’ lending conditions for firms and households and has indirectly created fiscal capacity for high-debt countries in the Euro Area (EA). In particular, the paper shows the impact of these expansionary policy measures on the main spreads observed in the financial markets and on inflation expectations. The ECB has utilised various instruments to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanisms, to mitigate the fragmentation of financial markets and to facilitate liquidity provision to the banking sector in the EA. The present paper aims to analyse these instruments and to assess their specific economic impact. In this perspective, it aims to contribute to two strands of literature. The first strand examines the effects of the monetary policy designed to offset the impact of the Covid-19 shock on financial markets and the economy.Footnote 1 The second strand relates to the use of event-study methodologies to examine the effects of monetary policy announcements.Footnote 2 These methodologies have recently been extended to study the impact of unconventional monetary policies.Footnote 3 In our work we mainly refer to Szczerbowicz (2015) and Altavilla and Giannone (2017), which focus on the monetary policies implemented by the ECB after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Both papers show that announcements of some exceptional liquidity measures and the central bank’s asset purchases have significantly stabilised financial markets and have lowered banks’ refinancing costs and governments’ financial charges. Our paper extends this approach to study the effects of the ECB’s post-Covid-19 policies on bank lending and government borrowing costs. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the main policy measures implemented by the ECB to overcome the Covid-19 shock. Section 3 complements the ECB’s policy initiatives in 2020 with the ECB’s announcements in the same year to build a string of monetary events. Section 4 provides a dynamic and qualitative view of inflation expectations and of the most relevant spreads in financial markets. Section 5, divided into three subsections, refers to an event-based analysis to assess the impacts of the ECB’s policy measures on these spreads and on inflationary expectations. Section 6 concludes the paper.",3

Lacking an effective vaccine at that time, the Covid-19 outbreak triggered a massive rise in uncertainty (Baker et al. 2020). More notably, countries around the world implemented drastic measures, from border closures to national lockdowns, to slow and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The macroeconomic consequences of the pandemic have been dramatic. Economic activity temporarily collapsed on a global scale. According to the International Monetary Fund (2021), world output declined by more than 3 percent in 2020. Similarly, some cross-border activities, such as merchandise trade and travel, contracted sharply. For world trade, for instance, the World Trade Organization (2021) estimates a fall by more than 5 percent in 2020. The impact of the pandemic on international capital flows, in contrast, is much less evident. At the beginning of the crisis, at a time of financial market turbulences, some countries experienced substantial capital outflows. In perspective, however, net outflows have been of a magnitude comparable to those seen in previous stress events (Batini 2020).Footnote 1 Moreover, the flight-to-safety episode was remarkably short-lived, partly due to massive central bank intervention (Lane 2020).Footnote 2 In principle, one can think of a number of channels through which a global pandemic might affect cross-border capital movements. One is the impact of uncertainty on international portfolio allocation. As risk increases, investors tend to reassess their positions, and portfolio realignment may then result in safe haven capital flows (Habib and Stracca 2013). Another channel focuses on the sensitivity of gross capital flows to economic conditions. Since capital flows are often found to be pro-cyclical, they are likely to fall during an economic slowdown, and maybe even to collapse in a crisis (Broner et al. 2013; Papaioannou et al. 2013). Moreover, measures to fight the pandemic, such as the closure of borders, may depress capital flows further. In this paper, we examine empirically the effect of policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic on German international capital flows. In particular, we make use of highly disaggregated monthly data from the German balance of payments statistics for the period from January 2019 to January 2021, which allows us to analyze the financial interactions of a single country, Germany, with foreign counterparts along multiple dimensions over the course of the pandemic. Exploiting then the variation in government response measures to Covid-19 across partner countries and time, we estimate the effect of national policies to slow the transmission of Covid-19 and economic support policies on a broad set of capital flow measures.Footnote 3 Previewing our results, we find that German capital flows are sensitive to foreign policies in response to Covid-19, with the effect depending on the type of policies implemented. More specifically, German capital flows tend to decline when a partner country adopts stricter containment and closure policies. The stringency of lockdowns, therefore, has a negative effect on bilateral financial interactions, an effect which becomes larger the longer the pandemic drags on. For economic policies, in contrast, greater government intervention in response to Covid-19 seems to be associated with larger financial flows. Economic support measures tend to strengthen bilateral financial interactions, especially during the early phase of the pandemic. Finally, to the extent that public interventions to fight the pandemic affect financial interactions, the adjustment mainly takes place within relationships which continue to exist (i.e., along the intensive margin). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data and our empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, Section 5 briefly concludes.",3

33.0,5.0,Open Economies Review,24 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09701-6,Editorial – Recent Trends in International Reserves: Theory and Evidence,November 2022,Alexander Mihailov,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"To provide a perspective on the theme of focus of the workshop and this special issue, it will be useful to propose a dense overview of the seminal early literature on international reserves. That literature perceived reserves, essentially, as a buffer stock, concentrating on their relationship with liquidity (Balogh 1960; Caves, 1964). Balogh (1960) seems to have been among the first to propose an economic theory of reserve holdings, where the level of international reserves depended on the objective of economic policy and provided liquidity to the economy. Caves (1964), consequently, defined the liquidity problem as financing the United States (US) trade deficit,Footnote 1 and analyzed the role of international reserves in the context of fixed exchange rates. Heller (1966), then, discussed three motives for holding reserves, by analogy with the motives for holding money in the Keynesian tradition: (i) a transaction motive; (ii) a precautionary motive; and (iii) a speculative motive. He appears also to have been the first to propose an optimal reserve function, taking adjustment cost and opportunity cost into account. Mihailov and Nasir (this issue) revisit the modeling of optimal reserves and derive an encompassing formula. It is widely accepted in the subsequent literature that the above three motives are the “traditional factors” of the optimal reserve function. Clark (1970), Kelly (1970), and Hamada and Ueda (1977) developed this “traditional view” in terms of modifying some assumptions, but their key result remained consistent with Heller (1966): the optimal reserve level increases with balance of payments (BoP) volatility and decreases with the propensity to import and the opportunity cost of reserve holdings. Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) proposed a buffer stock model for the optimal reserve level based on the same two types of costs. The opportunity cost was defined as a comparison of alternative investment returns, and the cost of adjustment as the cost of reserve depletion. In order to determine the optimal level of reserves, both costs were minimized. However, a tradeoff emerged: the opportunity cost increases when reserves are at a high level, whereas a high level of reserves is associated with a lower adjustment cost. The costs of reserves are reconsidered in Levy Yeyati and Gómez (this issue) and Torriani et al. (this issue). As trade and financial liberalization was progressing with a rapid pace in the course of the 1990s, precautionary demand for holding international reserves gained more prominence in the analysis. Ben-Bassat and Gottlieb (1992) introduced the effect of sovereign risk on it and discussed the cost of decreasing the reserve level, which might be taken as a signal of an external payment problem for a country with external debt. The authors also pointed out that past defaults mattered: therefore, a country that has experienced a default should hold more reserves to sustain its international credibility. In the wake of the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998, researchers and policymakers also became concerned with the issue of “reserve adequacy”, allowing a safeguard for a country from a “sudden stop” of capital inflows. Some simple policy rules were proposed in order to provide insurance for economies which had a risk of vulnerability from such episodes or crises – as in the contribution of Mihailov and Nasir (this issue). Feldstein (1999) argued that the accumulation of foreign reserves was an insurance against sudden stops of capital inflows and capital outflows in emerging market economies (EMEs). Greenspan (1999) similarly suggested a pragmatic measure of the “optimal” level of international reserves, equal to a country’s short-term external debt (STED). Along such lines, Eichengreen and Mathieson (2000) analyzed the importance of the currency composition of international reserves, a topic that recurs in Dooley et al. (this issue), Iancu et al. (this issue), and Laser and Weidner (this issue). The most recent literature has made considerable further progress. Bianchi et al. (2018) model international reserves as non-state-contingent assets that provide insurance against rollover risk. Differently from Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009), who quantify optimal reserves at the counterintuitive level of zero, Bianchi et al. (2018) assume that the debt may not be repaid in full in the next period, leading to the emergence of debt rollover risk, and quantify optimal reserves for EMEs in their endowment model at 6% of national income. Bianchi and Sosa-Padilla (2020) further examine a macroeconomic stabilization channel and its interaction with a precautionary motive. They depart from the existing work by incorporating nominal rigidities, which also gives rise to a macroeconomic stabilization hedging role for international reserves. Their key contribution consists in proposing a theory that is quantitatively consistent with the observed levels of reserves in EMEs, also linking, both theoretically and empirically, the accumulation of international reserves to the exchange rate regime. In turn, Arce et al. (2019) study the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, employing the idea that the motive for reserve accumulation derives instead from the correction of an externality, indeed typical for the literature on the mercantilist motive of reserve holdings. The mercantilist motive explains reserve accumulation as a by-product of industrial policies promoting exports when there are growth externalities (see, e.g., Rodrik 2006; Benigno and Fornaro, 2012). Yet in contrast to that literature, they focus on an externality originating in financial markets and leading to excessive systemic risk. These very recent advances have also viewed reserve accumulation as a kind of macroprudential policy.",1

Figure 1 shows that middle-income countries account for nearly a half of this increase. International Reserves, trn USD. Source: IMF’s International Financial Statistics and World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Our sample of 34 countries, listed in Table 2 (further below), includes mostly middle-income countries Consequently, the accumulation of international reserves in emerging market economies (EMEs) has become one of the most debated issues in open-economy macroeconomics (Chinn et al. 1999; Aizenman and Marion 2003; Dooley et al. 2004; Jeanne and Rancière 2006, 2011; Caballero and Panageas 2007, 2008; Alfaro and Kanczuk 2009; Durdu et al. 2009; Benigno and Fornaro 2012; Calvo et al. 2012; Dominguez et al. 2012; Bianchi et al. 2013, 2018; Arce et al. 2019; Bianchi and Sosa-Padilla 2020). Have many EMEs, in fact, accumulated excessive rather than adequate reserves? And what is an optimal ratio of reserves to output in a small open economy (SOE)? There is no consensus in the recent literature,Footnote 1 which offers contradictory explanations on these questions of immediate policy relevance. In particular, there is a long-lasting debate whether reserve accumulation is driven by a self-insurance motive against abrupt capital flow reversals; or by the so-called ‘new’ or ‘modern’ mercantilism, i.e., hoarding international reserves as part of a development strategy, which facilitates growth by maintaining an undervalued currency and by serving as ‘collateral’ to encourage foreign direct investment (see, e.g., Aizenman and Lee 2007; Aizenman and Sun 2009). Figure 2, however, makes it clear that the overall trend of rising international reserves, when expressed in terms of external debt, is largely accounted for by the Asian EMEs, especially after their bitter experience with the South-East Asian financial crisis. This observation points to the hypothesis that international reserves are likely to be accumulated in Asia with different motives and magnitudes compared to the other EMEs, and therefore may need a different modelling approach. International Reserves as % of Total External Debt by World Regions in Our Sample. Source: Data is for our sample of 34 countries listed in Table 2, as grouped by continent, from IMF’s International Financial Statistics and World Bank’s World Development Indicators On the other hand, when expressed relative to broad money or GDP, as in Figs. 3 and 4, the increasing trend in international reserves looks more uniform across EMEs, and perhaps may potentially be well explained by a common theoretical framework. International Reserves as % of Broad Money by World Regions in Our Sample. Source: Data and grouping as in Fig. 2 International Reserves as % of GDP by World Regions in Our Sample. Source: Data and grouping as in Fig. 2 Basically, two main benefits of large reserve holdings have been emphasized: (i) international reserves provide liquidity to smooth consumption (e.g., Jeanne and Rancière 2006, 2011); (ii) international reserves give a flexibility to manage sizable capital outflows in periods of crises (e.g., Aizenman et al. 2007). Moreover, it has also been argued that reserve policies can help guard away an economy from a crisis or contribute to a recovery after a crisis (Aizenman and Marion 2004; Dominguez et al. 2012). The issue of reserve accumulation has been discussed under two main approaches: (i) one of them rationalizes why EMEs hold a high level of reserves as a form of self-insurance against ‘sudden stops’Footnote 2 in capital inflows (Chinn et al. 1999; Greenspan, 1999; Eichengreen and Mathieson 2000; Aizenman and Marion 2003, 2004; Dooley et al. 2004; Aizenman et al. 2007; Dominguez et al. 2012); (ii) the other examines what the determinants of reserve holdings are and, furthermore, what the optimal level of reserves is (Jeanne and Rancière 2006, 2011; Caballero and Panageas 2007, 2008; Alfaro and Kanczuk 2009; Durdu et al. 2009; Calvo et al. 2012; Bianchi et al. 2013, 2018). Jeanne and Rancière (2006, 2011), in particular, have considered the role of optimal international reserves as an insurance against sudden stops in capital inflows in an endowment SOE, abstracting from physical capital accumulation through investment. Yet, the literature has not analyzed this important role reserves play in a richer SOE set-up that models production and investment explicitly. Our contribution with the present theoretical paper consists in filling in this gap. Indeed, most studies on international reserves have focused on other reserve-related issues, such as active reserve management (e.g., Aizenman et al. 2007) or the new type of monetary mercantilism (e.g., Aizenman and Lee 2007). While Jeanne and Rancière (2006, 2011) do consider optimal reserves in a SOE framework, essential features in neoclassical growth theory as well as in reality, such as production technology and production factors, remain outside the scope of their model. In concluding, these authors admit that their analysis is based on a stylized framework and one way to make it more realistic would be to add productive capital and investment. They suggest that the effects of such an extension are a priori ambiguous: on one hand, investment offers a new margin to smooth consumption, which would tend to reduce the optimal level of international reserves in terms of output; on the other hand, there will be a new benefit from reserves, namely, to smooth domestic investment and output, that may tend to increase the optimal reserves-to-GDP ratio. Which one of these two effects will dominate is not obvious before an explicit careful investigation. This unexplored research question of central interest motivates our present work, also aiming to better understand the key determinants of the optimal level of international reserves in models of production SOEs. International Reserves and Investment as % of GDP by Middle-Income Country. Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators, and authors’ calculations. Data on reserves to GDP ratios and gross capital formation are for 2019 (2016 for Jordan only due to lack of data) for the 34 middle income countries in the our/JR sample, as listed in Table 2. The estimated slope coefficient for 2019 (and 15 other years: see footnote 3) is not statistically significant at all conventional levels Figure 5 shows a scatter plot of the relationship in 2019 between the ratios of investment and international reserves, respectively, to GDP in the sample of 34 middle-income EMEs used in Jeanne and Rancière (2011), referred to henceforth as JR. This figure could serve as another motivation, in particular for the theoretical nature of the study we undertake here. It is insightful to note that the regression coefficient for the scatter plot is not statistically significant at all conventional levels, and this is also the case for 15 other years in the sample.Footnote 3 Only for 7 years in our sampleFootnote 4 such a scatter plot obtains a statistically significant coefficient at the 1% level, a slope which is also minimally positive. In conclusion, there is generally no correlation between investment and reserves in the data, at least for our type of countries. In such a sense, theoretical modelling may help guide such an analysis. Along these lines or argument, and beyond, our paper proposes an extension to a production economy of the endowment SOE model in JR. More fundamentally, in doing so we bring together two strands of literature that have evolved independently and separately from each other over many years, namely neoclassical growth theory of the 1950s and 1960s and the open-economy theory of capital flows under the risk of sudden stops since the late 1990s. JR have developed an ‘insurance model’ of optimal international reserves where the representative consumer can smooth consumption during sudden stops if the central bank in an endowment SOE holds a stock of international reserves. The authors derive a closed-form expression for the optimal level of reserves relative to the level of output, and quantify it at \(9.1\%\). They agree that this value cannot account for the rising reserve levels in EMEs since the late 1990s, especially in South-East Asia, which can clearly be seen by looking back into Fig. 4. Our extension of the JR endowment SOE in the present paper aims to incorporate investment, capital, labour and production in this modelling approach. As demonstrated and discussed further down, we first derive a richer analytical version of the optimal reserves formula in our extended set-up, essentially driven by productivity and the saving rate, which the endowment SOE benchmark misses. We further derive novel theoretical results that highlight explicitly the roles of investment, the capital stock, labour and technology on the level of reserves to GDP. We illustrate and analyze the effects of the key determinants of the optimal reserves-to-output ratio, focusing on those that were revealed by the richer production SOE model we worked with, extending the endowment SOE benchmark. Under a plausible calibration based on the 1975-2020 period for typical emerging market countries facing the risk of sudden stops in capital inflows, we then find that the optimal reserves-to-output ratio in our production SOE model is 7.5%. This is the mid-point in the range between the reserve ratio in Jeanne and Rancière’s (2011) endowment SOE, of 9.1%, calibrated to the same sample of 34 middle-income countries, and that in Bianchi et al. (2018), of 6.0%, obtained in a different, sovereign debt model without capital and production. We explain the lower optimal reserves-to-output ratio relative to the endowment SOE of Jeanne and Rancière (2011) by the role of capital accumulation as precautionary saving in our extension: the accumulated capital stock can potentially be used as a pledge to external creditors in obtaining borrowing. Such a ‘collateral’ function of the capital stock enhanced by flows of saving and investment insures better a SOE against sudden stops, and hence it should optimally hold less international reserves in terms of GDP. Since the countries in our sample appear quite heterogeneous (e.g., in Figs. 2 through 4), we also compute the optimal reserves-to-output ratio by world region. This regional analysis reveals that the insurance SOE model of reserves we extend to production is validated empirically in terms of matching well the average reserves-to-output ratio in the data for Latin America, at just above 10%. This world region has the highest weight in our sample, and represents nearly half of it, 16 countries, so the empirical validation is important. However, for Asia (with 8 countries in our sample), Africa (with 5 countries) and Europe (with 5 countries too), our regional model-based ratios understate considerably the respective data averages. We conclude that the insurance modelling of reserves we followed is empirically relevant for Latin American economies, but alternative approaches need to be explored for other world regions – unless this mismatch indicates the extent of reserves hoarding in them. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our extension to production of the JR endowment small open economy. The results of our calibration and quantification exercise, for the whole sample and by regional subsamples, are discussed and illustrated in Sect. 3, and Sect. 4 concludes.

Embedded in its strategy to “stimulate the openness, strength and resilience of the EU’s economic and financial system”, the European Commission mentions concrete measures to promote the international use of the euro (EUR). The European Commission in particular aims at establishing the EUR as a means of payment in the energy and the commodities sectors, at increasing depth and liquidity of the EU’s capital markets for example by issuing euro-demominated bonds, and at promoting sustainable finance. In addition, the European Commission is supportive of the introduction of a European digital currency, also to bolster the attractiveness of the EUR (European Commission 2021). Given the mixed performance of the EUR with regard to its perceived stability during the euro crisis and its decreasing relative importance as an international reserve currency, it is difficult to assess the prospects of success measured against these ambitions (Maggiori et al. (2019), The Economist (2019)). Not only since Mr. Juncker’s announcement in 2018 international reserves have been of considerable interest for academics and policy makers. International currency reserves not only increasingly play an important role for international currency markets and exchange rates but also more broadly in terms of geopolitics and the global economy. During recent years, holdings of international reserves have grown at an extremely fast pace, as shown by Fig. 1. According to the IMF International Financial Statistics (IFS) international reserves have seen a more than eightfold increase over the last two and a half decades.Footnote 1 This development has largely been driven by a small group of countries, as the ten biggest holders of reserves account for 70% of worldwide international reserves. China and Japan alone managed around 39% of worldwide international reserves in 2016.Footnote 2 Volume of international reserves (in trillion USD). Notes: The line (left axis) corresponds to aggregated worldwide international reserves volumes without gold. The bars (right axis) display respective year-over-year growth rates. [Please use colors in print.] Source: IMF International Financial Statistics The academic literature dealing with international reserves can broadly be separated into research questions concerning what determines the size of a country’s overall reserve holdings and those concerning a country’s drivers for its currency composition. We focus on the latter. While empirical examinations of currency compositions are hampered by limited access to relevant IMF data on country-specific reserve compositions, we compile a new dataset based on all countries publicly disclosing their data. Making use of country-specific data, we test the relevance of transaction motives in determining currency compositions. Transaction motives with respect to the currency compositions of foreign exchange reserves refer to bolstering a country’s preparedness for potential foreign exchange interventions, current account interventions, or temporary import financing. Our main findings suggest that currency compositions of international reserves under central bank management are influenced by currency pegs and trade patterns. Thus we are able to confirm previous academic findings (see Heller and Knight (1978), Dooley et al. (1989), Eichengreen et al. (2000) and recently Aizenman et al. (2019)). Unlike these papers, we place more focus on the specific role of the EUR, which since its introduction has been considered a serious competitor to the USD on international currency reserve markets by some. For instance, Bergsten (1997) calls the EUR the new rival to the USD and expects the establishment of a ‘bipolar currency regime’ and Chinn and Frankel (2008) describe scenarios in which the EUR will replace the USD as the main international reserve currency. In particular, we aim to disentangle the impact of the euro crisis on the euro’s role as an international reserve currency. Splitting the sample into pre-crisis and crisis subsamples, we analyse the effect of the crisis on the determinants of currency compositions. We identify a significant and negative impact of the euro crisis on EUR holdings across countries. Additionally, our findings suggest that the euro crisis impacted on the effect of the determinants of currency compositions, rendering proxies for bilateral economic interdependence more relevant. We cautiously interpret this as a setback for the EUR as an international reserve currency. In a final exercise, we use our model to predict currency compositions of the three most important non-disclosing holders of international reserves, China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we address the related literature. In Sect. 3, we present our data and descriptive findings. Section 4 is dedicated to analyzing determinants of country-specific reserve compositions, the role of the euro crisis and provides predictions of currency shares for non-disclosing countries. In Sect. 5, we summarize and discuss our findings.",

But simple explanations for financial fragility based on public overborrowing, which in turn assume that emerging markets are unable to contain fiscal spending, are at best incomplete, given that emerging markets encounter problems at levels of debt that are low by the standards of advanced countries. Further hypotheses are therefore needed to make sense of this phenomenon. A first hypothesis is that emerging markets are burdened by more serious credibility problems than their advanced-country counterparts. If for whatever reason their commitment to fiscal sustainability is less credible, markets will be quicker to anticipate defaults and inflation surprises; hence such countries will face higher interest rates and more jittery investors. This hypothesis resonates with economists, from advanced countries in particular, who are predisposed to think that if emerging markets and developing countries get into trouble, those countries themselves must be at blame. But these hypotheses leave unanswered why emerging markets might be systematically less credible than advanced countries.Footnote 2 This gap in argumentation in turn means that no guidance is provided on what they can do to escape their predicament (see Calvo 1988). A second hypothesis is that emerging markets display fear of floating (Calvo and Reinhart 2002). Because they do not allow their exchange rates to fluctuate and thereby absorb shocks, they expose themselves to currency misalignments that result in exchange rate crises rather than smooth adjustment. Again, however, the question of what causes this this fear of floating is left hanging. One possible answer is the lack of credibility of their monetary policies resulting in high passthrough from exchange rate movements to prices, which renders more flexible exchange rates costly and undesirable. But this answer only leads back to the previous problem, namely that the lack of credibility is unexplained. A third hypothesis focuses on currency mismatches on national balance sheets (Goldstein and Turner 2004). If a country has net foreign currency exposure, then it is more vulnerable to a crisis. Bad times will cause a currency depreciation that raises the cost of debt service, and that higher cost of debt service can result in further currency depreciation, in a vicious circle. But, again, this explanation goes only part way toward answering the question. Are currency mismatches just a policy mistake, or do they have a deeper cause? Twenty-five years ago, we proposed another interpretation. We argued that the central cause of financial fragility is the inability of countries to denominate their foreign obligations in their own currency, a phenomenon that we termed “original sin.” We showed that the phenomenon is too widespread to be explained by unfavorable monetary and financial history. Certainly, many countries with a history of inflation and default suffer from original sin, but many others with relatively unblemished monetary and financial histories do so as well. We showed that the only robust correlate of a country's ability to borrow abroad in its own currency was its economic size. We speculated that this reflected the structure of investor demand (lack of appetite of international investors for obligations denominated in the currencies of small countries) and liquidity issues (that such obligations trade in thin markets) rather than the peculiarities of a country's own history. We showed that the consequences were far-reaching. Inability to issue external debt in the country’s own currency is correlated with fear of floating, with the need to hold additional international reserves, with higher volatility of output and capital flows, and with lower credit ratings. Moreover, countries exhibiting this problem display procyclical rather than countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies. Hausmann et al. (2001) showed that fear of floating was robustly related to original sin, not to exchange rate passthrough. Flandreau and Sussman (2005) showed that original sin was highly persistent, having changed little since the middle of the nineteenth century. A lot of liquidity has flowed under the bridge in the past quarter century, in both the ""real"" world of finance and academia. More governments have succeeded in issuing international debt in domestic currency, and still others have seen greater participation of foreign investors in their domestic local-currency debt markets (Carstens and Shin 2019; Hofmann et al. 2020, 2021; Shin and Von Peter 2022). These observations in turn suggest important research questions. For example, were these changes due to much improved liquidity in those markets after the adoption of social security reforms that facilitated the establishment and development of pension funds? Did more credible inflation targeting regimes reduce one-sided currency risks and facilitate foreign participation? Hausmann and Panizza (2011) assessed this issue a bit over a decade ago; they showed that there had been modest progress in reducing original sin and considerable progress in implementing countercyclical macroeconomic policies, thanks to a reduction of currency mismatches and also to the accumulation of international reserves. In this paper, we assess the changes in original sin over the quarter century since we originally visited this topic. We are “unrepentant.” We show that in the majority of developing countries the pattern persists. Emerging-market governments (defined here as middle-income countries with access to international financial markets and which tend to be included in the leading emerging market bond indices) have made progress in placing external debt securities denominated in their own national currencies with international investors. Low-income countries, in contrast, have made little such progress. Hence the case for currency hedges for low-income countries. Moreover, for emerging markets and developing countries overall, local currency issuance peaked in 2008–2011, a period of rapid growth in the emerging-market world and when advanced-country central banks, responding to the global financial crisis, cut interest rates to zero, encouraging investors to migrate toward bonds of other countries denominated in other currencies. Our data show that a nonnegligible share of that progress was reversed subsequently. In terms of determinants, our previous results carry over. Aggregate country size remains the most robust determinant of the extent of original sin. It remains considerably more difficult for small as opposed to large countries to issue domestic-currency debt and sell it to foreign investors. Evidence of weak policies and institutions as a factor behind this pattern is more limited. This suggests that structural problems in international financial markets, and not simply current and past problems in individual emerging markets and developing countries, play a role in the phenomenon. And that conclusion in turn suggests also that there is a role for systemic solutions, such as ramping up international mechanisms that might enable such countries to better hedge their currency exposures.",1

In general, the coordination of macroeconomic policies is the task of central institutions in most federal systems, where stabilization and redistribution typically operate at a federal level, while allocation is often partly decentralized (Musgrave 1959; Escolano et al. 2014). Beyond the important role of monetary and structural policies, the focus of this work is on fiscal stabilization, in particular it tries to disentangle the role of fiscal policy conducted at the federal level in stabilizing the economy, by studying the case of the United States. In the US, monetary policy is conducted at the federal level by the Federal Reserve; structural policies are determined to some extent at the federal level, but also at the state and local levels; and fiscal policies are conducted at federal, state, and local levels. Nevertheless, the largest capacity for conducting fiscal policy to stabilize the economy remains at the federal level.  The literature on fiscal stabilization and risk sharing in the US has traditionally provided a reference for the establishment of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). For example in the early 1990s Sachs and Sala-i-Martin (1992); Von Hagen (1992); and Bayoumi and Masson (1995) proposed different approaches to quantify the role of fiscal transfers for redistribution and risk sharing in the US and to draw lessons for the forthcoming EMU. More recently, Bilbiie et al. (2021) use the US experience to discuss the option of a common European Unemployment Insurance Scheme. Yet, it is worth highlighting that due to its specific features the EMU does not represent in itself a single country or a political unionFootnote 1 and the option of fiscal transfers is necessarily constrained. The EMU has a different setup from the US, without common fiscal instruments for macroeconomic stabilization (Nikolov 2016; Bibow 2019). While monetary policy is fully centralized at the common level, the responsibility for fiscal policies remains entirely national, without a common fiscal capacity, in an unprecedented divergence between the main monetary and fiscal authorities (Goodhart 1998). The analysis of fiscal stabilization in the US is especially relevant because of this specific element of the EMU architecture: centralized monetary policy vs. de-centralized fiscal policy. The budget of the European Union (EU) is small in comparison to the sum of the national budgets; it accounts for roughly 1 percent of the EU’s GDP, and it mainly performs an allocative function, so far. On average, 80 percent of the budget returns to the member states, and recent estimates show that its net redistributive and stabilization impact is much lower than in the US (Pasimeni and Riso 2018). ProposalsFootnote 2 for the future of the EMU contain provisions for a euro area fiscal stabilization function to be developed over the longer term. The recent response provided by the EU to counteract the effects of the pandemic includes for the first time a common borrowing capacity to finance the “Next Generation EU” instrument, that some see as a possible embryo of a stable fiscal stabilization capacity (Guttenberg et al. 2021). It seems therefore useful to study how fiscal stabilization works in the United States – as a pertinent example of a well-established monetary union in a federal country, comprising 50 states. This paper enhances our knowledge about the actual macroeconomic stabilization performed by fiscal instruments in the US, in three ways: first, it measures stabilization not only as inter-state risk-sharing of asymmetric shocks, but also as intertemporal stabilization of common shocks; second, it provides a detailed breakdown of specific items in the US federal budget, both on the revenue and on the expenditure side; and finally it also measures the impact of the federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the Great Recession. The analysis helps draw some insights from the experience of a monetary union equipped with fiscal shock absorbers, which can guide the reflections about the future of the EMU without prejudice to the pace of its further deepening. In particular, we investigate the relative importance and stabilization impact of the US federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the Great Recession. The insights will be particularly useful in view of the new, deeper and more abrupt shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In drawing lessons from the US experience during the Great Recession, we always acknowledge the institutional differences between a federal state, such as the US, and a supranational entity, such as the EMU. The paper is structured as follows: the next section discusses the problem of macroeconomic stabilization in supranational entities and reviews the literature on this topic; the following section briefly illustrates how fiscal stabilization works in the US and in the EMU. Section 4 explains the methodology and the data used in our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the results of the estimations of the role of budgetary items for fiscal stabilization in the US, by distinguishing the role of intertemporal and interstate stabilization and by applying both a static and a panel vector autoregression (panel VAR) methodology. Section 6 elaborates further on the role of the emergency unemployment compensation enacted in response to the Great Recession. Section 7 discusses the results obtained and the last section, finally, concludes by suggesting some implications for the EMU architecture.",3

Barnett,Unal Eryilmaz,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Uniqueness and multiplicity of equilibrium solutions have brought a rigorous discussion and research inspiration in the economics literature. Determinacy concerns the existence of a unique equilibrium path of a dynamic system. Equilibrium of a macroeconomic model is called determinate, as defined by McCallum (2009b), if it is locally unique and dynamically stable under relevant specifications of policy tools. Studying the determinacy issues in a wide range of models has been an important subject among macroeconomists. One of the reasons for high focus on the subject is the fact that uniqueness of the solution path plays an important role for policy makers and researchers. Determinacy is important to the monetary authority in designing policy to manage inflationary expectations and preventing self-fulfilling economic fluctuations. Indeterminacy permits existence of multiple solutions, which could be fundamental equilibria or nonfundamental sunspot equilibria, as suggested by McCallum (2003) and Bullard (2006), among other authors. McCallum (2003) further divides the indeterminacy cases into two categories: failure of the model to determine the values of nominal variables (nominal indeterminacy) or of real variables (real indeterminacy). But Woodford (2003b) finds the distinction to be insignificant. He argues that both types of indeterminacy are quantitatively indifferent. Models with indeterminate solutions, as stressed by Bullard and Mitra (2002), are considered undesirable for macroeconomic analysis and policy design. In the presence of indeterminacy, as pointed out by McCallum (2003), Gauthier and Guesnerie (2005), Beyer and Farmer (2007) and others, non-fundamental shocks trigger extra variance and fluctuations in the economy. Then policy makers, unable to acquire full information, encounter unforeseen problems in monetary policy design. On the other hand, as Benhabib et al. (2001) point out, multiplicity of deterministic solutions might be informative about different regimes associated with certain equilibria of the model. Therefore, models with multiple equilibria can serve as a foundation for regime-switching models. Aruoba et al. (2018), for example, imposing a zero lower bound constraint on the interest rate rule, develop a New Keynesian model in which a sunspot shock moves the economy between a targeted-inflation regime and a deflation regime. Isakin and Ngo (2021) show that while the central bank pursues an active policy rule to stabilize both inflation and output, traditional New Keynesian models might result in three deterministic equilibria, associated with three stochastic regimes. Following Clarida et al. (2000) seminal work, interest has been growing in the determinacy issue associated with certain types of monetary policy rules in the context of different model settings, with inflation being a primary concern. Studying determinacy of macroeconomic models, as suggested by Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011), requires attention to trend inflation, and to the monetary authority’s policy responses to inflation rate, price level, and output gap or output growth. In particular, consideration must be given to forward or backward-looking approaches and complementary policy tools such as interest rate smoothing. In addition, macroeconomic models must consider sticky or flexible prices, closed or open economy, and other variables and structure potentially affecting the overall results. Learnability and determinacy properties are often studied together in New Keynesian open economy models. Although McCallum (2003, 2007, 2009b) and Bullard (2006) argue that learnability is a more essential criterion than determinacy for a plausible rational expectations equilibrium, learnable equilibria are normally determinate, while the converse is not necessarily true. Bullard and Mitra (2002), using the methodology of Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001), evaluate the Taylor-type monetary policy rules based on determinacy, expectational stability, and learnability. They find that monetary policy rules satisfying the Taylor Principle usually produce both determinate and learnable equilibria. They conclude that the determinacy settings of the equilibrium depend not only upon the monetary policy rule but also on the overall configuration of the economic structure. Llosa and Tuesta (2008) investigate under which conditions rule-based policies could generate a determinate and learnable rational expectational equilibrium in a New Keynesian open economy model. Similar to the findings by Zanna (2003), De Fiore and Liu (2005) and Bullard and Schaling (2006), Llosa and Tuesta (2008) find that the effects of trade openness depend on the elasticity of substitution between tradable domestic and imported goods. Moreover, with contemporaneous data, the Taylor principle satisfies necessary and sufficient conditions for determinate and learnable equilibria. The monetary authority could achieve unique equilibrium by targeting either the CPI or domestic inflation, while a managed exchange rate policy could ease the extent of response to inflation. With forecasted data on the other hand, openness makes it harder to achieve a determinate and learnable equilibrium. Then the monetary authority should employ an aggressive response to domestic inflation to prevent indeterminacy. Nevertheless, substantial additional analytical and empirical research remains to be done in exploring determinacy issues of New Keynesian open economy models. Different model configurations provide valuable insights into possible indeterminacy problems. Carlstrom et al. (2006) have found that regardless of what price index the monetary authority considers, the Taylor Principle holds in a multi-sector economy in which sectors differ in price stickiness. Taylor Principle has often been considered the right policy tool to achieve determinacy in equilibrium. But under certain circumstances, such as the presence of trend inflation, the Taylor Principle fails to guarantee determinacy. Giannoni (2014) and Ambler and Lam (2015) argue that interest rate rules that respond to fluctuations in price-level are less prone to equilibrium indeterminacy than interest rate rules, such as Taylor rules, which respond to fluctuations in inflation rate. Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011), Huang and Thurston (2012), and Hirose et al. (2020) argue that the Taylor Principle does not guarantee determinacy of New Keynesian models, especially in the presence of positive trend inflation. Hirose et al. (2020), in their study of Great Inflation of 1970’s in the US, conclude that to achieve determinacy within a generalized New Keynesian framework, an active interest rate policy should be run along with a lower trend inflation (lower inflation target), or with diminished policy response to the output gap, or with firmer response to output growth. Kiley (2007) shows that as trend inflation increases, the determinacy region shrinks. He suggests a moderately active interest rate policy accompanied by a slightly positive response to output gap to ensure determinacy. Gerko and Sossounov (2015) studied the effects on determinacy of positive trend inflation within a New Keynesian model with Calvo-type price setting and capital accumulation. While they verify the previous research findings on active monetary policy not necessarily guaranteeing determinacy of equilibrium, they also find that the parameters of monetary policy which ensure determinacy mainly depend upon the level of trend inflation. As the level of trend inflation increases, the regions of determinacy under Taylor–type rules shrink. While the Taylor-type rule might lead to indeterminacy within a large region of the parameter space, Gerko and Sossounov (2015) advocate employing strict price level targeting along with responses to current output gap to ensure determinacy of equilibrium. Fanelli (2012), on the other hand, argues that if the monetary authority does not react to inflation by an aggressive increase in the nominal interest rate, a unique equilibrium may not be achieved. Adding to the previous conclusions, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011) show that in the presence of positive trend inflation, an endogenous monetary policy based on the Taylor Principle may not be sufficient. Components of the policy, such as interest rate smoothing along with price-level targeting, can be needed to ensure determinacy. Dupor (2001) shows that including endogenous investment in the neoclassical imperfect competition model with sticky prices reverses the effects of interest rate rules on determinacy. While passive policy rules lead to locally unique equilibria, active rules do not. Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005) explore a Calvo-type sticky price model including capital and investment spending. They find that monetary authority aggressive response to the current inflation rate is the only way to achieve local determinacy. Under forward-looking interest rate rules, the determinacy region shrinks considerably, and local indeterminacy arises. Tesfaselassie and Schaling (2016) explore Blanchard and Galí (2010) New Keynesian model incorporating labor market frictions. They find that determinacy depends not only on the policy rule but also on inflation and unemployment expectations as well as hiring costs. Under the policy rules reacting to current inflation and unemployment, the indeterminacy region of the parameter space widens together with hiring costs. Under policy rules based on inflation and unemployment expectations, the indeterminacy region shrinks with hiring costs, while too much or too little reaction may still lead to indeterminacy. Assuming that the steady state is known, lack of enough reaction to inflation and unemployment can also lead to indeterminacy. Although it has rarely been considered in macroeconomics research, the open economy framework makes the determinacy analysis substantially more complicated. According to Clarida et al. (2001), considering the fact that open economy form is isomorphic to closed economy model in New Keynesian tradition, it is the degree of openness parameter which substantially affects the parameters of the model and the extent of interest rate response to inflation. De Fiore and Liu (2005) and Karagiannides and Liambas (2019) find that whether a policy rule leads to unique equilibria depends upon the degree of openness to trade. Karagiannides and Liambas (2019) argue that as trade openness increases, Taylor-rule based monetary policies should put more weight on output gap and less on price stability. But as openness decreases, price stability should take priority. In open economies, De Fiore and Liu (2005) explain transmission mechanisms which could lead to determinacy and transmission mechanisms that would not lead to determinacy. Unlike closed economies, in which the transmission mechanism operates through the substitution effect between consumption and leisure or savings, in open economies a rise in real interest rates affects the exchange rates and thus terms of trade between foreign and domestic goods. Improving terms of trade, depending on the level of openness, creates incentives for the household to substitute consumption for leisure or saving. In the open economy case, as the real interest rate is increased by the monetary authority, the domestic currency appreciates. The domestic goods’ price index rises relative to the consumer price index. Domestic inflation then differs from CPI growth, producing complications for policy making. There are other studies that incorporate different parameters or variables into the standard New Keynesian model to analyze open economy structures. While Clarida et al. (2001) and Taylor (2001) argue that responding to the real interest rate turns out to be ineffective and even destabilizing in monetary policy, Guender (2005) and Froyen and Guender (2017) emphasize the critical role of the real exchange rate in conducting monetary policy. Mihailov et al. (2011) evaluate the external determinants of inflation dynamics in OECD countries and find that expected relative changes in terms of trade play a bigger role in inflation than contemporaneous domestic output gap. Rhee and Turdaliev (2012), adding a direct exchange rate channel to domestic inflation in an open economy New Keynesian model, find that CPI inflation targeting causes a lower volatility in output than domestic inflation targeting. Our study seeks to enlighten some aspects of the determinacy problem in the New Keynesian open economy literature. For that purpose, we employ Gali and Monacelli (2005) model of a small open economy in the New Keynesian tradition. Gali and Monacelli’s (2005) model represents a small open economy as part of the world economy, which is itself a continuum of small open economies, identical in terms of preferences, technology, and Calvo-type staggered price setting. Under various policy regimes, the model seamlessly reveals the trade-offs between the stabilizations of inflation, output gap, and exchange rate. Since its publication, Gali and Monacelli (2005) model has attracted the attention of many researchers and policy makers and has become one of the most influential models in macroeconomic analysis. It has been used as a baseline model in a wide range of research and policy analysis.Footnote 1 Using Gali and Monacelli’s (2005) model, we investigated the determinacy conditions under a variety of alternative monetary policy rules. The conditions for the uniqueness and local stability of the equilibria are established for each model and are evaluated using numerical analysis. We reestablish the determinacy conditions in the open economy New Keynesian structures. Determinacy diagrams are constructed to show the regions of unique and multiple equilibria. Numerical analyses are performed to confirm the theoretical results. The numerical simulations show that limit cycles and periodic behaviors are possible, but on some occasions, only at unlikely parameter settings. We have found that in a broad class of open economy New Keynesian models, the degree of openness has a significant role in equilibrium determinacy under various forms and timing of monetary policy rules. The open economy framework creates substantial complications within the dynamic structure of the system. The resulting broad range of qualitative behaviors requires meticulous policy responses.",

Although the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates have been studied in a number of contributions, typically against the backdrop of the Dornbusch (1976) landmark contribution, the overshooting hypothesis (see e.g. Rüth 2020; Inoue and Rossi 2019; Bjørnland 2009; Scholl and Uhlig 2008),Footnote 1 information shocks associated with central bank announcements as a source of exchange rate fluctuations have received less attention. As central bank announcements typically reveal news about the central bank’s assessment of the state of the economy (see e.g. Campbell et al. 2012; Nakamura and Steinsson 2018; Jarocinski and Karadi 2020), financial market participants closely monitor and process information provided by central banks. Thus, information shocks may be a source of exchange rate fluctuations. A number of recent contributions emphasize the role of information effects for the transmission of monetary policy more generally (Cieslak and Schrimpf 2019; Jarocinski and Karadi 2020; Andrade and Ferroni 2021). Market participants may interpret contractionary (expansionary) policy announcements as the central bank’s reaction to an improved (worsened) economic outlook, which may give rise to more optimistic (pessimistic) views regarding the overall macroeconomic situation. Consider the following example: On January 30th, 2008 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction of the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points. This announcement resulted in a decline in the 3-month federal funds future and although standard textbooks predict an increase in equity prices in such a case, the S&P500 declined as well. The announcement was accompanied by the following statement (Federal Reserve 2008): ”Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.” Thus, the decline in stock prices, despite the lower federal funds rate target, may have been the result of information effects, i.e. more pessimistic expectations due to the information conveyed with the announcement. To study how information shocks influence exchange rate dynamics, we disentangle pure monetary policy shocks and information shocks by imposing sign restrictions on high-frequency changes in interest rates and stock prices measured within short time windows around central bank announcements. The main identifying assumption is that a pure policy shock results in a negative co-movement of high-frequency changes in interest rates and stock prices, while an information shock gives rise to a positive co-movement (Jarocinski and Karadi 2020; Jarocinski 2020; Kerssenfischer 2019). Intuitively, a contractionary pure policy shock should lead to higher interest rates and lower expected discounted dividends, which in turn leads to lower stock prices. However, if stock prices increase, despite a monetary tightening and higher interest rates, then the stock market movement is likely to reflect a more optimistic assessment by the central bank conveyed with the policy announcement. Based on these identifying assumptions, we decompose the high-frequency interest rate change into pure policy and information components using rotational sign restrictions as in Jarocinski (2020). The fact that changes in interest rates and stock prices are measured within short windows around announcements ensures that these changes reflect surprises associated with the announcement (Kuttner 2001; Gürkaynak et al. 2005). As a next step, we use the pure policy and information surprise components as instruments in a proxy VAR as in Gertler and Karadi (2015).Footnote 2 Our results show that, not accounting for information effects, contractionary monetary policy shocks give rise to a sharp appreciation followed by a persistent depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate consistent with the overshooting model of Dornbusch (1976) and in line with empirical evidence presented in e.g. Bjørnland (2009) and Rüth (2020). Although pure monetary policy and information shocks both contribute to the appreciation, the dynamic patterns induced by these two shocks differ strongly. A pure monetary policy shock appreciates the U.S. Dollar in the short run, but the effect is transitory, in line with the overshooting model. The exchange rate response to an information shock, in contrast, is rather muted on impact but becomes more pronounced over the medium run, resulting in a persistent appreciation. Thus, the behavior of the exchange rate conditional on the information shock is reminiscent of delayed overshooting dynamics in the spirit of Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) and Scholl and Uhlig (2008). To explore these delayed overshooting patterns in greater detail, we estimate the responses of ex-post deviations from uncovered interest rate parity (UIP).Footnote 3 While previous papers such as Müller et al. (2019) or Rüth (2020) include similar exercises, they do not distinguish between policy and information shocks. Despite the persistent exchange rate response after an information shock, we do not detect any noteworthy reactions of UIP deviations neither to the information shock nor to the pure policy shock. Thus, the exchange rate and interest rates jointly adjust in line with UIP, despite stark differences in the exchange rate responses. That is, the persistent exchange rate response to the information shock is accompanied by appropriate changes in interest rates, which is in line with a number of recent studies that document persistent effects of information shocks on interest rates.Footnote 4 Although the exchange rate response triggered by the information shock is less precisely estimated, the historical decomposition shows that due to the higher persistence of its effects, which accumulate over time, the information shock contributes substantially to exchange rate dynamics. To the extent that persistent changes in the exchange rate are likely to induce more pronounced effects on the economy, our results suggest that the implications of exchange rate fluctuations should crucially depend on the type of shock that gives rise to these fluctuations.Footnote 5 In fact, it may be primarily new information about the macroeconomic environment, rather than the announcement of the actual policy itself, that results in sizeable effects associated with policy-induced variations in the exchange rate. Given the strong influence of information shocks on exchange rate dynamics, our findings suggest that accounting for the potentially counteracting effects that the information revealed by central bank announcements exerts, contributes to a better understanding of exchange rate movements overall. In addition, our estimates may help to calibrate structural models of the monetary transmission mechanism, which increasingly incorporate information shocks (e.g. Jarocinski and Karadi 2020). Our analysis is related to several strands of the literature. The response of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks has been studied in a number of contributions. Several papers analyze whether exchange rate dynamics are consistent with the exchange rate overshooting model of Dornbusch (1976). Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) and Grilli and Roubini (1995, 1996) find evidence for delayed overshooting, i.e., a smaller response of the exchange rate in the short term than in the long term (see also Froot and Thaler 1990). Similarly, MacDonald and Popiel (2020) use ordering restrictions to identify unconventional monetary policy shocks in the U.S and Canada and find that the bilateral exchange rate response reaches its maximum only after more than a year following an U.S. policy shock. The maximum response after a Canadian unconventional policy shock is reached closer to the impact period, however. Scholl and Uhlig (2008) use sign restrictions to identify policy shocks and find that the maximum appreciation occurs only after 1 to 2 years. In contrast, Faust and Rogers (2003) estimate the maximum exchange rate responses at horizons that are close to the impact period. Dery and Serletis (2021) obtain similar results using a combination of zero and sign restrictions for identification. Bjørnland (2009) identifies monetary policy shocks by imposing long-run monetary neutrality restrictions and finds real exchange rate responses consistent with Dornbusch (1976) for a number of countries. Inoue and Rossi (2019) identify monetary policy shocks as changes in the whole yield curve in response to monetary policy surprises and also find support for exchange rate overshooting. Müller et al. (2019) use narrative monetary policy shocks and a local projections framework and find evidence in favor of delayed overshooting. In contrast to these studies, we use a high-frequency identification approach and emphasize the role of new information conveyed at central bank announcements. Methodologically, our paper is most closely related to Rogers et al. (2018) and Rüth (2020). These two contributions use proxy VARs in combination with high-frequency instruments to identify policy shocks and find evidence in favor of overshooting. While these authors do not explicitly consider information shocks, we contribute to this branch of the literature by exploring the exchange rate effects of new information conveyed at central bank announcements.Footnote 6 The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes our econometric approach and the data we use in our estimations. Section 3 presents our main findings, which include impulse response functions as well as a historical decomposition. Afterwards, Sect. 4 contains a battery of robustness checks and finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",

Which kind of global shocks can most account for observed business cycles? How big are the impacts of domestic shocks, as captured by productivity, mark-up, and demand shocks, as sources of variation in real economic activities, once we allow for global shocks? For any country, obtaining answers to these questions is fundamental to designing and implementing relevant macroeconomic and regulatory policies. The focus of our analysis in this paper is the US. In particular, we examine to what extent US output and real exchange rate are driven by global shocks, and to what extent they are caused by domestic shocks. As the world’s largest economic power, most existing theoretical and empirical studies tend to treat the US as the source of external shocks for other countries (e.g., Belke et al. 2019; Canova 2005; Justiniano and Preston 2010; Kazi et al. 2013; Kim 2001; Schmitt-Grohé 1998). Yet, history shows us that the US itself is not immune to disturbances originating from abroad (e.g., the Arab-Israeli war of the early 1970s and the East Asian crisis of 1997-98). Our goal in this paper is to contribute to this line of discourse by using an estimated two-sector open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to structurally account for the size of the effects of global shocks on the US economy. Our paper has two main contributions. First, our theoretical analysis builds on a two-sector open economy DSGE model first presented in Meenagh et al. (2015). In order to establish whether the US economy experiences energy business cycles, these authors advanced a novel two-sector model of the US with varying intensities of oil demand in production that also incorporates a high number of real frictions and shocks. Besides, the model allows for two types (energy-intensive and non-energy intensive) of final goods and a commodity (crude oil) to be traded on the world markets. From a modelling perspective, this was a notable contribution to the DSGE literature because previous work on this topic had generally been based on one-sector one-good autarky model except for oil imports (e.g., Dhawan and Jeske 2008; Kim and Loungani 1992).Footnote 1 Our paper extends their model in two distinct ways: (i) we let households have access to both home and foreign bonds, and (ii) we include ten more structural shocks in the version that we use in this paper.Footnote 2 The paper’s second contribution is that the model is tested and estimated by the method of indirect inference on unfiltered data.Footnote 3 In testing, we apply the indirect inference procedure to a set of initial parameters put forward as true for our model, and ask: could these coefficients, within this model framework, be the true model generating the data? Of course, only one true model with one set of coefficients is feasible. Nevertheless, we may have chosen coefficients that are not precisely right numerically so that the same model with other coefficient values could be correct. Only when we have evaluated the model with all coefficient values that are credible within the model theory will we have adequately tested it. Hence, in estimation, we further utilise our indirect inference procedure to seek alternative coefficient sets that could do better in duplicating US macroeconomy features. The primary reason why we favour the use of indirect inference is that it involves a powerful test of the model on the data. On this basis, we are able to say categorically that the model fits the data. As our empirical approach is less popular, we elaborate on it further in Sect 3. In addition, the use of unfiltered data allows us to add non-stationary shocks. So, beyond the theoretical refinements of Meenagh et al. (2015), we have also improved empirically on their work. As a result, our model can more appropriately mimic the dynamic properties of the US and the rest of the world data over the period under study. To preview our results, employing a two-equation VARX(1) of output and real exchange rate, we find that the model is not rejected and is able to reproduce the features of the US data jointly, passing the Wald test with a p-value of 0.063. The central result that we document is the pivotal role of global shocks on US economic fluctuations. According to the estimated model, global shocks explain nearly 40% of the variances of US output and real exchange rate, as well as the variations in consumption, labour hours, and foreign bonds. Furthermore, global shocks account for well over 50% of the variabilities in the remaining macroeconomic aggregates: investment, imports, exports, wages, interest rate, and oil use. Unbundling global shocks, the results of the structural variance decomposition indicate that exogenous world demand and oil price shocks are the most important driving variables; these are followed by the preference for exported energy-intensive goods and the price of imported energy-intensive goods. Of the six global shocks modelled, the only two with negligible contributions to the US business cycle behaviour are the preference for aggregate exported goods and foreign interest rates. Using historical decomposition, we also show that global shocks were dominant in causing changes to US output and real exchange rate. Then, in an application motivated by the continuing debate in the existing literature about the importance of oil price shocks, we use the estimated model to predict the frequency of occurrence of output expansions and contractions in the presence (absence) of oil crisis for the US economy. Our modelling strategy is derived broadly in the tradition of early international real business cycle (IRBC) literature (e.g., Ahmed et al. 1993; Backus et al. 1992, 1995; Baxter and Crucini 1995; Dellas 1986; Stockman and Tesar 1995). The main departures of our paper from that literature are two. First, we have adopted the assumption of incomplete asset markets to limit the degree of risk-sharing across countries implied by the structure of models in the early IRBC literature. In this regard, our model is in the fashion of the new open economy macroeconomics (NOEM) literature (e.g., Adolfson et al. 2007; Justiniano and Preston 2010). Second, the foundational element of the production structure in our model is in the spirit of Kim and Loungani (1992), who extended Kydland and Prescott’s (1982) model to allow a role for energy price shocks. Building on their approach, an added feature of our model is that we disaggregate the US economy into energy-intensive and non-energy intensive sectors, with both producing goods that are tradeable internationally. Consequently, we are able to study the business cycle implications of global and domestic shocks for US aggregate and disaggregate macroeconomic data. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our two-sector open economy DSGE model. Section 3 discusses the unfiltered data and the estimation methodology. Section 4 contains our findings. The final section concludes with a summary of the paper’s findings, policy implications, and suggestions for future research.",

This special issue presents a peer-reviewed selection of papers from the workshop comprising both real and monetary studies in context of Asia’s integration in the world economy. The contributed papers sort into two sections: The first section deals with monetary policy and the monetary system while the second part has a stronger focus on the real sector and international trade. Figure 1 shows some data on the evolution of Asia’s and Europe’s nominal and real integration in the world measured by international capital and trade flows. The comparison group in this first glimpse at the data is Europe, where the share in worldwide inward FDI flows and the share in worldwide merchandise trade were both declining by respectively more than 20 and more than 10 percentage points. To some extent, these developments are likely caused by the rise of Asia and in particular China. In their attempt of gaining market share, firms in and out of Asia invested huge amounts in China and its neighbors during the period studied in Fig. 1. The more successful investments caused soaring trade flows of final and intermediate goods, which may also explain the increase in real trade flows in Asia documented in the lower panel of Fig. 1. Some of the deeper determinants of this market integration in Asia are discussed in the various contribution presented at the workshop in Hagen. Asia's Realand Nominal Integration in the World However, measuring financial and real integration going beyond the broader picture shown in Fig. 1 is challenging. Potential measures of real integration include the size of intra- and inter-regional trade while financial integration can be measured through cross-border financial assets, correlation of stock returns, interest rate differentials and the use of domestic currencies. Given that some of these quantities, in particular interest rate and stock return correlations, are heavily influenced by the global financial cycle, we will not discuss all measures in greater detail and focus on the use of domestic currencies and intra-regional trade. Some contributions to this special issue are dealing with trade agreements between Asia and the rest of the world. These initiatives are aiming at a stronger integration of Asia with other regions, for example the European Union, and are complementary to policies which are designed to achieve stronger integration between Asian countries. One important determinant of regional integration is a commonly accepted currency used to convert local prices for international trade. Eichengreen (2011) argues that the world is heading towards a multi-polar system where the Euro dominates in Europe, the US dollar is the anchor in the Americas while Chinese Renminbi becomes the main currency in Asia. However, as it stands today, the Dollar is still the dominant invoicing currency in Asia (Boz et al. (2022) and also the dominant currency in terms of reserve holdings, debt denomination and currency anchor in Asia. This strong dependence might seem surprising given the strong economic growth in Asia over the last decade and the emergence of China. As the largest economic region in the world, a stronger use of Asian currencies as anchor would be sensible and China’s Renminbi is a natural candidate given the strong regional ties. However, an increase in its relevance could also coincide with a deteriorating role of the yen, generating further turmoil in the region.Footnote 1 Despite the dominance of the Dollar, some regional initiatives have promoted the use of local currencies instead. The ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers’ declared aims are strengthening policy dialogue, coordination, and collaboration on common financial, monetary, and fiscal issues. The local currency settlement framework (LCSF) represents a set of bilateral agreements among central banks to use their own currencies for cross border settlements of bilateral trade, foreign direct investment and other international transactions through designated banks as appointed cross currency dealers (ACCDs), including direct exchanges of the two currencies without the triangle transactions of using the U.S. dollar as a vehicle currency. An increasing amount of countries are implementing LCSF. As it stands, the use of local currencies will gradually keep expanding particularly in the area of trade invoicing or settlement and even for some international financial transaction (Asian Development Bank 2022). A popular proxy for real integration is the size of intra-regional trade. Figure 2 provides an overview of intra-regional imports in Asia between 1988 and 2020. The strong increase until 2005 has not been affected by the currency crises in 1997/1998. The level of intra-regional imports has hardly increased after 2012 which might also suggest that Asia has already reached a high degree of real integration. Intra-regional trade in Asia According to the Asian Economic Integration Report (AEIR) 2022, intra-regional trade made up to 58.5% of Asia‘s total trade in 2020, the highest share since 1990. It is also important to point out that initiatives such as the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement were designed to strengthen Asia’s trade with the rest of the world. Kim and Lee (2012) point out that financial integration in Asia lags real integration. Comparing the development of intra-regional trade with the use of domestic currencies supports this view. The strong role of the dollar and the global financial cycle are detached from the contribution of the United States to the World GDP and stronger trade ties within Asia have resulted in efforts to the stronger use of local currencies. The papers presented in this special issue and summarized in the following overview of the introduction do not deal with overall measures of integration. The focus is instead on specific topics related to specific aspects of integration and local economic development in Asia. The first study in the monetary block titled “The Impacts of Financial Crises on the Trilemma Configurations’” by Joshua Aizenman, Menzie Chinn and Hiro Ito analyzes the impact of crises on the impossible trinity and foreign reserves. The impossible trinity illustrates the finding that governments can pursue only two of the following three objectives: free capital mobility, fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policy. The authors argue that accumulating foreign reserves is a fourth pillar that boosts financial stability in open financial markets. Moving from any corner within the trinity towards a corner with more open financial markets induces additional risks that can be compensated by accumulating foreign reserves. The paper’s contribution to this debate is comparing the changes in the interplay between currency reserves and trilemma policies before and after the Asian and the Global Financial Crisis. The results show that countries faced with significant terms of trade shocks or negative economic growth during the Asian Financial Crisis increased reserve holdings afterwards. Negative growth during the crisis can be associated with a government’s higher tendency towards having more exchange rate flexibility and a more open financial market. A more granular view on these findings shows that this result appears in commodity exporting countries only. Overall, countries increased their foreign reserves after the financial crisis. Related to this first study on country-level adjustment strategies to financial crises, the second paper in this special issue looks at international spillover effects. Vulnerability to global shocks provides another perspective on economic integration since one aim of strong regional integration is to reduce the dependency from the global economy or the global financial cycle. The title of this second paper is “When the United States and the People’s Republic of China Sneeze: Monetary Policy Spillovers to Asian Economies” by John Beirne, Nuobu Renzhi and Ulrich Volz. Monetary policy spillovers from the US and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to real and financial sectors in advanced and emerging economies are studied using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. Their results show that Asian economies tend to be more susceptible to spillovers to GDP, inflation, and the current account emanating from monetary policy shocks in the PRC. Contrary to previous results in the literature, they find more persistence in the response of advanced Asian interest rates to PRC monetary policy shocks. These findings are important since previous research has frequently focused on spillovers from the US. The paper “On the International Spillover Effects of Uncertainty “ by Anindya Sen and Dennis Wesselbaum also contribute to the discussion on spillover effects. They assess spillover effects of economic policy uncertainty across borders. Based on a multivariate GARCH, which allows for a time-varying correlation structure of economic policy uncertainty across countries, they show that spillovers are relevant, vary sizably over time, and that spikes can be related to policy events, illustrating the connectedness of policy choices and the potential need for policy coordination. The results also show that correlations between policy uncertainty in China and the other countries in the sample are comparably small but also identifies negative spillover effects of policy uncertainty in China on the real economy of the US. The last paper in the monetary block is focusing on monetary policy in China. In “China's Monetary Policy and the Loan Market: How Strong is the Credit Channel in China?“ the authors Max Breitenlechner and Riikka Nuutilainen study credit supply effects in the transmission of Chinese monetary policy. They show that the credit channel constitutes an important and economically relevant transmission channel for monetary policy in China. Based on zero and sign restrictions in a structural vector autoregressive framework, they identify monetary policy shocks and supply dynamics in the loan market. Their findings show that policy shocks that coincide with loan supply effects account for roughly 60% of the overall effects of policy induced output dynamics. This illustrates the key relevance of credit supply for monetary policy transmission in China. The second part of the special issue has a strong focus on real integration of Asia in the world economy. In “Rising Wages and Intra-country Industry Relocation: Evidence from China” Yuting Li, Karsten Mau and Mingzhi Xu present a firm-level study on supply shortages in the labor market when wages and production costs of firms are increasing. Their analysis contributes to the debate revolving around the role of low labor costs for China’s economic success. Among the crucial drivers behind the Chinese export success were low wages and ample supply of labor but this comparative advantage deteriorated over time. The authors argue that there are regional disparities in China with regard to wages and labor supply. The wage growth documented for the whole of China may be more representative for the economic hotspots in China, whereas less developed places in the hinterland lack far behind in this regard. Their analysis aims at shedding light at regional disparities in wage growth based on a firm-level data approach. Their Chinese establishment data covers the period 1999-2007 and contains information about the precise location of the respective firm. This regional information can be used to infer information about the labor cost situation at the respective firm’s local labor market. The results suggest that, after controlling for the local industry's own wage rate and value added per worker, a higher average wage level in a location reduces production, employment and the number of firms. This result helps explaining why other countries in Asia gained stance in more recent times. Firms become less competitive due to rising labor costs. Another important initiative with significant impact on countries in Asia and the rest of the world is the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement. The study “The Trade Effects of the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement: Heterogeneity across Time, Country Pairs, and Directions of Trade within Country Pairs” by Benjamin Jung contributes an analysis on trade effects associated with this free trade agreement to this special issue. The author applies a gravity approach to a novel dataset that includes both inter- and intra-national trade flows. Overall, the author finds some anticipation effects on bilateral trade shortly after the announcement but insignificant effects in the long run. However, a more granular look at the data reveals heterogeneous effects on bilateral trade along several dimensions. The decomposition exercise shows that the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has raised goods exports of EU countries to Korea significantly, but lowered imports from Korea. Moreover, the effects differ across countries. Finally, the results show that the US-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (which entered into force in 2012) significantly raised US imports from Korea, but had no effect on US exports to Korea. Overall, the pattern for trade in services differs substantially from the one for trade in goods. “Transforming East Asia: Regional integration in a trade war era“ by Karen Jackson and Oleksandr Shepotylo presents a closely related study on trade and welfare implications of the same free trade agreement. However, their paper takes political tensions between the US and China into consideration and their identification strategy is different from the strategy proposed by Benjamin Jung. The authors employ a structural gravity approach to explore the effects of these cooperative and non-cooperative trade policies. Their results show that the free trade agreement can compensate for continued trade tensions in China. Reductions in tariffs are expected to lead to larger welfare gains compared to those stemming from lower non-tariff barriers to trade. Moreover, a deeper agreement will be more welfare enhancing for all members involved. Overall, East Asian integration appears to be a more appealing prospect in light of tensions with the US. Another study in this block takes a look at more recent developments in trade between Asia and the rest of the world. In “The COVID-19 pandemic and Chinese trade relations” Jaqueline Hansen, Antonia Kamaliev and Hans-Jörg Schmerer construct a panel containing information about bilateral monthly trade with China and non-pharmaceutical interventions against Covid-19. The authors argue that non-pharmaceutical interventions had an effect on countries’ bilateral trade with China through domestic demand and domestic supply. Their panel regression results suggest a reduction in monthly Chinese exports to countries that introduced more stringent lockdown measures. They extend their analysis by decomposing observed trade flows into gravity and residual trade components. More stringent lockdowns are associated with less residual trade. Moreover, an event study approach reveals a negative effect of the Covid-19 outbreak in China but this effect vanishes after only 2 months. “The double trap in China - Multiple equilibria in institutions and income and their causal relationship“ by Linda Glawe and Helmut Wagner focuses on the middle income trap in China by discussing multiple equilibria in institutions and income and their causal relationship. Their works aims to add further arguments to this discussion by focusing on the concept of club convergence. They assess whether institutional quality in low-income provincial level administrative divisions converges to the level experienced by relatively highly developed ones or whether multiple institutional clubs exist. Focusing on a sample from 1995 to 2007 they identify multiple institutional clubs within China, three rather small clubs which follow an above-average high institutional quality path and two clubs which find themselves on a relatively low institutional quality path and which together account for the majority of provinces and autonomous regions. They also show that various members of the poor institutional clubs are additionally caught in a low-income trap. Further evidence suggests that institutional traps are important determinants of income traps, giving rise to the recently identified phenomenon of a ‘double trap’. Finally, the results indicate that human capital and urbanization are additional important determinants of income traps, while globalization is decisive for avoiding poor institutional traps.",

The dominant role of US monetary policy in affecting global financial market conditions is largely understood, given the position of the US as the world’s largest economy as well as the role of the US dollar as a global reserve currency and its importance in international invoicing in trade and investment (e.g., Obstfeld 2020). That said, the rapid emergence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a global economic and financial heavyweight over the past decade or so may have had implications for the dynamics of global real and financial spillovers. In a recent paper, Miranda-Agrippino et al. (2020) found that US monetary policy dominates global spillovers via the financial channel, while the PRC’s monetary policy influence outweighs that of the US on the real side at the global level, transmitting through international trade, commodity prices, and global value chains. This paper builds on that analysis by investigating advanced and emerging Asian economy groups in greater depth, testing monetary policy uncertainty shocks, and conducting an empirical examination of relative exposure to real and financial spillovers in relation to the US and the PRC over the period 2000 to 2020. Examining the transmission of shocks to Asia is of interest given its diversity, involving both advanced and emerging economies. In addition, as an asset class, emerging Asia does not fit the profile of a typical emerging market economy (EME). Rooted in the aftermath of the Asian crisis of 1997–1998, many Asian economies have built up large foreign reserves, and many emerging Asian economies have run current account surpluses in recent years coupled with lower reliance on foreign currency-denominated external debt. Moreover, local currency bond markets have continued to develop strongly over the past 15 years or so (e.g., Beirne et al. 2021), which has helped to reduce exposure to foreign currency borrowing and to a certain degree insulate the economies from negative external financial shocks. However, at the same time, strong foreign investor participation, particularly in less developed Asian markets, may induce additional volatility. Also, with a further liberalization of capital accounts, financial integration has increased in these economies, while financial markets have also become deeper and more liquid. Rising financial integration can make economies susceptible to negative external shocks in a systematic manner, including through valuation effects. Local currency bond markets have helped to alleviate the extent to which external shocks lead to abrupt shifts in exchange rates however. So, in this way, financial integration has risen (potentially exposing economies to external shocks), while local currency bond markets mitigate associated financial stability risks. The question remains of whether these economies should be concerned about monetary policy shocks that may emanate from the PRC. Trade integration in Asia has increased steadily over the past 30 years, with the PRC having a more prominent role over time. Trade between the PRC and the rest of Asia increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, from around 6% to 25% of its global trade, respectively. By contrast, the share of trade between Asia and the US decreased over this period (see Fig. 1). In value terms, exports to Asia from the PRC and imports from Asia to the PRC outweigh those relating to the US by a factor of around two, demonstrating the strong role of trade as a transmission channel to Asia for shocks originating from the PRC (see Figure 9 in the Appendix). Trade Integration in Asia. Note: The figure reports the shares of total trade(exports plus imports) between Asia and other regions. Source: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics By exploiting interest rate differentials abroad relative to the US and through arbitrage trading, investors activate the financial channel via capital flows as a transmission mechanism. The prevailing literature has downplayed the financial channel as a propagator of monetary policy shocks emanating from the PRC at the global level. Mwase et al. (2016) ascribed this partly to capital controls in the PRC, which have limited the extent of its financial integration globally. It is worth noting, however, that inflows and outflows of capital from the PRC remain substantial, particularly in relation to those of other Asian economies. After the global financial crisis, the PRC experienced net capital inflows due to a combination of the gradual liberalization of its capital account and higher interest rates relative to the US, while equity returns in the PRC have exhibited rising correlations with equity returns in other Asian markets over the past 20 years (e.g., Arslanalp et al. 2016). Therefore, although the main channel through which the PRC affects financial markets in other parts of Asia has tended to be trade, there is increasing evidence of growing direct financial linkages. Unlike trade integration, historically, Asia has been more financially integrated at the global level than at the regional level (e.g., Kim et al. 2008; García-Herrero et al. 2009). This is partly due to the large current account surpluses in some Asian economies with respect to the US, with an accumulation of large shares of US financial assets. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to show that there are wide variations depending on the nature of financial investment, with intra-regional FDI integration being stronger in the Asian region than other more volatile types of flows (e.g., Didier et al. 2017). Greater financial integration through growing direct investment linkages may amplify the role of monetary policy spillovers via the financial channel for these economies. Furthermore, Chinese banks have significantly increased their exposure to other Asian economies in recent years, providing an avenue for the transmission of monetary policy shocks from the PRC. It is also worth noting that, in more recent years, cross-border portfolio capital flows into the PRC have risen substantially to around RMB5.7 trillion (US$837 billion) at the end of 2020, around eight times higher than the 2014 level (Lardy and Huang 2020). As regards financial integration, Fig. 2 depicts a rising correlation between the equity returns in the PRC and those in the rest of Asia, similar in magnitude to the correlation of US equity returns with those of Asia (excluding the PRC) in 2019. In addition, while the global level of portfolio investment assets and liabilities in the PRC is much lower than that in the US (Miranda-Agrippino et al. 2020), portfolio inflows from Asia to the PRC have risen significantly over time (see Fig. 10 in the Appendix). In addition, the PRC has greater exposure than the US to Singapore and Hong Kong, China, two of the major international financial centers in Asia. This suggests an increasing importance of direct financial linkages between the PRC and the rest of Asia, affecting some key markets more substantially than others. While the prevailing literature has focused on the global propagation of monetary policy shocks, typically originating in the US, this paper provides an analysis of monetary policy spillovers to real and financial sectors by isolating the transmission to Asian economies both from the US and from the PRC. This approach allows us to perform a comparative assessment of the vulnerability of Asian economies to US-originating relative to PRC-originating monetary policy shocks. The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 provides an overview of the related literature; Sect. 3 describes the data and methodology; Sect. 4 discusses the empirical findings; and, finally, Sect. 5 concludes.

The debates revolving around the end of cheap Chinese labor since the early 2000s suggest such a mechanism being at play. Industries which once were the driving force behind China’s export-led growth now face higher wage than productivity growth (e.g. Ceglowski and Golub 2007; Li et al. 2012). Not much is known about the consequences of this trend, however. While one could expect that sectors with excessive wage growth lack competitiveness and gradually disappear, outcomes might actually be different in China. The reason is China’s sheer size, both in terms of its population and its surface. Different regions in China range at different stages of economic development. Combined with limited labor mobility across regions this might result in China resembling a country that resides in multiple cones of diversification.Footnote 1 Wage growth in more advanced regions would induce production relocation towards less developed regions within China, rather than denoting a general end to cheap Chinese labor. Several factors, including demographic and structural change, could produce labor supply shortages. Sometimes they are confined to specific sectors or jobs. In the case of China, the specificity of labor supply shortages might materialize less across industries but mainly across regions. Given its combination of large internal distances and institutional barriers to internal migration (i.e., the so-called hukou system), China shares few characteristics with a typical national labor market where distances are moderate and mobility is high (Poncet 2006). Accordingly, also the end of cheap Chinese labor might be a regionally concentrated phenomenon and other regions might benefit from the relocation of such industries. Instead of observing that labor moves to the location where production takes place, high migration costs could induce firms and industries to relocate into a region where specific skills are abundant. The logic of this mechanism is comparable to models of the international relocation of production, where certain activities are shifted into locations with lower relative wages (e.g. Feenstra and Hanson 1997). In this paper, we seek to trace such patterns empirically. We analyze how wage dynamics — driven by local aggregate conditions — influence the composition of China’s manufacturing sector across regions and industries. We use data from a panel of Chinese industry production during the period 1999-2007 and exploit information on the location of the industry to obtain differences in their exposure to rising wage levels. To avoid capturing reverse causality effects or wage dynamics that reflect specific industry productivity shocks, we employ the average local wage rate of all industries. Moreover, we use instrumental variables to isolate the exogenous component of the variation in average wages over time. Our results suggest that, after controlling for the local industry’s own wage rate and value added per worker, a higher average wage level in a location reduces production, employment and firm counts. Such adjustments, however, are not generally observed. They reveal mostly where the overall wage level is already high to begin with. Moreover, industry output, employment, and number of firms are most affected in low-skill and labor-intensive industries. This is in line with theories of comparative advantage. To investigate cross-regional relocation, we identify industries experiencing a relative decline due to wage growth in China’s high-wage locations and analyze whether these same industries expand in other places. We find that a relative expansion of such industries reveals in places that are geographically proximate to China’s high-income regions and where the relative wage in these industries is low. Also this pattern is in line with theories of comparative advantage, after conditioning on geographic factors. Finally, we ask how locations that appear to attract industry activity from the high-income regions perform in terms of economic complexity (Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009; Hausmann et al. 2014) and find a positive relationship. “Attractive” locations experience a significantly faster increase in the economic complexity index (ECI) during the period of our sample, by about 0.10-0.15 standard deviations. We estimate that through this channel, they also experienced faster per capita income growth. Our paper contributes to the debate about the end of cheap Chinese labor (Ceglowski and Golub 2007; Li et al. 2012), which has been investigated recently by Donaubauer and Dreger (2018) and Xiong and Zhang (2016), for FDI flows and exports respectively. Most papers, however, remain general when it comes to cross-regional heterogeneity within China and we argue that this distinction is important. Our evidence suggests that rising labor costs may indeed be an obstacle for China’s manufacturing industries, but the end of cheap labor seems to be true only for a number of highly-developed regions. The rest of China still offers competitive locations and might even benefit from wage growth in the more advanced regions.Footnote 2 This in line with conjectures by Li and Xu (2008); Lemoine et al. (2015) and Jain-Chandra et al. (2018), who document declining regional disparity in China. We observe that cost heterogeneity within a country can effectively promote the relocation of industries, and thus diversification, especially when labor costs increase in more developed regions. Our research also relates to findings of Bernard et al. (2008), who use factor-endowment theory to study the location of industries in the United Kingdom (UK). In contrast to their static (cross-sectional) approach, we highlight in our work a mechanism where, over time, specific activities decline in one region and emerge in another. Although Bernard et al. (2008) document that changes in relative factor costs are related to changes in industry composition, they remain general where our paper documents the direction of such adjustments across regions and within narrow industries. Conceptually, our paper also relates to the work of Konings and Murphy (2006), who investigate whether multinational enterprises shift certain activities to their lowest-cost locations, and to a more general literature on the location choice of firms and industries (e.g. Forslid and Wooton 2003; Amiti and Javorcik 2008; Handley 2012). Finally, our paper contributes to research, which finds that adopting new (and increasing the range of) activities can be a key ingredient for countries’ economic growth and development (Imbs and Wacziarg 2003; Klinger and Lederman 2006; Koren and Tenreyro 2007; Cadot et al. 2011; Mau 2016). We show that this holds also for the case of regional development within a country. Moreover, although we cannot establish causality between rising wages in one and ECI growth in other regions, our results suggest that cost-saving industry relocations due to comparative advantage does not necessarily undermine economic complexity. While the related literature points out that economic diversification must take place in the “right” industries (Hidalgo and Hausmann 2009; Hausmann et al. 2014), our case illustrates that the cost-induced shifts in regional production patterns can result in such desired outcomes. These findings are also relevant from a transnational viewpoint. In line with recent conjectures of Hanson (2020), China’s continuous technological upgrading in the early 21st century appears to be accompanied by labor-heavy activities moving into its less populated and expensive inner regions, instead of relocating fully into other developing economies. In the following section, we present additional background information about China’s recent economic performance and highlight its regional economic heterogeneity. We describe the data and our empirical strategy in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 presents our findings for the relationship between wage growth and industry performance. In Sect. 5 we evaluate patterns of industry relocation in greater detail and analyze its repercussions for the evolution of economic complexity and subsequent per capita income growth.

While for a long time these agreements were “regional” not only in a trade-policy, but also in a geographic sense, they now span along global value chains and involve countries in different regions of the world, forming what Bhagwati has called “spaghetti bowls” (Bhagwati 1995). Moreover, they include chapters on barriers to trade other than tariffs, thus forming what is now generally referred to as “deep” agreements (WTO+ agreements). Due to the initiative “Global Europe: Competing in the world” of 2006, the European Union (EU) is an important driver of this trend. The EU has recently signed several RTAs with countries all over the world. The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement is the first RTA under the “Global Europe” initative and can serve as a prominent example of these second-generation RTAs that cover tariffs, regulatory barriers, services, intellectual property rights, and bilateral investment.Footnote 1 The trade negotiations were launched in May 2007. The EU-South Korea FTA was initialled by both sides in October 2009, signed in October 2010, provisionally applied as of July 2011, and fully entered into force in December 2015 (Lakatos and Nilsson 2017). The EU has recently signed similar agreements with Columbia and Peru (2013), Central America (2013), Canada (2017), Japan (2019), Singapore (2019), and Vietnam (2020), and has started negotiating similar agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and India. Likewise, South Korea followed a deep economic integration approach. Shortly before its agreement with the EU entered into force, South Korea entered agreements with India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (both in 2010), almost at the same time an agreement with Peru (2011), and in the years thereafter agreements with the United States of America (2012), Turkey (2013), Australia (2014), Canada, China, Vietnam, and New Zealand (all in 2015), Colombia (2016), Central America (2019), and the UK (2021; substitute for the EU-South Korea FTA after the UK left the EU). Against this background, in this paper I answer two questions: How do the trade effects of the EU-South Korea FTA differ across different phases of the agreement (pre- and post-agreement), and how do the effects differ across country pairs within the agreement as well as across directions of trade within country pairs? According to Baier and Bergstrand (2007), an RTA – they use the term free trade agreement (FTA) – on average increases two member countries’ trade by about 100% after 10 years. This estimate is derived from a dataset that covers the period 1960-2000 (in 5-year intervals) and trade between 96 countries. Under the assumption of symmetric trade costs, they properly control for multilateral resistance terms (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003).Footnote 2 However, this study suffers from a number of deficiencies. It does not account for heteroscedasticity in the error term and zeros in international trade flows (Santos-Silva and Tenreyro 2006), nor does it allow for trade diversion from domestic trade flows (Yotov 2012), or for potential anticipation effects (Egger et al. 2022).Footnote 3 Moreover, by construction of the dataset, their estimation cannot account for the more recent RTAs such as the EU-South Korea FTA. Using a dataset with information on both international and intra-national trade for 69 trading partners and the years 1986-2006 and estimating by Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML), Baier et al. (2019) find an average trade-creating effect of 34%, accounting for 5-year lagged effects. Their analysis is restricted to RTAs that were formed in the 1980s and the 1990s.Footnote 4 Interestingly, they provide detailed evidence on differences in the effects not only across agreements, but also within agreements both across pairs and within pairs across directions of trade. Like Zylkin (2016) for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), I zoom into a single trade agreement, namely the EU-South Korea FTA.Footnote 5 I combine the different dimensions of heterogeneity and quantify the heterogeneity of the effects of the EU-Korea FTA across time (pre- and post-agreement), country pairs, and directions of trade (imports vs. exports) within country pairs. In order to do so, I construct a dummy variable that is 1 for each country pair involving an EU member country and South Korea for 2011 and all years thereafter and 0 otherwise. This EU-South Korea dummy variable captures the effects of all bilateral trade cost changes induced by the agreement, including changes in bilateral tariffs and in non-tariff measures (NTM), as in Baier and Bergstrand (2007).Footnote 6 Moreover, as will become clear in Sect. 2, the starting conditions in the EU and South Korea for trade liberalization within the agreement differ between the EU and South Korea as well as between different EU-countries. Thus, I will also explore directional effects (exports vs. imports). Some of the measures such as Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) are only applied by some of the countries to some of the trading partners within the agreement. Moreover, even NTMs that are in principle applied to all trading partners may generate asymmetric effects as the composition of bilateral trade differs. That is why I also consider country-specific and within-pair direction-specific trade effects. All regressions include zero trade flows and are estimated using a “three-way” fixed effects Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (“FE-PPML”) estimator with (i) exporter-and-time fixed effects and (ii) importer-and-time fixed effects to control for exporter- and importer-specific observed and unobserved characteristics such as technology, aggregate expenditure, and outward and inward multilateral resistance terms, and (iii) asymmetric pair-specific fixed effects to control for time-invariant country-pair specific characteristics.Footnote 7 These pair dummies are also thought to mitigate the potential problem of endogenous selection into RTAs (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). Following Egger et al. (2022), I use consecutive-year data in the estimation. Weidner and Zylkin (2021a, b) argue that the estimated coefficients and the standard errors obtained from three-way FE-PPML estimators are biased due to incidental parameter problems. They show that even samples with a large number of countries feature these biases.Footnote 8 Following their advice, I present bias-corrected estimates and standard errors.Footnote 9 In all regressions, I account for common globalization effects with a set of time-varying border dummy variables, separating domestic from international transactions (Bergstrand et al. 2015). I rely on a novel dataset provided by the WTO (Monteiro 2020) that contains information on international as well as on intra-national flows in manufactured goods at an annual basis for more than 180 tradings partners and for the period from 1980 to 2016, as recommended by the recent gravity literature (Yotov et al. 2016).Footnote 10 Morover, all regressions include controls for the average RTA other than the EU-South Korea FTA. Following Baier and Bergstrand (2007), in addition to the contemporaneous effect as of 2011 (the date of provisional application), I also consider lagged trade effects. This is important when concessions are phased in over some years (Baier and Bergstrand 2007) and when the trade effects are subject to lagged adjustment.Footnote 11 Additionally, I account for anticipation effects (Egger et al. 2022). Such effects arise during the negotiation and initialling period when firms start to adjust their behavior in anticipation of the implementation of the agreement (Breinlich 2014; Moser and Rose 2014) and when uncertainty about future negative trade policy shocks is resolved.Footnote 12 Handley and Limão (2015) argue that 75% of the increase in Portugal’s exports to the EU following the 1986 enlargement can be explained by removing trade policy uncertainty. Similarly, Handley and Limão (2017) provide evidence for anticipation effects also for China’s accession to the WTO in 2001. In order to compute the cumulative effect, I sum over all coefficients. I find that the EU-South Korea features an anticipation effect two years prior to the agreement, but this effect is eaten up by a negative trade effect one year prior to the agreement. Moreover, I find no significant trade effect in the five years after the agreement entered into force. However, this zero aggregate effect might mask heterogeneity across directions of trade. Following Civic Consulting and Ifo Institute (2018), I therefore allow the effects to differ across directions of trade. Indeed, exports from EU countries to South Korea increase on average, while the effect on EU countries’ imports from South Korea (South Korea’s exports to EU countries) is insignificant. I find huge heterogeneity in the trade effects across country pairs. The cumulative trade effects are significantly positive for trade between South Korea and Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia and significantly negative for trade between South Korea and Bulgaria and Finland. There is also heterogeneity within pairs across directions. The literature discusses several potential explanations for asymmetries in the effects of trade liberalization across country pairs. Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) and Baier et al. (2019) report evidence in favor of the hypothesis that country pairs trading a smaller range of product varieties before the trade negotiations start have a higher potential for trade growth thereafter. Zylkin (2016) argues that the heterogeneity in trade effects on different members can be expected to be explained by differences in ex ante trade barriers, but he finds the trade effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to “disagree strongly with expectations based on pre-NAFTA tariffs.” (p. 1). Larch et al. (2021) report that the trade effects of the EU-Turkey Customs Union are negatively correlated to inital bilateral trade barriers, as measured by the asymmetric pair fixed effect. In the context of Canada’s trade agreements, Anderson et al. (2017) stress that differential trade effects on member countries of an RTA “are not a reflection of comparative advantage, since comparative advantage forces and their changes over time are already controlled for [...] by the exporter-time and the importer-time fxed effects” (p. 35). They propose unobserved trade policy variables as well as outsourcing patterns as potential explanations. In this paper, I relate the directional trade effects on EU member countries to the shares of the South Korea in extra-EU exports and imports, respectively, but I do not take a stance on what type of relationship between initial trade levels and trade growth induced by the agreement to expect. I find the directional trade effects to be positively correlated to the share of South Korea in the EU country’s extra-EU imports in the year 2010.Footnote 13 I am not the first to look into the trade effects of the EU-South Korea FTA. In a report to the European Commission, Civic Consulting and the Ifo Institute (2018) discuss the concessions and the effects of the EU-Korea FTA in great detail. They find a positive effect on both EU exports to and EU imports from Korea. The latter is estimated to be smaller than the former. I find a similar pattern, the difference being that in my estimations the effect on imports of EU countries is not statistically significant. The empirical analysis in Civic Consulting and Ifo Institute (2018) is based on information from the World Input Output Database (WIOD) (Timmer et al. 2015). In the regressions, the authors pool across all available sectors, which also includes agricultural, mining, and services sectors. The authors also provide estimates of sectoral directional effects. The effect on EU exports to South Korea is significantly positive for most of the sectors, while the effects on EU imports from South Korea are more mixed. In particular, there is no significant effect on imports of Computer, Electronic and Optical Equipment and Electrical Equipment (see their Table 91), which are quantitatively important sectors (see below). Grübler and Reiter (2021) find that the EU-South Korea FTA increases bilateral trade on average by 9.42%, which is smaller than my estimate. In their regressions, they do neither account for anticipation nor for delayed effects. They also disentangle the effects of tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs). In the regressions where they separately control for tariffs, the EU-South Korea FTA dummy does not show up significantly. This suggests that NTMs have on average no additional role in explaining trade flows, once tariffs are controlled for. I stick to the ‘umbrella’ approach with a single dummy that picks up changes in tariffs and NTMs, but additionally explore anticipation and delayed effects as well as directional effects. Juust et al. (2020) use a sample of 36 countries for the period 2005-2015. Thus, the number of trading partners is very small. Moreover, the dataset only covers two years prior to the launch of the trade negotiations. They also find differential effects on EU exports to and imports from Korea. In their regressions, they focus on the transition periods 2011-2013 and 2011-2015. I consider the period from 1980-2016 (and RTAs until 2021) and estimate directional effects also within country pairs. Using product level data, Lakatos and Nilsson (2017) show that, compared to the period before negotiations began, the EU-South Korea FTA had a positive impact on trade during the start of negotiations (June 2007) and after the initialling of the agreement (Sept 2009). While their dataset contains detailed (8-digit) product-level information on trade between EU countries and South Korea, I consider trade at the aggregate (manufacturing) level, but include other countries as well in order to be able to properly control for country-specific effects and other free trade agreements. Moreover, I also account for delayed effects. The paper is also related to Larch et al. (2021) who explore the average and the heterogeneous effects of the EU-Turkey Customs Union. They use a similar approach, allow additionally for heterogeneity across sectors, but use a shorter dataset (1988-2006) and do not apply bias corrections. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I give an overview of the trade environment before and after the EU-South Korea FTA. In Sects. 3 and 4, respectively, the structural gravity framework and the data are presented. Section 5 contains the econometric specifications and results. The final section discusses explanations for the observed heterogeneity in the trade effects.",3

Indeed, the recent pandemic unveiled the risks associated with higher international dependency. Plummeting world trade due to the numerous Covid-19 outbreaks disrupted global supply chains and supply of consumer products. Related to this discussion, we study the role of national lockdowns for bilateral trade with China. We present an econometric analysis of the changes in Chinese trade with particular focus on lockdown policies imposed by China’s trading partners. Lockdowns may have positive and negative effects on bilateral trade. Plummeting demand for Chinese goods can be explained by stricter restrictions on international exchange or less demand by consumers and firms for Chinese products during the lockdown. In contrast, Chinese exports may compensate for declined domestic production caused by lockdown measures as workplace closing or stay at home orders. The net-effect may be negative, positive or even insignificant. To get a first impression, we conduct a panel regression analysis explaining the difference in monthly exports and imports between 2019 and 2020 by various Covid-19 indicators. The results suggest that countries with stricter lockdown measures imported less goods from China (denoted by Chinese exports). However, we also find the less intuitive result that countries with more stringent lockdowns exported more to China (denoted by Chines imports). The less intuitive results obtained from the benchmark regression analysis motivate a decomposition analysis of total trade into observed and unobserved trade components. We build this analysis on Brueckner et al. (2020). The authors suggest a standard gravity approach that allows predicting residual trade flows that cannot be explained by the standard gravity determinants. We then confront the residuals with our lockdown measure. This approach allows studying the role of GDP. The residuals are net of expected trade due to the respective country’s level of GDP. Moreover, constructing a counterfactual GDP predicted using the expansion path of GDP before the pandemic. This allows predicting how much of the changes in trade are due to the rapid decline in GDP. The less intuitive result for imports disappears when focusing on residual trade. Lockdowns can be associated with less residual imports and exports. Another shortcoming in the benchmark analysis is that we are unable to draw a conclusion about the persistence of the lockdown effects. How fast do those effects disappear after launching the lockdown? We shed light on this question using an event study approach that allows distinguishing between short- and long-run effects of the lockdown. This procedures allows us to analyze the effects at different stages of the shock. The launch of the lockdown is associated with an increase in Chinese trade when omitting unobserved heterogeneity. The effects turn negative when controlling for fixed effects in the short-run. These results show that controlling for unobserved heterogeneity matters, which supports the approach proposed by Brueckner et al. (2020). There are several reasons why we picked China as reference country for our analysis of potential trade effects associated with non-pharmaceutical Covid-19 prevention. China is an important supplier for both consumer products and intermediate goods and most countries in the world somehow rely on trade with China. Moreover, China’s role in the pandemic was special. The country managed bringing the pandemic under control within a rather short period of time by imposing a rigorous zero-Covid strategy while other countries were struggling with less successful lockdown strategies. COVID-19 pandemic course for selected countries Figure 1 compares different transmission rates of Covid-19 between Brazil (BRA), China (CHN), Italy (ITA), South Korea (KOR) and the USA (USA). While China and South Korea reported very low levels of new cases per 1 million residents within one dayFootnote 1, countries such as Italy, the USA or Brazil experience very high transmission rates, with sometimes more than 700 new cases per 1 million inhabitants per day. China’s reaction to the pandemic was an important predictor for the developments in the rest of the world for various reasons. Firstly, the world became aware of the threat because of China’s rigorous combat against the spread of the virus in early 2020. Secondly, the short-run impact of such an intervention was already observable in China’s GDP growth at the beginning of the crisis. China’s GDP fell by approximately 10 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Thirdly, China is still one of the most important exporters in the world. Thus, the lockdown-effects in China were transmitted through international supply linkages to other countries relying on China. However, the Covid-19 crisis sequentially affected most of China’s trade partners when China was already back to normal, which makes it a good control group. Our analysis builds upon the hypothesis that lockdowns trigger supply and demand shocks. Companies in countries that introduce a more stringent lockdown may have difficulties producing intermediate and final goods. Some of the domestic production must be substituted by imports from other countries. We argue that China was able to fill the gap by supplying enough goods when production in other countries was plummeting due to a lockdown. The demand shock operates into the opposite direction. More stringent lockdowns may curb consumers demand through lower wages and less opportunities of consuming commodities. Moreover, the growing sentiments against China may have reinforced this downward trend. Another potential channel for trade effects due to a lockdown operates through reduced trade costs. Some economies reduced trade barriers for specific goods: Argentina suspended the anti-dumping duties on Chinese medical products. Canada remitted tariffs for specific products if they are imported by health institutions and even the USA exclude a range of medical protective gear and equipment from additional duties. Figure 2 gives a first glimpse at the observable effects on bilateral trade with China - China’s monthly export growth between 2006 and beginning 2021. Change in Exports (2006-11 to 2021-2) Compared to the crisis in 2008, the Covid-19 outbreak caused a much more pronounced decline in Chinese export growth of nearly 40%. But by mid-2020, Chinese exports were already back on their initial growth path. The increase in exports more than compensated for the previous decline. The impact of the crisis in 2008 was less pronounced but more persistent. The analysis is structured as follows: The next subsection provides a literature overview. Subsequently, we present the empirical strategy as well as the data used in our analysis. A discussion of our empirical results is presented in chapter four. The last chapter concludes and give some political implications. Several studies investigate the trade-off between public health and economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and related lockdown policies in economic models.Footnote 2 Additionally, there is an emerging literature on the affects of the pandemic crisis on international trade. Overall, empirical studies suggest a reduction in the volume of internationally traded goods during the crisis (e.g. Baldwin and Tomiura (2020), Espitia et al. (2021), Gruszczynski (2020), Guan et al. (2020)). Based on a gravity approach, Hayakawa and Mukunoki (2021) identify negative effects on international trade for both importing and exporting countries. Espitia et al. (2021) identify heterogeneous effects across sectors. Industries producing medical products experience positive effects on exports, whereas trade in non-essential durable goods is persistently negative affected. Guan et al. (2020) analyze different lockdown scenarios and their effects on global supply chains. The authors find that trade in intermediaries reacts less sensitive to lockdown restrictiveness than lockdown duration. The overall losses would have been much smaller if lockdown policies were established earlier, stricter and shorter. Verschuur et al. (2021) find stronger effects for economies with strong trading links to China, such as Australia or Malaysia. In contrast, Vietnam seems to benefit from trade diversion effects from China to its own economy. Liu et al. (2021) investigate how the pandemic and lockdown policies in countries affected imports from China. Thus, their paper is closely related to our paper. Overall, the results suggest a dominance of the negative demand effect over the negative supply effect resulting in a reduced volume of imports from China. The effects differ across sectors. Additionally, the authors identify a trade diversion effects to China, if the main trading partner is affected more severely. We replicate their findings using our own data. However, we depart from their approach by studying the effects on residual trade flows and we are using an event study approach as well. The event study approach shows that the effects are significant in the very short-run and disappear after two months.",
