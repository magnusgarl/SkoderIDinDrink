However, an unintentional effect of teaching household skills may be to influence occupational and educational choice by encouraging the daughter to turn into a chambermaid in the hotel industry. This paper presents the idea that household skills decrease demand for higher education by qualifying for some service occupations. Individuals with more household skills have less incentive to choose occupations that require higher education, because the future earnings of higher educated employees must not only compensate for tuition costs and foregone earnings during education but also absorb the indirect costs of lower household production while studying and later in life. In economic literature, the home is the site of consumption and leisure. In her classic work, Reid (1934, pp. 6–7) distinguishes consumption and leisure activities that you prefer to do yourself (i.e. reading the newspaper) as opposed to household production that you would like somebody else to do for you (i.e. cleaning). Household skills are learnt at home in a learning-by-doing process and increase productivity both in household production and in occupations with tasks similar to household production. Of course, the types of household skills that are acquired at home vary according to time and space. Modern, industrialised economies are addressed here and such types of household production as caring for babies and dependants, cleaning, cooking, driving, gardening, laundry, car maintenance, house maintenance, shopping, production and repair of clothes and seeking household information. A person with much household skill has a high productivity at home in unpaid work and can earn a living from a job in firms like bakeries, restaurants, laundries, gardeners and day-care centers. Organised training may add to certain household skills; according to Becker (1991, p. 27): ‘Some investments, such as on-the-job training, mainly raises the productivity of market time; others, such as classes in child care, cooking, or art history, mainly raise the productivity of household time.’ However, classes in cooking increase productivity in jobs, such as kitchen help as well, whereas classes in child care increase productivity in jobs as a child care assistant. In this paper, I present a model of how household skills can influence college enrolment. Household skills supplement the explanations suggested in the literature: college costs, borrowing constraints, business cycle, parental education, family income and wealth and scholastic preparedness (math and language skills). I return to the latter in Sections 3 and 4. According to my model, declining household skills may have contributed to the observed increasing demand for higher education. As mothers entered the labour market, learning-by-doing options for household skills were reduced, especially for girls, thereby increasing female demand for higher education. My model is a partial equilibrium model in which persons with varying household skills choose between becoming a chambermaid earning a piece-rate wage v or becoming an economist by graduating from higher education and earning an hourly wage rate w. The wage rates v and w are exogenously given. I show how persons with more household skills than a critical value a* will opt for the chambermaid job, while those with lower household skills than a* will become an economist. I have elsewhere shown how this partial equilibrium can be embedded in a general equilibrium model.Footnote 1
 The remainder of the paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 presents the partial equilibrium model that shows that youth with more household skills are less inclined to choose higher education because of higher opportunity cost of education. They are willing to accept lower wage rates in household skilled jobs than predicted by traditional human capital theory. Section 3 discusses limitations of the model, measurement problems of household production and skills and presents results from relevant studies. Section 4 addresses educational policy issues, and the concluding Section 5 suggests that the main idea that household skills represent an opportunity cost of schooling may be highly relevant in developing countries.",3

Even though India experienced in the 1990s a period of relatively high economic growth, the decline in infant and child mortality rates slowed down (see Claeson et al. 1999). As an explanation for the decline in infant and child mortality rates after an increase in income, Pritchett and Summers (1996) mention that an increase in income is usually accompanied by increased public and private expenditures in health inputs. However, in India, both state and central governments suffered from severe financial pressure due to a focus on reforms in industrial and trade policies (e.g., Ahluwalia 2002). In particular, rural areas where 75% of the Indian population live saw declined growth rates in public investments in drainage, water, electricity, irrigation, infrastructure, education, and health care. Arulampalam (2007) argues that rural areas of India lag behind many developing countries in terms of health, social, and economic development. Hobcraft et al. (1985) indicate that, at different ages, there are differential associations between mortality rates and socioeconomic characteristics. Fikree et al. (2002) show that the causes of neonatal deaths are quite different from the causes of post-neonatal deaths. Most empirical studies assume, however, that health inputs have constant impacts on child mortality over the age of the child (e.g., Guo and Rodriguez 1992; Maitra 2004; Ridder and Tunalı 1999; Sastry 1997). We contribute to the existing literature by constructing a very flexible model that allows the impacts of health inputs to change as the child gets older. We show that a hazard rate model can very easily deal with time-varying covariate effects. More precisely, we allow socioeconomic and environmental characteristics to have different effects on neonatal (first month), infant (12 months), and child (60 months) mortality, which are the most often studied health outcomes. For example, Bhalotra and Van Soest (2008) consider neonatal mortality, while Arulampalam (2007), Arulampalam and Bhalotra (2006), and Bhargava (2003) focus on infant mortality, and Makepeace and Pal (2008) investigate child mortality. Our paper thus contributes to understanding why results may differ between studies. It is well known that, even after controlling for family-specific characteristics, there often remains unobserved frailty at the family level, which is important in explaining child mortality. Not properly taking account of these unobserved characteristics or the relation between children within a family may lead to inconsistent and inefficient estimators (i.e., Guo and Rodriguez 1992; Ridder and Tunalı 1999; Sastry 1997; Vaupel et al. 1979). Like, for example, Arulampalam and Bhalotra (2006) and Bhalotra and Van Soest (2008), we allow for random family-specific effects (i.e., similar for all children from the same mother). However, we follow Sastry (1997) and allow for frailty on more levels. In particular, we also allow for frailty at the level of the child. To distinguish these types of frailty, we exploit that children within the same family are related, which implies that they might share some unobserved characteristics. Unlike Sastry (1997), we do not restrict the different types of frailty to be independent of each other. It should, however, be noted that identification requires unobserved components to be age-invariant. The key objective of our model is to identify the relevant mortality determinants at different ages of a child, which is important for designing effective public policies for reducing child mortality. We are particularly interested in socioeconomic and environmental characteristics, such as mother’s education, source of drinking water, sanitation facility, type of cooking fuels, access to electricity, and availability of medical services. In low-income countries, these health inputs absorb a large share of the household expenditure (Pritchett and Summers 1996). Our empirical model can be used to identify households with high child mortality risks, which can be useful for targeting resources and policy towards such households. We also provide some indication of the health benefits of possible public programs targeted at improving households’ health-related resources. We estimate the model using data from the National Family Health Survey 1998/1999 of India.Footnote 1 This is a rich, nationally representative database that covers around 90,000 households living in India. The Indian National Family Health Survey is used by, for example, Arulampalam and Bhalotra (2006), Bhalotra and Van Soest (2008), Bhargava (2003), Makepeace and Pal (2008), Maitra (2004), and Withworth and Stephenson (2002) to investigate various aspects of infant and child mortality in India. We focus on the rural areas. We find that a formal statistical test rejects the standard hazard rate model with constant impacts of socioeconomic and environmental characteristics over ages against our model, which allows for differential age impacts. However, when comparing policy simulations, both models have similar results. Both models show that child mortality at all ages can be reduced significantly by improving the mother’s education. The effect of mother’s education increases, however, substantially after the first month. Maitra (2004) shows that mother’s education has a strong effect on demand for health care. Also, safe water and reducing indoor air pollution by using clean cooking fuels or having a separate kitchen can substantially reduce child mortality. We also find that, after controlling for socioeconomic differences between households, there are still significant differences in mortality rates between states. Arulampalam (2007) argues that there is clustering of mortality rates within states. Pritchett and Summers (1996) mention the importance of public expenditures on health inputs for reducing infant and child mortality. Since a substantial share of public expenditures are determined at the state level, we provide a decomposition of the state-level fixed effects. The decomposition shows that there are observed state-level characteristics, which are important in explaining the state-level fixed effects. We find that child mortality is negatively associated to schooling expenditures and female immunization rates. This provides guidance that state-level public policies are important. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the statistical model. Section 3 describes the data. Estimation results and sensitivity analyses are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.",9

Topel and Ward (1992) show that for young workers, only one third of the wage increases can be attributed to job changes. Within a firm workers can climb a usually well-defined hierarchy. Promotions to higher levels occur when workers accumulate human capital or when firms learn about workers’ productivity. These promotions are often associated with substantial wage increases. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the relation between wage increases, promotions and job-to-job transitions. There exists both an extensive theoretical literature on wage development and promotions (e.g. Gibbons and Waldman 1999), and on job transitions (e.g. Jovanovic 1979; Burdett and Mortensen 1998). But the link on what goes on inside and outside the firm is limited, both theoretically and empirically. Exceptions are recent studies by Ghosh (2007), Kahn (2007), Schönberg (2007) and Pinkston (2009). We use a dynamic framework to investigate up to what extent promotions and job changes can be predicted by the past career path, and how promotions and job changes affect wage increases. To estimate dynamic models, we need data covering a sufficiently long period. The Portuguese-matched employer–employee data Quadros de Pessoal describe a relatively long observation period, and include precise and detailed information on both firms and workers. It is based on an annual enquiry of all firms with wage earners in the private sector. Since firms report wages, hierarchical levels, detailed job descriptions, promotion dates, firm size etc., measurement errors are most likely smaller than in worker survey data. Furthermore, we can continue following workers also when switching employers. Since job turnover is non-random, this is an advantage over the empirical literature on internal labor markets using only data from a single firm. It should be noted that the Portuguese labor market is characterized by a centralized wage system setting rules for wage increases and career progression. However, empirical studies have concluded that there is a substantial degree of wage flexibility. For example, Cardoso and Portugal (2005) suggest that agreements reached by collective bargaining are adjusted by firms’ subsequent arrangements. Our findings are, therefore, not only the consequence of existing institutions, but also reflect labor-market dynamics. We construct two measures for promotions. The data include the worker’s hierarchical level, which is ranked by a well-defined hierarchy. Our first measure for promotions is based on changes in hierarchical level. Also Lluis (2005) uses changes in hierarchical levels as measure for promotions. This definition connects to the theoretical literature where a promotion is considered to be a change in hierarchical level accompanied by a change in the worker’s production technology (e.g. Bernhardt 1995; Gibbons and Waldman 1999). An advantage of using changes in hierarchical level as promotion is that it also identifies promotions coinciding with a job-to-job transition. Indeed, Scoones and Bernhardt (1998) provide a theoretical model in which job-to-job transitions are associated with promotions. The second measure for promotions uses whether the firm reports that the worker has been promoted in the past year. We show that both promotion concepts differ substantially. Less than 30% of the changes in hierarchical level are also considered promotions by the employer. Furthermore, about 40% of the employer-reported promotions are not associated with a change in detailed job description. The wage returns to an employer-reported promotion are substantially higher than returns to a change in hierarchical level. Also in other aspects the estimation results differ substantially between the two promotion concepts. Our interpretation of these findings is that the eight hierarchical levels distinguished in the data are too broad to capture all changes in job complexity and responsibilities, while firms might also report substantial wage increases as promotions rather than changes in job tasks. Our empirical results show that after controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity there remains serial correlation in changes in hierarchical levels. Within the theoretical framework of Gibbons and Waldman (1999), this is considered evidence in favor of symmetric learning. However, wage increases do not forecast promotions and serial correlation in wage increases is absent. The data also do not show the type of serial correlation in wage increases as predicted by Chiappori et al. (1999) under symmetric learning. There are substantial returns to switching employers, but the pattern of job-to-job transitions is not fully consistent with basic job-search theory (e.g. Burdett and Mortensen 1998). Asymmetric employer learning might be a possible explanation for the substantial returns to both promotions and job turnover. This evidence is only circumstantial, we do not provide direct tests for asymmetric employer learning, and there is no single model which is consistent with all our findings. Another possible explanation might be that workers are searching for a good match, as modeled by Jovanovic (1979). Finally, it should be noted that the estimation results are quite similar for men and women and for different educational groups, but differ between blue and white-collar sectors. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss recent theoretical literature concerning promotions, wage increases and job transitions. This theoretical literature is used to guide the specification of our empirical models, which are presented in Section 3. Section 4 provides a detailed description of the data. In Section 5 we present our empirical results. Section 6 provides sensitivity analyses. Section 7 concludes.",16

Hamermesh,Philippe Weil,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Men engage in more market work than women. What have not been thoroughly examined, and indeed have been almost ignored by economists, are gender differences in the total amount of work—the sum of work in the market and at home. Despite the obvious importance of looking more closely at how people spend their non-work time, relatively little attention has been paid to describing its patterns and examining its determinants. A few studies have considered how the price of time affects the distribution of non-work time (Biddle and Hamermesh 1990; Kalenkoski et al. 2009); and Freeman and Schettkat (2005) have examined possible trade-offs between market and non-market work in a few countries. This line of inquiry has been limited by the relative paucity of available data sets. This absence of data has begun to change, and that change enables us to examine gender differences in the allocation of total work time. The issue of gender differences in time use is important for a number of reasons. First, because the amount of work (and thus the utility from leisure) is one of the crucial arguing points in the “gender wars,” simply discovering new facts about it is important. Second, the determinants of those facts allow inferring how patterns of work by gender change as economies develop. Third, by generating new explanations for patterns of gender differences in the amount of total work, we may provide an impetus for using similar theories to examine other differences in the allocation of time. Finally, these facts and the related theoretical discussion impose restrictions on a variety of economic models. Our purposes here are to document in much greater detail a fact that has been essentially ignored by economists and that appears unknown to the public, and to offer and test some explanations for it. In the next section, we describe what we mean by market and household work and examine the gender breakdown of work at home and in the market using time-diary data from 27 countries. Whether the facts that we adduce in Section 2 are novel, and whether they are already widely known, are examined in Section 3. Section 4 considers some possible explanations of our findings and indicates which ones seem inconsistent with aggregate data. Section 5 examines some microeconometric evidence. The end result is a variety of facts and the ability to rule out some explanations for them. Section 6 indicates how these considerations might be used to inform how we model a variety of economic behavior.",95

It has gained attention in academic research as well as in the public debate (see, for example, Bloom et al. 2008, 2010a, 2011; The Economist 2009, 2011, for an overview). While declining fertility—even below the replacement level—triggers increases in the mean age of a certain population and slows down population growth, decreasing old age mortality allows individuals to enjoy the benefits of retirement for longer time periods. Just to get an impression of the severity of the demographic changes, we are facing the following: on the global scale, the total fertility rate has dropped from five children per woman in 1950 to 2.5 children per woman today, while life expectancy has increased from 48 years in 1950 to 68 years today (cf. United Nations 2011; Bloom et al. 2011). The economic consequences of these developments are expected to be huge. To mention only the most well known examples, support ratios will decline such that fewer and fewer workers will have to carry the burden of financing more and more retirees (see for example Gertler 1999; Gruescu 2007); overall productivity levels will change because workers have age-specific productivity profiles and the age decompositions of societies will shift (see Skirbekk 2008, for an overview); and the savings behavior of individuals will change because they expect to live longer (see for example Heijdra and Ligthart 2006; Heijdra and Romp 2008). However, as regards the implications of population aging for per capita output growth in a setting with diminishing marginal products of capital, there are only transient effects of changing support ratios, changing savings behavior of households, and changing aggregate productivity profiles. The reason is that a shift from high to low fertility cannot lead to a permanently changing age decomposition of a certain population (cf. Preston et al. 2001), and the induced change in the savings behavior of households has only level effects on per capita output (cf. Solow 1956; Cass 1965; Koopmans 1965; Diamond 1965). By contrast, we are interested in the implications of population aging for per capita output growth over a long time horizon. Since technological progress has been identified as the main determinant of long-run economic prosperity (see for example Romer 1990; Aghion and Howitt 1992; Jones 1995a; Segerström 1998), we are particularly concerned with the effects of changing age decompositions on research and development (R&D) intensities. The natural model classes to investigate these effects are endogenous and semi-endogenous growth frameworks, where the R&D effort of a society is determined by general equilibrium forces due to the interaction between utility-maximizing households and profit-maximizing firms. Endogenous growth models with purposeful R&D investments (see for example Romer 1990; Grossman and Helpman 1991; Aghion and Howitt 1992) state that, aside from other influences, the population size of a certain country is crucial for its long-run economic development. The argument is that larger countries are able to grow faster because they have more scientists to employ and feature larger markets with more profit opportunities for innovative firms. This is called the scale effect, which was, however, questioned by Jones (1995b) because it had not been supported by empirical evidence. In another contribution, Jones (1995a) paved the way for semi-endogenous growth models (see also Kortum 1997; Segerström 1998), where long-run economic performance is affected by population growth rather than population size. The basic idea of semi-endogenous growth models is that developing a constant share of new technologies becomes more and more difficult with an expanding technological frontier. Consequently, ever more scientists have to be devoted to R&D activities in order to sustain a certain pace of technological progress. In the long run, this can only be achieved by having positive population growth. Despite that the described models examine the economic growth effects of changes in demographic patterns as represented by population size and population growth, they remain silent when it comes to the consequences of population aging. The reason is their common underlying assumption that economies are populated by representative identical individuals who live forever. We introduce age-specific heterogeneity of individuals by generalizing these frameworks to account for finite individual planning horizons and overlapping generations in the spirit of Blanchard (1985) in case of the endogenous growth paradigm and in the spirit of Buiter (1988) in case of the semi-endogenous growth paradigm. In so doing, we assume that individuals do not live forever but that they have to face a certain probability of death at each instant. Furthermore, we allow for endogenous fertility choices inspired by Barro and Becker (1989), Sato and Yamamoto (2005), and Miyazawa (2006), where parents want to have children, while they also face the associated costs in terms of foregone consumption. The standard endogenous and semi-endogenous growth models are then special cases of our framework with the probability of death being equal to zero and fertility being exogenously given. For analytical tractability, the mortality rate has to be age-independent in our model. Consequently, the interactions between child mortality and fertility decisions cannot be studied satisfactorily within its realm. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that this is a very important topic: Doepke (2005) analyzes the implications of decreasing child mortality for the predictions of the Barro and Becker (1989) model and concludes that a decrease in child mortality alone cannot explain the slowdown of population growth within this framework. By contrast, Kalemli-Ozcan (2002, 2003) assume that parents are risk averse and use this framework to investigate the interactions between child mortality and human capital investments. The finding is that a decline in the exogenous child mortality rate reduces precautionary demand for children, which has the potential to reduce population growth. The slowdown in population growth, in turn, allows parents to raise investments in children’s human capital, which enables countries in a preindustrial stage of development to escape from the Malthusian trap. Furthermore, Cigno (1998) focuses on the implications that endogenous child mortality has on the fertility decision of parents and finds that mortality and fertility are positively related if parents realize that they can increase the survival probabilities of their children by spending more for child nutrition and health. If child mortality is high (less developed countries), governmental investments aimed at reducing child mortality raise parent’s investments in the number of children as well as in the nutrition and health of these children, which altogether promotes population growth. By contrast, if child mortality is low (developed countries), further governmental investments in reducing child mortality mainly lead to lower investments of parents both in the number of their kids as well as in their nutrition and health. Thus, at this stage of development, governmental policies that reduce child mortality primarily represent a subsidy on parent’s consumption. We conclude that very interesting and relevant interactions occur once that (endogenous) child mortality is taken into account. It should therefore be considered in a follow-up simulation study, where analytical tractability is less important and therefore mortality can be allowed to vary with age. Altogether, our results indicate that a more realistic demographic structure in traditional endogenous and semi-endogenous growth models is desirable because it allows to disentangle the growth effects of a changing population size from those of a changing population age structure. We can also show that the growth effects of population aging differ between the endogenous growth paradigm and the semi-endogenous growth paradigm. In particular, we find that decreasing mortality has a positive effect on long-run growth, while the converse holds true for decreasing fertility. The positive effects of decreases in mortality outweigh the negative effects of decreases in fertility in case of the Romer (1990) model, while the positive and negative effects exactly offset each other in the Jones (1995a) framework. Furthermore, population aging positively impacts long-run economic growth in the Romer (1990) case, whereas its particular effect in the Jones (1995a) case depends on the relative change between fertility and mortality. Two other branches of the literature closely relate to our efforts. The first one (Reinhart 1999; Futagami and Nakajima 2001; Petrucci 2002) basically follows the Romer (1986) assumption that there are knowledge spillovers in the production process, and, hence, there are no diminishing returns of capital in the aggregate production function. This assumption allows them to draw conclusions on the effects of demographically induced changes in individual savings behavior even on long-run economic growth performance. A very interesting recent contribution (Schneider and Winkler 2010) uses this framework to endogenize the rate of mortality and to analyze the welfare implications of individual health investments. However, the knowledge spillover model of Romer (1986) has been criticized because empirical evidence rather points toward a diminishing marginal product of capital (cf. Mankiw et al. 1992). Furthermore, one cannot analyze the effects of aging on purposeful R&D investments within such a framework and, as we will see later on, the transmission mechanism of the impact of aging on economic growth within these types of models differs to our approach because we also allow for an endogenous interest rate. The second related branch to our work (Kalemli-Ozcan et al. 2000; Cervellati and Sunde 2005; Hazan and Zoabi 2006) focuses on the implications of population aging on human capital accumulation and basically states that an increase in the life expectancy of individuals renders investments in human capital more profitable. Consequently, human capital accumulation increases, which fosters economic growth via the particular link that these models establish between human capital accumulation and economic development.Footnote 1 However, also these models do not consider the effects of aging on purposeful R&D investments and therefore the transmission mechanism of the effects of aging on economic growth is, by its very nature, different to ours. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes a model that nests the Romer (1990) and the Jones (1995a) frameworks as special cases and features a richer demographic structure. Section 3 examines the effects of demographic change for long-run economic growth perspectives in the nested specifications. Section 4 draws conclusions and highlights scope for further research.",117

It is the upper bound T that we put on top of the integral or sum sign when we compute expected lifetime utility of a representative agent. Life span differs conceptually from life expectancy. Although we frequently treat life- expectancy, a measure, which depends on the probability to survive from one period to the next, as a constant, this is an assumption made “for convenience”, since survival depends certainly on the macroeconomic environment (GDP per capita, doctors per square kilometer, etc.) and on individual economic decisions (nutrition, health expenditure, etc.). While most of economic theory is based on the simplifying assumptions of either certain survival until a given end of life or a given age-unrelated survival probability per time unit of life (based on Yaari 1965 and Blanchard 1985), there exists also a, by now, rich literature that tries to endogenize survival and to incorporate empirically plausible survival probabilities into economic reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, however, there exists no research in economics on human life span.Footnote 1
 With contrast to life expectancy, which is population specific and situation specific, life span is usually conceptualized as a species-specific characteristic (Arking 2006; Gavrilov and Gavrilova 1991). Life expectancy of a population of mice, for example, depends on the specific environment in the wild or in the laboratory. Life span of mice, in contrast, is independent from such conditions but it differs from the life span of fruit flies or elephants. Likewise, life expectancy of a particular human population differs across countries (England vs. Uganda) and over time (England today vs. 200 years ago). Life span of human beings, however, if it exists, should be invariant across populations. Probably all biologists agree to this notion of life span. But how to measure life span is—in contrast to life expectancy—less easily agreed upon. Defining human life span as the maximum attainable age at death, as suggested in many general dictionaries and many older contributions in biology, is certainly misleading (Wilmoth 1999; Carey 2003). Conceptually, this idea is refuted by the insight that “however old we are, our probability to die within the next hour is never equal to one” (Jacquard 1982). Empirically, it has been refuted by the observation that maximum age at death has been continuously on the rise for at least 140 years (Wilmoth and Robine 2003). The simple fact that the “sample size” of people who ever lived on earth is continuously rising lets us expect that the maximum ever-observed life length will rise as time proceeds. This is impressively shown by Finch and Pike (1996). They define life span T as the estimated age at death of the last survivor of a population such that \(S(x)=1/N\) is the probability to be the last man standing out of N. Plugging 1/N into an empirically estimated Gompertzian survival function, they obtain a life span of 105 years for \(N=10^3\) and 114 years for \(N=10^7\). In general, the dependence of maxima on sample size is a well-known fact of the statistics of extreme values (Gumbel 1958). From these observations, it should be clear that life span, in contrast to life expectancy, cannot be defined as a mere statistical measure without biological foundation. We need some understanding about the biological mechanism of aging in order to infer an intrinsic mechanism that governs the pace at which our bodies deteriorate. Following standard reasoning in modern biology by taking aging and death as stochastic processes (Arking 2006), we are interested in whether a regularity exists which is common to all humans independently from environmental and genetic characteristics. From this regularity, if it exists, we try to infer life span not as an absolute maximum but as the characteristic length of life.Footnote 2
 We begin our pursuit of human life span in Section 2 by introducing two very strong empirical regularities, the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality and the compensation effect of mortality. These empirical regularities are theoretically supported by reliability theory as shown by Gavrilov and Gavrilova (1991) and other bio-gerontologists. This led to the development of a novel theoretically founded conceptualization of human life span. We sketch the essence of this theory and its consequences in Section 2.3. The most important quantitative implication is that human life span can be inferred from the estimated compensation effect of mortality. In Section 3, we show that human life span if it was immutable would lead to a rectangularization of the survival curve and thus would put an upper bound on future advances of human longevity. In Section 4, we estimate the parameters of the Gompertz–Makeham equation using the method of nonlinear least squares and data on age-specific mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database (2010). We then use the estimated parameters to analyze the compensation effect of mortality and infer human life span. We observe a time-invariant compensating effect until the mid-twentieth century for all countries in our sample. For the second half of the twentieth century, we find evidence for a secular increase of human life span. In other words, we find that human ingenuity has effectively interfered with nature and has created “manufactured lifetime” (Carnes and Olshansky 2007). Finally, we show that life expectancy in the second half of the last century increased in sync with life span. To a large and increasing extent, we are living longer because technological progress has changed the way we age and the way our bodies decay. Our study continues the work of Strehler and Mildvan (1960) and Gavrilov and Gavrilova (1991). Compared to these earlier works, we used a larger sample consisting of more countries and covering a much longer period of time. This allowed us not only to confirm the earlier result of a time-invariant compensating effect (time-invariant life span) until the mid-twentieth century but also, based on new data from the late twentieth century, to derive the novel result of a secular increase of human life span. This finding in turn allowed us to offer a novel explanation for the observation of “broken limits to life expectancy” (Oeppen and Vaupel 2002): since about the 1970s, later born humans can expect to live longer at least partly because human life span itself is on the rise.",54

For instance, The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that approximately 50 % of fathers and mothers in state prison had at least one other family member that had also been incarcerated: 6 % had an incarcerated mother, 19 % had an incarcerated father, 34 % had an incarcerated brother, 7 % had an incarcerated sister, 2 % had an incarcerated child, and 2 % had an incarcerated spouse (Glaze and Maruschak 2008). What is it about these individuals that cause them to engage in similar antisocial behaviors? Answering this question and identifying the relative contribution of different family and community factors to criminal behavior is crucial in our quest to both identify the fundamental causes of criminal behavior and to develop public policies to combat crime. Thus, the aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of family background and neighborhood effects as determinants of crime. We do this in two ways. We first quantify the role of family and community background for criminal activity by estimating sibling correlations in criminal convictions and incarceration. Siblings share (among other things) genes, parents, family values, and common influences from peers and neighborhoods. The sibling correlation, therefore, provides us with a broad measure of the importance of family and community factors. It tells us what share of the variation in criminal behavior can be traced back to common influences stemming from family and community background. We then run an accounting exercise to see the extent to which a large set of family-wide variables (parental income and education, parental criminality, family structure, and neighborhoods) can account for the sibling correlations in criminal behavior that we report. While a literature studying sibling correlations in crime certainly exists, as does a literature studying the importance of family and community background effects on crime,Footnote 1 we are aware of little research that has combined these two strands of literature to assess the extent to which various family-wide control variables can account for sibling similarities in crime. Footnote 2
 Sibling correlations in criminal behavior have been documented in a number of contexts: varying countries, different types of sibling pairs, administrative versus survey data, various crime types, and different measures of criminality. These estimates range from a low of 0.25 (Mazumder 2008) to a high of 0.69 (Johnson 2007).Footnote 3 Twin studies also report strong sibling similarities in antisocial behavior and crime.Footnote 4 Many of these studies, however, use data from small, selected samples, while studies using data from the NLSY or PSID rely on self-reported data covering a limited time period. Frisell et al. (2011) is an important exception. Their study reports (perhaps for the first time) population-wide sibling correlations using police register data in Sweden, albeit only for violent crime at the extensive margin. They find an extensive margin correlation of 0.41 for brothers and 0.48 for sisters. This paper builds on the existing literature by estimating sibling correlations in criminal convictions and incarceration using Swedish register data on a nationally representative sample of more than 700,000 brothers and sisters born between 1958 and 1968. We have information on all criminal convictions, crime types, and sentences received between the years 1973 and 2007, which allows us to estimate both extensive and intensive margin sibling correlations for different crime types and for both genders. At the extensive margin, our estimated sibling correlations indicate that factors shared by siblings account for 24 % of the variation in convictions and 39 % of the variation in incarceration. At the intensive margin, we find much larger sibling correlations for higher numbers of crimes and longer prison sentences. For example, the brother correlation in having committed at least one crime is 0.29, while the brother correlation in having committed at least 10 crimes is 0.51. We also see similar patterns for sibling correlations after breaking down the data by crime type (violent, property, and other) and no systematic difference between brother correlations and sister correlations. Lastly, we show that closely spaced siblings are more similar in terms of their criminal behavior than are siblings who are born many years apart from each other. We then go on to study the different factors that could potentially explain why siblings are so similar in terms of their criminal behavior. We first look at the effects of family-wide variables that siblings share: parental income and education, parental criminality, and family structure. These variables have been chosen based on our reading of the previous literature on family background and crime. After including these potentially important family characteristics as control variables (when estimating the variance components used to construct our sibling correlations), we assess how much of the sibling similarities in criminal behavior they account for. While this decomposition approach has been used to investigate the determinants of sibling similarities in income, health, and education (Mazumder 2008, 2011; Björklund et al. 2010; Anger and Schnitzlein 2013), it has not been applied to criminal behavior. Sibling correlations decrease by at most 9 % when we control for parental income and education, by at most 21 % when we control for parental criminality, and by at most 19 % when we control for family structure. The largest decrease is seen for the extensive margin measures. Including all of the controls simultaneously decreases the sibling correlations by at most 27 %. These results imply that sibling associations in criminal behavior appear to be driven mainly by factors common to siblings other than parental income and education. Parental criminality and family structure appear more important.Footnote 5 But the largest share remains unexplained. We then show that closely spaced siblings are more similar in terms of their criminal behavior than widely spaced siblings, even after controlling for our full set of family background variables. We argue that part of this effect may be due to a stronger sibling peer effect between closely than widely space siblings. However, using a correlated random-effects model proposed by Altonji et al. (2013), we find little empirical evidence of a direct effect of older siblings’ crime on that of their younger sibling in the following period. We continue our analysis by examining the role of shared neighborhood influences (e.g., schools, peers, local labor markets, etc.) by estimating neighborhood correlations that can (under certain assumptions) be viewed as upper bounds on the potential effects of neighborhood influences (Solon et al. 2000). These correlations tell us that neighborhoods account for only 1 % of the variation in aggregate crime at the extensive margin (or 3 % of sibling similarities) and 2 % of the variation in incarceration at the extensive margin (or 5 % of sibling similarities). At the intensive margin, neighborhood correlations tend to be somewhat larger and explain up to 13 % of the sibling correlation. In a supplementary experiment, we conclude that neighborhood quality may explain part of the neighborhood effect. We also investigate the potential role of family-neighborhood interaction effects. Together, family-wide variables and neighborhood effects can account for one third of the sibling similarities that we observe in our data, leaving the lion’s share unexplained. What these other influences on siblings’ behavior might be is discussed in the conclusion. We also discuss several important caveats that must be kept in mind when interpreting the results from our accounting exercise. In the next section, we outline our statistical model and empirical estimation methods. This is followed, in Section 3, by a presentation of our data and descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we present extensive and intensive margin sibling correlations in crime and incarceration. We then proceed in Section 5 to see what share of these correlations can be accounted for by parental income and education, parental criminality, family structure, sibling peer effects, and neighborhood effects. Section 6 concludes.",29

G. Brown,Klaus F. Zimmermann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Throughout the last three decades, the Journal of Population Economics, an international quarterly journal that publishes original theoretical and applied research in all areas of population economics, has been at the forefront of population economics research.Footnote 1 The issues stretched from micro-level topics as individual, household, or family behavior, including household formation, marriage, divorce, fertility choices, education, labor supply, migration, health, risky behavior, and aging to macro-level analyses as economic growth with exogenous or endogenous population evolution, population policy, savings and pensions, social security, housing, and health care. Moreover, the Journal has also featured research into economic approaches to human biology, the relationship between population dynamics and public choice, and the impact of population on the distribution of income and wealth. In addition, the Journal has attracted papers dealing with policy issues and development problems that are relevant to population questions. Today, issues related to population economics such as the demographic composition of the labor force, including aging populations, migration and refugees, declining fertility rates, and many more policy-relevant topics have been at the fore. With the aim of guiding readers, the Journal traditionally features a lead article with temporary open-access and group articles into thematic clusters. In its 30 years of publishing high-quality research in population economics, the Journal has experienced exciting developments in its editorial processes, its geographical and thematic perspectives, and its successes in impact and ranking. In the next section of this article, we present some selected aspects of these developments. The proliferation of working papers and the respective working paper culture in economics has implications for publishing peer-reviewed journal articles. Some journals in demography and other disciplines have been worried about the potential competition working papers may have for journals. In section 3, we, thus, discuss these implications, the benefits and potential costs of working papers. Specifically, we look into the implications for citations. We argue that the dissemination function, the resulting benefits, and resulting early cites clearly outweigh potential citation losses of journal articles. Finally, we try to identify the citation impacts of working papers in the Journal of Population Economics. Section 4 concludes.",8

They must decide how much to invest in education, how much to save for retirement, how much to invest in health, etc. In each case, these decisions are based on some assessment of the potential welfare at different periods under different scenarios. Following Samuelson (1937), economists have largely adopted a discounted-utility model which assumes that preferences over time can be condensed into one major parameter, the geometric discount rate (see Frederick et al. 2002 for a critical review and Hall 2010 for a review of recent research developed using this approach). To estimate discount rates, both field data and experiments are found in the literature. Experimental studies are by far the most numerous. Among the 42 studies surveyed by Frederick et al. (2002), 34 use experimental methods. A typical approach is for individuals to be offered a menu of (real or hypothetical) choices between a quantity of money now and a different quantity of money at some point in the future. Respondents’ choices are used to estimate a discount rate. Our paper fits into a much smaller literature that estimates discount rates using field data on aspects of behaviour and a lifecycle model of consumption and saving. A typical way to estimate preference parameters in such models, though not the one that we will take, has been to solve numerically the intertemporal optimisation problem that the agents in a particular population are assumed to face. Estimates of parameters such as the discount rate are chosen such that the model’s predictions are close, in some metric and according to some data, to those seen in reality. Such studies vary in the extent to which heterogeneity in the discount factor is admitted into the model. Some papers assume homogenous discounting behaviour, like French (2005) and Edwards (2013) where discounting is exponential and Laibson et al. (2007) where discounting is quasi-hyperbolic. More flexibility was allowed by Attanasio et al. (1999) who estimate a version of the lifecycle model where the discount rate varies stochastically with the composition of the household while even more is allowed by Samwick (1998) and Gustman and Steinmeier (2005) who estimate a different discount rate for every household. These papers fully specify a lifecycle model and solve it. The method we employ does not do this but rather uses the first-order condition to that solution—the Euler equation. We first generate longitudinal observations on consumption using a procedure introduced by Ziliak (1998) and Browning and Leth-Petersen (2003). This involves calculating consumption using comprehensive and high quality data on assets and income and the intertemporal budget constraint. Our resulting distribution of consumption is shown to be remarkably similar to that derived from the UK’s household budget survey. Using the Euler equation and consumption transitions at the household level, we estimate average discount rates for groups of households. Such an approach has typically been precluded in the past by the absence of good quality panel data on consumption—a problem discussed in detail by Browning et al. (2003). Our approach has some parallels with papers that have previously relied on the Euler equation to estimate parameters, in particular the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Estimation in this manner was carried out by Campbell and Mankiw (1989) and Attanasio and Weber (1995) among others. For a lively criticism of this approach, see Carroll (2001) and for a defense see Attanasio and Low (2004). Our approach differs from these papers in three principal ways. First, we are able to use consumption transitions at the household level rather than relying on aggregate or cohort-level data. Second, our use of household rather than cohort level consumption data allows us to use the exact Euler equation in our estimation, rather than relying on Taylor series approximations. Third, we do not assume that the discount rate is the same for each individual in our sample, nor do we assume that it is unchanging across the lifecycle. We apply the procedure outlined above to a representative sample of older English households using the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA). We show, unsurprisingly, that there is substantial heterogeneity in discounting in that population. The typical levels of discount rates that we estimate are of similar magnitude to those estimated in other papers based on the lifecycle model of consumption and saving. These rates imply substantially less discounting than is implied by the results of experimental studies. Our most surprising result is that discount rates tend to rise with education and levels of numerical ability (i.e. those with less education and those who are less numerically able tend to be the most patient). This result is contrary to that found in the literature that measures the extent to which individuals discount future income streams (see for instance Warner and Pleeter 2001; Harrison et al. 2002; Dohmen et al. 2010). These papers differ in their empirical approach—the first uses data on the choices of departing military personnel over whether they will take their severance payment in a lump-sum or in the form of an annuity payment, while the second and third papers use laboratory experiments. The literature using field data offers less conclusive evidence. Gourinchas and Parker (2002) solve a lifecycle model and estimate discount rates by matching simulated consumption data to those observed in the data at different ages and, similar to us, finds that people with more education are less patient. On the contrary, Cagetti (2003), implementing a broadly similar procedure as that used by Gourinchas and Parker, but using data on assets instead of consumption, finds evidence suggesting the more educated are more patient. This is also found by Lawrance (1991), using an approach based on a log-linearised Euler equation and data on transitions in food expenditure. We discuss our somewhat puzzling result below and raise the possibility that prior evidence, driven largely by choices individuals made at younger ages is not applicable to the discounting between periods at older ages. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Our empirical approach is outlined in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the data and explain how we calculate consumption from assets and income. Results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.",8

The first studies fertility and the economic cycle as dynamic phenomena in which shifts in fertility affect economic conditions, and vice versa (Lee 1973). As evidence on fertility-based economic cycles has become more tenuous over time (Poterba2001 and Abel2001), a second and now dominant perspective that focuses more on the effects of economic conditions on fertility has emerged. This second perspective has gained momentum in part due to the recent economic recession from 2008 to 2009,Footnote 1 which has sparked a renewed interest in the effects of economic conditions on fertility. It is now well understood that long-lasting low fertility rates pose a serious threat to the sustainability of transfer schemes, such as the pension system. The current recession has not only been exceptionally severe, it also started in a period in which fertility rates in developed countries were already low. This coincidence could prove particularly harmful, as the onset of the recession in 2008 may have halted the ongoing recovery of fertility rates (Goldstein et al. 2013). While there are a number of channels through which economic conditions can affect fertility, current research has highlighted the importance of unemployment (Sobotka et al. 2011). However, even though it is commonly accepted that high unemployment depresses aggregate fertility (Adserà 2005), theoretical models of family decision-making have traditionally emphasized the lower opportunity cost of childbearing during periods of relatively high unemployment and lower income growth (Becker 1981). The aim of this article is to offer insights into the tension between the early theoretical literature that emphasizes the countercyclical effects of unemployment, and more recent empirical findings that indicate that unemployment has a negative impact on fertility. In this work, I seek to reconcile these conflicting findings by considering the cyclical and the structural components of unemployment separately using a new modeling approach. My results suggest that both perspectives are empirically relevant, and that each simply emphasizes one specific side of the relationship between unemployment and fertility. This work therefore helps to answer the question of whether countercyclical fertility is an empirically relevant phenomenon at an aggregate level. In this work I depart from existing research on fertility and unemployment in two ways. First, I introduce a conceptual distinction between cyclical unemployment and structural unemployment. Using well-established statistical techniques from the business cycle literature, I decompose unemployment into a long-term trend component, or structural unemployment; and a short-term variation in this trend, or cyclical unemployment. My hypothesis is that it is reasonable to expect that families will adjust fertility downward when economic conditions are persistently difficult, but that families might react differently to short-term variations in unemployment. In the next section, I elaborate on how this expectation is well grounded in existing theories of family responses to economic shocks. Second, I suggest a cohort-based modeling approach, and show how both in theory and in the empirical application it has some advantages over the more traditional models based on lagged unemployment and cross-cohort, age-specific period fertility rates. In my cohort model I study completed fertility for different cohorts in 5-year age groups, and relate it to summary statistics of the history of unemployment experienced by the cohort during the period. This allows me to capture the effects of unemployment over longer time horizons, which is not possible when studying the effect of unemployment in a set period with information on the fertility of several different cohorts. I empirically address these questions by examining cohorts with birth years from 1958 to 1969 for nine developed countries. I relate the complete histories of fertility and unemployment with panel data methods, and compare the outcomes from standard models and cohort-based models. My findings demonstrate the advantages of using cohort approaches, and confirm my assumption that the distinction between structural and cyclical employment is empirically relevant. Both components of unemployment have a significant statistical influence, often with opposing signs, that vary depending on the age of the mother. Generally, I find that higher levels of structural unemployment are associated with lower fertility, and that the effect of cyclical variations in unemployment on fertility depends primarily on the age at which a woman experiences these variations. Interestingly, I find evidence that temporary increases in unemployment can have a positive influence among the youngest and the oldest age groups. My findings are robust to the inclusion of labor force participation. The paper is organized as follows. First, I discuss the theoretical foundation of my hypothesis and the background literature within which this work is situated. I then present the data together with my operationalization of the research questions and the estimation method. In the next section, I discuss my empirical results. In the final section, I present my conclusion.",5

The rising top income share in the USA, for example, has inspired many discussions on everyone’s equal opportunity to prosperity through hard work in the formerly known “land of opportunity.” In a recent paper, Chetty et al. (2014a) emphasize the importance of regional differences in income mobility and describe the USA as being, instead of a land of opportunity, a collection of societies some of which are lands of opportunity with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in which few children escape poverty.Footnote 1
 This is the first paper employing high quality register data to study the state of income mobility across regions in Sweden. My data set allows me to analyze national and regional mobility measures very precisely for the Swedish population born between 1968 and 1976. I compute, in addition to the traditional intergenerational elasticity (IGE), national and regional measures of intergenerational income mobility based on income ranks. The basis for these measures, called the rank-rank slope, is obtained by regressing the position (expressed in percentile ranks) of each member of the child generation on the parents’ position in their income distribution. Income ranks are considered more stable over the life cycle compared to income in levels, and no adjustments have to be made in order to accommodate zero income observations (Dahl and DeLeire 2008; Chetty et al. 2014b; Nybom and Stuhler 2016b). I use two different measures in order to describe income mobility on the regional level, based on Chetty et al. (2014a). The first measure is called “relative mobility” and it is computed by scaling up the estimated rank-rank slope by a factor of 100. Relative mobility shows the strength of the association between child and parent income rank by region. In addition, since all incomes are expressed over 100 percentiles, relative mobility measures the difference in mean income rank between children with parents in the top, and children with parents in the bottom of the parent income distribution. In other words, relative mobility tells us about the size of the wedge (in terms of percentile ranks) between average incomes for children from high- and low- income families in each region and is thus also a measure of outcome inequality by region. The second measure informs us about the average income rank a child who grew up in a certain region attains as an adult, given that her parents are located at a specific point in the parent income distribution. This measure is called “absolute mobility at percentile p”. The average child outcome can be calculated for any given parent income rank p, using the estimated intercept and rank-rank slope. I choose to focus on absolute mobility at parent percentile 25 when comparing Swedish regions, given the general interest in how children with disadvantaged background fare as adults. The absolute outcomes for any other parent percentiles can, however, easily be constructed from the reported measures. The geographical unit that I focus on in the regional analysis is “local labor market,” which is an aggregation of municipalities defined by commuting patterns. The local labor market unit is similar to the commuting zone used by Chetty et al. (2014a). However, in comparison to the commuting zones in the USA, there is much more variation between different Swedish local labor markets in terms of population size (and thereby the number of observations). As I show below, this aspect of the data results in imprecise estimates. To remedy this problem, I propose a joint estimation technique using maximum likelihood, referred to as a multilevel (or hierarchical) model. In contrast to the approach taken in Chetty et al. (2014a), where they essentially run a set of distinct regressions, the multilevel model allows me to make a comparison between the different regional mobility measures in a statistically rigorous way. For example, I can test if the mobility estimate of one particular region is statistically significantly different from the national average. For completeness, I also report and discuss results based on separate OLS regressions by region. Even though this paper follows Chetty et al. (2014a) closely in the mobility measures used, there are several important advantages with my study. For instance, Chetty et al. (2014a) assign childhood location based solely upon where individuals lived at the age of sixteen, whereas I define childhood location as the region where a child lived for at least six years between the age of six and fifteen. Thus, I make sure that children are assigned to a region in which they in fact spent a major part of their childhood. Furthermore, when approximating average parent lifetime income, Chetty et al. (2014a) use a 5-year average of both parents’ pretax income between 1996 and 2000. One caveat with this (which is not discussed in their paper) is that parents have their children at different ages and therefore also have different ages in the 1996 to 2000 interval. According to their data description, parents in the core sample are actually between age 29 and 60 when their income is measured. This means that incomes are measured (and subsequently ranked) at very different points during the parents’ life cycles. This can potentially lead to very large measurement error. In this paper, in comparison to Chetty et al., I measure parents’ income over 17 years instead of 5. Moreover, I also measure income during the same age span for all parents. This eliminates the life cycle problem. In order to account for changing economic conditions beyond inflation, I rank parents along two dimensions: by average income and both parents’ birth cohort. My results can be summarized as follows. I find that relative mobility (the scaled rank-rank slope) is relatively homogeneous across Sweden. The outcome inequality in mean rank is 18.2 percentile ranks in most local labor markets. Only 10 areas out of 112 show significantly lower or higher relative mobility, i.e., a larger or smaller difference between children from families with highest and lowest incomes, respectively. Stockholm ranks in the bottom with the lowest relative mobility, and the Varberg region south of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast shows the highest relative mobility. Absolute mobility at percentile rank 25, the expected outcome for children from low income families, varies considerably more across Swedish local labor market areas, between 40.90 percentile ranks in the Årjäng region close to the Norwegian border and 48.61 in the Värnamo region in the center of southern Sweden. This corresponds to a small but highly statistically significant income difference of approximately 20,000 SEK per year (≈2,210 USD). For Sweden as a whole, the association between parent and child income measured by the relationship between income ranks has approximately been constant between 1968 and 1976. Looking separately at daughters and sons, there was an opposite trend with a decreasing association for sons and an increasing association for daughters, which reached equal levels for the last cohort observed. The IGE shows a different development with decreasing mobility between 1971 and 1976 and is misleading: the IGE reflects, in addition to the parent-child income association, also the considerable increase in the ratio of the standard deviations of child over parent income that took place from 1971 onward. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a short background of the IGE, mobility measures based on income ranks, and a description of the multilevel model is given. The data and variables used are described in Section 3. In Section 4, results for intergenerational mobility on the national level and over time are reported. The regional results are the focus of Section 5, including a comparison of the multilevel model to OLS regressions. Section 6 concludes.",34

 This “gradient” is a significant concern for politicians and public health officials, as it implies that inequalities between rich and poor do not only appear as differences in consumption and material well-being, but also in life expectancy and quality of life. Unfortunately, any policy intervention targeted at reducing these inequalities, or promoting public health in general, suffers from the fact that we still know little about if and how wealth affects health. Answering these questions is further complicated by the possibility that causality may go in the opposite direction, from health to wealth.Footnote 2 It could also be that unobserved factors, such as genetics, early childhood exposures, or time preferences, influence wealth and health in the same direction without a causal link.Footnote 3
 Given the practical constraints involved in randomizing people to receive different amounts of wealth, researchers have tried to solve these methodological challenges with quasi-experimental designs, in particular by exploiting exogenous variation generated by individual wealth or income shocks. Important examples include lottery winnings (Lindahl 2005; Gardner and Oswald 2007; Apouey and Clark 2015; Cesarini et al. 2016), stock market fluctuations (Schwandt 2014), inheritances (Meer et al. 2003; Kim and Ruhm 2012; Carman 2013), and unanticipated policy changes (Jensen and Richter 2004; Case 2004; Frijters et al. 2005; Snyder and Evans 2006).Footnote 4 The general finding is that wealth and income have a limited impact on adult health in the short to medium run. Previous studies, however, are limited by the fact that they are almost entirely based on survey data on subjective general health status. Although it has been argued that subjective health status is a good predictor of future morbidity and mortality (Idler and Benyamini 1997; van Doorslaer and Gertham 2003), there are reasons for questioning its use as a dependent variable in this context. For instance, subjective health status is likely to be influenced by factors such as social norms regarding health and use of health care as well as how participants understand the survey questions, which in themselves are systematically related to wealth and income in such a way that the coefficient estimates are biased towards zero (see, for example, Murray and Chen 1992; Bago d’Uva et al. 2008). Moreover, subjective general health status does not separate between different aspects of health. For instance, it has been shown that, on the one hand, improved wealth leads to harmful behaviors such as smoking and drinking and, on the other hand, to reduced obesity, lower stress, and enhanced mental well-being, suggesting that important health effects may go undetected (Lindahl 2005; Apouey and Clark 2015; Kim and Ruhm 2012). This paper manages causality by exploiting a previously untapped and policy-relevant source of exogenous variation in wealth, namely the repeal of the Swedish inheritance tax on December 17, 2004.Footnote 5 Heirs who received inheritance above the tax threshold from parents who passed away after the reform are defined as being treated, as they experienced a favorable shock to their inheritances equal to what their tax payments would have been had the decedent died before the reform. Calculations indicate that this inheritance shock on average amounted to SEK 70,000 (about USD 9500 in 2004 value). This corresponds to around 7% of initial wealth or one quarter of annual taxable income. The empirical strategy is to estimate the causal effect of the inheritance shock on health by approximating the counterfactual outcome with the health experiences of heirs who received inheritance above the tax threshold before the reform date, who subsequently received smaller inheritances than the treated heirs as they had to pay the inheritance tax. Thus, the treatment effect should be interpreted as the effect on health resulting from receiving an additional inheritance.Footnote 6 While the inheritance shock is transitory and relatively limited in magnitude, which implies that its effects do not necessarily capture the relationship between permanent wealth and health, it does provide knowledge about the wealth effects generated by policy changes of similar magnitudes as the repeal of the Swedish inheritance tax affecting middle-aged individuals. In fact, I also report results showing that the impact of the inheritance shock is similar to the impact of inheritance as such. This broadens the generalizability of the main results further as inheritances represent one of the most common increases in wealth that people experience in life. The relevant study population is collected from an administrative database covering the entire population of heirs of deceased Swedes over the time period of 2003–2005. Results from several tests show that the treated and the controls are comparable in predetermined characteristics, including health, implying that any difference in health between the two groups following the inheritance could reasonably be attributed to the inheritance shock. I also conduct placebo experiments, testing for responses among heirs for whom the reform should have no impact, and these results support the validity of the empirical strategy. Further support for this is given by an analysis showing that my main estimates are akin to the estimates obtained for a subsample of heirs whose parents passed away suddenly. The health outcomes are collected from medical records, death certificates, and the Swedish sickness insurance register, and they all share the feature of being based on the medically qualified opinions of physicians. As far as I am aware, this is the first paper investigating the effects of increased economic resources on health by exploiting reform-induced variation in wealth and administrative individual-level data on health outcomes. The main health outcome is an indicator of whether the individual has been hospitalized for any reason in a given year. Comparing the incidences of hospitalization between the treated and the controls over time—10 years before and 6 years after the inheritance—shows that the inheritance shock increases the likelihood of hospitalization by around 5%. This is equal to the impact of being 4 years older. At a first glance, the positive effect on hospitalization may be interpreted as the inheritance shock having a detrimental consequence for health, especially since health care in Sweden is universal and basically free of charge.Footnote 7 Tests for heterogeneous responses across diagnoses reported in connection with the hospital admissions, however, show that the wealth effect is only evident in two diagnosis categories: “symptoms and signs of disease” (e.g., shortness of breath, fever, general feeling of illness) and “cancer.” Regarding cancer, previous studies document that improved wealth leads to more smoking and drinking, behaviors that are positively related to the disease. However, it seems unlikely that the current wealth effect is operating through these channels, given the relatively limited time period over which it is estimated. If the inheritance shock leads to more smoking and drinking, we would instead see responses in diagnoses that are more immediately related to these risk factors (e.g., injuries, mental problems, respiratory diseases). Likewise, if the shock leads to reduced obesity or improved mental well-being (which has also been indicated by previous studies), we would be more likely to find a reduction in the incidence of cancer rather than an increase. One possible explanation is instead that cancer has been detected during health care visits for minor health problems (i.e., symptoms and signs of disease). That the inheritance shock leads to more health care visits, although health care is free in Sweden, could potentially be explained by people demanding good health in order to benefit fully from their improved prospects for future consumption. To get a better understanding of how the inheritance shock affects different aspects of health, tests for responses in (publicly insured) sick leave amounting to more than 2 weeks in addition to in all-cause mortality are conducted, as these two health outcomes are likely to capture health events that are both more and less severe than those resulting in hospital admissions. The results show that the inheritance shock does not have any detectable effect on either of the two outcomes. Although the insignificant wealth effect on sick leave may be attributed to the fact that the analysis is based on the working-age population (for whom the inheritance shock has no detectable effect on hospitalization), the finding lends additional support to the conclusion that the inheritance shock has a negligible consequence on health. The insignificant effect on mortality is expected given the insignificant effect on the prevalence of diseases other than cancer (for which the impact is apparently too small to translate into mortality, at least over a period of 6 years). In sum, the results show that increased wealth has limited short to medium run consequences for objective adult health. This is line with the findings in previous studies. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, I discuss the theoretical predictions regarding the effect of wealth on health, together with an overview of the previous empirical literature. Section 3 describes the inheritance tax, with a particular focus on its unexpected repeal. In Section 4, I discuss the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents the empirical strategies and in Section 6, I present evidence suggesting that the inheritance shock is exogenous. Section 7 contains the results, Section 9 presents a discussion on the generalizability of the findings, and finally, Section 8 provides a concluding discussion.",11

However, critics argue that the positive consequences must be weighed against the potential adverse effects of working longer on health. If workers are unable to work until the raised retirement age or if their health deteriorates at a faster rate due to continued work, the fiscal burden might simply be shifted from the pension system to other parts of the welfare system. Understanding the health effects of retirement age increases, in conjunction with longer working lives, is therefore a crucial issue in pension policy design. This paper studies the consequences of a 2-year increase in the normal retirement age for Swedish local government workers on subsequent health. Prior to year 2000, these workers could retire at age 63 with full pension benefits and an average replacement rate of 73 %. As of 2000, those born before 1938 could continue to retire under the old rules, but those born in or later than 1938 had to work until the age of 65 to claim a full benefit. The new rules incentivized these workers to retire later as each month of retirement before age 65 implied a benefit reduction of 0.4 %. The reform caused a remarkable shift in the retirement distribution, increasing the actual retirement age by more than 4.5 months. The effect of the reform is estimated by examining their subsequent health in ages 65–69. The identification strategy is based on cohort variation in the timing of the reform, and as health measurements, I use drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, and mortality. The main analysis makes use of the cohorts born 1938–1942 who were fully affected by the reform and the cohorts born 1935–1937, who were not affected, in the estimation of the counter-factual health of those born 1938–1942. Because there were very few men in the affected worker categories, the analysis focuses exclusively on women. I use female private sector workers of the same ages who were not affected by the reform to control for general period effects. The control group experienced no major change in retirement incentives during the period of study and are similar to the local government workers along several background covariates. Estimation is thus performed using difference-in-difference regression models, which also allow me to control for pre-reform characteristics of the individuals. The results show no effect on the probability of being prescribed a non-zero quantity of drugs, nor on total drug purchase. There is also no effect on the probability of being hospitalized due to any cause, nor on the number of days spent in hospital. Moreover, tracking mortality up to age 69, I fail to reject the null hypothesis of no causal effect of working longer on mortality. The estimates are precisely estimated, which allows me to bound the effect sizes to a narrow range around zero. Although the empirical framework is based on Swedish public sector workers, the results should be of more general interest. First, data from the European Union Labour Force Survey show that the occupations of interest, including personal care workers, nursing professionals, cleaners, and restaurant service workers, belong to the most common occupations for women both in Sweden and abroad. Second, the focus on low- to medium-paid public sector jobs is relevant from a policy perspective since various discussions of increasing the retirement age thresholds deal primarily with the concern that such increases could adversely affect individuals in low-skilled jobs. The abovementioned occupations are characterized by demanding work environment and relatively high rates of sickness absence. Third, since retirees have equal access to publicly provided health service and medical care as employed individuals, the estimates are likely to capture the direct effect of the retirement age increase on health care utilization and mortality, rather than indirect effects, such as access to health insurance. The effects are also unlikely to operate through a loss of income as the long-run effect of the reform on disposable income is small. Finally, health care utilization is arguably the most important health dimension in estimating the fiscal impact of reforms that promote longer working lives. In 2014, individuals aged 65 and over comprised 20 % of the Swedish population, but they accounted for 40 % of total drug prescriptions and 47 % of all patient discharges from public hospitals (Socialstyrelsen 2015a, b). The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the previous literature, Section 3 discusses the details of the reform, Section 4 describes the methodological framework and the data, Section 5 provides the analysis, and Section 6 concludes.",45

This question is of long-standing interest in the social sciences partly because the answer reveals something about the degree to which inequality is transmitted across generations. An extensive literature has tackled the question by providing estimates of the relationship between parental education and children’s education.Footnote 1 Such estimates reflect both the influence of ‘nature’ and ‘nurture’ but a recent literature, mostly based on a twin and an adoption design, has established that a substantial part of the transmission of education across generations reflects a causal effect of parental education (e.g. Behrman and Rosenzweig 2002; Sacerdote 2002; Plug and Vijverberg 2003; Plug 2004; Björklund et al. 2006; Holmlund et al. 2011; Amin et al.2015).Footnote 2 While this literature has enhanced our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of human capital, we still have limited knowledge about what it is that well-educated parents bring to their children.Footnote 3 In other words, what are the particular mechanisms that are involved in the intergenerational transmission of human capital? Do the estimates reflect, for instance, that mothers’ and fathers’ education improves the health of their children, who, in turn, go on to obtain more schooling? A growing literature points to the importance of early health capital for education and earnings (see Currie 2009 and Almond and Currie 2011). Or do the estimates reflect that more educated parents get smarter children or children with greater social skills? Studies by Heckman and others emphasise the importance of skill acquisition early in life for later life outcomes (Heckman et al. 2006). Other mechanisms may be at work as well, where education is transmitted through information or through having access to networks. While a small and mostly instrumental variable-based literature has provided some evidence on potential mechanisms, much remains to be learned (see e.g. Currie and Moretti 2003; McCrary and Royer 2011; Carneiro et al.2013; Piopiunik 2014; Lundborg et al. 2014b, and the literature review below.) In this paper, we add to the literature on the mechanisms behind the transmission of education across generations by exploiting rich administrative data from the Swedish military enlistment records, where cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, and health have been measured for almost the entire population of 18-year-old Swedish males. To these data, we have merged register-based information on parental education, including information on parents who are twins and parents who have adopted a child. Our analysis contributes to the existing literature in mainly two ways. Firstly, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of children’s skills and health. While there is growing evidence for the importance of skills and health during childhood and adolescence, we know less about their determinants. Moreover, besides schooling, there is little evidence on the effect of parental education on other important outcomes of their adolescent children. Secondly, we contribute to the literature on the intergenerational transmission of human capital by providing new evidence on some of the mechanisms. With our data, we are able to open the black box of possible mechanisms and examine the role of skills and health in the transmission of human capital. If parental schooling is found to affect their children’s skills and health, this may also provide some clues to how the intergenerational transmission of education arises. Moreover, this would suggest that poor health and poor skills during childhood and adolescence are important mechanisms for the intergenerational transmission of human capital and economic status. Since we are able to use both an adoption and a twin design, we are thus able to directly address the possible mechanisms reflected in the previous twins and adoption-based literature on the transmission of education across generations. Improving the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is important for many reasons.Footnote 4 As argued by Currie (2009), it is only by opening the black box of the family that we can understand why it is that better backgrounds promote success in life. But improved knowledge about the mechanisms could also be useful information for policy makers. For instance, policies that increase the level of education in society could be considered as more valuable if they also improve the education of people’s offspring through increasing the offspring’s skills and the health, rather than only through improving their study results in a narrower sense or through a pure informational advantage. The reason is that improved skills and health may have benefits that stretches way beyond increased educational attainment. For instance, improved skills have been linked to reduced crime and risky behaviour, in addition to higher education and earnings (Heckman et al. 2006; Lundborg et al. 2016). Our results favour the view that skills and health during childhood and adolescence are important mechanisms through which the intergenerational transmission of education arises. We show that parental education increases sons’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills, as well as their health. Moreover, across a number of outcomes, the estimates are rather similar using both the adoption and twin design, especially when we restrict the adoption data to children adopted within their first year of life. In addition, we obtain some pronounced gender differences, where the education of the father matters more for the formation of cognitive and non-cognitive skills, whereas the mother’s education matters more for the son’s health. Such patterns may reflect differences in the effectiveness of investments in children across genders and areas and/or role model effects. We believe that our estimates appear reasonable, given the results obtained in previous studies on the intergenerational transmission of human capital and on the schooling returns to skills. Taking the example of cognitive skills, we show that the effect of parental education on such child skills could explain half of the causal effect of parental schooling on children’s schooling obtained in previous studies. Given the positive effects that parental schooling has on non-cognitive skills and health outcomes, this suggests that a major part of the transmission of education across generations runs through improved capacities of children. This paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews some of the relevant literature on the intergenerational transmission of human capital. Section 3 describes the data used in this study. Section 4 describes and discusses the two empirical strategies used in this paper: the adoption design and the twin design. Section 5 presents the results and Section 6 summarises our findings and draws some conclusions.",15

It first came to prominence in popular culture after the great New York City blackout of 1965, which left over 30 million people without electricity for 13 h. However, the seminal work by Udry (1970) concluded that birthrates did not increase significantly 9 months after this event. Since then, the theory has been termed an “urban legend” by the president of the Population Association of America.Footnote 1 Unlike power outages in the developed world, blackouts are commonplace in developing countries. Many of them experience rolling blackouts that last weeks, if not months, and for several hours a day. However, the existing literature has almost exclusively focused on the costs to firms and investment from unreliable public infrastructure (see Fisher-Vanden et al. 2015; Reinikka and Svensson 2002). This paper is among the first to highlight both the short- and long-run effects of unreliable power infrastructure on household fertility and socioeconomic outcomes. We shed light on three interrelated issues. First, we provide evidence that, in the short run, power rationing does, in fact, create baby booms. Second, we answer the question: how persistent is this shock on fertility? We check the claim that after having an unplanned baby, women maintain the size of family they originally desired by having fewer children in the future (Ward and Butz 1980; Barmby and Cigno 1990). Third, we address the long-run effects of the fertility shock as measured by socio-economic outcomes like educational attainment (Ribar 1994, 1999; Geronimus and Korenman 1993; Ashcraft et al. 2013), participation in the labor market (Angrist and Evans 1998; Gangadharan et al. 1999), and child health (Burlando 2014b) 12 years after the shock. We exploit a unique natural experiment set in Colombia to address these questions. In 1992, the El Niño climate phenomena caused a drought, which led to such low water levels in rivers and reservoirs that power generation plummeted, resulting in daily electricity rationing over the period from March 1992 to March 1993.Footnote 2 This constitutes a natural experiment with quasi-random treatment appealing at two levels. First, the yearlong power rationing gives us sufficient statistical power to detect even minor effects. Second, the power rationing was heterogeneous across Colombia. We exploit this spatial variation in the intensity of power rationing to study how short- and long-term fertility rates varied accordingly. We do so by constructing a retrospective mother-level birth history using the micro sample of the 2005 population census of Colombia. This provides us with the number of birth events. We combine this with the municipality-level variation in the intensity of the power rationing. This measure of treatment intensity is constructed from nighttime lights satellite imagery. We use this dataset to study the impact of power rationing, both in the short run (the first year following the blackout period) and the long run (12 years after the end of the blackout). For the short-run analysis, we adopt a fixed effects model. By looking at the impact of the blackout on the fertility of individual mothers, we are able to address concerns of omitted time-invariant variables. We show that women, on average, experienced a 4% increase in the probability of giving birth in 1993, the year following the blackout. This implies that more babies were conceived during 1992, the year in which power was rationed. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the blackout led to an additional 1.9% of births—representing around 6,800 babies—in 1993. Next, we show that women do not respond to this short-term fertility boost by having fewer children later. Using the 2005 census cross section, we estimate the effect of the blackout on the number of children a woman has 12 years after the end of the blackout. We take advantage of the fact that women who gave birth during 1992 may have been exposed to the power rationing, but were biologically much less likely to conceive because they had just delivered a baby. For the estimation, we use a difference-in-difference approach. In the first difference, we compare women who gave birth in 1993 in blackout areas with women who gave birth in 1993 in non-blackout areas. For the second difference, we compare women who gave birth in 1992 in blackout areas with women who gave birth in 1992 in non-blackout areas. The difference between these differences corresponds to our estimate of the long-run effect of the blackout on fertility. We estimate that women who had a child in 1993 due to the blackout had, on average, 0.07 more children in 2005. This estimate implies that in 2005, there were approximately 14,100 more children as a consequence of the blackout. Therefore, the fertility shock had not yet been offset 12 years later. In addition, we find that, for women who had already given birth at least once prior to the power outage, the blackout reduced the time between births by 1 to 2 months. This further supports our interpretation that the power outage-induced fertility increase was unplanned. Finally, we document the long-run effects of the blackout on some socioeconomic characteristics of women (and to some extent their children) by applying the same difference-in-difference approach. Our research design allows us to rule out some potential confounders such as the impact of the blackout on job loss or other income shocks, since both women who gave birth in 1992 and 1993 may have been exposed to the power outage (and a possible income shock), but women who gave birth in 1992 could not physically conceive that same year. We show that the two sets of women are very similar on a set of predetermined exogenous socioeconomic characteristics. Further, we find patterns that are consistent with our interpretation that women who had an unplanned baby due to the outage find themselves in worse socioeconomic conditions. We think that the evidence presented provides some support for our overall interpretation that we capture genuine long-run effects as opposed to purely measuring selection into treatment of vulnerable populations. This paper contributes to several strands of literature. It relates closely to Burlando (2014a), as he studies the impact of a month-long power outage in Zanzibar on village-level fertility outcomes. He finds a 20% increase in village-level births 9 months after the blackout, but cannot provide any further evidence as to whether this temporary increase was dynamically offset. More generally, our paper contributes to a growing empirical literature on examining the impact of electricity infrastructure in developing countries (see Gerard and Costa 2015; Dinkelman 2011; Rud 2012). The paper also relates to understanding the fertility response to other aggregate shocks. Evans et al. (2008), Pörtner (2008) and Oliveira and Quintana-Domeque (2016) examine the effect of natural disasters and hurricanes in particular on fertility and birth outcomes. Aragón and Rud (2016) study the exposure to air pollution and infant mortality using micro-data stemming from one million birth events. Burlando (2014b) looks at mothers’ exposure to power outages during pregnancy and finds that this resulted in lower birth weights.Footnote 3Bozzoli and Quintana-Domeque (2014) study the impact of the economic crisis in Argentina on birth weights, while (Quintana-Domeque and Ródenas-Serrano 2014) explore the impact of in utero-exposure to stress caused by terrorism attacks in Spain on birth weight. Schindler and Brück (2011) examine the effect of conflict on the fertility choices of survivors, finding that loss of siblings only has a short-term effect on reproductive behavior. Our study also speaks to the literature on the influence of culture, media, and leisure on fertility (Ferrara et al. 2012; Jensen and Oster 2009; Kearney and Levine 2015). These studies have found a link between television programming and fertility behavior, including smaller family size. Finally, we make significant contributions on the methodological front by being the first to exploit nighttime light data to detect power outages from outer space and combine this data with individual-level birth records. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background and context for the 1992 blackout in Colombia. Section 3 describes the data and how we constructed our main dependent variables. Section 4 provides the empirical strategy, while Section 5 presents the key results. The conclusion follows in Section 6.",6

Achieving this goal involves narrowing the employment gender gap, which to different degrees is still substantial in all EU member states but especially high in Southern European countries. In fact, a recent OECD (2012) analysis of labor market gender gaps reports 2011 male versus female employment rates in the 15–64 age group of 65.9 versus 45.1% in Greece, 64.1 versus 52.8% in Spain, and 67.5 versus 46.5% in Italy. Although several explanations are proposed for the low labor force attachment of women in Southern European countries, the most cited are cultural influences like the “male breadwinner model” and institutional constraints (which, in turn, may also reflect cultural influences). Among the latter, the lack of publicly provided childcare is stressed as a major barrier to women’s reconciliation of family with career (Del Boca and Vuri 2007; Del Boca and Sauer 2009). In Italy, for instance, public expenditure on childcare accounts for a tiny 0.2% of GDP, which is half of the average OECD-30 expenditure (see Fig.x 1). Unfortunately, the need to cope with tight budgetary constraints after the Great Recession has prevented most Southern European countries from increasing the funds allocated to family policies and thus hampered any substantial progress in raising female employment. It is therefore likely that in a context of low or even shrinking public childcare provision, grandparents (and relatives in general) may serve as an important source of affordable childcare for working women. According to Hank and Buber (2009), for instance, about 32% of European grandmothers are engaged in regular childcare (i.e., almost weekly or more often) with percentages in countries such as Greece, Italy, and Spain almost twice as large as those in Scandinavia. In Italy, a survey run by the Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) in 2005 shows that grandparents remain the main source of childcare when the mother is working. Among 1–2-year-old children of working mothers, about half (52.3%) are looked after by grandparents, 13.5% are enrolled in public nurseries, 14.3% in private nurseries, and 9.2% looked after by nannies (ISTAT 2005). In this paper, we assess whether grandparents’ potential availability for childcare, proxied by their meeting pension eligibility requirements, has a positive effect on female, and especially maternal, labor force participation.Footnote 1 This question is relevant not only in light of the widespread structural underinvestment in public childcare in many European countries, but also the recent pension reforms introduced in many EU member states. These reforms, by setting stricter retirement eligibility requirements, may have unintended consequences on female employment. For example, we show that raising retirement age and years of contributions, by reducing the supply of low-cost, flexible, informal childcare provided by grandparents, can reduce the labor force participation of mothers. Hence, pension reforms that are not coupled with sufficient investment in public childcare may further exacerbate the already wide intergenerational and gender gaps in employment by reducing the employment of young women relative not only to older women but also to young men, who traditionally bear less of the childcare burden. Public expenditure on childcare and early education services, percent of GDP, 2011. Source: OECD Family Database (http://www.oecd.org/social/family/database.htm), chart PF3.1 The case of Italy is ideal for studying how changes in pension eligibility impact labor force participation because in recent years it has undergone several pension reforms that have gradually increased retirement requirements. For instance, whereas prior to 1992, the 20-year accumulated contribution rule allowed many public sector workers to retire in their 40s or early 50s, since then several pension reforms have gradually increased the number of years of contributions required for seniority-based retirement, and raised the minimum age required for age-based retirement to 65. These pension eligibility rules, which vary over time and according to such factors as gender and employment sector, provide an arguably exogenous variation (see also, Bottazzi et al. 2006; Battistin et al. 2009, 2015; Aparicio-Fenoll and Vidal-Fernandez 2015) used in this paper to identify the effect of grandparental childcare availability on maternal employment. Our estimates show that mothers of cohabiting children under 15 whose own mothers are eligible for retirement have a 7.1 percentage point higher probability of labor force participation (+ 11%) than those whose mothers are not yet eligible. We interpret this result to mean that grandparental availability for childcare facilitates the labor force participation of women with young children. This interpretation is confirmed by the absence of any such effect for men or for women with no cohabiting children under 15, but a large effect for women with very young children, who have the most intensive childcare needs, and for low-educated mothers or mothers in small municipalities, who have fewer childcare alternatives available in the market. Our baseline results are also robust to several sensitivity checks; in particular, accounting for potential sample selection issues into having a cohabiting child aged 0–14, considering employment instead of LFP, and including controls for additional pathways through which grandparental retirement eligibility may affect female LFP (e.g., income and wealth transfers). Our paper complements the evidence in Aparicio-Fenoll and Vidal-Fernandez (2015) by exploiting seniority-eligibility rules in addition to age-eligibility rules. This is a nonnegligible improvement because past research has shown that individuals tend to retire as soon as possible (Behaghel and Blau 2012; Gruber and Wise 2007), and reforms increasing age requirements may cause a “run to seniority pension” (Brugiavini and Peracchi 2012; Ardito 2017) increasing the relative incidence of seniority vis-à-vis old-age pensions. As a consequence, the age-eligibility rules exploited in previous papers are likely to be binding only for those grandparents who did not or could not use the seniority rules such as late labor market entrants (e.g., highly educated individuals), grandparents with very discontinuous working lives, or those who did not have to provide childcare (see Rupert and Zanella 2014). The potential endogeneity of individuals’ seniority-based eligibility is addressed (i) by controlling for a large set of determinants of grandparents’ retirement eligibility available in our data (age, gender, education, and employment sector and type), so that our preferred model is only identified by changes in the retirement rules mandated by pension reforms; and (ii) by not using grandparents’ actual years of pension contributions to compute seniority eligibility, but imputing years of contributions based on the average behavior of individuals with the same characteristics. Our results point to the importance of exploiting both sources of eligibility. Indeed, our estimated effects are substantially larger than the comparable (reduced form) estimates reported by Aparicio-Fenoll and Vidal-Fernandez (2015), especially on the sample of women with younger children (− 15 percentage point vs. − 3 percentage point). This difference leads to markedly different conclusions and policy implications on the importance of grandparent-provided childcare. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the most relevant empirical literature and highlights our main contributions. Section 3 gives a brief history of the Italian pension laws, whose nature assures exogenous variation in grandparental availability for childcare, and describes our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the data used in our empirical analysis, and Section 5 investigates the relation between pension eligibility and retirement status. Section 6 reports our primary analytical results while the outcomes of several robustness checks are described in an appendix, after which Section 7 reports some back-of-the-envelope calculations of the potential effect of pension laws on maternal aggregate employment. Section 8 summarizes the main findings and concludes the paper.",25

Frequently, the so-called Barker hypothesis has been a point of departure, according to which fetal growth restriction programs the individual to experience an increased likelihood of adult disease (e.g., Barker 1990; 1995). Since then, a large number of researchers have documented associations between lower birth weight and a range of health problems later in life. For a substantial amount of existing studies, it is, however, unclear whether associations reflect causality or whether the hypotheses tested reflect explicit physiological mechanisms between in utero and later-life health. Studies in economics have often used exogenous shocks or within-family comparisons to try to disentangle the causal effects of prenatal circumstances (see for example Almond and Currie 2011) on later-life health. Some studies (e.g., Almond et al. 2005; Almond 2006; Black et al. 2007) have documented effects on outcomes such infant mortality or adult self-reported disability, whereas other studies (e.g., Oreopoulos et al. 2008; Almond et al. 2009; Field et al. 2009; Royer 2009) find no or little evidence of effects on a range of outcomes, such as self-reported days of illness in childhood or adolescence, hypertension, or diabetes. In this study, we provide new evidence on the relationship between birth weight and health outcomes throughout childhood and into early adulthood. Using full-population Swedish register data on individuals born between 1973 and 1994, followed until 2011, our analysis exploits differences between siblings and twins, aiming to better allow for causal inference. Our analysis considers both inpatient visits and sickness absences, examining how the effect changes from birth until adulthood (individuals who are in their 30s). Furthermore, by exploiting data on specific diagnoses, we contribute to the literature not only by studying the total number of days in care but also by studying whether the individual was diagnosed with different types of diseases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies examining the effect of birth weight on days of sickness absence in adulthood. Due to its importance, both to the individual’s ability to successfully pursue a labor market career and to a country’s public finances (in particular for generous welfare states, like Sweden), this outcome represents an important complement to hospital stays.",4

The notable phenomenon of “missing women,” referring to unnaturally low female-to-male ratios in South Asia, is often argued as being associated with the practice of dowry (Sen 1990; Croll 2000; Anderson and Ray 2010; Chakraborty 2015). Advertisements for sex-selective abortion read “Better Rs. 500 now than Rs. 500,000 later” (in dowry). Especially in India, the media reports sensationalist stories on dowry, and academics claim it to be a cause of domestic violence and a type of homicide called “dowry murder” (Stone and James 1995; Rudd 2001; Bloch and Rao 2002; Sekhri and Storeygard 2014). On the basis of this belief that dowry is a harmful custom, an anti-dowry movement emerged at the end of the 1970s, led by female activists and NGOs. The stance on dowry issues has also become politically important.Footnote 2 Dowry has been labeled an anti-social practice and is currently banned or restricted by law.Footnote 3 Nevertheless, no legal, political, or social action seems effective in discouraging this practice; in fact, it seems to have intensified and extended in recent times. Although it is claimed that dowry is an abominable practice, especially in India, its real meanings and roles are not well known. Despite the massive number of case studies conducted on dowry, many seem little more than a set of anecdotes and narratives, often focusing on extremely negative cases such as dowry murder.Footnote 4 In contrast, a less prevailing view in South Asia holds that dowry, in fact, enhances women’s status in a context where women’s property rights and security are not sufficiently guaranteed in practice (Kishwar 1988, 1989; Narayan 1997; Leslie 1998; Oldenburg 2002). According to this perspective, most deaths recorded as dowry murder in India were actually unrelated to dowry. These differing views on dowry may be due to dowry being a heterogenous concept serving multiple functions, as suggested by recent studies (Chan 2014; Anderson and Bidner 2015; Arunachalam and Logan 2016). The chief reason for the dearth of rigorous evidence on dowry may be scarce or inadequate data needed to conduct empirical analysis. Dowry is an illegal social practice in India and Bangladesh; therefore, it is often reported that people are unwilling to reveal accurate dowry amounts. This may be one reason that aggregate marital expenses paid by a bride’s parents are often reported in a dataset without separating dowry and ceremony expenses (e.g., India Human Development Survey). Besides, dowry usually consists of jewelry, clothing, furniture, household items, livestock, cash, and so on; thus, assessing specific dowry value at the time of marriage becomes even more difficult (Jejeebhoy 2000). For the specific purpose of examining the roles played by dowry, especially how dowry is associated with women’s status in the marital household, we conducted a household survey in rural Punjab, Pakistan. We meticulously designed the survey questionnaire to obtain accurate information on every single item offered as part of dowry. The studies most closely related to ours are those by Zhang and Chan (1999), Brown (2009), and Chan (2014), showing that dowries have positive effects on several measures of women’s welfare. Zhang and Chan (1999) originally incorporate assets brought into marriage into the Nash model of household bargaining (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981; McElroy 1990; Lundberg and Pollak 1993). The key to understand the model is one’s (wife’s or husband’s) threat point, which is the function of anything that affects one’s bargaining position in the marital household. The threat can be divorce (Manser and Brown 1980; McElroy and Horney 1981),Footnote 5 or non-cooperative behavior within marriage (Lundberg and Pollak 1993). Expecting that assets brought into the marital family increase one’s threat point, the theoretical implication of the model is that dowries, or any asset brought into marriage, affect the intrahousehold resource allocation in one’s favor and have positive effects on one’s private consumption in the marital family. Because one’s private consumption is not necessarily reported in the datasets, these empirical studies use various measures of wife’s welfare or status as a proxy for wife’s private consumption.Footnote 6 Zhang and Chan (1999) and Brown (2009) use East Asian datasets reporting both dowry and bride price. In the South Asian context where patrilocality is the norm, however, it may be inappropriate to consider dowry assets brought into a marriage because it is not clear who is the recipient or who controls the dowry. Chan (2014) conducts the first study to decompose dowry into two components, i.e., a bequest dowry over which the wife has control and a groom price over which she does not and shows that only a bequest dowry enhances women’s status in the marital household. We employ an approach similar to Chan’s by analyzing different components of dowry but are unique in our method of decomposition. We do not decompose dowry by the wife’s subjective assessment regarding who controls each component as in Chan; rather, we decompose it by relatively objective measures, i.e., items composing the dowry. Some dowry components, such as furniture and kitchenware, are more easily considered assets brought into marriage compared with cash and gold/jewelry, which can be easily converted into cash and may be taken by the husband or his parents, even if not intended to be part of the groom price. We contribute to the empirical literature on dowry by introducing a unique dataset that allows us to analyze (1) various itemized components of dowry and other marriage expenses and (2) how each is related to women’s status in the marital household. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study separating each itemized component of dowry from the aggregate total, an approach that offers a more direct test of the Nash bargaining model. The current study provides new evidence on dowry’s roles in the Pakistani context. With empirical studies being scarce as a whole, to our knowledge, only one empirical study concerning dowry payments in Pakistan has been conducted to date (Anderson 2000, 2004). Dowry’s effect on women’s welfare is an empirical question because its meanings and roles can be diverse across time and space, depending on the context. Jejeebhoy’s (2000) study shows that a larger dowry size positively affects women’s decision-making power in the northern part of India but not in the southern part. Dowry’s heterogenous effects may also be related to women’s property rights, which are relatively more protected in southern India compared with northern India (Makino 2017). Dowry may exemplify seemingly gender-discriminatory practices that function as an informal mechanism that, in fact, serves to protect women’s rights under a weak legal system.Footnote 7 If dowry compensates for institutional failures to protect women’s property rights, dowry’s effect on women’s welfare in rural Pakistan, where property rights are legally guaranteed but are not enforced, may be positive. Potential endogeneity problems arise when conducting an empirical study on dowry. In particular, unobserved characteristics of the bride’s parents may affect not only how the bride is treated in the marital household but also the dowry amount. The type of endogeneity we most suspect here is that richer families may pay larger dowries, and brides from richer families may be better treated in the marital household. On the other hand, we are less worried about the specific type of reverse causality such as more progressive parents increasing the dowry amount in the expectation that it will lead to better treatment of their daughter in the marital household. In this case, the ultimate factor enhancing the bride’s status may be her parents’ progressiveness, but the fact remains that even such parents believe that a higher dowry will lead to better treatment of their daughter. Because any instrumental variables for dowries, including those used by Zhang and Chan (1999), Brown (2009), and Chan (2014), face difficulty in convincingly satisfying the exclusion restriction on their own, in the current study, we do not impose an implausible exclusion restriction. Instead, three methods are used to address the specific endogeneity concern that women from richer families may be better treated in the marital household irrespective of the dowry amount. The first method is to include a rich set of observed characteristics concerning the marriage. In particular, we include the bride’s natal family’s income at the time of marriage and the bride price paid by the groom’s parents. The former directly controls the richness of the bride’s parents, and the latter indirectly does because it directly reflects the value of the bride’s and her parents. We compare this with univariate regressions and follow Altonji et al. (2005) to demonstrate how much larger the effects of unobservables would have to be in order to completely eliminate the effects of dowry on women’s status.Footnote 8 The second method is to include disaggregated marriage expenses explained above, which enables us to extract item-specific association with women’s status controlling for the value of other items that can be offered by the households with similar wealth. The third method is to conduct a series of reduced-form regressions of women’s status on three different sets of dowry and bride price paid to others, namely, average amount of dowry (bride price) paid by the wife’s brothers’ (sisters’) in-laws, the village-level average amount of dowry (bride price) excluding her own, and the community-based dowry (bride price). From a broader perspective, this study is related to literature on the relation between empowerment and economic development (World Bank 2011; Duflo 2012). In general, a positive association between women’s empowerment and economic development can be observed. In South Asian countries, however, economic development is not necessarily accompanied by women’s equal treatment. For example, the skewed male–female ratio seems to have become rather exacerbated in recent years (Croll 2000). Dowry practice, often a symbol of women’s disempowerment, is disappearing with the spread of modernization (Anderson 2003). The only exception is South Asia where the practice not only continues but is actually expanding. In a context where women’s legal protection is underdeveloped, interpreting dowry as a symbol of women’s disempowerment may be misleading. Rather, in such a context, dowry may empower women by enhancing their decision-making power in the marital household. Our empirical analysis reveals that in rural Punjab, Pakistan, higher dowry amounts, especially when given in forms other than cash/gold/jewelry, are associated with a woman enjoying an increased status in the marital household. The positive association adds suggestive evidence that the nature of dowry in rural Punjab, Pakistan is a trousseau, and is consistent with the view that the bride’s parents voluntarily offer a higher dowry to their daughter, expecting that she will be better treated in the marital household. Our findings provide for a new perspective on the policy debate concerning the custom of dowry in Pakistan, where dowry is not yet legally banned but is a controversial policy topic because of its alleged negative consequences. In a society where women do not inherit parental land in practice, a dowry might be the only asset that women can take into marriage and serves as their only source of protection after marriage. The remainder of this study is constructed as follows. Section 2 overviews related research and existing data. Section 3 describes our unique household survey and the dataset. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",19

Ayhan,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economists have been devoting increasing attention to the broad well-being consequences of unemployment.Footnote 1 A substantial body of literature has documented that joblessness causes large life satisfaction declines and permanently scars those directly affected (Winkelmann 2014; Clark et al. 2001). While most of the scholarship has focused on the subjective well-being consequences of one’s own unemployment, it is reasonable to expect that unemployment may affect the well-being of other family members through the negative externatilities due to sharing the same household, having a common income, and being exposed to similar stressors (Luhmann et al. 2014). Similarly, one spouse’s job loss could affect the well-being of the other spouse due to increased financial strain and worries about the future income, or due to non-monetary considerations, including the change in the amount of time spent together, social stigmatization, emotional contagion, and the spillover of negative emotions such as stress or worry (Luhmann et al. 2014). Nevertheless, with a few exceptions, the literature on unemployment and well-being has surprisingly ignored explorations of the within-couple subjective well-being externalities. This paper fills this void by investigating how one spouse’s exogenous unemployment induced by company closings causally affects the subjective well-being of the other partner (i.e., the indirectly affected spouse).Footnote 2 Using household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) for 1991–2015, which allow us to employ couple fixed effects, we find that spousal job loss due to workplace closure has a negative effect on the indirectly affected spouse’s life satisfaction.Footnote 3 By accounting for about one quarter to one third of the effect of one’s own unemployment on subjective well-being, the magnitude of the cross-spouse externality that we document is economically important. In particular, following his wife’s unemployment, a husband’s life satisfaction decreases by about 0.34 points (on a 0–10 scale). The decline is slightly smaller (0.25 points) for the average woman whose husband loses his job, although the gender difference is statistically insignificant. Furthermore, we also discover that the life evaluations reduction is also mirrored in the declining satisfaction with household income and living standards. In addition, we investigate the subjective well-being trajectories of partners before and after involuntary spousal unemployment. We show that wives do not adapt to their husbands’ unemployment, while the pattern for indirectly affected husbands is less clear-cut. Our results are robust to several sensitivity tests, such as controlling for job loss expectations, panel attrition, partnership dissolution, state-specific shocks, and local-level unemployment rates. We also test for possible channels behind our results and conclude that the negative effect of spousal unemployment is independent of current and future income, the unemployment duration, as well as the couple’s position in the income distribution. Taken together with the declining satisfaction with income and living standards, these results suggest that in a country with a liberal unemployment benefits system such as Germany, the stigma attached to living on public welfare rather than the financial concerns may account for the well-being losses that we document (Chadi and Hetschko 2017). This paper focuses on the cognitive component of subjective well-being, namely life satisfaction.Footnote 4 It thus differs from the related scholarship on the mental health consequences of spousal unemployment (e.g., Bubonya et al. 2017; Marcus 2013; Mendolia 2014; Siegel et al. 2003). At first sight, it may seem that mental health and subjective well-being are synonymous. Nonetheless, despite being conceptually related, mental health refers to the absence of depression and chronic anxiety, while life satisfaction is a global reflective assessment of one’s life as a whole (Diener et al. 1999; Flèche and Layard 2017). While both mental health and life satisfaction are subjective states, mental illness is typically diagnosed by a medical professional. Finally, the correlation coefficient between mental health and misery (low subjective well-being) is as low as 0.1 (and as high as 0.4), implying that these are two different constructs (Flèche and Layard 2017).Footnote 5 Building on the extant studies, our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we provide a causal estimate of the effects of spousal unemployment on the other partner’s life evaluations using representative household German panel data. Second, in addition to studying unemployment's externalities in terms of spousal life satisfaction, we are also the first to consider the consequences of unemployment for the indirectly affected partner’s satisfaction with five different life domains: leisure, housework, household income, standard of living, and health. Third, we document novel results concerning the anticipation of and adaptation to spousal job loss due to plant closing and we compare and contrast these patterns with the anticipation of and adaptation to one’s own unemployment due to company closure in our sample. Finally, we carefully consider the robustness of our findings and whether income considerations could be driving our results. We argue that a causal understanding of the size of the spillover effects of unemployment has important consequences for the design of social policy. Our findings highlight the relevance of unemployment’s within-couple externalities and expand the state-of-the-art knowledge of such interdependencies. As such, the results imply that effective public policy programs aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of unemployment should adopt a family perspective.",27

Rapid economic growth combined with urban-prioritised and pro-coastal policies caused a great demand for cheap labour. Meanwhile, the increasing efficiency level of agriculture production due to the practice of the Household Responsibility System launched in the early 1980s has led to a large labour surplus in rural China.Footnote 1 As a result, the migrant population has increased more than threefold from 70 million in 1993 to 274 million in 2014, and the number keeps rising (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2014). As a result of primarily younger individuals (aged between 18 and 29 years) leaving their homes in search of better employment opportunities elsewhere as well as an increasing life expectancy and rapidly declining fertility rates,Footnote 2 China and in particular its rural areas is facing a dramatic ageing problem. Jackson and Howe (2004) predict that the elderly population above 60 years of age will reach 28% of the total Chinese population in 2040, more than twice the amount of 2012. This demographic transition is causing considerable pressure on the family. In China, old age support is traditionally the role of adult children (Chyi and Mao 2012). More precisely, according to Confucian filial piety, it is the role of the eldest son and his family to care for parents in old age. In addition, the current pension system is under-developed such that elderly parents rely heavily on their families as main source of financial support in old age. With the drastically increasing migration flows over the past decades, this informal safety net is however dramatically weakening leaving elderly parents more and more often in precarious situations. Employment and income of migrating children in the host communities are far from being secure. Migrants often work in informal or precarious employment and have risky incomes excluding them from social security payments (Knight and Yueh 2004; Giles et al. 2010; Biao 2007). As a consequence, financial support from a migrant child may be unreliable putting the elderly at a greater risk of falling into poverty (Giles et al. 2010). This may significantly exacerbate an elderly parent’s vulnerability leading to significant distress and emotional ill-health. Meanwhile, it is inherently more difficult for migrant adult children to provide emotional and physical support to their parents while working elsewhere, which may further severely impair parental emotional wellbeing. In this paper, we assess how migration of an adult child affects the emotional health of elderly parents. For this purpose, we use data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) for 2011 and 2013 which is particularly well suited for this study as it contains detailed information of both elderly parents and all of their children. Due to the increasing longevity and ageing populations across developed and middle-income countries, a growing body of literature has emerged examining various aspects of the impact of migration on families left-behind. Health-related outcomes have received considerable attention. The basic idea is that in these countries remittances of migrants to their families left-behind may allow the elderly to have access to better medical care which may positively affect their health (Vanwey 2004; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2011; Ao et al. 2016). Yet, much in contrast to these countries, remittances in China have not contributed to a substantial development of rural areas and have had only limited impact on the welfare of the left-behind (Biao 2007) for much of the income of migrants remains in urban areas. Consequently, only limited positive health effects, if any, can be expected of remittances from migrant children. Moreover, Li and Démurger (2013) argue that migration reduces the number of labourers on family farms. As a consequence, elderly parents often have to continue to work on their farms to replace the missing child (Pang and de Brauw 2004) which might significantly harm the elderly’s physical health. Migration does not only reduce the number of labourers, it also inherently reduces the number of caregivers and hence the quality of care received by the elderly. As a consequence, health conditions are likely to be exacerbated (Davin 1999; Croll 1997). A priori, health effects resulting from migration are unclear and remain an empirical question. Considerably lower health outcomes among the elderly resulting from migration of an adult child are found for Mexico (Antman 2010, 2016) and China (Huang et al. 2015; Ao et al. 2016). In contrast, Kuhn et al. (2011) find for Indonesia that migration of an adult child does not worsen an elderly parent’s health. On the contrary, it seems to have improved it. Similar positive health outcomes are found for Bangladesh (Kuhn 2004), Moldova (Böhme et al. 2015) and Tonga (Gibson et al. 2011). It is arguable whether over a short period of time adverse effects on physical health are indeed the result of migration of an adult child because any changes in physical health may take time to take effect. Even with careful identification strategies, it is more plausible that migration of a child first affects an elderly parent’s emotional health rather than causing an immediate deterioration of physical health. Evidence in the medical literature shows that mentally healthier people are more inclined to live in a healthy way (Veenhoven 2008) and also people with positive mental states are found to have better immune responses (Cohen et al. 1995) and are hence healthier on average. A growing body of literature has devoted attention to assessing the effects of migration on parental emotional health. Reduced co-residency in extended households may result in loneliness and feelings of powerlessness (Yao 2011; Zhang and Li 2004; Zhang et al. 2005) but it is also found to reduce happiness among the elderly (Chyi and Mao 2012). Migration may also improve the elderly’s psychological wellbeing as it tends to indicate better innate ability of a migrant child, which parents can be proud of (Zhuo and Liang 2006). Moreover, migration inherently reduces the possibility of quarrels between family members which could mitigate some of the adverse effects on emotional health (Zuo and Li 2011). Antman (2016) investigates emotional health outcomes as one of many health outcomes resulting from migration in Mexico. She finds that migration leads to worsened levels of emotional wellbeing. For Ireland, Mosca and Barrett (2016) find that it is particularly mothers whose emotional health deteriorates if a child migrates. Our main challenge is to address the endogeneity of migration. To do so, we adopt two different estimation strategies. First, an important source of endogeneity is the possible selection of migrants and their families in terms of physical and emotional health. In this context, the so-called healthy migrant effect states that migrants tend to be healthier compared to randomly selected non-migrants (Jasso et al. 2004; Giles and Mu 2007; Rubalcava et al. 2008; Riosmena et al. 2012; Farré 2015). As emotional wellbeing is an important determinant of a person’s physical health (Clark and Oswald 2002; Easterlin 2004; Galper et al. 2006), we expect migrants to also be positively selected in this regard. Moreover, if healthier parents have healthier children, we believe that parents of migrant children are emotionally healthier on average. Not accounting for this selectivity may understate the negative effects of migration on parental emotional health. To eliminate such time-invariant sources of individual heterogeneity, we exploit the panel structure of the CHARLS data. More specifically, we use a fixed effects approach to allow for individual differences over time to identify how changes in the migration decision of an adult child affect changes in emotional health of the elderly parent. To strengthen the identification strategy, we additionally adopt an instrumental variable approach. This is helpful to account for reverse causality which occurs if children take their migration decision in response to their parents’ overall emotional health status. Giles and Mu (2007) find that poor parental health in China significantly reduces the migration probability of adult children. For this approach, we exploit variations in community characteristics that might influence the child’s migration decision but are not related directly to parental emotional health. As instruments, we use (i) the percentage of a community’s migrant population relative to its total population and (ii) a community’s per capita total revenues in 2010. We make use of the fact that a child is more likely to seek employment opportunities elsewhere if the share of migrants within a community is higher which lowers migration costs (Rozelle et al. 1999; Mckenzie and Rapoport 2007; Fan 2008) or if the home community’s economic condition is relatively worse. Our main identification strategy regarding parental emotional wellbeing relies on short-run changes in the migration status of an adult child. The reduced support network resulting from the absence of an adult child may cause severe feelings of unhappiness and loneliness and may eventually lead to more pronounced depressive symptoms. Such deteriorated emotional health outcomes may further impair the elderly’s physical health and might hence be crucial risk factors to the overall health status. Our findings suggest that parents with migrant children have significantly worse emotional health outcomes and have severely increased probabilities to suffer from clinical depression. Return migration can mitigate to some extent the adverse effects on mental wellbeing. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we will provide a brief overview of the institutional background in China. In Section 3, we will briefly introduce the data and present descriptive statistics. Section 4 will detail the empirical strategy. Our main results are presented in Section 5. In the subsequent section, we examine different definitions of the migration status. For example, we divide the sample of migrants into returning and newly migrating children to examine the resulting differential effects. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.",23

32.0,3.0,Journal of Population Economics,21 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-018-0710-3,Immigration and the reallocation of work health risks,July 2019,Osea Giuntella,Fabrizio Mazzonna,Carlos Vargas-Silva,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"There is a large literature exploring the impacts of immigration on different factors such as labour markets, public finances, delivery of public services, housing market and criminality, among others (Dustmann et al. 2013; Dustmann et al. 2010; Dustmann and Frattini 2014; Sá 2015; Bell et al. 2013; Giuntella et al. 2018). However, there is less evidence about the impact of immigration on health care costs. This is an important gap in the evidence as immigrants are often blamed for high levels of health care expenditure in host countries, particularly in countries that have publicly funded health care systems (Giuntella et al. 2018). The existing evidence has mainly focused on exploring the health trajectories of immigrants and suggests that immigrants are often healthier upon arrival in the host country but that their health outcomes converge to those of natives over time (Kennedy et al. 2015). However, just a few studies have explored the impact of immigration on the health outcomes of natives (Giuntella and Mazzonna 2015), a major factor in the determination of the overall impact of immigration on health care expenditure. The classical model of labor demand and supply suggests that immigration has a negative effect on the wages and employment of the residents of the host country (Borjas 2014). However, most studies have found little empirical support for this effect. Previous research suggests that this lack of evidence could be explained by differences in comparative advantage between immigrant and native workers. Immigrants have a comparative advantage in manual-intensive jobs, while native workers have an advantage in communication-intensive jobs due to better language skills. An expansion in the supply of immigrants increases the relative returns to communication-intensive jobs pushing native workers towards those jobs (Peri 2012, 2016; D’Amuri and Peri 2014; Ottaviano et al. 2013; Peri and Sparber 2009). This paper contributes to this literature by exploring if these labor market adjustments lead to a reallocation of natives’ occupational physical burden (e.g. lifting and carrying heavy loads) and occupational health risks (i.e. injury risk) to immigrants. While previous studies analysed the effects of immigration on task-complexity, in this study, we separately identify the effect of immigration on the likelihood to engage in risky jobs. We also document that while tax complexity is highly correlated with job physical intensity and occupational risk, there is no perfect correspondence. Furthermore, previous studies focused primarily on the effects of low-skilled immigration on low-skilled workers. However, as shown by Dustmann et al. (2013), immigrants, and in particular recent immigrants, in the UK are well educated but downgrade substantially upon arrival, accepting jobs far below the ones accepted by natives with a comparable educational background. To account for the peculiarity of the UK context, we test the heterogeneous effects of immigration on work-related health risks along the skill distribution. In order to provide this evidence, we use 2003–2013 data for England and Wales for the analysis. The consequences of immigration are at the centre of the political discussion in the UK and analysis suggests that immigration was one of the key drivers of the British vote to leave the European Union (EU) (Vargas-Silva 2016). According to the 2011 Census, there were 7.5 million foreign-born persons living in England and Wales, corresponding to 13.4% of the population. Close to 40% of these immigrants arrived from 2004 onwards and, many of them are citizens of the new EU member states who found jobs in the low-wage sector (Drinkwater et al. 2009). There is widespread geographic dispersion on the level and change in immigration (Fig. 1). In fact, in 2011, immigrants represented over 10% of the population in a quarter of local authorities in England and Wales.
 Share of foreign-born individuals across English and Welsh local authorities, UK Census 2011 The increase in immigration to the UK over the last decade has been accompanied by a decrease in UK-born workers’ average physical burden and injury rates (Fig. 2) and share of high-physically demanding jobs held by UK-born workers (Fig. 3). This paper explores the connection between these trends.
 Trends in immigration, physical burden and injury rate among UK-born men, aged 20–59). Data are drawn from the Labour Force Survey (2003–2013) Trends in immigration and the share of physically intensive jobs held by UK-born workers (men, 20–59). Data are drawn from the Labour Force Survey (2003–2013). The solid line illustrates the trend in the share of physically demanding jobs held by UK-born individuals We exploit spatial and temporal variation in the share of immigrants residing across local authorities. To address the concern that immigration may be endogenous to labor market demand and correlated with unobserved determinants of working conditions and work health risks, we used an instrumental variable approach exploiting the correlation between immigrant inflows and historical concentration of immigrants across local authorities in England and Wales (Bell et al. 2013; Sá 2015). Furthermore, using retrospective information on worker’s occupational characteristics, we analyse the effects of immigration on occupational changes at the individual level. Examining individual labor market transitions allows controlling for individual time-invariant characteristics. This exercise strengthens the causal interpretation of our results mitigating the concern that our identification strategy may be confounded by spillover effects and internal mobility (Borjas et al. 1996; Borjas 2003). Our results suggest that immigration pushes UK-born workers towards jobs characterised by lower physical burden and injury risk. The effects are particularly large for UK-born males with medium levels of education holding physically demanding jobs. These workers have lower search and training costs for new jobs and can take advantage of the increased demand for communication-intensive jobs induced by the inflow of immigrants. Consistent with these findings, immigration also reduces the average occupational risk for natives with medium levels of education. We also find that that immigration reduced natives’ likelihood to report work-related disability and any health problem. The reallocation of tasks, together with the evidence that immigrants report lower injury rates than natives, suggests that immigration reduces health care, productivity and financial costs associated with work-related injuries in the UK.Footnote 1 This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical intuition behind the analysis. Section 3 provides a discussion of the data, the empirical specification and the identification strategy. Section 4 presents the main results of the paper. Section 5 presents the robustness checks. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.",20

The objective is to test the relevance of both conventional and more unconventional explanations for parents’ bequest decisions. We do this by studying the determinants of differences in inherited amounts among siblings. We use a population-wide dataset from Sweden covering data on bequests and inheritances for complete families (deceased parents and all their children) during the 2002–2004 period, matched with an extensive set of individual economic and demographic variables from other administrative registers. By exploiting the within-family variation in the data, we estimate the influence of child characteristics on inherited amounts using models with family-fixed effects that effectively account for unobserved heterogeneity in preferences across families. The questions we analyze include: Do children who are worse off financially than their siblings receive larger bequests? This is the hypothesis of the altruism model of bequests, which assumes that parents use bequests to equalize consumption possibilities within the family (Barro 1974; Becker 1974). In macroeconomics, for example, the Ricardian equivalence predictions about fiscal policy inefficiency are based on the assumption of dynastic altruistic behavior. Do children who have provided more services to the parent inherit larger amounts than their siblings do? This is the hypothesis of the exchange model of bequests (Bernheim et al. 1985; Cox 1987). To the extent that services refer to informal care of the parent, unequal sharing on the basis of quid pro quo will work as a private insurance, compensating for the income losses from caregiving. Do children who continue the family bloodline receive more than their siblings who do not? To the extent that this form of evolutionary motive (Cox 2003; Hamilton et al. 2007) is important, it would manifest itself in larger bequests to genetic children than to non-biological children. Moreover, children who produce offspring (grandchildren of the deceased) should receive more than the siblings who do not produce offspring, and especially daughters since their offspring are more certain to be genetic descendants. The above explanations are all based on the idea that parents (with more than one child) make unequal bequests. But, as the vast majority of parents divide, or intend to divide, their estates equally between their children, these explanations are commonly rejected in the literature (Arrondel and Masson 2006). It should be noted already at this point that equal sharing is the default rule in the Swedish inheritance law. This is similar to the inheritance laws in most other European countries as well as in the USA (Angelini 2007; Pestieau 2003). It is apparent that equal sharing also is the common practice. In our data, 86% of the parents who pass away with a positive estate, more than one child and a will (which is needed to divide unequally) divide their estates equally among their children, even though they had the option to choose a different distribution.Footnote 1 It is important to learn about the degree at which bequests are typically divided unequally for an analysis of the evolution of wealth distribution.Footnote 2 But this is only a first step. It is, on a more general level, crucial to understand what determines the allocation decision in order to assess the normative implications of wealth inequality and consider potential policy interventions (Cremer and Pestieau 2006). We begin our analysis by studying the factors influencing the parent’s decision to divide the bequest unequally. Our results show that the propensity to divide unequally does not appear to be random but rather that it is associated with within-family differences in child attributes and behaviors, as predicted by the transfers theories. We find, for instance, that a higher dispersion in economic resources (income and wealth) among the children increases the likelihood of unequal sharing, as predicted by the altruism model. Moreover, parents are more likely to divide unequally if they have a mix of children living and not living close to them, which could be seen as support for the exchange model. And, our finding that parents with a mix of biological and adopted children increases it the likelihood of unequal sharing is consistent with the evolutionary model. One issue with the above findings is that they only provide indirect support for the transfer theories. For example, the finding that a greater income dispersion among the children is positively associated with unequal division is only consistent with the altruism model if the less well-off children receive a larger inheritance than their more affluent siblings. Similarly, the finding that a mix of biological and adopted children increases the likelihood of unequal sharing is only consistent with the evolutionary model if the biological children (who can carry on the family genes) receive disproportionally more. To provide more direct tests of the transfer theories, we exploit the uniqueness of our data, that is the information on inherited amounts for complete families, and estimate how differences in inherited amounts across siblings are related to differences in their characteristics and behaviors. As far as we know, we are the first to use population-wide administrative data covering precise information on realized inherited amounts for complete families to apply this empirical strategy to test several bequest theories. The identifying variation in these estimations comes from families with unequally divided bequests. This is unlike most previous studies that use the incidence of transfers as outcome, and thereby rely solely on variation induced by the small and particular subset of families in which the parent has disinherited at least one child (e.g., Dunn and Phillips 1997; McGarry 1999). The results from our analysis are the following: We find no evidence that the inherited amount is correlated with the child’s permanent income. This finding is inconsistent with the altruism model of bequest.Footnote 3 To our knowledge, only Wilhelm (1996) provides tests of the compensatory nature of bequests using a similar approach. Based on estate tax return data on wealthy parents in the USA, he, similarly to us, finds no evidence of compensatory division of bequests within families. We also take Wilhelm’s work further and test for whether bequests are compensatory with respect to wealth and education but the relationships with the inherited amount are also in these cases statistically insignificant. Another improvement in relation to Wilhelm is that we show that these findings remain also when controlling for an extensive set of other children characteristics and behaviors that parents may use as a basis for discrimination. We find that children who are more likely to have provided services and attention to the parent (e.g., because they lived close to the parent) benefit disproportionately from bequests. This is consistent with the predictions of the exchange model. There are no previous studies using our approach to test the predictions of the exchange model with respect to bequests.Footnote 4 In their seminal paper, Bernheim et al. (1985) find that parents’ bequeathable wealth has a significant positive effect on attention (measured as number of visits, or phone calls) supplied by the children. Light and McGarry (2004) report that among mothers who plan to leave unequal bequests, one fourth intends to exchange bequests for services provided by the children. Finally, Brown (2006) finds that children who provide informal care to the parent, as compared to those who do not, are more likely to be included in the set of potential bequest recipients. In order to investigate the relevance of the evolutionary model, we test for differences in inherited amounts between biological and adopted children within the same families. This strategy, as opposed to comparing transfers to biological children and non-adopted, non-biological children (e.g., stepchildren or foster children), is advantageous as it minimizes the influence of unobservable confounding factors, such as preferences, upbringing, etc.Footnote 5 It also limits the possibility that smaller transfers to non-biological children are the result of the parent expecting the child’s biological parents to provide for him or her. Our results show that, among families with both biological and adopted children, adopted children receive less than half of what the siblings who are the parent’s biological children do. A closer look at the relationship, however, indicates that it is largely driven by disfavored adopted stepchildren of the deceased. Adopted children with two adoptive parents, on the other hand, do not receive less than siblings who are the biological children of the deceased. The finding that stepparents invest less in their (step) children than biological parents do is the reason for why we use the term Cinderella effect.Footnote 6 The crucial factor leading to a lower bequest for an adopted child, in other words, is whether the previously deceased parent was the child’s biological parent. Our finding agrees with previous studies that report that mothers with both biological and non-biological children (adopted or step) are more likely to plan unequal bequests (Light and McGarry 2004), and that stepchildren are less likely to be included in the stepparent’s will before the death (Francesconi et al. 2015). Moreover, we find that daughters with children of their own receive more than sons with children. This is also in line with the prediction of the evolutionary model that larger investments should be directed to offspring who are certain to be genetically related. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the hypotheses and some empirical issues. Section 3 presents the data and the construction of the analysis sample. In Section 4, we report the results from an analysis of the determinants of unequal division as well as from the main analysis; that is, the determinants of differences in inherited amounts among siblings. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude. Two appendices provide additional descriptive statistics and estimation results.",8

This is done by measuring the wealth gap between native and immigrant households across the wealth distribution. This is an important topic because wealth is a long-run indicator of well-being and gives insight into the economic integration of the foreign born. In addition, wealth is fundamental to income security for a non-negligible number of older (50+ years) immigrants who are approaching retirement. The most recent wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE Wave 6) shows that, in 2015, almost 10% of older interviewees were first-generation migrants. Given the surge of reforms aimed at reducing the generosity of social security systems all around Europe, it is vital to know whether such a large group is potentially at risk of poverty in retirement. Finally, appropriate policies depend on whether the wealth gap—if any—is driven by differences in observable characteristics. Despite its relevance, this is a largely understudied question. While the literature has mainly pointed to the reasons why one should expect a positive wealth gap in favor of natives (e.g., earnings gaps, credit constraints, lack of destination country-specific information, institutional barriers, differences in social norms, limited access to social welfare programs), there are reasons to believe that some factors could dampen the gap and even lead to higher wealth for certain migrant households compared with natives. Freedom of movement, easier bureaucracy, and limited cultural or ethnic differences within Europe could, for example, foster allocative efficiency through better skill matching. Those who stay longer in the destination country may be a selected group of particularly well-integrated individuals, and those who migrated earlier may have had more time to integrate and adapt to the new country. However, a gap in favor of migrants may not be apparent if one looks only at the average or median gap, as has been the case in most previous studies. At the same time, the average gap could hide a much larger gap for certain migrant households. In general, the distribution of the gap along the wealth distribution is much more informative than a single statistic. Another common limitation of previous literature is that it did not restrict wealth comparisons to households with comparable characteristics. Besides, in most cases, the decomposition methods used are based on linear relationships when, in fact, the wealth function is unknown and most likely highly non-linear. A noticeable exception is Barsky et al. (2002), who recognized the limits of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition and measured the portion of black–white wealth gap in the US explained by earnings using a non-parametric method, which did not require extrapolation outside the range of observed explanatory variables. This study adds to the literature in several respects. Following Frölich (2007) and Ñopo (2008), a matching strategy is used to estimate the gap between native and migrant households (as well as mixed households) in Europe during the years 2006 to 2015 and to partition the gap into its explained (by observables) and unexplained parts. Second, the data at hand allow for the calculation of pension wealth in addition to real and financial wealth. Pension wealth is generally disregarded due to data limitations.Footnote 1 This represents a serious omission given that this study shows that pension wealth accounts for around half of the total wealth of older Europeans. Third, the decomposition method adopted does not require the specification of a functional form for wealth, thus avoiding misspecification errors. Fourth, this study goes beyond the average gap by estimating the distribution of the unexplained gap. The average gap may in fact be misleading, given that the wealth distribution is typically highly skewed. More importantly, the average would hide the presence of heterogeneity of the gap across the wealth distribution. Finally, the approach adopted restricts the comparison to individuals with comparable characteristics in both groups. Linear models, on the contrary, implicitly assume validity-out-of-the-support, because they do not take into account the differences in the support of the empirical distributions of individual characteristics. Besides the methodological differences, this study separately analyzes households where both spouses are immigrants and households where only one of the spouses is an immigrant. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of migration toward and within Europe, different groups of migrant households are separately analyzed, depending on their origin, age at migration, and citizenship status. It is important to underline, however, that this study does not try to answer whether immigrants are better off due to migration than stayers in the home country. This is an equally important question, which is left to future research. This study finds that the average wealth gap delivers a very partial picture of the gap between natives and migrants. Even though the average gap is positive and significant, it hides a very interesting distribution, where immigrant households in the upper part of the wealth distribution are better off, and those in the lower part of the distribution are worse off, than comparable natives. Furthermore, the gap after matching is larger than the unconditional gap over most of the distribution. In the case of mixed households, even the average gap found after matching is larger than the unconditional gap. Moreover, a heterogeneity analysis reveals that origin, age at migration, and citizenship are important determinants of the wealth gap. Households who migrated from within Europe have a lower relative gap than those who migrated from outside Europe. The same is even more true for those who migrated at young ages than for those who migrated as adults, as well as for those who hold the citizenship of the destination country. The structure of the study is as follows: Section 2 discusses the theoretical background and summarizes previous literature on the measurement of the nativity wealth gap. Section 3 presents the data and some preliminary descriptive statistics. Section 4 discusses the drawbacks of previous methods used to measure outcome differences between two groups and introduces the propensity score matching method and its advantages over the Blinder-Oaxaca method. Section 5 presents the results and proposes a detailed decomposition analysis. Section 6 analyses the heterogeneity of the gap for different groups of migrants and Section 7 concludes.",6

Chu,Zonglai Kou,Xilin Wang,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The differential timing of countries experiencing a transition from stagnation to growth has governed patterns of comparative economic development across the world and contributed significantly to the divergence in income across the world over the past two centuries.Footnote 1 Given the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR) to the pace of technological progress and therefore to the transition from stagnation to growth, this study explores the role that the patent system may have played in the pace of this transition and on economic growth in the long run. The UK experienced this transition during the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century. Figure 1 plots real GDP per capita in the UK.Footnote 2 Figure 2 plots the log level of real GDP per capita, in which the slope shows the growth rate of income. In the eighteenth century, income in the UK grew very slowly. Specifically, the average annual growth rate of income in the UK from 1701 to 1800 was 0.4%. Then, the average growth rate from 1801 to 1900 increased to 1.0%. From the twentieth century onwards, the average growth rate stabilized at about 1.7%.
 Real GDP per capita in the UK from 1700 to 2016 Log of real GDP per capita in the UK from 1700 to 2016 We incorporate patent protection into the Schumpeterian growth model of endogenous take-off in Peretto (2015). In this model, the economy first experiences stagnation with zero growth in output per capita when the market size is small. Here, population size plays the crucial role of determining the market size, which in turn implies that population growth gives rise to an expansion of the market. As the market size becomes sufficiently large, innovation takes place and the economy gradually experiences growth. In the long run, the economy converges to a balanced growth path (BGP) with steady-state growth. Within this growth-theoretic framework that is consistent with the growth pattern in Figs. 1 and 2, we obtain the following results. Strengthening patent protection leads to an earlier take-off. Incentives for innovation to take place depend on the market value of inventions, which in turn depends on the level of patent protection and the market size. Therefore, when stronger patent protection increases the market value of patents by reducing price competition and making firms more profitable, it also reduces the market size required for innovation to take place. As a result, the economy starts to experience innovation and growth at an earlier time (i.e., an earlier industrial revolution). Our finding that stronger IPR protection leads to an earlier (but not necessarily immediate) take-off is consistent with historical evidence on the effects of IPR on industrial revolution.Footnote 3 However, stronger patent protection eventually reduces innovation and growth as recent studies tend to find.Footnote 4 Intuitively, although stronger patent protection encourages entry and increases the number of products in the economy, this larger number of products reduces the market size of each product and redirects resources away from the quality-improving innovation of each product, which determines long-run growth.Footnote 5 This study relates to the literature on innovation and economic growth. Romer (1990) develops the seminal variety-expanding growth model in which innovation is driven by new products, whereas Aghion and Howitt (1992) develop the Schumpeterian quality-ladder growth model in which innovation is driven by higher-quality products. Peretto (1998, 1999) and Smulders and van de Klundert (1995) combine the two dimensions of innovation and develop a Schumpeterian growth model with an endogenous market structure. This study explores the effects of IPR in this vintage of the Schumpeterian growth model.
 In the literature on IPR and innovation, other studies also explore the effects of IPR in the innovation-driven growth model.Footnote 6 These studies mostly focus on either variety expansion or quality improvement. Only a few studies, such as Chu et al. (2012) and Chu et al. (2016), explore the effects of IPR in the Schumpeterian growth model with both dimensions of innovation. However, these studies do not consider the case in which the effects of IPR can change at different stages of the economy. Iwaisako (2013), Chu et al. (2014) and Chu et al. (2019) show that the growth or welfare effects of IPR can depend on, respectively, the level of public services, the distance to the technology frontier, and the level of financial development in the economy. However, none of these studies consider how IPR affects the endogenous take-off of an economy. The novel contributions of this study are to explore the effects of IPR in a Schumpeterian growth model of endogenous take-off and to highlight the contrasting effects of IPR on economic growth at different stages of the economy with different dimensions of innovation. This study also relates to the literature on endogenous take-off and economic growth. Galor and Weil (2000) provide the seminal study and develop unified growth theory,Footnote 7 which explores how the quality-quantity tradeoff in childrearing and human capital accumulation allow a country to escape from the Malthusian trap and lead to the endogenous take-off of the economy.Footnote 8Peretto (2015) develops a Schumpeterian growth model of endogenous take-off, which features exogenous population growth and does not capture the Malthusian trap; instead, it describes an economy in which take-off is driven by innovation, which also relates to the industrial revolution and is suitable for our analysis of patent policy. The Peretto model features both quality improvement and variety expansion, under which endogenous growth in the number of products provides a dilution effect that removes the scale effect of population size on long-run growth. Therefore, although the population size affects the timing of the take-off, it does not affect the steady-state growth rate. We incorporate patent protection into the Peretto model to explore its effects on endogenous take-off. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 explores the effects of patent policy at different stages of the economy. Section 4 concludes.",12

The economics of religion is a young but fast-growing field of research that employs economic theory and econometric techniques to better understand the interaction between religion and society (Iannaccone 1998; McCleary and Barro 2006; Iyer 2016). In this paper, we investigate the link between religion and abortions. Each day, approximately 153,000 pregnancies are terminated around the world (Sedgh et al. 2016). While access to abortion has become more widely available in an increasing number of countries, abortion remains a controversial procedure. In many countries, women who abort face religious sanctions, legal restrictions and hostile social norms (Norris et al. 2011). The decision to undergo an abortion is often associated with considerable stress and anxiety. For example, Coleman et al. (2009) show that women who abort are at a higher risk of a variety of mental health problems, including anxiety, mood and substance abuse disorders, when compared with women without a history of abortion. We measure the causal impact of papal visits to Italian provinces between 1979 and 2012 on the number of abortions. Our choice to focus on Italy is motivated by three factors. First, Italy is predominantly Catholic and the Pope is the emblem of Catholic doctrine. Second, due to the geographical proximity of the Vatican, Italy is the country with the highest number of papal visits, viz. 129 in our sample period, increasing the statistical power of our research design. Finally, since 1979, the Italian National Institute of Statistics has collected information on all abortions in Italy with a high detail of geographical identification, allowing us to construct a monthly panel of abortion counts at the provincial level. We employ an event study methodology to measure the impact of a papal visit to an Italian province. Our main result is a large and statistically significant drop in the number of abortions starting from the 3rd month after a papal visit and persisting until about the 14th month. Specifically, we measure a decline in monthly abortion counts that ranges from about 10 to 20%. Ceteris paribus, a decline in abortions should be accompanied by a subsequent spike in live births. However, we fail to detect a significant increase in births after the papal visit. This is surprising for at least two reasons. First, as we detail later, a back of the envelope calculation predicts that, if there is no change in the number of pregnancies, live births should increase by about 3.7% 6 to 7 months after the decline in abortions. Our null result on the number of births is rather precise; the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is about 1.2%. Second, independently of the effect on abortions, papal visits would be expected to boost fertility in the short run through an increase in desired fertility or reduced contraceptive usage. Indeed, Bassi and Rasul (2017) document a spike in births in Brazil 9 months after the papal visit in 1992. Why would papal visits lead to a drop in abortions? Catholic Church doctrine strongly condemns deliberate termination of pregnancy. According to the Donum Vitae:  “Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the Lord of life from its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being” (Ratzinger 1987). Papal visits can heighten the stigma attached to abortion, leading to both direct and indirect effects on the number of abortions. By direct effect, we mean a reduced probability of abortion, conditional on becoming unintentionally pregnant. This can be mediated through a drop in the demand for and in the supply of abortions. Women may be more reluctant to abort. Alternatively, stigma could drive women to opt for “back-street” abortions to keep the procedure secret, which would cause under-reporting. Abortion providers may also become more reluctant to do the procedure unless medically necessary. In contrast, the indirect effect is a reduction in the number of abortions due to a decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies if women choose more abstinence or use more contraception.Footnote 1 The intuition of the indirect effect is readily confirmed in a simple model of contraceptive usage that builds on Levine (2004). In this model, women are forward looking and fully informed of their personal costs of abortion vs. birth in the case of an unintended pregnancy. They choose an optimal level of contraception, which can include abstinence. Papal visits increase the perceived cost of abortion. The model predicts that women respond by increasing contraceptive usage, thereby reducing the number of unintended pregnancies, which in turn reduces the number of abortions. For two main reasons, we argue that it is the indirect effect rather than the direct effects that drive our results. First, the direct effects should show up as a decline in abortions that is contemporaneous with the papal visit. There is no such contemporaneous drop. In contrast, if there is a decline in unintended pregnancies that begins with a papal visit, it would manifest itself with a decrease in abortions 2–3 months after the papal visit since pregnancies are typically detected 6–8 weeks after conception.Footnote 2 Second, as noted already, we find no significant increase in births after the papal visit. If there are fewer abortions, births must mechanically increase unless the number of pregnancies is also falling.Footnote 3 The proximate causes of a fall in unintended pregnancies could be increased abstinence, or alternatively, increased usage of contraceptives during intercourse. Since the Catholic Church frowns upon sexual relations unless in the context of procreation, that could also directly increase abstinence. Women may also opt for more use of contraceptives, although that can pose a dilemma since the Catholic Church has traditionally opposed contraception. It is conceivable that some women decide that contraception is the “lesser of two evils”. We furnish supporting evidence that papal visits make the Catholic doctrine highly salient and increase the perceived cost of abortion. While one might think that Italians are “accustomed” to the papal presence, as he lives in Rome and often visits Italian provinces, we document that papal visits within Italy dominate local media coverage and generate considerable excitement among the local clergy and the population alike. Furthermore, the impact on abortions appears to be larger when the Pope refers to abortion in his speeches and when he engages more intensively with the public. We also find that the visits result in higher religiosity in the local population as proxied by church attendance. This paper contributes to a number of different literatures. First, we shed additional light on the determinants of abortion. The economic literature on abortions can be traced back to seminal work by Becker (1991) and Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983). They model children as an investment producing benefits over time. Contraception and abortion are seen as methods for achieving the number of children desired by the household. Several studies have explored how the demand for abortion responds to changes in public policies. Blank et al. (1996) and Levine et al. (1996) show that the enactment of restrictions on Medicaid funding is correlated with a decline in abortion rates in the USA. Joyce and Kaestner (1996) show that parental involvement laws have no impact on the probability of abortion for minors in the USA, with the only exception of South Carolina, where a negative and statistically significant effect is found for 16-year-old non-Blacks. Levine (2003) finds that parental involvement laws reduce abortion rates for younger teens, but not for older teens or adult women. Abramowitz (2018) finds that the provision of the Affordable Care Act for young adults, a health insurance reform enacted in the USA in 2010, causes a decrease in the probability of childbirth and in the abortion rate. A new stream of research has started to investigate the causal effects of “supply-side” policies that target abortion facilities Joyce (2011). Grossman et al. (2017) find that, among Texas counties with no abortion provider in 2014, larger increases in the distance to the nearest provider between 2012 and 2014 are associated with larger decreases in abortions. Lindo et al. (2017) find a large and non-linear reduction in abortion rates in response to increased distance to clinics from abortion clinic closures in Texas; they also find a substantial negative effect from increased congestion at the surviving clinics. Second, we add to the strand of literature in the economics of religion that aims to pin down the causal effects of religion on important socio-economic outcomes. For example, a number of recent papers have exploited the exogenous timing of Ramadan-induced fasting to study effects on educational, health and labour market outcomes (Almond and Mazumder 2011; Oosterbeek and van der Klaauw 2013; Majid 2015). Clingingsmith et al. (2009) exploit the lottery-based allocation of Hajj visas in Pakistan to identify the impact of Hajj on religiosity and social attitudes. In an experimental study, Benjamin et al. (2016) randomly prime subjects to make their religious identity salient and find that this causes subjects to identify more closely with their religion, and in turn affects their economic choices. Our paper is closely related to a recent paper by Bassi and Rasul (2017) on the effect of the 1991 papal visit on fertility-related beliefs and behaviour in Brazil. The authors report a significant increase in the hazard rate for births 9 months post-visit. We complement Bassi and Rasul (2017) using administrative records to study the impact of papal visits on abortion and to a lesser extent births. To the best of our knowledge, no study before has sought to measure the effect of heightened religious sentiment on the number of abortions or used administrative data to precisely estimate the effect of the papal visits on the number of births. Finally and more broadly, the paper contributes to a growing literature focused on the impact of role models on behaviour. Beaman et al. (2009) and Beaman et al. (2012) show that exposure to a female politician reduces gender stereotypes and influences adolescent girls’ career aspirations and educational attainment. DellaVigna (2010) uses an event study methodology to explore how Obama’s election affects racial discrimination against Blacks and economic outcomes for Blacks by changing perceptions of Blacks. Bertrand and Schoar (2003) analyse how individual managers affect corporate behaviour and performance. Jones and Olken (2005) investigate the impact of national leaders on economic growth. Stroebel and van Benthem (2012) use the appointment of local bishops in Kenya to study the impact of church authorities’ teaching on sexual behaviour. The paper is organised as follows. We present the institutional setting in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the data on abortion and the papal visits. Next in Section 4, we sketch a simple model of contraceptive usage, and spell out the predictions for the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and live births in response to a change in the perceived cost of abortion. Regression results for the number of abortions and live births are presented in Section 5. In Section 6, we investigate plausible mechanisms that could be driving the results. In particular, we show that papal visits within Italy generate widespread coverage in local media, there appears to be an increase in religiosity as measured by church attendance, and the measured decline in abortion is greater during visits where the Pope mentions abortion. We discuss and interpret our findings in Section 7. We also show that the timing of papal visits is not driven by short-run pre-existing province-level trends, bolstering the case for a causal interpretation of our results. Finally, we conclude in Section 8.",2

These days, several developed countries are below replacement-level fertility, facing populating aging and being unable to reproduce themselves over an extended period of time.Footnote 1 The trend of falling fertility levels has not been limited to high-income countries, with the majority of developing and middle-income countries experiencing rapid movements towards replacement-level fertility (Strulik and Vollmer, 2015; UN, 2015a). To better understand fertility behavior and the existence of low-fertility regimes, the economic literature has recently turned towards examining the role of parenthood on subjective well-being (SWB).Footnote 2 Empirical evidence on this topic—mostly from cross-sectional regressions—has often found an insignificant or even negative effect of having children on SWB, which could help explain the trend towards declining and low fertility levels (Alesina et al. 2004; Blanchflower, 2008; Clark, 2007; Deaton and Stone, 2014; Di Tella et al., 2003, Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2006; Hansen et al. 2009; Dolan et al., 2008; Kohler et al. 2005; Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011; Stanca, 2012; Stutzer and Frey, 2006). The predominant result that parents are better off without children is surprising given that most of the world is pervaded by strong cultural beliefs that children increase the well-being of parents (Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011). Related research, however, has provided some rationalization for the finding by showing that parents experience higher levels of stress and anxiety (Buddelmeyer et al., 2018; Deaton and Stone, 2014; Evenson and Simon, 2005; Hamermesh and Lee, 2007), increased anger and depression (Nomaguchi and Milkie, 2003), and more worries about sufficient family income (Stanca, 2012) compared with non-parents.Footnote 3 Despite plausible explanations for the absence of a positive correlation between having children and SWB, it should be pointed out that only limited causal evidence exists that examines how fertility affects SWB. Establishing causality in this context is difficult given that fertility decisions are endogenous for multiple reasons. First, concerns about reversed causality need to be addressed given that several studies have pointed out selection effects indicating that happier couples are more likely to have children (Cetre et al., 2016; Moglie et al., 2015; Parr, 2010). Second, econometric results obtained from simple ordinary least squares (OLS), matching on observables, and panel fixed-effect specifications might be biased due to the inability to control for certain (time-varying) confounding variables such as personality, job aspirations, partnership stability, sexual activity, and growing into adulthood (Myrskylä and Margolis, 2014). Third, several of the control variables used in the fertility-SWB literature are simultaneously factors influencing and outcomes of the very same relationship, which therefore requires robustness checks involving different covariate specifications. Since the magnitude, direction, and significance levels of the coefficient of interest are quite sensitive to the choice of covariates (Clark and Oswald, 2002; Herbst and Ifcher, 2016; Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011), the available descriptive evidence is in general difficult to interpret. My data and empirical setting addresses these difficulties. I leverage data from UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs) using all available datasets in which women’s complete birth history and SWB information were collected. The causal identification strategy is borrowed from the labor market and child quantity-quality trade-off literature (Aaronson et al., 2017; Angrist et al., 2010) and exploits quasi-experimental variation in family size due to preferences for a mixed sibling sex composition (Angrist and Evans, 1998). Employing a local average treatment effect (LATE) framework, I establish several novel facts about the relationship between fertility and SWB. My first finding is that while, similar to other studies, the OLS estimates here indicate a negative relationship between fertility and SWB, the relationship is positive and statistically significant for the causal estimates for the subpopulation of compliers. In fact, instrumental variable (IV) estimates suggest that having a third child increases SWB between 0.45 and 0.58 units. Second, I provide empirical evidence that an increase in certain dimensions of life satisfaction, namely family life, friendship, and treatment by other people, are more closely related to the overall increase in SWB due the birth of a third child. My study advances the literature on fertility and SWB in three ways. First, I provide causal evidence that addresses concerns regarding the likely endogeneity between fertility and SWB with the previous literature being confined to (i) cross-section and pooled regression models (Alesina et al. 2004; Aassve et al. 2012; Clark, 2007; Deaton and Stone, 2014; Di Tella et al. 2003; Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2006; Herbst and Ifcher, 2016; Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011; Stanca, 2012; Stevenson and Wolfers, 2009; Vanassche et al., 2013), (ii) panel models with fixed effects (Clark and Oswald, 2002; Stutzer and Frey, 2006), and (iii) event studies (Baetschmann et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2008; Clark and Georgellis, 2013; Frijters et al., 2011; Myrskylä and Margolis, 2014; Pedersen and Schmidt, 2014).Footnote 4 Second, bearing in mind the main causal identification strategy, I in particular contribute to the substantially less-developed literature on the effect of fertility on SWB at the intensive margin (an additional child) in contrast to the extensive margin (becoming a parent). Estimates at the intensive margin are less frequently reported, with the majority of studies estimating coefficients on motherhood only, which hides possible differential effects by the intensive and extensive margin. Those studies that provide estimates at the intensive and extensive margin, either by simply controlling for the number of children or by estimating effects separately by birth order, show that both estimates tend to go into the same direction (Herbst and Ifcher, 2016; Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011; Myrskylä and Margolis, 2014; Stanca, 2012). Third, my analysis focuses on developing countries, for which only very little evidence on the relationship between fertility and SWB yet exists.Footnote 5 Scholars have argued that the underlying mechanism and relative importance of circumstantial factors such as cultural norms, the availability of formal and family child care mechanism, and access to effective contraceptives differs between developing and developed countries, with consequences for the effect of fertility on SWB (Margolis and Myrskylä, 2011). Furthermore, studying fertility behavior, more specifically the fertility-SWB link, in developing countries seems particularly rewarding given that these countries are fundamental to global fertility and population trends (UN, 2015b, 2017), as well as international economic growth and welfare improvements (WB, 2010). I proceed as follows. In section 2, I describe the data. In section 3, I present the identification strategy and describe the main results. In Section 4, I show additional robustness checks and examine results for different dimensions of life satisfaction as well as heterogeneous treatment effects. Finally, I conclude in section 5.",3

The incapacitation effect of schooling on minority women,October 2020,Anna Adamecz-Völgyi,Ágota Scharle,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Teenage fertility disrupts human capital accumulation and is one of the most important sources of intergenerational poverty transmission (Bonell 2004). There is compelling evidence on the negative health, social, and economic consequences of teenage childbearing, such as lower educational attainment and labor market attachment rates, poorer soft skills, higher rates of benefit receipt, and higher infant mortality (Klepinger et al. 1999; Chevalier and Viitanen 2003; Fletcher and Wolfe 2009; Fletcher and Padrón 2016; Wilson 2017). Negative impacts have been found to carry on to the next generation as well: Navarro Paniagua and Walker (2012) show that daughters of teenage mothers are less likely to have post-compulsory education and more likely to become teenage mothers themselves. Due to its high opportunity costs, the prevalence of teenage motherhood has been declining in most developed countries. In the 2000s, the share of women aged 15–19 giving birth per year was between 0.5 and 2.5% in most Western-European countries.Footnote 1 However, teenage motherhood is still very common among disadvantaged ethnic minorities living in developed countries. Examples include Mexican women in the USA, women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin in the UK, Turkish women in Belgium and France, and Roma women throughout Europe. In Hungary, more than a quarter of Roma women have their first child by their 18th birthday, and almost half of them have their first child by their 20th birthday. Bean and Swicegood (1985) argue that fertility differences between minority and majority women are generated by social and economic exclusion. The opportunity costs of early childbearing tend to be lower for minority women because their perceived and actual future economic opportunities are constrained, independent of their fertility patterns. Lopoo (2004) finds that disadvantaged teenagers with working mothers (which is assumed to improve girls’ perceived labor market prospects) are 18% less likely to give birth compared with their peers who have non-working mothers. Wolfe et al. (2007) propose that girls’ fertility decisions depend on their perceptions of the consequences of childbearing for future income and relationships. They show that negative consequences observed in the older generation reduce the teen fertility rate. Kearney and Levine (2012) conclude that young women choose motherhood instead of investing in the development of their own human capital because “they feel they have little chance of advancement.” Kearney and Levine (2014) provide evidence that women of low social and economic status are more likely to give birth at a young age if they live in a US state with a higher level of income inequality. The majority of earlier studies focus on the fertility effects of education in general, not distinguishing between minority or majority ethnic groups. Their identification strategy is usually based on changes in education policy.Footnote 2 Most papers find that having more education does reduce the probability of early childbearing and/or delays motherhood. There is much less evidence on the potential impact of education on teenage motherhood among ethnic minority women in particular. The only such study we have found so far is Bifulco et al. (2015), who examine the effects of school desegregation in the USA and find that it has not reduced the fertility of black teenagers. They conclude that, although school desegregation has generated benefits for black students along several dimensions, decreasing early childbearing is not one of them. This finding is consistent with the above explanation: desegregation tackled the quality of education available to black girls, but did not address expected labor market prospects. The impact of education on fertility may work via two main channels: incapacitation or human capital investment. While the incapacitation effect can only influence conception during the period of education (extended by some exogenous event), the human capital effect may materialize during or after this period as well. IncapacitationFootnote 3 refers to the possibility that teenagers may not have the desire, time, or opportunity to have a child while they are in school. This does not necessarily imply that teenagers are less sexually active while in school. It might also happen that they have easier access to contraception, morning-after pills, or abortion. The human capital effect is commonly described as an increase in education that increases the expected wage, which in turn increases the opportunity cost of having a teen birth. Human capital development might also bring non-pecuniary benefits such as increased awareness of contraception and/or of the potential negative consequences of early motherhood, or improved mating strategies. Most of the literature distinguishes between incapacitation and human capital channels by looking for effects on fertility beyond the age directly affected by the reform. Investigating reforms raising the compulsory school leaving age, Black et al. (2008), Cygan-Rehm and Maeder (2013), and Silles (2011) find evidence of both incapacitation and human capital effects. Geruso and Royer (2018) follow a different approach. Assuming that all pregnancies lasted for 9 months, they deduce the approximate conception time of babies and look at the effects of extended schooling on the probability of pregnancies conceived before, during, or after the new schooling period. They only find statistically significant effects during the new schooling period and interpret this as evidence for incapacitation effects. Berthelon and Kruger (2011) concentrate on the incapacitation effect of education and show that longer school days reduce the probability of motherhood and criminal behavior among teenage girls aged 15–19. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we examine how extended compulsory education affects teenage childbearing among ethnic minority women characterized by poor labor market opportunities and low opportunity cost of motherhood. We look at Roma women, who make up the largest ethnic minority in Hungary, accounting for about 5–7% of the total population, or 500,000–700,000 people. Unlike in Western Europe, the vast majority of Roma communities in Hungary settled down by the end of the nineteenth century and travellers practically disappeared by the early 1990s (Crowe 1995; Kemény and Janky 2005). School attendance among the Roma steadily increased after the 1960s, and by the late 1990s, the Roma-non Roma gap in children completing the 8-year elementary school was reduced to a negligible level (Hajdú et al. 2014). However, Roma have continued to experience social exclusion. Belonging to the Roma minority is strongly correlated with poverty, social exclusion, and long-term unemployment. Roma children are more likely to attend segregated schools, which are often of lower quality (Kemény and Janky 2005; Ladányi and Szelényi 2002; Kertesi 2005; Gábos et al. 2006). The Roma employment gap is especially large for women (FRA 2014). Returns to education rose sharply during the 1990s, but labor market opportunities for the low educated and the Roma declined. Teenage fertility of non-Roma women is just as low in Hungary as in most Western-European countries, while among Roma women, it is comparable with levels measured in developing countries such as the Congo or Kenya (Janky 2007; UNFPA 2013). We estimate the intention-to-treat (ITT) effects of longer schooling by exploiting the reform of compulsory schooling introduced in 1996. The reform increased the compulsory school leaving (CSL) age from 16 to 18, applicable to those starting elementary school in September 1998. Our identification strategy is based on the elementary school enrollment rule that allows us to set up a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) identification strategy around a cutoff date of birth. We find that the reform decreased the probability of teenage motherhood among Roma women by 3.5–6.8 percentage points (13.4–26.0%), depending on the empirical method we use, and caused a 2-year delay in motherhood. We find no effects among non-Roma women. Our second contribution to the literature is that we exploit a database of all known pregnancies, including live births, abortions, fetal losses, and still births, linked to a large subsample of Roma women in the 2011 Hungarian Census. The data have information on gestational age and thus allow us to reconstruct the week when conception occurred and directly investigate the effect of the reform on the probability of getting pregnant, having an abortion, and ending a pregnancy with an abortion. We find a negative effect on the probability of having an abortion and on the probability of ending a pregnancy with an abortion (conditional on getting pregnant). This last result is estimated on the small subsample of pregnant Roma women and is not significant; however, the large coefficient might suggest that the reform decreased the probability of unwanted pregnancies more. Third, we separate the incapacitation and human capital effects of education by showing that the reform decreased the probability of getting pregnant during the school year but not during summer and Christmas breaks, indicating that the effect is generated mainly by the incapacitation channel. This result is in line with the conclusion of Geruso and Royer (2018) and consistent with the explanation that the poor labor market prospects of ethnic minority women keep the opportunity cost of childbearing low. In terms of showing that being in school has a contemporaneous incapacitation effect, our results are analogous to those of Berthelon and Kruger (2011) as mentioned above and Jacob and Lefgren (2003) who show that teenagers are less likely to engage in criminal behavior on schooldays. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the fertility pattern of Roma adolescents. Section 3 summarizes the reform and the institutional background. The identification strategy and empirical methods are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results, Section 6 reports several robustness checks while Section 7 concludes.",1

Decision makers pay the financial and psychological costs of migration up front in order to reap the benefits of higher expected lifetime utility later. Since these benefits are uncertain, economic theory implies a close link between risk attitudes and the propensity to migrate. Only few contributions, however, provide direct evidence on the impact of risk aversion on migration decisions at the individual or household level, and those that do mostly focus on risk aversion as a determinant of migration within countries. For example, Jaeger et al. (2010) find that migrants between German regions are more risk loving than their immobile counterparts. Conroy (2009) finds the same for emigrants from rural Mexico, as do Akgüç et al. (2016) and Dustmann et al. (2017) for rural-urban migrants in China. Direct evidence on the importance of individual-level risk aversion for international migration is even more limited. To the best of our knowledge, only Gibson and McKenzie (2011) and Nowotny (2014) provide direct evidence on the role of risk aversion in international migration. While the former focus on a highly selective sample of the “best and brightest” high school students from three Pacific states (New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga), the latter mostly focuses on the role of risk aversion in the choice between cross-border commuting and migration.Footnote 1 This paper uses a large-scale, multi-country individual-level dataset (the Life in Transition Survey, LITS) to provide direct evidence on the impact of risk aversion on the propensity to migrate across and within countries in a unified framework. This data provides information on migration intentions both within a country and abroad for 30 transition countries that, according to Özden et al. (2011), account for over 25% of worldwide migrant stocks. It also contains a measure of risk aversion whose reliability has been experimentally validated by Dohmen et al. (2011). This data allows us to consider potential migrants relative to the general population in the sending country and to compare the impact of risk attitudes on the propensity to migrate abroad and within countries. The data source also surveys potential migrants prior to migration, which makes issues related to the potential impact of migration experiences on risk attitudes, a cause of endogenous attitudes toward risk in data on actual migration (see Jaeger et al. 2010), of less concern. Further, the focus on a broad set of sending countries lets us explore whether risks that are specific to the sending country moderate the relationship between individual-level risk aversion and the propensity to migrate. This is of interest because Jaeger et al. (2010) argue that, although more risk averse individuals should be less prone to migrate, the negative impact of risk aversion on migration decisions could be weaker (or potentially even be reversed) in countries with high risks if risk averse persons dislike living in a risky (region of a) country. The overall effect of risk aversion on migration propensities is therefore ambiguous and likely to depend on the riskiness of the sending country. We base our analysis on a model of immigrant self-selection and find that, in accordance with the previous literature, risk averse individuals are less likely to be willing to migrate both abroad and within countries. We expand the existing evidence by showing that this impact is less negative in riskier countries. Somewhat surprisingly, this applies not only to willingness to migrate abroad but also to willingness to migrate within a country. We also find that willingness to migrate within a country and abroad are highly correlated even after controlling for a broad set of observable characteristics. This can be taken as evidence that (unobserved) factors that impact migration costs abroad and within countries are highly correlated. In addition, individual-level risk aversion reduces willingness to migrate abroad more strongly than willingness to migrate within a country.",10

Evidence from Finnish municipalities,January 2021,Jakub Lonsky,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The popularity of far-right (sometimes also referred to as populist radical right)Footnote 1 parties across Europe has been rising rapidly in recent years. The latest political developments in Europe—such as the UK’s exit from the European Union—suggest that the surge of the far-right could have significant negative economic and political consequences for the entire continent. The rise of the far-right appears to be driven—in large part—by immigration. Since the early 1990s, Europe has experienced significant migration flows. First was the East to West migration from post-communist countries that began with the fall of the Soviet Union, and accelerated after the EU enlargements in the 2000s. Recent years saw a large inflow of asylum seekers from Asia and Africa fueled by a number of armed conflicts. Both of these immigration shocks likely kindled anti-immigrant sentiments across the continent, contributing to an unprecedented wave of electoral success among far-right parties. This paper studies the effect of immigration on voting for the far-right on a local (municipality) level. This micro effect is facilitated through the personal contact between natives and immigrants as well as the perceived impact of foreign in-migration on local communities. By contrast, the macro effect of national immigrant inflows refers to the salience of migration in the national social and political discourse.Footnote 2 The micro-level impact of immigrants on natives’ voting choices is a priori ambiguousFootnote 3 and thus requires an empirical examination. This study focuses on Finland, a country that had a single far-right party (the Finns Party) for nearly 25 years (1995–2017) but was long considered immune to the surge of the far-right seen in other European countries (Ellinas 2010; Goodwin 2008; Ignazi 2003). The period of study is 2006 to 2015. These years are characterized by both the historically largest inflow of foreign citizens into Finland (Koivukangas 2003) and a remarkable rise in the Finns Party’s popularity. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between immigration and far-right voting on the national level (see Section 3 for more details). The analysis employs a novel panel dataset that spans 7 election years and 297 municipalities (all of mainland Finland). All types of national elections (i.e., parliamentary, presidential, and European parliamentary) are considered. The sudden and unprecedented increase in immigration into Finland that followed the 2004 EU enlargement also provides an excellent setup for identification. The 2003 distributions of immigrants by continent of citizenship can be used to construct a “shift-share” instrument (Altonji and Card 1991; Orrenius and Zavodny 2015) to identify the effect of immigration on far-right voting. One thing that makes this instrument particularly convincing in this case is the change in immigrant composition that followed the 2004 enlargement. While the 1990s and early 2000s were characterized primarily by an influx of Ingrian Finns from the former Soviet Union and asylum seekers from countries such as Somalia and former Yugoslavia (Koivukangas 2003), the 2004 and the subsequent EU enlargements brought in mostly economic migrants from Central and Eastern Europe. This minimizes the concern that IV results could be driven by persistent trends in anti-immigrant or pro-immigrant attitudes across municipalities. Using the shift-share instrument, I find an economically meaningful and statistically significant negative effect of municipal in-migration of foreigners on the Finns Party’s vote share. The IV coefficient from the preferred specification suggests that 1 percentage point increase in the share of foreign citizens in a municipality (68% of the mean) decreases the Finns Party’s vote share by about 3.35 percentage points (28% of the mean). Placebo tests using pre-period data confirm the IV estimate is not driven by persistent trends at the municipality level. To further validate the IV design, I re-estimate the main specification using a shift-share instrument constructed with 1991 immigrant distributions.Footnote 4 The resulting coefficient remains negative, statistically significant at 5%, and slightly larger in magnitude than the original estimate. Additional robustness checks such as the first-difference estimation, the inclusion of lagged-immigrant share, the exclusion of potential outliers, and the estimation with larger geographical units confirm the main result. Considering the effect of immigration on voting for other parties, I find that the strongly pro-immigration Green League and Swedish People’s Party gain votes. Indeed, their positive coefficients roughly add up to the negative estimate for the Finns Party. These positive effects are also relatively large; a 1 percentage point increase in the foreign share increases the Green League’s vote share by 23% and the Swedish People’s Party’s vote share by 57% with respect to the sample means. Exploring the potential mechanisms behind my main finding, I first show that local foreign in-migration increases voter turnout (3% with respect to mean), potentially activating a larger pro-immigration base. Interestingly, the share of protest votes remains unaffected by immigrant inflows. In addition, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the negative effect of immigration on the Finns Party’s vote share is only present in places with large initial exposure to immigrants. This finding provides some evidence in favor of Allport (1954)’s intergroup contact theory which suggests that a meaningful contact between natives and immigrants can effectively ameliorate natives’ anti-immigrant attitudes. Finally, I also find some evidence consistent with the welfare-state channel. In particular, I show that immigration increases municipal per capita personal income tax revenue, while per capita spending on social services, health care services, and education remain unaffected (Facchini and Mayda 2012; 2009; Dustmann and Preston 2007). My analysis contributes to the growing economics literature on the effects of immigration on voting for the far-right and other anti-immigrant parties in Europe (described in more detail in Section 2).Footnote 5 Most studies find a positive effect (Halla et al. 2017; Barone et al. 2016; Becker and Fetzer 2016; Edo et al. 2019; Gerdes and Wadensjö 2008; Harmon 2018; Mendez and Cutillas 2014; Otto and Steinhardt 2014; Brunner and Kuhn 2018), while the negative relationship has only been documented in Steinmayr (2018), and to some extent also in Dustmann et al. (2019) and Levi et al. (2020). This study is the first to show that an inflow of economic migrants can reduce support for the far-right across all types of national elections. By contrast, both Steinmayr (2018) and Dustmann et al. (2019) consider the exposure to refugees through refugee allocation schemes. In addition, Steinmayr (2018) evaluates the impact of a specific and relatively short-term event—the European refugee crisis—and considers only the extensive margin of immigration. This paper, on the other hand, focuses on the intensive margin and the study period spans 10 years and involves three types of national elections. Regarding Dustmann et al. (2019), the negative effect is present only in a limited subsample analysis of the 5% most urban Danish municipalities (i.e., 26 observations). By contrast, I find no effect heterogeneity with respect to initial population size—the negative effect is present in municipalities both above and below the median initial population size. Second, this paper examines a broad set of electoral outcomes in a parliamentary democratic system, which before the emergence of the Finns Party was characterized by basic electoral stability and the implosion of the party system. The former refers to low volatility of electoral gains and losses while the latter describes a scenario in which all major parties become center parties capable of forming a coalition government with one another (Arter 2008). In this political setting, uniquely positioned to face the threat of a right-wing populist party, I consider the impact of immigration on voting for other parties and voter turnout, as well as the protest vote. A few previous studies have considered the impact of immigration on voter turnout. Barone et al. (2016) find a negative effect, while Steinmayr (2018) finds no effect. Dustmann et al. (2019) find a positive effect but only in municipal elections, whereas I find an increase in turnout in the context of national elections. As far as the protest vote is concerned, the only other paper that considers it is Barone et al. (2016). While they find an increase in the share of invalid ballots in response to immigrant inflow, I find no effect on the protest vote. Third, Finland provides a unique setting in a number of other dimensions as well. Before the 2004 EU enlargement, Finland was a country with minimal immigrant inflow and a very low far-right popularity. Even after 2004, both the stock and the inflow of migrants remained relatively low compared to other EU countries (Eurostat 2020). In addition, the majority of immigrants have been from Europe, with a large number of economic migrants arriving from Central and Eastern Europe following the 2006 and 2007 labor market openings. Last but not least, Finland is also interesting as it is characterized by an extensive welfare state, highly educated and aging population, compressed wage distribution, and high union density, all of which have likely played an important role in shaping natives’ attitudes towards immigration (Sarvimäki 2011; Koivukangas 2003). Fourth, this paper is one of only a handful of studies providing evidence for the welfare-state channel as a possible mechanism through which immigration affects far-right voting. This is particularly appealing given that Finland is a country with a generous welfare system (managed primarily by municipalities), and thus, native concerns about immigrant “benefit tourism” are especially relevant in this context. Previous papers have focused mostly on labor market and compositional amenities (Halla et al. 2017; Barone et al. 2016; Becker and Fetzer 2016), cultural diversity (Barone et al. 2016), the intergroup contact theory (Steinmayr 2018), and other non-economic aspects (Otto and Steinhardt 2014). Otto and Steinhardt (2014) do consider welfare channel as well, but they provide only indirect evidence. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys the findings in the previous literature. Section 3 discusses the background. In Section 4, I describe the data and identification strategy. Results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses potential mechanisms. Section 7 concludes.",15

Although the rest of the world soon learned about the first publicly known cases, several countries did not perceive an immediate risk for their populations. Starting in January 2020, the epidemic spread outside China, first in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and in the USA, and in many cases it was connected to recent travelers to the country. In Europe, Italy reported its first official community-based case on February 20, and, very quickly, clusters of cases developed in the Lombardy region. It was later discovered that the virus had been circulating in Lombardy since at least early January (Cereda et al. 2020) and, possibly, since December. By mid-March, the vast majority of countries in the world had multiple cases, with the centers of the outbreak moving first to Europe and later to the USA. Most countries responded by requiring their populations to adhere to some form of social distancing to reduce the rate of infection and lessen the strain on healthcare providers. Responses, however, have been widely heterogeneous. Italy reacted with a few-days delay after the outbreak and then implemented restrictive stay-at-home policies. A minority of countries initially experimented with laxer restrictions, either based on a misguided attempt to have their populations achieve herd immunity on their own (the UK, which soon moved away from the policy), or because of an unwritten “social contract” with citizens rather than enforcement from policymakers (Sweden). Others acted quickly and decisively to attempt to eradicate the disease before it became widespread (New Zealand). The spread of coronavirus has highlighted the importance of interdependencies across different regions. Depending on business links and other existing relationships, the virus rapidly moved across borders. Perceptions about the crisis and social behavior responded generally with lags, but they were also likely affected by observed experiences abroad. Countries had the opportunity of learning from others about social adjustments that were more or less effective in containing the disease. The main objective of this work is to study these global interrelationships in the early response to COVID-19 shocks. In particular, this paper exploits information about social networks across countries to study interdependencies in the number of disease cases, in the perceptions of their citizens about coronavirus risk, and in their social responses. I also provide some preliminary evidence on the early economic effects of the pandemic by looking at a potential leading indicator of unemployment. I include in my sample 41 countries and use a variety of data sources. To capture the extent of pairwise country social connections, I use data obtained from Facebook, which measure the total number of friendships across pairs of countries as a fraction of the total number of combined users in the two countries. This Social Connectedness indicator allows me to have a measure that can account for different types of relationships: regular friendships, business links, family ties, relations based on older and more recent patterns of immigration, and tourism flows. Social networks can help explain the transmission of COVID-19 cases across borders, and they are likely to represent a superior measure compared with the use of geographic distance alone.Footnote 1 Other contemporaneous papers make a similar observation (e.g., Kuchler et al.2020). At the same time, social networks not only can potentially explain patterns of disease contagion, but they can also help account for spillovers in ideas and behavior. Controlling for the country-specific dynamics of COVID-19 cases, people’s risk perceptions may respond differently and also be affected by the experience and perceptions of individuals in their networks of social connections, including those residing abroad. The same is true for responses in terms of social distancing: individuals who had large connections to countries where the virus outbreak and the social distancing responses were already happening may have learned from their early experiences, taken the epidemic more seriously, and responded similarly. To measure the actual social distancing response in each country, I exploit a novel dataset made available by Google through its country-specific Social Mobility reports. Finally, I use Internet data from Google Trends to measure coronavirus risk perceptions and to have a real-time, daily indicator of unemployment. I estimate a global VAR model to study the transmission of pandemic health shocks both domestically and globally.Footnote 2 In my global framework, for each country, COVID-19 cases can affect risk perceptions about the virus, which can trigger a social distancing response. As a result of social distancing or general uncertainty, unemployment may increase. The model allows me to treat all these variables as endogenous. This is necessary since social distancing, for example, is likely implemented in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, but it also itself has an impact on the future number of cases. Moreover, domestic variables in the model are also allowed to respond to foreign aggregates. The foreign variables enter each domestic model with weights that depend on the matrix of social connections. The relevant foreign aggregate for each country is different, since the patterns of connections are unique to the country. In the GVAR literature, the domestic models can be estimated separately as conditional VARs. All endogenous variables can then be stacked together to form a large-scale global VAR; it is then possible to track the responses of all variables to each shock in each country. Through the use of a connectivity matrix (my Social Connection matrix), the Global VAR model offers a relatively simple and parsimonious way to deal with potentially complex interactions across different variables and countries. My estimates highlight the importance of interdependencies and social networks in the transmission of coronavirus cases, in the increase of risk perceptions, and in social distancing behavior. Domestic variables, for the vast majority of countries, are significantly affected by foreign aggregates, constructed with weights based on the strength of social connections across countries. Given the role played by Italy and the USA as centers of the outbreak in different phases of the epidemic, I study how variables in the rest of the world respond to coronavirus shocks originating in these countries. I document strong and significant responses of risk perceptions and social distancing to the Italy COVID shock almost everywhere in the world. Countries also respond to the subsequent US shock, although with a smaller magnitude. Spillovers from Spain and the UK also play a sizable role. The countries’ responses to foreign and their own domestic coronavirus shocks are heterogeneous. I can, however, reveal some common patterns. The countries that respond with social distancing do so with a delayed and sluggish adjustment. They seem to learn from the experience of other countries, but they display an adaptive behavior: they do not adjust their habits instantly; instead, they gradually reduce their social mobility, which reaches a negative peak almost a week after the shock. In the opposite direction of causality, changes in social distancing lead to a decline in the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. The implications of the pandemic for unemployment also vary significantly by country. Labor markets in the USA and Spain are the most negatively affected, with large expected increases in unemployment rates. But large spikes in unemployment are not inevitable since most other countries seem to experience much more contained fluctuations. The results suggest that different institutional features can partly insulate the corresponding populations from the worse effects of large exogenous shocks. Due to the historical importance of the COVID-19 pandemic, research related to the disease and its effects has been growing swiftly. Many papers use the leading model in epidemiology, the SIR (or, alternatively, the extended SEIR) model based on Kermack and McKendrick (1927), to simulate the evolution of the disease (e.g., Ferguson N et al (2020)). In economics, a number of recent papers have adopted a similar framework and developed the theory further by adding relevant trade-offs between health and economic costs (e.g., Eichenbaum et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020)). This paper, instead, takes a different route by providing empirical evidence related to the social response to the outbreak, and using an alternative framework. In contrast to studies using the SIR model, I do not aim to predict the evolution of the number of infected individuals in a population; my focus lies more on explaining the social responses to the original health shocks around the world. Other recent works investigate the determinants of different approaches to social distancing. Gupta et al. (2020) find that social distancing responses do not necessarily correspond to policies mandated by State and local governments. Painter and Qiu (2020) and Adolph et al. (2020) find that political beliefs affect compliance with social distancing indications in the USA. Andersen (2020) finds evidence of substantial voluntary social distancing, and he also shows that it is affected by partisanship and media exposure. In light of these results, my approach does not use data on mandates, but it exploits, instead, the actual decline in mobility, as measured using location tracking technologies. Qiu et al. (2020) focus on the early months of the pandemic. They provide empirical evidence on the transmission of coronavirus cases across cities in China between January and February. They estimate how the number of new daily cases in a city is affected by the number of cases that occurred in nearby cities and in Wuhan, over the previous 2 weeks. They show that social distancing measures reduced the spread of the virus, whereas population flows out of Wuhan increased the risk of transmission. My paper stresses the importance of modeling cross-country interrelationships to understand the evolution of the next phase of the pandemic. A recent work by Zimmermann et al. (2020) shares a similar goal. They find that countries that are more globalized are affected by the pandemic earlier and to a larger extent. Therefore, they discuss how early measures that temporarily reduce inter-country mobility would be beneficial. Outside of the recent COVID-19 literature, my paper also provides a contribution to the literature on GVAR models (see Chudik and Pesaran 2011, for a survey). Most papers in the literature consider macroeconomic applications and study the global spillovers of policy and other shocks (e.g., Pesaran et al. 2004; Chudik and Fratzscher 2011; Dees et al. 2007). Others have studied interdependencies in housing markets (Holly et al. 2011), firm-level returns (Smith and Yamagata 2011), and a variety of other applications (Di Mauro and Pesaran 2013; Pesaran et al. 2009). The effect of foreign variables is usually assumed to depend on trade balances across countries. My framework, instead, introduces a different connectivity matrix, based on social networks, which can be promising for a different set of applications. Therefore, my paper is also connected to recent papers that propose the use of Facebook connections to measure social networks across locations (Bailey et al. 2018). Finally, I measure risk perceptions and fears of unemployment using Google Trends data. This approach has become more and more popular and is now exploited in different fields to measure people’s attention (Da et al. 2011), in forecasting and nowcasting economic variables (see the various examples discussed in Choi and Varian 2012), and to track the spread of diseases (e.g., Ginsberg et al. 2009; Brownstein et al. 2009) in the absence of easily observable private information. Askitas and Zimmermann (2015) discuss how Internet data can be useful for empirical research in a variety of social science applications and, in particular, for research about human resource issues (Askitas and Zimmermann (2009) and Simionescu and Zimmermann (2017) provide evidence directly related to the unemployment rate).",90

The disease, which was later labeled COVID-19, remained confined to China for several weeks. Starting in January 2020, the epidemic spreads outside China, first in Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, favored by an outflow of travelers during the Chinese Spring Festival (Milani 2021; Qiu et al. 2020). Concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. According to the official data released by the WHO, 1,056,157 cases were confirmed around the world by 4 April 2020, causing the death of 57,130 individuals (or 5.5% of confirmed cases). With more than 583,000 cases, Europe was the hardest hit continent at the time. Among European countries, Italy registered both the highest number of cases (almost 120,000) and the highest number of deaths (almost 15,000). Since then, the situation has worsened, reaching 13 million cases in the world and about 600,000 deaths (or about 4.5% of cases) as of mid-July 2020; Europe and Italy in particular are still among the most affected regions. The first case of COVID-19 in Italy was registered in Lombardia on 20 February 2020 and spread rapidly across the Northern Italian regions. With these scary numbers at hand, in Italy, a huge debate started concerning the number of deaths, the number of infections, and mortality rates from COVID-19 (Bonacini et al. 2021). This paper contributes to the debate, seeking to estimate these quantities early on for Lombardia. These quantities are important for epidemiologists to identify possible directions of research towards a cure and for policy makers who monitor the number of deaths from and cases of COVID-19 to make decisions about lockdowns—a policy introduced in Italy, like in many other countries, to suppress and reverse the growth trajectories of the virus (Qiu et al. 2020; Zimmermann et al. 2020). As the Italian Government maintains the power to make the rules about lockdowns more or less stringent, the results of this paper may help the government make better-informed decisions. To provide a continuous update of the COVID-19 situation, the Italian Civil Protection Department (Protezione Civile) started publishing daily data at the regional level on deaths, cases, and swabs. Based on these updates, many argued that there was something special about Lombardia, whose mortality rate was as high as almost 20%; for comparison, the mortality rate from the “natural experiment” among the Diamond Princess passengers was 1.5 %.Footnote 1 In fact, regardless of the external validity of the Diamond Princess experiment (Heckman 1996), the data from Protezione Civile are not appropriate for shedding light on COVID-19 because they are incomplete. For example, individuals who died from COVID-19 but who were never tested are not included in the sample of Protezione Civile, nor are they classified with the specific COVID-19 code in official statistics (WHO 2020): as a consequence, the number of deaths from COVID-19 provided by Protezione Civile underestimates the true deaths from the infection. By the same token, asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals who are not tested are not considered infected from COVID-19. Given the tiny fraction of the population tested, the number of individuals suffering from COVID-19 provided by Protezione Civile vastly underestimates the real number. It follows that the mortality rate from COVID-19 (i.e., the ratio between deaths from and patients suffering from COVID-19, both of which are downward biased) will in general be biased. To overcome the limitations of Protezione Civile data, in April 2020, the Italian Statistical Institute (Istat) began publishing the number of daily deaths in Italian municipalities between 2015 and 2020. So far, five waves have been released. As the collection of demographic data usually takes 4 months (Istat 2020), during the first two releases of the data, municipalities were selected on the basis of the observed deaths in 2020, and therefore, the observed municipalities did not represent a random draw of all Italian municipalities. Although Istat (2020) clearly emphasized the possible bias from the selected sample (Heckman 1979), several commentators employed the data from the selected sample to learn about the total population (see Rettore and Tonini 2020 for a review): the COVID-19 mortality in observed municipalities was used to predict the COVID-19 mortality in unobserved municipalities (Colombo and Impicciatore 2020; Modi et al. 2020), so as to obtain the COVID-19 mortality in Italy. For the third release of the data, Istat made an extraordinary effort to publish data on all the municipalities. The main scope of this paper is to overcome the limitations of the administrative data, which are then used to obtain the correct number of deaths from, the incidence of, and the mortality rate from COVID-19 during March 2020 in Lombardia. The main theoretical argument of this paper is that the generalization of the results from the observed sample to the whole population is not recommended because of the (potential) bias that the selection of the sample might introduce. In order to learn about the population, a correction is required. To this aim, rather than using standard approaches that allow point identification, I partially identify the outcomes of interest (Manski 1990) while taking into account the selection mechanism (Horowitz and Manski 2000). Partial identification combines assumptions with the data to deliver a set of admissible values or bounds. Stronger assumptions yield stronger conclusions but decrease the credibility of the inference (Manski 2011). Given the limited knowledge about COVID-19, a distinctive feature of my approach is that I am very cautious about imposing assumptions. I start with assumptions based on definitions, and then I introduce mild assumptions (whose validity can be supported) that nonetheless have relevant identification power (i.e., narrow the bounds by much). As for mortality data from Istat, I begin with the second release, which is characterized by a non-random selection of municipalities, and check all the results using the release that contains all the municipalities. This gives the unique opportunity to appreciate the relevance of set identification with respect to the number of deaths, a key component of the mortality rate from COVID-19. The exercise is important because the challenges faced by Istat are common to other national Statistical Institutes (NSI) around the European Union (EU) and the solution proposed in this paper may also be adapted to other contexts. The methodologies of this paper might thus be of general interest. To the best of my knowledge, only three papers adopt set identification to study Covid-19: Manski and Molinari (2020), Manski (2020), and Manski and Tetenov (2020). This paper contributes to that literature by adopting a population-level perspective, which thus admits different assumptions than an individual-level perspective, and allows me to answer related, but different, questions. In Lombardia, the Italian region that was hit the hardest by COVID-19, there were between 10,000 and 18,500 more deaths during March 2020 compared with the same period over 2015–2019, on average. A striking result is that the conclusions drawn from the standard approach, based on point identification, are rejected by the bounds introduced in this paper. The most narrow bounds of mortality rate in Lombardia are between 0.1 and 7.5%—including also asymptomatic individuals—much smaller than the 17.5% estimated with Protezione Civile data. One should be cautious when concluding that there is something special in the region (Odone et al. 2020; Favero 2020). It is therefore important that researchers carefully consider what they can learn when available data are combined with credible assumptions: amid the uncertainty about COVID-19, imposing strong assumptions may lead to wrong conclusions.",19

Decisions on implementing, stopping, or renewing restrictive measures require quick and reliable information about infection trends and the impact of already implemented measures. At the same time, however, time is needed before the effects of particular measures can be observed, and there is a delay from contagion until the moment when it appears as a confirmed case in official statistics, i.e., the detection delay. In addition, people may react to the virus and anticipate social distance restrictions (using, e.g., media reports, the internet, and their own observations). All of these factors complicate the accurate identification of changes in the pattern of contagion. We propose a machine learning procedure to identify structural breaks in pandemic dynamics induced by lockdowns using regional data. With an iterative procedure based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), we select the best model that gives us the relative impact of each lockdown measure and the date when the corresponding structural breaks are recorded in the data. We move in the same direction as Casella (2020) and Dehning et al. (2020), who calibrate a detection delay in epidemic models. Our model is not epidemic but involves a theoretical, data-driven approach that allows avoiding any prior assumptions about the number and time distribution of the structural breaks. Thus, we neither assume, ex ante, that all lockdowns are effective nor do we exclude further structural breaks. The lack of restrictions also allows coping with possible announcement effects that may reduce the final detection delayFootnote 1. Moreover, we do not need to assume that each measure has the same delay. This is important since, as shown in our analysis, delays vary consistently from one lockdown to another. We consider the case of Italy, the first non-Asian country where COVID-19 resulted in a large number of deaths. Three national lockdowns were implemented: the closure of schools (including universities), the main lockdown, and the shutdown of non-essential economic activities. According to our results, the first lockdown started to effectively slow the daily growth of COVID-19 cases 17 days after its introduction, and the detection delay in the structural break determined by the second lockdown was even larger (19 days). In addition, we highlight that the school closure had a greater impact despite the relatively weaker prescriptions. This may confirm that, in particular in the case of an unprepared country, this first measure also has an announcement effect, making people adopt less risky behaviors beyond the official prescriptions. In contrast, the last lockdown was hardly effective. After discussing these results, we use the interaction terms analysis to inspect some side effects of the specific lockdowns across the Italian territory. Finally, we show that the proposed machine learning procedure can also be used in a real-time methodology to promptly detect any changes in the outbreak pattern. In this case, the structural breaks predicted with shorter series are the same, and they can be correctly identified from the first day after they occurred, with the exception of the third and least effective lockdown. This evidence reveals that important policy implications can emerge from procedures like the one we developed, since the first lockdown’s effects on the spread of COVID-19 could have been detected at the beginning of the political debate on the possible implementation of the business lockdown. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains a review of the recent literature related to our analysis, while Section 3 briefly describes the Italian case (features and timing of the lockdowns) and provides some descriptive evidence. Section 4 presents the econometric strategy. The following four sections present the results. Section 5 shows the results of the machine learning procedure that allows determining the detection delays. Section 6 analyzes the coefficients of the best model selected, while in Section 7 we include some interactions with space-variant variables in the structural break model to assess for lockdown-specific features. Section 8 provides an ex post validation of model sensitivity. The last section offers some concluding remarks. Robustness checks are reported in the Appendix together with a description of the data.",40

In order to limit the number of deaths and hospitalisations due to the novel coronavirus, most governments in developed countries decided to suspend many economic activities and restrict people’s freedom of mobility (Brodeur et al. 2020a, b; Qiu et al. 2020). In this context, the opportunity to work from home (WFH) became of great importance (Acemoglu et al. 2020) since it allows employees to continue working and thus receiving wages, employers to keep producing services and revenues, and overall limits infection spread risk and pandemic recessive impacts. Recent estimates for the USA show that remote workers have quadrupled to 50% of US workforce (Brynjolfsson et al. 2020). Due to uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and future contagion waves, the role of WFH in the labour market is further emphasised by the fact that it might become a traditional (rather than unconventional) way of working in many economic sectors. According to Alon et al. (2020, p. 17), ‘Many businesses are currently adopting work-from-home and telecommuting options at a wide scale for the first time. It is likely that some of these changes persist, leading to more workplace flexibility in the future’. Also, Baert et al. (2020b) recently found that the great majority of the employees believe that teleworking (85%) and digital conferencing (81%) will continue after the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Facebook and a number of other companies, especially those dealing with information technology (IT), have already decided they will allow many employees to work from home permanently.Footnote 1 Because of WFH’s sudden prominence and growth, several studies recently investigated the WFH phenomenon, especially with the objective of identifying the number of jobs that can be done remotely (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020; Dingel and Neiman 2020; Koren and Peto 2020; Leibovici et al. 2020; Mongey et al. 2020). However, the literature neglects potential effects of WFH along the wage distribution and on income inequality in general. As we know, the causes of inequalities are heterogeneous and numerous, and these causes have been growing in prominence in policymakers’ debates because inequality has increased in Western countries over the last decades (Atkison 2015; Beckfield 2019). To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first to show how a future increase in WFH would be related to changes in labour income levels and inequality, through the influence function regression method proposed by Firpo et al. (2009). In particular, we want to understand to what extent an increase in the number of employees who have the opportunity to WFH (or at least their professions are more likely to be performed from home) would influence the wage distribution under the hypothesis that this WFH feasibility shift is long lasting (as it seems it will happen because of the COVID-19 outbreak and its aftermath). Considering baseline feasibility levels across Italian employees as the counterfactual scenario, the Firpo et al.’s (2009) methodology allows us to estimate potential influences of this ‘innovation’ on labour income inequality moving toward a hypothetical distribution where shares of employees are swapped with others according to the reported WFH feasibility level. With respect to the (conventional) quantile regression method developed by Koenker and Bassett (1978), this methodology has also the merit of estimating the effects on a labour income distribution that is not conditioned by the set of covariates included in the model (Fortin et al. 2011). To do that, we focus on Italy as an interesting case study because it was one of the countries most affected by the novel coronavirus and the first Western country to adopt a lockdown of economic activities (on 11 March). Barbieri et al. (2020) estimated that at least 3 million employees (i.e. about 13% of the total) started to WFH because of lockdown measures, and another large number started even earlier due to the closure of schools and universities on 5 March (more details in Bonacini et al. 2021). Moreover, Italy was the European country with the lowest share of teleworkers before the crisis (Eurofound and ILO 2017) and, as a result of the pandemic, it had to face a massive increase in WFH in a very short time without both precise legislation and adequate policies. Now that the country is steadily increasing the share of WFH, it is crucial to understand the possible effects on the labour market of such a structural change. Our analysis relies on a uniquely detailed dataset relying on the merge of two sample surveys. The first one is the Survey on Labour Participation and Unemployment (INAPP-PLUS) for the year 2018, which contains information on incomes, skills, education level, and employment conditions of working-age Italians. The second sample survey is the Italian Survey of Professions (ICP) for the year 2013, which represents an Italian equivalent of the much more famous US Occupational Information Network (O*NET). ICP provides detailed information on the task-content of occupations at the 5-digit ISCO classification level and allows to calculate the WFH index recently proposed by Barbieri et al. (2020). Different from other studies that analyse working from home in Italy through an elaborated matching between US O*NET data and Italian labour market information (e.g. Boeri et al. 2020), we use ICP data to avoid potential matching biases. In fact, being based on professions performed in the Italian labour market, ICP has the key advantage of being probably more able than the US O*NET to capture specific features (e.g. tasks, skills required, workplace characteristics) of the Italian economy. To provide further insights on the relationship between a WFH shift and labour income inequality, we also estimate heterogeneous effects by gender, age group, and education level. The latter is particularly interesting because it allows us to test whether an increase in WFH among high-skilled and educated employees may be related to Skill Biased Technological Change (SBTC) (Acemoglu 2002; Autor et al. 2003). In this context, the existing complementarity between new technologies and high-paid professions may be a key factor in wage polarisation, which in turn is the key variable to understand, predict, and manage some of the possible long-run consequences of COVID-19 in terms of working modality changes. Moreover, we merge our dataset with one provided by the Italian Civil Protection Department (2020) on COVID-19 infection spread at the provincial level (reference period 24 February–5 May 2020) to investigate whether this potential increase in WFH would benefit more those areas of the country that have been affected the most by the novel coronavirus and thus will suffer worse economic consequences. Finally, this study has relevant policy implications for tackling inequalities that will arise in the labour market because of the recent pandemic and the consequent (probably) increase in WFH. Our results are based on Italian data, but they may be useful to policymakers in other developed countries as well and, in general, where COVID-19 has forced governments to rethink production processes with a more intense and stable use of WFH. The rest of the article is structured as follows. The next section presents the literature review on the topic and a brief chronicle of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Section 3 describes the datasets, discusses the definition of our variables of interest, and provides some descriptive statistics, while Sect. 4 reports the econometric methodology. Sections 5 and 6 present results and robustness checks. Section 7 concludes with some policy implications.",190

Niaz Asadullah,Elisabetta De Cao,Zahra Siddique,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Gender disparities in outcomes favouring men within developing countries are generally larger than in the developed world (Jayachandran 2015). Similar disparities also often exist in attitudes towards gender equality (see, for instance, Asadullah and Wahhaj 2019; Borrell-Porta et al. 2019). Such attitudes, including attitudes supporting domestic violence and child marriage, can have important effects on behaviours, as well as play a prominent role in explaining observed gender disparities in outcomes. For instance, Dhar et al. (2016) find that parents’ discriminatory attitudes reduce daughters’ aspirations to pursue schooling beyond secondary school in India. Maertens (2013) finds that parents’ perceptions of ideal age at marriage have an adverse impact on daughter’s schooling. Despite the important role that attitudes play in explaining behaviours and outcomes, much of the existing empirical literature relies on survey-based direct questions eliciting attitudes that are likely to suffer from measurement error leading to biased estimates. Our study addresses this limitation by making use of list experiments that enable us to elicit attitudes regarding gender roles and behaviours in a better way. One aspect of their lives in which women face a disadvantage is as victims of violence. Women in South Asia face various forms of violence throughout their lifetimes, from early childhood to old age (Solotaroff and Pande 2014). Surprisingly, some of the global hotspots for child marriage and violence against women are also places that have seen considerable progress in poverty reduction and women’s economic participation. One such developing country setting is Bangladesh, where female labor force participation for women age 15+ increased from 23% in 1990 to 33% in 2017.Footnote 1 While the incidence of child marriage has fallen in recent decades, it remained the case that approximately 38% of women in Bangladesh were married by the time they were 15 years of age and 74.7% were married by the time they were 18 years of age in 2014. Support for intimate partner violence is relatively high among both young and old women in Bangladesh and has remained unchanged in recent decades despite improvements in female labor force participation (see Appendix 1 for more details). In 2014, 28.3% of Bangladeshi women agreed that a husband is justified in beating his wife for one of the following reasons: if the wife burns the food, if she argues with the husband, if she goes out without telling him, if she neglects the children or if she refuses to have sexual intercourse with him.Footnote 2 Finally, 22.4% of ever married Bangladeshi women report being a victim of physical or sexual violence by their husband/partner in the last 12 months.Footnote 3 These kinds of disparities, which disproportionately put women at a disadvantage within the household compared with men, are likely to have serious implications for women’s welfare. The objective of this paper is to measure attitudes towards intimate partner violence and child marriage among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. We do this by using standard survey questions (direct questions) as well as methods to elicit responses to sensitive survey questions (list experiments, see “Section 2” for a description and examples). We find that the method of measurement matters when eliciting responses to sensitive questions. Standard direct survey questions under-estimate support for socially harmful practices—few adolescent girls in the study accept the practice of intimate partner violence (5%) or child marriage (2%) when asked directly. List experiments reveal substantially higher support for both intimate partner violence (30%) and child marriage (24%). Adolescent girls with lower levels of education under-report their support for child marriage by 16 percentage points compared with adolescent girls with higher education. We also find that girls randomly exposed to village level adolescent clubs set up by the Bangladeshi non-government organization BRAC, which educated them on marital rights and laws, under-report their support for intimate partner violence in comparison with non-exposed adolescent girls. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to use list experiment methods to elicit attitudes towards child marriage as well as domestic violence, and has greater external validity than similar empirical investigations. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. “Section 2” provides a literature review and lists the contributions this paper makes to the literature. “Section 3” describes the background of our study and list experiment that generated the data we use in this paper. “Section 4” lays out the empirical analysis that we perform on the data as well as including a discussion of our findings, while “Section 5” concludes.",5

Age and subjective well-being in 145 countries,April 2021,David G. Blanchflower,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, I report on the existence of a midlife nadir in well-being. The analysis is conducted mostly at the country level with happiness and life satisfaction variables, although a number of other measures are used that relate to a household’s financial situation and their living standards, satisfaction with local services, and the macro economy. All produce U-shapes in age. Using country-level data, I identify U-shapes in age in 145 advanced and developing countries.Footnote 1 This includes 138 of the 193 member countries of the United Nations. I find this happiness curve (Rauch 2019) for 109 developingFootnote 2 and thirty-six advanced countries based on an analysis where I control for gender, education, marital and labor force status, and time. I use data from fourteen different survey series. I use these data to estimate 477 separate country-level estimates that reach a minimum, on average, at age 48.3.Footnote 3 There are 241 estimates from developed countries with an average minimum at age 46.7 and 236 estimates from developing countries with an average minimum at 49.9. I examine cross-section time series data at the country level rather than examining panel data. Longitudinal data files that have a long run of years are restricted to the UK (BHPS and NCDS), Germany (GSOEP), and Australia (HILDA). In part, the concern with these surveys is non-random attrition bias and hence missing values over time with the least happy dropping out or even dying, which may well introduce measurement error. There is a small literature looking at age effects using panel data that I interpret as largely supportive of U-shapes, although there are some technical issues that must be considered. My interest is to see whether there is evidence of a midlife zenith in other countries besides the UK, Germany, and Australia. I examine the importance of cohort effects to determine if younger and older age cohorts are different from those in the middle and find out that they are not. I examine the data over time and adjust for cohort effects and find remarkable consistency in the findings. I find that introducing cohort effects in the samples where I have a long time series, namely, the EU Commission’s Eurobarometer series pre (1973–2002) and post the Great Recession (2009–2019), has little impact on the results. I find the minima in Europe have risen over time, from around age 40 in 1975 to over 50 in the most recent data. I also address the issue of possible differential response rates among older people, along with the concern that happy people live longer. To minimize that concern, I focus my analysis on people from early adulthood, which is usually age 18 but in some samples is as low as 15, to under the age of 70. I exclude older people. It makes sense to look at as many countries as possible given the evidence that in the raw data the USA looks different. In the raw US data, essentially however measured, happiness rises initially to a peak around age 30 and then declines into midlife and then rises again after age 70. This apparent M-shape disappears once controls are included and a well-defined U-shape appears. It also disappears when the sample is split into separate married and unmarried samples. These patterns are not found elsewhere in the world. This has led to a debate in the USA especially about the importance of including control variables, although less so outside the USA where it matters little. In other countries, the U-shape generally appears whether controls are included or not, although the point at which the function reaches a minimum may differ. It is also worth pursuing the possibility that the U-shape doesn’t apply to poorer countries, where residents have shorter life expectancies. Blanchflower and Oswald (2008a) find a U-shape for 39 developing countries in World Values Survey sweeps 1–4Footnote 4 that averages out at a minimum around age 43 when including control variables. In this paper, I find there are U-shapes in age in developing countries with minima similar to those in advanced countries regardless of how well-being is measured. I examine the presence or not of U-shapes with and without controls in the USA and find the evidence is much stronger with controls. I then turn to examining data for the UK and 36 European countries and find there is evidence of a U-shape whether controls are included or not, with very little difference in the age minima. I then proceed to examine a series of multi-country data files. It is striking that the same finding holds across so many countries. The U-shape can be found in multiple data files and does not depend on what question is asked or how the responses are coded. I document clear patterns in the data. This paper is the mirror image of Blanchflower (2020b) that examined unhappiness data and finds comparable evidence using twenty different measures for an unhappiness curve that maximized with controls at age 49 compared with a zenith of happiness estimated in this paper at age 48.",110

Nations racing to slow the spread of the virus have imposed lockdowns and social distancing measures (Qiu et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021), which have shuttered businesses, forced people out of work, and decimated incomes. The World Bank (2020) projects that the global economy will contract by 5.2% in 2020, experiencing “the deepest global recession in eight decades, despite unprecedented policy support.” While aspects of the macroeconomic consequences have been carefully considered (Milani 2021), we know much less about the extent to which the crisis is affecting individuals’ financial wellbeing or how people are coping financially. Job and earnings losses are undoubtedly harmful to financial wellbeing, but the size of the impacts is uncertain because myriad factors, including people’s financial reserves and financial behaviour, ability to shift expenses, government assistance, and social resources, provide ways of mitigating the effects. In this paper, we investigate how labour market shocks, as a direct result of the implemented social distancing and lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, are associated with the perceived financial wellbeingFootnote 1 of people living in Australia. We are specifically interested in the relationship with financial wellbeing, rather than income alone. Financial wellbeing can range widely within income levels and is arguably a more direct measure of people’s enjoyment of their income, their consumption, and their financial worries and constraints. In comparison to focusing on income, financial wellbeing gives us a holistic view of the true pressures felt by all individuals across the income and wealth distribution during the pandemic. Financial wellbeing as a validated multi-item empirical measure is a relatively new development. Our measure is defined in terms of the extent to which individuals feel that they are able to meet their financial obligations, have the financial freedom to enjoy additional consumption and other fulfilling choices, control rather than be controlled by their finances, and have security and be free from financial anxiety now, in the future, and under possible adverse circumstances. Our validated measure captures functional, situational, and temporal components, and while it is related to objective financial indicators, it is a distinct concept, as shown in Comerton-Forde et al. (2018, 2020). It is positively correlated with income but distinct in that it is a multi-faceted measure that captures key elements such as uncertainty and future security, which income would miss. It is also superior to single-item financial satisfaction measures, which are loosely framed and not expressed in terms of specific financial outcomes, thereby making comparisons across groups very difficult. Our chosen financial wellbeing measure has been rigorously tested and validated, in contrast to most other existing financial wellbeing measures.Footnote 2 As one of the first studies of its kind, we use unique survey data collected during the intense period of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia between April 20 and July 7 2020. The survey contained the validated financial wellbeing scale as well as a set of demographic information, and in particular questions around individuals’ labour market experience during the pandemic. This allows us to study people’s financial wellbeing associated with labour market shocks following from COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. A range of studies have been conducted on how COVID-19 has affected different outcomes. For example, Brodeur et al. (2020) explored the relationship to mental health; Fetzer et al. (2020) looked at changes in economic anxiety; Belot et al. (2020) considered the wealth implications of the pandemic; Botha and de New (2020) examine the relationship to (Likert 0–10 scale) life satisfaction and its satisfaction subdomains: health, family life, family health, health services, and finances. The study most relevant to this paper is Biddle et al. (2020a, b), which also used Australian survey data. Using ANUpoll data from April 14 to 27, 2020 and comparing those responses to the same individuals interviewed in the ANUpoll in January and February 2020 (Biddle et al. 2020a) and later in August 2020 (Biddle et al. 2020b), the researchers considered the relationship of COVID-19 to factors such as employment, labour supply, life satisfaction, income, financial distress, and mental health. Our study differs from Biddle et al. (2020a, b) in that we examine specifically financial wellbeing as an outcome and its association with COVID-19-related labour market shocks. Our paper also contributes to the other existing literature on COVID-19 mentioned previously by being the first to investigate how individual perceived financial wellbeing is associated with COVID-19 labour market shocks. We conceptualise the determinants of financial wellbeing through a rational-choice lifecycle framework in which people make current financial decisions, including spending, bill-paying, saving, borrowing, investing, and insuring, to maximise their current and expected future utility. In each period of their lives, people have economic resources that come from their earnings, investment income, wealth, and other sources and that give them scope to undertake financial behaviours. Previous financial behaviours, such as saving or borrowing, add to or diminish the current set of resources. Similarly, current financial behaviours affect future resources and opportunities. For working-age people, current and expected future earnings are a key resource for producing financial wellbeing. In this framework, negative involuntary labour market shocks, such as unemployment, reduced work hours, and lower wages, are expected to be related to financial wellbeing through several channels. First, negative labour market outcomes reduce current and permanent income, and thus decrease the resources that are available to achieve financial wellbeing. Previous research has found that higher levels of income and wealth are associated with greater financial satisfaction (Bonke and Browning 2009; Brown and Gray 2016), fewer financial hardships (Shim et al. 2009), and increased financial wellbeing (Comerton-Forde et al. 2020). Second, negative labour market shocks could reduce people’s credit ratings and borrowing ability, which would reduce the scope for financial behaviour and impact financial wellbeing (French 2018). Third, shocks would increase the volatility and uncertainty of people’s resources and make their finances more difficult to manage. Fourth, labour market shocks could have adverse psychological effects (Biddle et al. 2020a), which might influence financial wellbeing, such as through loss of control (Vlaev and Elliott 2014) and increased stress related to money management as well as increased feelings of expected financial insecurity in the future (Netemeyer et al. 2018). Consistent with these mechanisms, research has found direct associations between unemployment and several financial outcomes, including financial satisfaction (Bonke and Browning 2009; Brown and Gray 2016; Simona-Moussa and Ravazzini 2019), difficulties managing financially (French 2018), and financial hardships (Scutella and Wooden 2004). Only two studies have investigated the effects of adverse labour market outcomes using comprehensive, summative measures of financial wellbeing. Brenner et al. (2020) found a negative association between unemployment and the U.S. Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) scale of financial wellbeing (CFPB 2017), and Comerton-Forde et al. (2020) found a similar relationship using the Melbourne Institute-Commonwealth Bank of Australia Reported Financial Wellbeing Scale (Comerton-Forde et al. 2018). However, both of these studies examined joblessness in the context of a robust economy and not in the midst of a global crisis. Our study finds that labour market shocks directly related to COVID-19 are associated with substantial and significant declines in financial wellbeing, not just on average, but in particular at the lower end of the financial wellbeing distribution. Distribution regressions suggest large potential gains in financial wellbeing equality if one were to remove counterfactually the negative associations of COVID-19 labour market shocks across the financial wellbeing distribution. Our findings provide a first measure of the significant negative relationship between labour market shocks triggered by the COVID-19 crisis and financial wellbeing. More than just affecting people’s employment and incomes, the COVID-19 economic shocks are associated with people’s ability to enjoy their financial freedom, their consumption, their financial security and stability, and their tranquillity about future outcomes. Perhaps more importantly, we show these labour market shocks are disproportionately felt by people at the lower end of the financial wellbeing distribution. Our results thus contribute to a growing international literature documenting the nature of the COVID-19 crisis across societal outcomes and complements existing evidence on its generally (but not universally) regressive associations with employment, income, and industrial activity. In the Australian context, much has been and is being done by the government to stave off the worst of the economic downfall, and there are several targeted labour market programs. However, as we find negative associations between the labour market shocks and financial wellbeing in a high-income country such as Australia with significant temporary government transfers during the pandemic, it seems that bolstering income alone might not be sufficient, as it likely cannot eliminate the uncertainties felt by individuals about their future financial situations and the pressures related to having to adjust spending and wealth portfolios to cope with new financial pressures now and in the future. Financial outreach programs targeted at individuals experiencing a labour market shock during the pandemic to help manage their finances during the crisis could have large returns in improving financial wellbeing, especially at the lower end of the distribution.",32

Papageorge,Matthew V. Zahn,Egon Tripodi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The spread of illness is largely influenced by human behavior. In the presence of strong externalities, a concern is that individual behavior may not align with socially optimal outcomes (Posner and Tomas J. P. 1993). This is especially salient in contexts where the costs of protective behaviors, i.e., behaviors that limit the spread of illness, are unevenly distributed across socio-demographic groups (Pampel et al. 2010). For instance, in the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals who face a relatively low risk of serious illness, but who are economically vulnerable (e.g., lacking comfortable housing, the ability to work from home) may not follow recommendations or directives to engage in protective behaviors, such as wearing a mask or social distancing. This potentially puts high-risk groups in danger of infection and prolongs the pandemic. The socially optimal amount of protective behaviors—the levels that balance public health concerns with individual burdens and aggregate economic costs—are not yet fully understood, and are unlikely to be for some time due to uncertainty about the virus and about which behaviors most effectively prevent its spread (Manski 2020). Compounding this uncertainty, we do not yet understand the full extent of the economic and social costs of the pandemic, ranging from job losses, shuttered businesses, and gaps in schooling, to violence and addiction, among others (Fairlie et al. 2020; Alon et al. 2020; Mongey et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020; Viner et al. 2020). Nevertheless, understanding what factors affect individuals’ incentives to engage in protective behaviors will be of critical importance as we develop effective and humane policy, evaluate the current epidemic, make plans to emerge from it, and begin to prepare for future pandemics. This paper examines factors predicting adoption of individual self-protecting behaviors at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA. We focus on the USA since the country lacks a consistent national policy on Covid-related behaviors, leading to a variety of different state-level policy responses and individual-level behavior changes (Adolph et al. 2020; Béland et al. 2020). Moreover, there is variation in local infection rates at a given point in time (Allcott et al. 2020b; Manski and Molinari 2020) along with vast socioeconomic inequality across US citizens. Together, these features of the US context allow us to examine how individuals with different characteristics and facing different policy environments respond to a pandemic. Moreover, the lessons we learn extend beyond the USA. For example, economic inequality—and, potentially, resulting variation in the costs of engaging in self-protective behaviors during an infectious disease pandemic—is present in other countries.Footnote 1 Indeed, non-compliance with self-protective measures is not unique to the USA. Starting in the Fall of 2020, Europe has experienced a “second wave” of the Covid-19 pandemic, driven in part by people opting to not comply with local public health measures (WHO 2020). Our study uses unique survey data collected during the third week of April 2020 and detailed in Belot et al. (2020b). The data set follows roughly 6000 individuals in 6 different countries and includes about 1000 individuals from the US, who are the focus on this study. Roughly 250 individuals come from each of four US states: California, Florida, New York and Texas. The specific factors we study include income, socio-demographic variables (e.g., race and gender), pre-pandemic health characteristics, job and income losses due to the pandemic, work arrangements (e.g., the ability to tele-work) and housing quality (e.g., access to outside space at home), along with beliefs and perceptions about the pandemic (e.g., whether individuals perceive social distancing to be an effective measure and the consequences of infection). We study how these factors relate to three measures of behavior change from before the pandemic to the point of data collection. In particular, respondents were asked whether they changed any behavior at all in response to the pandemic; whether they increased social distancing, which includes avoiding public spaces, running fewer errands and visiting friends and family less often; and whether they increased hand washing or mask wearing. The data have information on a host of additional self-protective behaviors (and similar income gradients emerge when we examine them). We chose to focus on these three measures because they illustrate the wide range of possible self-protective behaviors: the first is very broad, including any change in behavior at all; the second is a relatively high-cost activity; and the third is a relatively low-cost activity.Footnote 2 We begin by documenting a striking and robust pattern apparent in the data: higher income is associated with larger increases in self-protective behaviors. Figure 1 illustrates this relationship for the three aforementioned behaviors for the US sample. Note, the figure plots changes rather than levels. Using these measures, we show that on average individuals in the fifth income quintile (quintile mean $233,895) are between 13 and 19 percentage points (16–54%) more likely to increase their self-protective behaviors compared to individuals in the first income quintile (quintile mean $13,775).Footnote 3 For each of these behaviors, the difference between the first and fifth income quintile is statistically significant at the 1% level. It is worth noting that some of the stronger income differences in the figure appear when we compare low versus middle and high income. For example, hand washing and mask wearing changes are larger for middle versus low-income individuals, but are not larger for high- versus middle-income individuals. While increases in social distancing appear to increase in magnitude across the income distribution, we cannot reject that individuals in third, fourth and fifth quintiles increase the behavior the same amount. For changes in any behavior, we find significant rises across the income distribution. These finding suggest that higher income is generally associated with larger increases in self-protective behaviors and, moreover, that some differences are concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution, meaning that low-income individuals may face especially large costs to adopting such behaviors. Our subsequent analysis aims to shed light on these relationships by assessing which specific factors related to income help to explain differences in behavior change.
 Probability of changes in self-protective behaviors by income quintile: This figure shows the proportion of US respondents within a household income quintile that reports changes in any self-protective behaviors; reports increased social distancing; and increased hand washing-mask wearing. We also plot the estimated trend relating each changed behavior to income quintiles. The gray area is the associated 95% confidence interval In particular, our main analysis explores these relationships between income, the pandemic and self-protective behaviors in two ways. First, we ask how income relates to initial consequences of the pandemic along with other factors that could affect social distancing and other self-protective behaviors. We illustrate the burdens lower income respondents face, ranging from increased chances of job and income losses due to the pandemic to limited access to remote work or to open air space at their residences. Taken together, this means that we would expect these people to have a harder time adopting social distancing behaviors, which may prolong the pandemic. Next, we examine which socio-demographic characteristics predict self-protecting behaviors. To do so, we estimate a series of linear probability models where a change in self-protective behaviors is the outcome variable and the predictor variables include income along with different sets of additional variables, culminating in a final specification that includes income along with all variables. Several patterns emerge. Work arrangements and housing characteristics, particularly transitioning to tele-working and access to outside space at home, are associated with adopting more self-protecting behaviors. We also find that income losses due to the pandemic are associated with larger increases in the behaviors that we examine. Surprisingly, we find no meaningful patterns between pre-existing health conditions and increases in self-protective actions. We also show that males and respondents from Florida and Texas are less likely to engage in self-protective behaviors compared to females and respondents from California and New York, respectively. Moreover, beliefs about the effectiveness of social distancing along with perceived benefits (e.g., more time spent with family) correlate with larger increases in self-protective behaviors, though less so for lower income groups, which we discuss below. Finally, we demonstrate that the income gradient is only partially explained by the inclusion of these variables. The size of the income coefficient estimates are fairly stable across specifications where different sets of controls are included. These findings suggest that while income is an important predictor of behavior change, this relationship is only partly explained by the other factors we examine. There are likely to be other variables not captured by our data that help to further explain why income matters so much in the adoption of self-protecting behaviors. Broadly, our findings are consistent with two key ideas. One, the initial economic consequences of the pandemic are particularly harmful to low-income individuals. Two, behaviors that stem from the pandemic could place relatively large burdens on individuals with lower incomes. For example, higher income individuals are more likely to report being able to work from home and more likely to have transitioned to tele-working instead of losing their job. As a result, adoption of self-protective behaviors, such as social distancing, are more practical, comfortable and feasible for people with more income, which is evident in the behavior changes depicted in Fig. 1. Effective and sustainable pandemic policy should be based not on what policymakers wish individuals would do, but what they expect them to do. To the extent that socioeconomic status helps to predict behavior, it should play a role in the development of policy. Further, to the extent that specific and policy-relevant factors help to explain income gradients, they could shed light on new avenues to mitigate the harm of a pandemic. For example, our results suggest the importance of outside space at home in predicting the adoption of self-protective behaviors. If so, opening parks, which may seem frivolous and unnecessarily risky at first glance, may actually be a prudent policy to prioritize. Doing so could potentially encourage self-protective behaviors by providing outside space to those who lack access to it. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of the existing literature on Covid-19 pandemic and socioeconomic health gradients. In Section 3, we provide a brief history of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA.

On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a coronavirus-type pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began screening at three major US airports on January 20, and the first US coronavirus case was confirmed the following day. On January 23, China made the unprecedented move of quarantining Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The white House announced on January 31 a travel ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to China within the past 14 days. The first US death from the disease occurred on February 29 in Washington State.Footnote 5 The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. That same day the US National Basketball Association suspended all games, and the actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for the virus in Australia. Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, unlocking up to $50 billion dollars in federal funding to combat the spread of the disease, the same day on which several states announced school closures. On March 19, California became the first state to issue a “stay-at-home” order, with exceptions for work and shopping for essential needs. On March 26, Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which provided $2 trillion in aid to businesses, hospitals, and local governments. While no country was unaffected, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the USA particularly hard. The US COVID-19 death toll passed the grim mark of 100,000 on May 28; by September 22, 200,000 American lives had been lost. Measured on a per capita basis, only Brazil, Spain, and Mexico have recorded higher death rates among large countries.Footnote 6 Along with lost lives, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the USA exerted a profound economic impact. Increasing numbers of cases caused changes in consumer behavior, with large drops in consumption of services (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020) leading to an unprecedented increase in unemployment (Chetty et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020). The economic downturn coincided with changing political attitudes about the role of government, with Rees-Jones et al. (2020a) finding deaths and infections associated with increased support for expanding the US safety net. In sharp contrast to most world leaders and to his opponent Joe Biden, Trump sought to downplay the threat of the virus, with limited political success. He began this tactic early in the crisis, and never veered from it. On February 10, Trump claimed, “a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat...” On February 26, as US cases began to appear, he said, “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Again, on April 3, he remarked, “It is going to go away. It is going away.” He continued making similar comments throughout the summer, and in his first remarks after contracting the virus himself in October, he declared, “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”Footnote 7 The tactic did little to help his standing with the electorate. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating fell from a 2020 high of 49% on March 22 to 38% on June 30.Footnote 8 Polls showed nearly 60% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s response to the pandemic, with very little variation in the 5 months leading up to the election.Footnote 9 There are several reasons to believe that the pandemic and the Trump administration’s response were detrimental to Trump’s reelection prospects. The strong disapproval of the president’s handling of the virus suggests that a majority of the public blamed the administration for its failure to curtail its spread. Most importantly, voters likely associate rising local cases and deaths with an increasing threat to the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. In this context, we might expect that the greater the local exposure to risk, the more likely voters are to punish the president by voting for the challenger. Another channel through which COVID-19 may have lead to diminished Trump support is economic. Despite a big rebound in economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate remains well above the historical average. Ominously, rising case numbers in the lead-up to the election portended another wave of hospitalizations and deaths—and the prospect of more localized lockdowns, business closures, and a double-dip recession. Both retrospective and prospective voting frameworks suggest that voters are likely to hold the president accountable for the toll of the virus. For these reasons, we examine whether more severe local outbreaks are associated with weaker support for Trump in 2020, compared to the 2016 presidential election. There is, however, a counter-argument to be made. A possible interpretation of Trump’s strategy in responding to the pandemic is that it was in line with the preferences of his core constituents. Survey data reveal a striking difference in attitudes toward the pandemic between Democratic and Republican voters. According to Gallup, only 25% of Republican respondents are “worried about getting the coronavirus,” whereas this percentage climbs to almost 80% among Democratic respondents.Footnote 10 Similarly, about 60% of Republican respondents are “ready to return to normal activities right now,” whereas a mere 3% of Democratic respondents are ready to resume a normal lifestyle. We see similar differences for questions related to practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. While ideology influences attitudes toward the pandemic in other countries as well, the differences between Democratic and Republican voters in the USA are uniquely large. In short, given the polarization of US politics, voters seem to be experiencing the very same event in very different ways based on their partisan identities. If this is the case, even a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths may not meaningfully reduce support for Trump, especially among his base.",70

According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University, more than 120 million people around the world have been infected and almost 3 million people have died of COVID-19 as of March 30, 2021.Footnote 1 To protect their most vulnerable citizens and to slow the spread of the disease, many governments have imposed strict policy measures, such as social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and local and nationwide lock-downs. While there is evidence that some of these policies have been successful in at least slowing the number of infections (e.g., Chernozhukov et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021), they also have both directly and indirectly affected labor supply and demand, investment, consumption, and other economic variables, taking a heavy toll on economies. The world GDP is projected to have fallen by more than 4% in 2020 (IMF 2020). The projected decline in GDP is even more pronounced for advanced economies. Economic distress caused by the pandemic policy measures has also affected broader aspects of peoples’ lives and well-being (e.g., Arenas-Arroyo et al. 2021; Brodeur et al.2021). Facing such detrimental effects on both theeconomy and society, and with the prospect of widely accessible vaccination still distant — especially for low-income countries — policy makers have been looking for alternative ways of containing the pandemic. Mass testing for COVID-19 has received particular attention as a potential tool for suppressing the pandemic.Footnote 2 Regional and local mass antigen testing has been carried out in several countries, such as the UK, China, South Korea, Austria, Luxembourg, and Slovakia. Evidence on whether and how (repeated) mass testing can work to mitigate pandemics is scant, however. Informing policy makers on the question of whether mass testing can be an effective policy tool to re-open the economy during a pandemic is hence an urgent call. Proponents of mass testing maintain that it is a cost-efficient policy for identifying and quarantining potentially infectious individuals. This direct effect of testing would in turn help reduce the number of cases and the spread of the disease (e.g., Pavelka et al. 2021). If mass testing could accomplish this, costly social-distancing policies could be eased or lifted, schools and the economy could remain open, and far-reaching social and psychological costs could be averted. In contrast, opponents of mass testing argue that it may create a false sense of security and may lead individuals to behave less carefully, as argued by, for example, Mahase (2020). Cheaper rapid antigen (Ag) tests, which are often used in mass testing events, generally have lower sensitivity and specificity compared with the more expensive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, likely leading to higher rates of false negatives and false positives in mass antigen testing. This could undercut the credibility of such testing and anti-COVID-19 measures in general. In contrast to the original intention of mass testing, a larger share of false positive tests would incorrectly confine a correspondingly larger share of workers in quarantine, putting an unjustified pressure on the economy (Pettengill and McAdam 2020). Potentially even more detrimentally, negative test results, whether true or, even worse, false, would likely reduce people’s caution in social contacts and increase risky behavior, leading to an increased spread of the disease. As the relative shares of false and true positives and negatives depend on disease prevalence, so too do the relative strengths of these direct and indirect effects (Dinnes et al. 2021). Specifically, the benefits of testing tend to be smaller and the signals more noisy in low-prevalence, asymptomatic populations, and vice versa (Dinnes et al. 2021). In light of these arguments, the overall effect of mass testing on disease prevalence is an empirical question. From the perspective of effective suppression of pandemics, it is important to know whether repeated mass testing can in practice suppress the pandemic and if so, for how long the potential benefits may last. In this study, we evaluate the impact of repeated mass antigen testing coupled with quarantine measures on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic using epidemiological data from Slovakia. Over two days in autumn 2020, Slovakia was one of the first countries in the world to conduct a countrywide mass testing event using rapid antigen tests. All those who received a positive test result, their household members and self-traced recent contacts (from the past two days), as well as those without a valid negative test, were required to quarantine for ten days. One day after the mass testing event, the government announced that in districts where the share of positive COVID-19 tests was equal to or above 0.7% a second round of mass testing would be conducted. As we argue below, a lot of uncertainty surrounded whether the second round would take place, and if so, what criteria would be used to select districts for testing or whether it would be conducted nationwide. Given these uncertainties and the minimal, one-day difference between the time when the results from the first round became available and the announcement of the selection threshold, we argue that the chosen threshold was ad hoc and ex ante publicly unknown, and as a result, as good as random for the purpose of this study. In our empirical approach, we exploit this unique mass-testing setting in Slovakia to evaluate the potential benefits of repeated mass testing. We compare districts above and below the announced threshold using a difference-in-differences framework.Footnote 3 Our empirical approach requires that districts above and below the threshold would have followed a similar infection trajectory absent repeated mass testing. In light of the discussion about rapid antigen tests above, to be able to identify the impact of repeated mass antigen testing on the spread of the disease, we also need to rule out any dynamic unobservable effects within districts, such as systematically changing differences between districts above and below the threshold in the sensitivity rates of the rapid antigen tests or in the composition of populations participating in testing.Footnote 4 We find that in those districts above the threshold, the measured number of infections fell on average by up to about 30% and the reproduction number, which measures the number of secondary infections per case generated in the population, decreased by about 0.3 two weeks after the second mass testing event, compared to districts below the threshold. Exploring the dynamics behind these effects, our results indicate a maximum reduction in COVID-19 incidence around 15 days after the second mass testing and a reversal to zero afterward. Three weeks after the second round of mass testing all the measured effects disappeared. To investigate the robustness of our results, we conduct a wide range of robustness tests. We show that our results are qualitatively similar when discarding districts further away from the threshold, which arguably might have fundamentally different infection dynamics. In addition, we control for several potentially confounding factors, show that our results are not driven by relatively large districts in terms of population size, and provide support for the assumption that the re-testing threshold was practically as good as random. We make several contributions to the small but rapidly growing literature on the effects of mass antigen testing on the COVID-19 pandemic, which we review in Section 2.Footnote 5 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study systematically evaluating the potential benefits of repeated mass antigen testing, exploiting the unique setting surrounding the mass testing events in Slovakia using a difference-in-differences identification strategy.Footnote 6 Our strategy enhances the external validity of the estimation results while relying on arguably weaker assumptions than model-based evaluation methods (e.g., Atkeson et al. 2020). Our approach also allows the investigation of possibly dynamic effects of repeated mass testing. How long potential benefits of mass testing last is an important parameter in guiding decision makers. This parameter has so far only received limited attention in the empirical literature. The results of this study are of interest for policy makers in light of the question of how mass testing together with strict contact tracing and quarantine measures can help mitigate pandemics. First, we show that repeated mass testing can be an effective policy tool for decreasing the spread of the disease when coupled with an effective quarantine regime of positive cases and their contacts. Second, our results indicate that the mitigating effect is temporary. While we are not able to disentangle to what extent such a dissipation of the effects is driven by people’s behavioral adjustment to testing or test results, the epidemiological properties of the disease, or other channels, this result implies that mass testing would need to be conducted on a regular basis if a sustained mitigation of the pandemic were to be achieved. The paper proceeds by discussing the literature on mass testing and our contribution to it in the next section. We then describe the institutional setting and the mass antigen testing events that took place in Slovakia in the autumn of 2020 in Section 3. The empirical approach as well as the data used are outlined in Section 4. In Section 5, we report and discuss our main estimation results. Section 6 presents various robustness and falsification tests. Section 7 discusses the contribution of this study, its limitations, and concludes.",14
34.0,4.0,Journal of Population Economics,11 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00849-y,COVID-19: a crisis of the female self-employed,October 2021,Daniel Graeber,Alexander S. Kritikos,Johannes Seebauer,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The unprecedented shutdown of businesses in specific industries, social distancing guidelines, and overall insecurity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary halt of major parts of the economy in many countries in 2020, with dire consequences for these economies (Milani 2021). The service sector, which often necessitates physical proximity, was particularly affected (Barbieri et al. 2020). At the same time, the service sector depends more on self-employed individuals than the manufacturing sector, where the vast majority of workers are employees. In particular, self-employed women are more likely to work in service industries than self-employed men: According to the OECD (2017), 91% of self-employed women and 68% of self-employed men in Germany worked in the service sector in 2016. The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a public debate as to what extent the female working population experienced greater income and employment reductions. This is particularly relevant since women are often the primary caregivers in the family and, as such, were also confronted with the closure of schools and daycare centers (Alon et al. 2020). However, the debate revolving around the gender gap and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic does not, thus far, differentiate between forms of employment, although initial descriptive evidence points to stronger negative effects for self-employed women (see, e.g., Ifo Institute and forsa (2020) for Germany and Kalenkoski and Pabilonia (2020) for the USA). In this paper, we investigate whether women in self-employment and among employees are more severely affected by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) than men. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly contrast the experience of the self-employed with employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and, by doing so, to identify where gender disparities occurred as a consequence of the pandemic. The particular focus on self-employed individuals is warranted by the increasing importance of self-employment and entrepreneurship for modern economies. For example, in Germany, around 4.2 million individuals — about ten percent of the working population — are self-employed, running diverse businesses either without or with additional employees, often micro-businesses with up to 10 employees. In sum, the self-employed contribute substantially to the economic development in Germany (Audretsch et al. 2020). It is further important to note that, while there is still a significant gender gap among the self-employed, the share of women has been increasing steadily since the turn of the century (Fritsch et al. 2015). Our study proceeds in three steps. First, we contextualize our analysis on the comparison between female and male workers in both forms of employment by investigating the differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the self-employed and employees. Second, in our main analysis, we examine the gender gap in the effect of the pandemic on labor market outcomes, focusing on the self-employed. Third, we provide evidence on potential mechanisms driving the observed gender differences among the self-employed. For our analysis, we use the Socio-Economic Panel-CoV (SOEP-CoV), a novel data set sufficiently rich to allow for such a comparison, as it enables us to control for individual-level heterogeneity to a large extent. SOEP-CoV surveyed a randomly selected subset of respondents from the SOEP who were asked to answer a wide array of questions about their economic situation, family situation, health, the use of public support instruments, as well as attitudes during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SOEP is a representative household panel in Germany that surveys respondents annually since 1984 (Goebel et al. 2019). By design, the SOEP-CoV enables us to link individual respondents to their pre-crisis information. Thus, we can exploit rich information on the respondents, including their pre-crisis household income, education, household characteristics, personality traits, and employment experience, among others. Therefore, we are able to analyze whether individual characteristics that are known to be important determinants of self-employment influence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic (see, e.g., Parker 2018). With this data at hand, we perform multivariate analyses, first comparing the gap in labor market outcomes between employed and self-employed respondents. We show that there are significant differences in the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated NPIs on the two employment forms: The self-employed are about 42 percentage points more likely to report losses of gross income than employees and 30 percentage points more likely to report a reduction in working hours. Turning to gender differences in the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that self-employed women are about one-third more likely than self-employed men to experience income losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not find a comparable gender gap among employees. We then decompose the gender gap in the probability of income losses among the self-employed using the Gelbach decomposition (Gelbach 2016), allowing us to decompose different sets of covariates into their individual contribution to the gender gap. We show that the gender gaps in the probability of income losses and reductions in working hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic are driven by the fact that self-employed women are disproportionately active in industries that are more severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not find such evidence for employees. Lastly, we provide evidence for a likely channel driving the gender gap among the self-employed. We find that self-employed women are 20 percentage points more likely to be affected by regulations adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that our results are, once again, driven by the disproportionate sorting of self-employed women into industries that were more severely restricted by the NPIs implemented. Moreover, we present evidence that these restrictions mediate the relationship between industry-sorting and income losses. We also find suggestive evidence that gendered household production contributes to the gender gap in income losses. However, this effect is of second order compared to the contribution of the industry affiliation. We contribute to the literature in several ways. First, we contrast the gender gap between employees and self-employed individuals in the labor market during the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to related studies relying on the U.S. Current Population Survey (Fairlie 2020; Kalenkoski and Pabilonia 2020) or the Canadian Labour Force Survey (Beland et al. 2020), the SOEP-CoV contains information on earnings losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020), who collected their own data, are a notable exception in that they do have information on earnings losses. They do not find gender differences in realized job or earnings losses for Germany. While Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) provide important initial evidence, they do not distinguish between self-employed individuals and employees with respect to the gender gap. This is an important distinction since the labor market in Germany is characterized by stronger rigidities than other countries, limiting the extent to which firms can cut the wages of their employees (e.g., Burda 2016). Furthermore, policy measures taken by the federal government were mostly aimed at stabilizing the earnings and employment trajectories of employees. By contrast, self-employed individuals, as residual claimants, are more vulnerable to economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we contribute to the broader literature on gender gaps in labor markets (e.g., Blau and Kahn 2017; Goldin et al. 2017; Meara et al. 2020) documenting earnings gaps, which the authors, among other factors, attribute to the selection of women into occupations or sectors that are associated with lower average wages. We complement this literature with our finding that the disproportionate representation of women in certain industries also translates into a gender gap in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, our finding that government-mandated regulations are an important driver of the gender gap in the impact of the pandemic on the self-employed constitutes novel evidence in the literature. Lastly, we also contribute to a strand of literature studying the consequences of the spread of communicable diseases on economic well-being in general (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2014; Barro et al. 2020; Correia et al. 2020; Velde 2020). These studies mainly investigate the impact of the 1918 Spanish flu. While providing important insights, these studies are hampered by limited data due to the historical nature of the event. In this context, our finding that NPIs have unintended consequences for gender equality implies that this variation in economic suffering needs to be accounted for when addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any future public health crisis involving communicable diseases of a similar or even greater magnitude.",39

34.0,4.0,Journal of Population Economics,19 May 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00840-7,Culture and mental health resilience in times of COVID-19,October 2021,Annie Tubadji,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"During economic shocks, the cultural sector is generally left by policymakers to the mercy of serendipity, and, with few exceptions, it is traditionally perceived as a needy industry that is among the first candidates for austerity measures. The question raised by this paper is whether this attitude is economically justified, in particular whether the essential role of culture as a public good with implications for individual mental health is overlooked in economic research. To answer this question, the definition and function of culture needs to be re-evaluated, as the notion is still loosely understood in contemporary economics. Definitionally, some studies address culture as rules, norms, and traditions (see, for example, Guiso et al. 2006; Alesina and Giuliano 2015). Others accentuate its behavioral side as goods and services produced and consumed in the process of cultural participation (see, for a leading example, Throsby 1999). Inspired by Scitovsky (1983, 1972, 1976), the culture-based development (CBD) definition of culture unites the former two perspectives by building on the intrinsic link between them. Namely, CBD defines culture as a “story of stories,” a complex entity that is used to justify certain rules of behavior. This entity is embodied in norms and beliefs and material goods and services. CBD also draws a temporal divide between past culture (of both material and immaterial kind), termed cultural heritage, and present norms and beliefs and their related goods and services, termed living culture (see Tubadji 2012, 2013, 2020a, b, c; Tubadji and Montalto 2020).Footnote 1 This study adopts the CBD definition of culture. Functionally, culture is usually addressed as a mixed good that is partially a luxury good (necessary only after basic needs are satisfied) (see Heilbrun and Gray 2001) and partially a public good (with benefits for all and endowing individuals with useful cultural capital) (see Bourdieu 1986). The latter helps in social mobility and optimizes the utilization of our social networking (Bourdieu 1973). In line with Denzau and North (2000), CBD recombines these two aspects and postulates that the main function of culture is to alleviate pain from uncertainty by creating predictable behavior according to present cultural norms and rules for all. The main channel for the implementation of this function is cultural consumption, which, in the spirit of Veblenian consumption (Veblen 1899), is a manner of signaling compliance with cultural norms and rules. Thus, according to CBD, the greater the cultural consumption by individuals and society, the lesser the depletion from the pain of uncertainty as part of mental health.Footnote 2 Mental health is a spectrum of states, but being in a balanced position mentally is an essential need for individuals and society. This paper argues that the consumption of cultural goods and services (i.e., cultural participation) can serve as a tool for keeping the individual centered around the golden mean of mental health. According to Schelling’s model (1969, 1978) of individual and system behavior, cultural consumption is expected to affect the mental health of the entire population. However, while much is known about the various impacts of culture on the aggregate level,Footnote 3 microeconomic mental health–related mechanisms behind these economic effects are still under-researched. This oversight may be harmful if it leads policymakers to neglect the public good role of culture. The shock of COVID-19 represents a unique natural experiment about mental health and cultural consumption under increased uncertainty. The mental health of people across the world was significantly affected by the lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 (see Tubadji et al. 2020a, b, c, d, e, f; Yamamura and Tsustsui 2021). As the crisis struck and the lockdown was imposed, concert halls, museums, and even some of the Egyptian pyramids granted free online access for people. Moreover, funding for the cultural sector became a secondary issue at the policymaking level in most countries,Footnote 4 with the exceptions of Germany and New Zealand. Thus, what is urgently needed is empirical evidence on whether public cultural expenditure is now indeed redundant for the economy or, instead, fully justified. This paper uses the natural experiment of COVID-19 to explore the effect of cultural consumption under uncertainty. The current paper aims to tap into this natural experiment to study the CBD micromechanism. Namely, using primary data from a pilot online survey carried out March 23–29, 2020, the paper employs a hedonic modeling approach to address the existence of the cultural micromechanism of pain alleviation and support for mental health resilience during increased uncertainty. It relies on various measures of happiness (Kahneman and Krueger 2006; Frey and Stuetzer 2018; Weimann et al. 2015) as well as a measure of pro-social propensities in human behavior, treating them as alternative approximations of mental health. The paper addresses two aspects of the cultural impact on mental health resilience: the cultural effect on mental health prevention (i.e., the effects of past consumption of culture on the levels of happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic) and the cultural impact on the resilience of the community spirit (in line with Guiso et al. 2008, 2016) approximated by the change in the social capital propensity in human behavior due to cultural consumption during the lockdown period. The paper finds strong evidence for an association between cultural consumption from pre-pandemic periods and individual levels of happiness during the pandemic. Additionally, during increased uncertainty, group cultural engagement is associated with a boost in people’s pro-social behavior. The “Results” section discusses potential macroeconomic implications. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 offers an overview from an evolutionary and behavioral economics perspective about the role of culture as an essential tool for alleviating pain from uncertainty. Section 3 outlines the neuroscience motivation for considering culture as a tool for supporting psychological resilience under shock conditions. Section 4 explains the CBD micromechanism that is part of the utility function of the general consumer, affecting happiness and mental health resilience. This section also outlines some regional and macroeconomic implications of this micro mechanism. Section 5 offers an empirical test of the CBD micromechanism. Section 6 concludes and reflects on some fiscal policy implications concerning culture.",13

Under this restricted life, a question that arises is how and to what degree does the COVID-19 outbreak affect mental health? Previous studies have shown that the COVID-19 outbreak has negatively affected mental health (e.g. Brodeur et al. 2020; Sabat et al. 2020; Yamamura and Tsutsui 2020).Footnote 1 There is a gap in working from home between working mothers who have children of primary school age and other working women during the COVID-19 spread (Yamamura and Tsutsui 2021a). Changes in working style seem to influence mental health. The allocation of time spent on housework normally differs between husbands and wives in Japan (Yamamura and Tsutsui 2021b). However, the effect of school closures on parents’ mental health is unknown, as is whether this effect differs between mothers and fathers. This study examines the influence of school closure on parents’ mental health, focusing on gender differences among parents.Footnote 2 The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed working styles and time use in many countries.Footnote 3 As a consequence of the lockdown to cope with COVID-19, the percentage of people who stay at home increased by 8% across countries in the USA (Brzezinski et al. 2020).Footnote 4 In addition, schools were closed because of the emergent situation under the diffusion of COVID-19 in various countries (Baldwin and Mauro 2020). Parents’ care for school-aged children plays a critical role in child growth.Footnote 5 The closure of primary schools resulted in parents taking care of their children at home, as childcare services were not available because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, parents’ childcare burden increased. According to the Global Gender Gap Index 2020 rankings, Japan was 121st among 153 countries (World Economic Forum 2020). Under the COVID-19 pandemic, even in two-income households, mainly women worked from home to take care of their primary school children in Japan (Yamamura and Tsutsui 2021b).Footnote 6 We predict that the mental health of mothers with school-aged children deteriorated more than fathers’ due to school closures caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Existing research has evaluated the effect of school closure on coping with outbreaks of several viral diseases (e.g. Cauchemez et al. 2008, 2014; Adda 2016) and on parents’ working from home (Sevilla and Smith 2020) but has not looked specifically at gender differences in effects on parents’ mental health. Primary and junior high schools were closed throughout Japan from the beginning of March to the end of May 2020 and generally reopened in June 2020. School-aged children could learn at school during the daytime after June 2020.Footnote 7 We conducted Internet surveys five times from March to June 2020 to independently construct a panel data. Due to the setting and the novel data, we can explore the impact of school closure on parents’ mental health by comparing school closure and reopening periods. We find that school closures decreased the mental health of mothers with children who were primary school pupils, which concurs with other COVID-19 work by Takaku and Yokoyama (2020) arguing that marital relationships deteriorated as a result of school closures. The key finding of this work is that the negative effect of school closures on mental health is observed for less-educated mothers, but not for mothers with higher education levels. The contribution of this paper is to show that school closures increased the inequality of parents’ mental health between genders and educational backgrounds. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review related literature. Section 3 presents an overview of the situation in Japan. In Section 4, we explain the survey design and data. Section 5 describes the empirical method. Section 6 presents and interprets the estimated results. Finally, Section 7 provides some reflections and conclusions.",29

Zoutman,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"COVID-19 puts a large burden on the healthcare system since many patients with COVID-19 require hospitalization or intensive care (ICU). From a health economics perspective, it is crucial to understand the extent to which non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) affect the allocation of these scarce resources, and reduce the pressure on the hospital sector. This study provides direct causal evidence on the relationship between NPIs and the demand for hospital resources. Our study provides evidence from the three Scandinavian countries Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Scandinavia forms an ideal laboratory to study this question. First, the three countries are similar in terms of culture, climate, healthcare and institutional framework. Second, community spread of COVID-19 started at the same time; Norway reported its 100th case on March 4, Sweden on March 6, and Denmark on March 9. Third, throughout the pandemic, the three countries have maintained high-quality comparable databases regarding hospitalizations and ICU admissions, thus allowing us to provide direct evidence from the hospital sector. Fourth, the NPIs vary strongly between the three countries. Denmark and Norway introduced strong NPIs early in the pandemic. On the other hand, Sweden imposed an extraordinary light NPI regime. The similarity between the three Scandinavian countries in all aspects except NPIs provides a unique source that allows us to isolate the causal effect of the NPIs on hospital resources.Footnote 1 We use a difference-in-difference (DiD) event-study to analyze the effect of the lockdown in Denmark and Norway on the daily number of patients in hospitals with COVID-19, the daily number of patients in intensive-care (ICU) with COVID-19 and the daily cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths. Our main analysis covers the period March 5–June 30, 2020, which comprises the first wave of COVID-19 in Scandinavia. We find that between the start of our sample period and 2–3 weeks into the lockdown period, the number of ICU patients and mortality per capita follow a common trend in the three countries.Footnote 2 After, the outcome variables diverge rapidly, increasing in Sweden but plateauing and eventually decreasing in Denmark/Norway. Trends in Denmark and Norway are remarkably similar throughout the sample period. Both the timing of the effect and the similarity between Denmark and Norway are strongly indicative of the idea that we are measuring the causal impact of the NPIs. Phasing out the lockdown in Denmark and Norway does not result in an increase in our outcome variables. However, from the end of April onward, the number of hospitalizations and ICU patients in Sweden decline, and hence, the DiD between Sweden and Denmark/Norway decreases as well. We use our event-study model to predict the peak number of patients Denmark and Norway would have had in the counterfactual in which they did not lock down. Our model predicts that for Denmark (Norway) the peak number of hospitalizations would have been 144 (257) percent higher. The peak number of ICU patients would have been 103 (152) percent higher had Denmark (Norway) decided not to lock down. We also consider the overall effect of the lockdown up to the end of our sample period. We find that in the counterfactual without lockdown, Denmark (Norway) would have had 334 (671) percent more hospitalization-patient days, and 277 (379) percent more ICU-patient days. Deaths would have been 402 (1015) percent higher. Using conventional estimates for the cost of hospitalization and intensive care from the literature, we find that lockdown saved Denmark (Norway) 96 (94) million US dollars. We also consider mortality costs focusing on a scenario with low mortality cost and a scenario with high mortality cost. We find that the overall healthcare and mortality costs Denmark (Norway) saved through lockdown amounts to between 1 and 4 (0.9 and 3.5) percent of GDP. The main policy conclusion is that the lockdown in Denmark and Norway has been extremely successful in reducing peak pressure on the healthcare system and reducing healthcare and mortality cost. Given that the duration of the lockdown was relatively short (phase-out started after 5 weeks), and given that the economic damage of the lockdown appears to have been relatively limited (see Sheridan et al.2020, Juranek et al. 2020), we conclude that the benefits of the lockdown outweigh the cost. We also take a look at the long-run impact of the pandemic. In the second and third waves, a causal design is no longer plausible because the spread of COVID-19 does not follow the same trajectory across the three countries. However, our main conclusion is that Sweden has been most severely affected by all three COVID-19 waves. Moreover, likely related to the much higher case load, Sweden had to maintain a much stricter NPI regime throughout the remainder of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. There is thus no evidence that Sweden’s approach to COVID-19 during the first wave provides a long-term benefit. One of the main contributions of our study is that we use data directly from the hospital sector, whereas most of the literature only focuses on the number of confirmed COVID-19 infections and/or mortalities (e.g., Courtemanche et al.2020b; Flaxman et al. 2020). Hospital data has several advantages. First, hospital beds, and specifically ICU beds, are likely to serve as a bottleneck in the healthcare system because a significant number of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care and supply in terms of personnel and equipment is limited in most countries. Therefore, from a health economics perspective, it is important to understand how NPIs affect these variables. Second, patients with COVID-19 who end up in hospitals are likely to be tested because testing is required to protect other patients and staff. Therefore, hospitalization data provides a more reliable source of information on the spread of COVID-19 than the number of confirmed cases which is in part driven by differences in the testing regime. Third, the economic costs of patients who end up in hospitals, ICUs or who pass away are arguably larger than less severe COVID-19 cases. There is a rapidly growing literature that considers the effect of NPIs on the spread of COVID-19. We contribute in four ways. First, the Scandinavian setting offers clean identification because the countries are very similar, COVID-19 community spread occurred simultaneously in all three countries, and despite this, Sweden’s approach to COVID-19 differs from its neighbors. In contrast, in US (e.g., Courtemanche et al. 2020a, 2020b; Friedson et al. 2021; Allcott et al. 2020) and German (e.g., Glogowsky et al. 2020; Mitze et al. 2020) states, jurisdictions implement similar NPIs in rapid succession and timing is endogenous to the severity of the outbreak.Footnote 3 Second, relative to the epidemiological literature (e.g., Flaxman et al. 2020) identification comes from the assumption that Sweden serves as a valid counterfactual to Denmark and Norway, rather than a structural epidemiological model. Third, we are the first empirical study to provide direct insights on the effect of NPIs on hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. Fourth, we are the first empirical study to provide a monetary quantification of the benefit of lockdown in terms of the reduction in healthcare expenditure and mortality.",10

The lack of labor market integration clearly constitutes a problem in its own right because of the substantial fiscal costs it generates, but the costs are likely much bigger and broader than the direct fiscal costs (Danzer 2011). For instance, lower levels of economic resources have been shown to increase the level of crime committed by refugees and to reduce schooling outcomes of their children (Andersen et al. 2019; Arendt 2020). Post-displacement living conditions are also correlated with mental health and social participation (Porter and Haslam 2005; Hynie 2018; Laurentsyeva and Venturini 2017). Even though the broader consequences for receiving countries of refugee immigration are poorly understood (Chin and Cortes 2015), they are often misinterpreted in public opinion and therefore generate political tension (Wike et al. 2016; Bell 2016). As I describe below, these findings are particularly disturbing since few causal studies exist that can aid decision makers in their efforts to close the employment gap and thereby reduce the economic pressure, and potentially also the social pressure, that arises as a consequence of the gap. This study seeks to fill part of the lack of evidence on effective strategies for fostering labor market integration for refugees by estimating the effect of a work-first policy for refugees. A work-first policy is a strategy that emphasizes a quick entry to the labor market and is often contrasted to a train-first policy that emphasizes human capital investments.Footnote 2 The work-first policy considered in this study is constructed as an addendum to a human capital investment strategy, where the refugee is investing in language capital. Denmark adopted the work-first policy in 2016 to address challenges after the recent surge in the number of asylum seekers in Europe. I use a quasi-experimental design to estimate the policy’s impact by exploiting the fact that only immigrants who arrived after the third quarter of 2016 were subject to the work-first policy. The work-first policy introduced a requirement that all unemployed immigrants actively search for a job and subjected immigrants to on-the-job training immediately upon their arrival. The aim of the policy was to expedite entry to the labor market, and to avoid skills depreciation and reduced job-finding motivation that may arise with a later job market entry. Similar strategies aimed at speeding up labor market entry for refugees are in place or are being debated in several countries in the aftermath of the 2015 crisis (Zimmerman 2017). The strategies include early skills-assessment and fast-track solutions for refugees with specific skills in Canada, Sweden, and Germany and discussions about reducing the employment bans during the asylum-seeking period that are in place in many European countries (Martín et al. 2016; Konle-Seidl and Bolitz 2016; Garibay and De Cyuper 2013; Desidero 2016). Marbach et al. (2018) show that asylum seekers’ initial labor market experience in a country can have a long-lasting impact. They find that employment bans during the asylum seeker period have large negative long-run consequences for the labor market integration of refugees once they obtain asylum. Descriptive studies have also documented that both the timing of job entry and job entry characteristics may have long-run consequences (Aaslund et al. 2017; Ansala et al. 2018). To my knowledge, no other studies have estimated the causal impact of an intervention that enforces early exposure to the labor market immediately after receiving a residence permit. The empirical analysis in the current study is based on Danish administrative register data that contain information on all refugees who arrived in Denmark during the period under consideration, including their date of their arrival and weekly information on their participation in labor market programs as well as monthly information on their labor market status. The data allows me to align the timing of program participation with monthly outcomes in a detailed manner. The results show that the work-first policy succeeded in speeding up men’s labor market entry: The share of men who has worked one year after arrival increases by 10 percentage points, but they work in precarious jobs with few work hours. I find no indication that men’s pay and work industry were affected. The policy crowds out language investments but at the same time raised the share of men who enrolled in education. In contrast, the work-first policy had no or only minor effects for women. Since I apply a before-after design, care must be taken when interpreting the results. A causal interpretation of the results is supported by findings that show that the results are robust across different specifications, pass two placebo tests, and that the policy works as intended: It sharply raised the share of refugees subjected to job search and who participated in on-the-job training in the first six months following their arrival in Denmark. This increase is smaller for women, and lower treatment intensity can therefore explain part of the smaller results for women. The results are important because they show that effective quick job-entry strategies are feasible, even in a country with relatively high minimum wages and a generous level of welfare benefits. However, because the work-first policy has ambiguous effects on human capital, it is important to consider the long-run effects of similar policies in future research.",16
35.0,1.0,Journal of Population Economics,17 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00870-1,Do elections accelerate the COVID-19 pandemic?,January 2022,Ján Palguta,René Levínský,Samuel Škoda,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The dramatic onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, just like other large-scale emergencies, disrupted lives, businesses and communities worldwide as governments responded with extraordinary measures to battle the spread of the virus. While non-pharmaceutical interventions that limit mobility and isolate potentially infected people are designed to keep the pandemic at bay, they also clash with the cornerstone of democracy: regular, free and fair elections. The public discourse over holding massive, in-person elections amid the growing pandemic has been highly contentious in numerous countries. Early academic literature promptly attempted to quantify the impact of elections on the growth in new infections and mortality (Berry et al. 2020; Feltham et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2020), but, contrary to widespread fears, found little evidence that elections would speed up pandemic growth. Concerns about these estimates included questions related to choosing the correct model of counterfactual pandemic evolution and the lack of exogenous variation in voter participation in elections. At the same time, evidence by Bertoli et al. (2020), Cotti et al. (2021), and Cassan and Sangnier (2020) hinted, in a stark contrast, that elections can be associated with significant speeding up of the pandemic. These conflicting results make the challenge of defining a credible counterfactual in which one could track the same area (e.g. a country) simultaneously holding and abstaining from a massive electoral event even more salient.Footnote 1 In this paper, we provide evidence from a natural experiment that allows us to convincingly estimate the causal impact of large-scale, in-person elections on the COVID-19 pandemic without relying on strong assumptions about voter turnout and pre-electoral pandemic trajectories. Our study is based on constituency-level variation from Czechia, a developed, high-income, EU-member country that biannually renews mandates in one-third of Senate constituencies, which rotate deterministically in holding elections according to the country’s 1995 election law. The constituencies voting in each turn are geographically scattered across the country. The first round of Senate elections is always organized jointly with municipal or regional elections, which are held nationally. The second round, however, held 1 week after the first round, is not combined with another nationwide electoral event. This institutional setting implies that in the absence of the second round of the 2020 elections (held on October 9–10), the pandemic would evolve along parallel paths in voting and non-voting constituencies because the initial pre-electoral pandemic conditions in constituencies should be uncorrelated with their assignment to the 2020 electoral turn. In our results, we show that in the second and third weeks after the elections, the growth rates in new COVID-19 infections are significantly higher in voting compared with non-voting constituencies. For illustration, the 14-day growth in new cases is 24.6 percentage points higher in the third week after elections in constituencies that just held elections compared with the baseline 146.4% growth rate over the last 14 days in non-voting constituencies. A temporarily linked acceleration in hospital admissions (significant at the 5% level at its peak in the third week) together with essentially no changes in test positivity rates indicate that the acceleration does not merely reflect increased testing in voting constituencies. We validate our findings using standard event study tests of no differences in pre-trends across voting and non-voting constituencies. We also implement a battery of tests showing no initial differences in COVID-19 prevalence, active cases, reproductive number R and a number of socio-demographic outcomes characterizing economic status, education and age structure of the population across constituencies. Using data from earlier regional elections, we find no differences across constituencies in terms of voter electoral preferences and turnout. Our event study estimates are robust to controlling for the earlier epidemiological situation in constituencies and any observed and unobserved time-invariant factors. In our heterogeneity analysis, we find that the pandemic acceleration is only present in the population younger than 65 and is absent in older cohorts, consistent with strategic risk-avoidance by older voters (Dave et al. 2020b), who are at greater risk of hospitalization or dying if diagnosed with COVID-19 (Williamson et al. 2020). Also, we find that the acceleration is significantly higher in municipalities with a below-median share of individuals with at least secondary education. The evidence supports the literature suggesting that socio-economic factors play an important role for the speed of the pandemic’s spread and its mitigation (Wright et al. 2020). To inspect the mechanism of viral spread, we use data from Google and Apple and estimate increased mobility and shorter stays at places of residence during elections. In comparison, we do not find significant spikes in mobility at other types of locations, namely, in retail and recreation facilities, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations and workplaces. Using data from a unique representative panel survey, we also do not find respondents to be more likely to engage in more frequent family reunions, restaurant visits, group holidays or large public events (including electoral rallies) in the election week. We only estimate the respondents were more likely to commute by crowded public transport, likely because they needed to get to polling places. Our analysis contributes to several strands of the literature. First, we add to the rich and growing literature that evaluates public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of infectious viral diseases. Earlier studies in this strand find that policies aimed at reducing population flows by restricting mobility (Fang et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020), adopting safer-at-home orders and non-essential business closures (Amuedo-Dorantes et al. 2021), school closures (Adda 2016; Litvinova et al. 2019) or paid sick leaves that keep contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem 2009; Pichler and Ziebarth 2017) can mitigate viral transmission. Along this line, holding large gatherings of attendees with little or no social distancing has been also suspected to contribute to viral spread, especially to the COVID-19 pandemic (McCloskey et al. 2020). Earlier studies examine the epidemic impact of a large motorcycle event (Dave et al. 2021), the role of New York City subways (Harris 2020), the impact of college students returning after spring break (Mangrum and Niekamp 2021) and the role of Black Lives Matter protests (Dave et al. 2020b) . We are aware of several studies that focus explicitly on elections but deliver conflicting results. In particular, Leung et al. (2020), Berry et al. (2020), and Feltham et al. (2020) find no effects of the 2020 US primary elections on COVID-19 transmission and mortality. In a stark contrast, Cotti et al. (2021) find in the same setting of primary elections in Wisconsin that a higher number of in-person voters per polling station is linked with higher positivity 2–3 weeks later. In the European context, some studies of municipal elections in France suggest that higher voter turnout is associated with higher post-electoral hospitalizations (Cassan and Sangnier 2020) and mortality (Bertoli et al. 2020), whereas other studies find no impact (Duchemin et al. 2020; Zeitoun et al. 2020). The common features of these studies are the challenges associated with choosing the correct model of the counterfactual pandemic evolution and the difficulty of addressing non-random voter turnout. In this respect, Cotti et al. (2021) abstain from causal language as they recognize that the number of polling stations per voter might be endogenously set. Bertoli et al. (2020) predict turnout using the intensity of local electoral competition, but, as pointed out by Bach et al. (2021), their estimates are attributable to measurement error. Other studies either assume turnout to be fully exogenous with respect to pre-electoral pandemic conditions or do not discuss that many socio-economic determinants of turnout might also shape the trajectories of pandemic spread and compliance with mitigation policies.Footnote 2 Unlike previous work, our study provides evidence from a clear natural experiment that does not require complex modelling of pre-electoral pandemic trajectories nor strong assumptions about voter turnout to convincingly estimate the causal effect of massive (electoral) event on viral spread. Next, our analysis adds to the growing literature on socio-economic determinants of viral propagation. In this strand, Adda (2016) finds pro-cyclical effects of economic activity and inter-regional trade on viral transmission. Markowitz et al. (2019) show that higher employment is linked with higher incidence of influenza. Using data from the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in China, Qiu et al. (2020) show that cities with higher GDP per capita had higher transmission rates, which is ascribed to more social interactions as economic activities increase. As pointed out by Dave et al. (2020b) and Gupta et al. (2020), however, individuals can strategically respond to the perceived risk of contagion, which can slow down viral propagation. In line with this argument, Wright et al. (2020) show that residents of high-income areas in the US comply with shelter-in-place ordinances much more than their counterparts in areas with lower incomes, even after accounting for partisanship, population density and unemployment. We contribute to this literature by showing that pandemic acceleration due to elections was significantly higher in municipalities with a below-median share of individuals with at least secondary education and absent in the population above 65, which supports the strategic risk-avoidance hypothesis. Finally, we contribute to the studies on the electoral implications of viral outbreaks. In this strand, Pulejo and Querubín (2021) find that incumbents who can run for reelection implement less stringent anti-pandemic restrictions when elections are closer in time. Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2021) moreover suggest that political ideology might compromise the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the adoption speed of NPIs during the COVID-19 crisis appeared to be less effective in Republican counties. In line with the broad literature on retrospective voting (reviewed by Ashworth 2012), Warshaw et al. (2020) show that US states and local areas with higher COVID-19 fatality rates were less likely to support President Trump and Republican candidates for the House and Senate. Baccini et al. (2021) argue that the prevalence of COVID-19 likely decided the 2020 US presidential election. We add to this literature by arguing that in the case of strategic risk-avoidance by vulnerable groups of voters, pandemic outbreaks can produce a side effect of elevated absenteeism of important socio-economic groups in elections. In our setting, we estimate little pandemic acceleration due to elections especially in the population above 65. We also estimate that the share of population above 65 is less strongly associated with voter turnout in 2020 compared with the previous 2016 elections. Our evidence is therefore suggestive of self-imposed restrictions on electoral franchise by older voters, which has important policy implications for the organization of elections during viral outbreaks. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background and data. Section 3 outlines the empirical methodology. Section 4 presents our findings. Section 5 summarizes, discusses policy implications and concludes.",19
35.0,1.0,Journal of Population Economics,21 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00867-w,Optimal lockdown and social welfare,January 2022,Pierre Pestieau,Gregory Ponthiere,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In order to battle against the COVID-19 pandemic and to save lives, governments around the world relied massively on lockdown strategies during spring 2020. At the beginning of April 2020, about 3.9 billion humans—that is, more than half of humanity—were asked or ordered to stay at home to prevent further expansion of the pandemic.Footnote 1 Those (more or less strict) lockdown strategies saved lives, but at the cost of causing a major macroeconomic slowdown and a rise in unemployment. According to Deb et al. (2020), the Great Lockdown reduced the number of fatalities by about 90% in comparison to a baseline with no containment policies. But at the same time, the lockdown had also a major impact on economic performance. According to the OECD (2020), the scale of the decline in the level of output is equivalent to about 2 percentage points of GDP growth lost for each month of strict lockdown. As a consequence, the 3 months of strict lockdown in spring 2020 imply an annual GDP growth that was, for 2020, lowered by about 6 percentage points, and thus unambiguously negative, i.e., a severe contraction of economic activity.Footnote 2 The macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 is studied in more details in Atkeson (2020) and Eichenbaum et al. (2020). The design of optimal lockdown requires weighting the gains and losses from maintaining the economy under more or less strong sanitary constraints. Recent papers by Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), and Gollier (2020) examined, using various theoretical settings, the optimal lockdown strategy within dynamic economic models including the (potentially amended) susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) structure of epidemiological frameworks. Those papers studied not only the optimal extent of the lockdown, but, also, the optimal timing of the lockdown.Footnote 3 The goal of this paper is to focus on another aspect of the optimal lockdown problem: its robustness to the postulated social welfare criterion. The research question that we would like to address in this paper is to know how robust the optimal lockdown strategy is to the underlying ethical criterion. Our research question is motivated by the fact that the design of an optimal lockdown strategy is an inherently prescriptive task. Deriving an optimal lockdown is, by nature, normative, in the sense that this tells us something about what governments or national health agencies should do. As emphasized by Moore (1903), a normative proposition—whatever it is—cannot be deduced from positive premises only, but requires necessarily, among the premises, at least one normative proposition. Any policy can only be “optimal” with respect to some pursued goal, which is normative in nature. What is true in general is also true in the times of COVID-19: any “optimal” lockdown can only be “optimal” given some pursued goal. As a consequence, the study of the optimal lockdown cannot avoid a discussion of its normative foundations. During the COVID-19 crisis, governments gave the impression that the pursued goal was to “save as many lives as possible”. Whereas further research would be needed to “rationalize” government’s strategies during the COVID-19 crisis, one can raise doubts about a social objective that would consist in saving as many lives as possible. Such a normative objective would ignore all other aspects of life, and, as such, would be too restrictive. Ideally, a social objective should incorporate and weight all aspects of life (not only the quantity of life, but, also, the quality of life). This paper explores the implications of several distinct social welfare criteria for the design of optimal lockdown strategies. In order to address that issue, this study develops a dynamic model of the human life cycle with risky lifetime. In our model, an epidemic, which has its own dynamics, increases mortality and reduces the proportion of old individuals in the population. In that economy, the government has only one policy instrument against the epidemic: a lockdown strategy, which decreases the prevalence of the epidemic and the mortality due to the epidemic, but at the cost of reducing consumption possibilities and causing direct disutility.Footnote 4 We examine the solution of the optimal lockdown problem under various social welfare criteria. The model studied in this paper is designed so as to be the simplest framework allowing us to examine how different ethical criteria address the trade-offs between the goals of saving lives and economic prosperity. Our model includes, unlike SIR models, only two states: individuals can be either alive or dead, and the average age at death varies with the prevalence of the pandemic. But despite its simplicity, our model accounts for the fact that individuals of different ages are not equally vulnerable to the pandemic. The prevalence of the pandemic is modelled as an equilibrium phenomenon, whose level depends on the strength of lockdown policies. Following Acemoglu et al. (2020), we consider not only the design of optimal (undifferentiated) lockdown policies (as those carried out in 2020), but, also, the design of optimal age-differentiated lockdown policies (with a degree differing between the young and the old). When examining the design of optimal lockdown policies, this paper differs from the existing literature on optimal timing issues (optimal “stop-and-go” policies). Unlike that literature, this paper focuses on the selection of stationary lockdown policies allowing to reach the equilibrium prevalence of the pandemic, which can be interpreted as a “target” selected by the public authority. Abstracting from transitional issues allows us to pay more attention to the determinants of the selection of the target. Although a simplification, this theoretical shortcut is most relevant for policy-makers facing trade-offs between saving lives and prosperity. Governments around the world designed their policies by fixing a target for the prevalence of the pandemic, a target with respect to which they adjusted lockdown policies up and down. Our setting allows us to focus on the selection of that target, whose level reveals how the trade-off between saving lives and prosperity is dealt with. This paper aims at examining how different ethical doctrines address that difficult trade-off. Our main result is that the optimal lockdown strategy is not robust to the postulated social welfare criterion. Utilitarianism leads to a strictly positive lockdown level, and can also, under some conditions, imply a COVID-19 variant of Parfit’s (1984) Repugnant Conclusion: for any (interior) lockdown with life periods of low quality, there must be a stricter lockdown that is regarded as better, even though this reduces the quality of life periods even more. On the contrary, the ex post egalitarian criterion, which gives priority to the worst-off ex post (once individual durations of life are known), implies a zero lockdown, a result in sharp contrast with utilitarianism.Footnote 5 Although the sensitivity of an optimal policy to the pursued social objective could be anticipated, the contribution of this paper is to show that, in the case of the design of optimal lockdown, the lack of robustness takes an extreme form: the optimal lockdown varies between its minimal level (under ex post egalitarianism) and its maximal level (prevailing, in general, under utilitarianism). The strong sensitivity of the optimal lockdown policy to the postulated social criterion is robust to extending the set of available policy instruments to allow for age-differentiated lockdown policies. Under utilitarianism, there is still, in general, some support for positive age-differentiated lockdown, whereas the ex post egalitarian optimum involves zero lockdown for all. Beyond the comparison of optimal lockdown under utilitarianism and ex post egalitarianism, our results point to a general ethical dilemma between two goals: on the one hand, saving lives (modeled by the Survivors Number Count axiom), and, on the other hand, giving priority to the worst-off (Hammond Equity). Preventive policies like the lockdown achieve the first goal, but at the cost of deteriorating the situation of the most disadvantaged in the society. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. The optimal lockdown is then derived under the utilitarian criterion in Section 3. Section 4 identifies the condition under which the utilitarian criterion leads to a COVID-19 variant of Parfit’s Repugnant Conclusion. The ethical dilemma between saving lives and Hammond Equity is studied in Section 5. Section 6 characterizes the optimal lockdown under the ex post egalitarian criterion. In order to study the robustness of our results to the set of available policy instruments Section 7 examines the optimal age-specific lockdown policies under utilitarianism and ex post egalitarianism. Section 8 concludes.",9
35.0,1.0,Journal of Population Economics,15 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00874-x,The unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders on abortions,January 2022,Fernanda Marquez-Padilla,Biani Saavedra,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose heavy costs on health, well-being, and economic performance around the globe, additional concerns over how the current context has affected women’s access to essential sexual and reproductive health services have arisen. In particular, strained healthcare systems, stay-at-home orders (SAHO), and economic hardship and uncertainty are all likely to affect women’s desire and ability to determine whether and when to have a child. Unwanted fertility is likely to negatively affect economic, social, and individual-level outcomes (Ananat et al. 2009; Lin and Pantano 2015; Sonfield et al. 2013), and it is strongly determined by two essential reproductive health services that allow women to achieve their reproductive desires: access to contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies and safe abortion care to avoid unwanted births (Bongaarts et al. 2012; Bailey 2012). Safe abortion care is a time-sensitive service for which a delay may increase health risks and decreases the possibility of receiving a legal procedure because of gestational age legal limits (Bayefsky et al. 2020). We analyze the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and SAHO on abortions in Mexico City (CDMX). Many countries have implemented SAHO as key mitigation policies, and while they have been generally successful at containing the spread of the virus, they have had unintended consequences on general health (Pfefferbaum and North 2020; Wong et al. 2020) and women’s sexual and reproductive health (Cousins 2020; Bullinger et al. 2020). In this paper, we analyze the effects of the SAHO time period in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) on the number of legal abortions performed at CDMX’s public abortion program called Interrupcion Legal del Embarazo (ILE). The program has been found to be associated with improvements in maternal health and aggregate fertility rates (Clarke and Mühlrad 2020). We present evidence that the start of SAHO coincided with a sharp reduction in the number of abortions compared with week-to-week trends observed in previous years (2016–2019). We use detailed woman-level data on abortions performed by ILE merged with municipal measures for MCMA’s 72 municipalities to explore heterogeneous effects by municipal poverty levels, rates of informality, and COVID-19 mortality rates.Footnote 1 Additionally, we explore how the composition of women getting abortions was affected by the pandemic and SAHO. We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy that compares the weekly municipal-level number of abortions provided by the ILE program during 2016–2019 (averaged) and 2020 before and after the SAHO. We further explore differential effects on abortions corresponding to conceptions occurring before and after the start of the SAHO. Additionally, we use an event study approach to analyze the dynamic effects of the beginning of SAHO on the decline in abortions. We complement our strategy by analyzing the effects of COVID-19 and SAHO on abortion-related morbidity (ARM) using hospital discharge data (as in Clarke and Mühlrad (2020)) in order to explore potential effects on maternal health and unsafe abortions. Furthermore, we use detailed call-level administrative data for reproductive health-related calls from a government “helpline” that assists women with legal, medical, and psychological issues in order to explore the mechanisms that may be driving the observed changes in abortions. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic and the SAHO to contain it led to a large and significant decrease in the number of abortions performed by ILE of approximately 25%, and of around 20% once anticipatory effects are accounted for (i.e., women getting earlier abortions in anticipation of restricted access from SAHO). We find that this effect was more pronounced for women living in municipalities that were arguably more likely to comply with SAHO (Weill et al. 2020): those in CDMX where SAHO tended to be more strict, and those with lower poverty levels and a smaller informal economy. Effects were similarly stronger in municipalities with high COVID-19 mortality rates, where individuals may experience greater fear of visiting healthcare facilities. While SAHO—as well as the pandemic in general—are likely to have affected the number of occurring pregnancies (and the composition of pregnant women), and thus indirectly affected abortion-seeking patterns, we exploit the fact that abortions performed during the first weeks of the policy correspond to conceptions happening before SAHO and thus unaffected by SAHO’s indirect effects on abortions through its effects on pregnancies. We find a smaller decline in abortions (18%) in the weeks immediately following the start of policy, and that no compositional changes are observed. The effect as of seven weeks after the policy’s start—when changes in pregnancies due to SAHO and the pandemic may affect abortion patterns—is significantly larger (a decline of 29%), and we observe relevant compositional changes in the women getting abortions: the shares of single and young women getting abortions fall significantly.Footnote 2 This evidence is consistent with a reduction in unwanted pregnancies among women not living with a partner, arguably from reduced sexual activity due to social distancing measures. Taking into account the dynamic effects of the SAHO time period on ILE abortions and the differential effects for single and non-single women, a conservative back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that about 4.9% of the observed fall in abortions for single women can be attributed to a reduction in unwanted pregnancies. A decline in safe, legal, and free abortions is likely to have a broad range of consequences for women’s health, well-being, and overall fertility (Clarke and Mühlrad 2020). In particular, fewer ILE abortions may translate to either an increase in abortions performed in the private sector (although these tend to be more expensive and of lower quality, Becker and Diaz Olavarrieta (2013)), an increase in unsafe abortions, self-managed abortions or emergency contraception, or an increase in unwanted fertility—or it may reflect a change in preferences over terminating a pregnancy. We present evidence suggesting that unsafe abortions did not increase after SAHO, as ARM discharges typically associated with these procedures did not increase (we actually observe a decrease in these discharges, consistent with generalized trends regarding hospital utilization). Additionally, our analysis using call data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and SAHO led to a decrease in the share of teenagers making abortion-related calls; an increase in pregnancy-related calls two weeks after the start of the policy; a fall in contraception-related calls; and an important increase in domestic violence calls (driven by married and cohabiting women). Taking together our evidence, our results suggest that the sharp fall in the volume of ILE abortions after SAHO were implemented is mostly explained by restricted access to healthcare, in addition to fewer abortions mostly from single women, arguably from fewer unwanted pregnancies due to reduced sexual activity from SAHO and the pandemic in general. Additionally, we find evidence of anticipatory effects of SAHO as abortions increased the week prior to the beginning of the policy, implying that the effect of SAHO and the COVID-19 pandemic on the total number of abortions is smaller (the estimated effect falls to approximately 20% when we account for anticipatory effects). We find no evidence of an increase in unsafe abortions or of changes on desired fertility but cannot exclude the possibility that self-managed abortions/emergency contraception increased. Our results point to some increase in undesired fertility among married and cohabiting women—a topic where empirical evidence and data are currently scarce (Aassve et al. 2020) and that merits future research. To the best of our knowledge, our paper contributes some of the first empirical evidence of a potential increase in unwanted pregnancies that will arguably influence the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility. Our analysis exploits the sudden start of SAHO in Mexico, but it is still hard to separate the total effect of the pandemic from the effects of the SAHO. While the sharp reduction in abortions immediately following SAHO provides some suggestive evidence that the effects we estimate are mainly driven by this policy, many things were changing in correlated ways during the first few weeks of the pandemic, so our estimates are likely to capture not only the effects of SAHO but the effects of the pandemic itself as well. We argue that in any case, identifying the total effect of the pandemic on abortions is highly relevant. Our paper contributes to understanding the effects of lockdown policies on non-COVID-19 health-related outcomes—in particular, its effects on access to abortions. Our results are consistent with findings for the USA and other settings, where the pandemic has affected abortions and reproductive health services (Andersen et al. 2020; Adelekan et al. 2020). By using individual-level data, our study contributes to the literature by shedding light on the mechanisms driving the decline in abortions following SAHO and the pandemic. Additionally, while we exploit the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that the insights from our research transcend the specific context of the lockdown and offer valuable lessons for economic and health policies regarding the effects of limited access to abortions and reproductive health services more broadly. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some of the potential effects of the pandemic on desired abortions and fertility and describes the context in which we study the effects of SAHO on reproductive health, Section 3 presents our abortion, hospital discharge, and call data and shows some raw trends in our outcome variables. Section 4 discusses the empirical approach. We present results in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.",8

Survival expectations entail individual-specific factors (e.g., perceived health status) driving intertemporal choices that are unobservable to the policy-maker and unpredictable by relying solely on objective data. For instance, individuals who expect to live longer may decide to retire at an age that does not fit the longevity risk estimated in the official life tables (Mirowsky 1999; Hurd et al. 2004; Van Solinge and Henkens 2009). Similarly, subjective survival expectations may influence future risky health behaviors (Viscusi 1990; Gilleskie 1998; Adams et al. 2015). Even if individuals perfectly understand that healthy behaviors reduce morbidity and mortality, they can underestimate the benefits of engaging in those behaviors on the basis of their personal judgments about survival. These decisions may have non-negligible implications for welfare costs regarding, for instance, the sustainability of pensions and healthcare provision. What are the determinants of subjective survival probabilities? Previous research has deemed past and current health status and health behaviors crucial determinants of the current expectations about future survival (Falba and Busch 2005; Hurd and McGarry 19952002; Kutlu-Koc and Kalwij 2017), which, in turn, as mentioned above, may influence future health. Other factors, such as socio-economic status, have also been found to influence subjective survival probabilities (SSPs) (Adams et al. 2014; Arpino et al. 2018). Among the factors entering the formation of survival expectations, childhood characteristics may also play an important role. Life-course research has suggested that the type of childhood experienced predicts quality of life in adulthood (e.g., Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014; Layard et al. 2014; Elder 2018) and mortality (e.g., Su 2009; Doblhammer et al. 2013; Masters 2018). For instance, growing up in wartime and witnessing episodes of war-related violence in early childhood are largely recognized as key predictors of health and economic performance later in life (e.g., Kesternich et al. 2014; Havari and Peracchi 2017). However, whether exposure to such hardships produces positive or negative consequences is still debated. On the one hand, a strand of literature documents that exposure to conflict in childhood has negative effects on a variety of human capital dimensions in adult life, such as health (Taylor 2010; Kesternich et al. 2014; Havari and Peracchi 2017; Singhal 2018), mortality (Akbulut-Yuksel 2014), education and labor market outcomes (Ichino and Winter-Ebmer 2004; Akbulut-Yuksel 2014), perceived quality of life (Kesternich et al. 2014), and social and risk attitudes (Conzo and Salustri 2017; Voigtländer and Voth 2015; Bucciol and Zarri 2015; Bellucci et al. 2020). In addition to physical victimization, lack of familial and social support, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) emerge as candidate explanations to these negative impacts (Lustig et al. 2004; Pynoos et al. 2001). In fact, PTSD has been shown to persist over time well after the trauma, as documented by medical studies conducted on adults exposed to holocaust in the childhood (Kestenberg 1992; Lev-Wiesel and Amir 2003; Kuwert et al. 2008; Yehuda et al. 2007 and 2008), although other studies documented a reduction in PTSD as time since the traumatic event passes (e.g., Frankenberg et al. 2008). On the other hand, another strand of literature suggests that war or other traumatic events witnessed in the past do not translate into lower well-being in the future. Research on resilience has shown that children recover rather quickly from trauma since they tend to adapt rapidly (Garmezy 1993; Boyden and Mann 2005). Thus, adverse events in childhood may not have major or long-lasting effects (Masten 2001). Positive psychological changes, instead, emerge because of higher appreciation of life after a traumatic experience. In this regard, it has been shown that exposure to war does not reduce life expectancy (Sagi-Schwartz et al. 2013) or mortality (Todd et al. 2017). Along these lines, some groups exposed to violence—e.g., the Jewish Holocaust survivors (Carmil and Breznitz 1991; Sigal 1998) and the Palestinians exposed to the first Intifada (Barber 2008)—appear resilient and politically engaged (Masten 2001; Werner 2007; Forstmeier et al. 2009), registering positive life changes in struggles with major life crises (Calhoun et al. 2000; Amir and Lev-Wiesel 2001; Lev-Wiesel and Amir 2003). These positive effects are consistent with the “post-traumatic growth” hypothesis: individuals who witnessed serious hardships develop “a significant beneficial change in cognitive and emotional life” (Tedeschi et al. 1998, p.3) that allows them not only to bounce back from trauma but to further develop and grow (Calhoun and Tedeschi 2014). The previous discussion points to psychological consequences of exposure to war during childhood, which may (or may not) persist over time and have an impact on the formation of expectations about survival even at older ages. Some studies have examined the psychological construction of the determinants of survival expectations. Consistently with the idea that stress and anxiety are likely to create negative perceptions and thoughts about the future, they have been found to negatively impact subjective life expectancy, a close measure to SSP (Joubert 1992; Lester and Abdel-Khalek 2007; Griffin et al. 2013). On the opposite, dispositional optimism, a generalized expectancy that good things will happen in the future and bad things will not, has been found to be positively associated with subjective life expectancy (Griffin et al. 2013). Similarly, Kobayashi et al. (2017) showed a positive effect of an individual’s positive psychological state on expectations about survival. Based on the abovementioned studies on the legacies of childhood traumas and on the psychological determinants of expectations about survival, two competing hypotheses can be formulated. They lead to opposite predictions about the effect of war exposure on subjective survival probabilities. A negative effect can be hypothesized if children exposed to the traumatic events of the Second World War (WW2) manifest signs of PTSD also in the adulthood. A positive effect, on the contrary, is expected if, through the adverse life experience of WW2, individuals learn to appreciate their life to a larger extent and become more resilient and optimistic about their recovery capacity (post-traumatic growth, or PTG). The current study enters this debate with the aim of providing new causal evidence on whether, and in which direction, exposure to WW2 during childhood affects subjective survival probabilities in adult life. We contribute to both the literature on the long-lasting effects of war exposure during childhood and on the formation of subjective survival probabilities in at least four directions. First, we consider a novel policy-relevant outcome for the literature on war exposure, i.e., subjective survival probabilities. Drawing from the above-mentioned studies, long-lasting psychological distress in the aftermath of a traumatic event would lead individuals to produce pessimistic expectations on their survival chances, whereas PTG and life appreciation would generate more optimistic expectations of survival. Second, from a methodological point of view, we rely on a representative sample of European adults who happened to be exposed or non-exposed (or exposed to a varying extent) to WW2 early in life. This study exploits WW2 as a large-scale natural experiment, in which individuals from different cultural, economic, and institutional contexts faced a common shock, but were differentially exposed to it as a result of their date and place of birth. This characteristic of WW2 provides our results with higher external validity than those in most of the aforementioned studies, which focus on a single country or on a circumscribed population (Carmil and Breznitz 1991; Kestenberg 1992; Sigal 1998; Lev-Wiesel and Amir 2000; Masten 2001; Barber 2008; Werner 2007; Yehuda et al. 2007 and 2008; Kuwert et al. 2008; Bundervoet et al. 2009; Forstmeier et al. 2009; Sagi-Schwartz et al. 2013; Akbulut-Yuksel 2014; Singhal 2018). Third, in order to explore the mechanisms behind our results, we use retrospective data and test if the socio-economic status of the family at the time of the war, the absence of a parent, and episodes of dispossession and hunger during WW2 absorb the effect of war on subjective survival probabilities. Such early-life circumstances are shown to be important predictors of human capital outcomes (Kesternich et al. 2014; Havari and Peracchi 2017; Islam et al. 2017) and hence emerge as candidate mediators of the war effects also on subjective survival probabilities. Fourth, by exploiting the rich set of information on health conditions contained in the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we also test whether early-life exposure to war moderates the negative effects of health impairments on subjective survival probabilities. If it is found that war exposure reduces the negative influence of bad health conditions on survival probabilities, this would offer support to the PTG hypothesis. Identification of the causal effect of WW2 in our study rests on two sources of plausibly exogenous variation, i.e., month-place of war events and month-place of individuals’ birth. Thus, the estimated impact of war exposure on later life subjective survival probabilities lends itself well to a causal interpretation. We also implement a series of robustness checks that additionally increase the validity of our results. The empirical strategy of this paper allows also to net out confounding effects deriving, for instance, from heterogeneity in the extent of destruction and recovery capacity of the respondents’ regions, or in the human capital outcomes and childhood characteristics of the surveyed individuals. Our results show that individuals exposed to WW2 episodes early in life report, on average, higher subjective survival probabilities than those who were not exposed. The effect of war exposure is larger if the number of war events the respondent has been exposed to is above the median. Current health conditions and behaviors, proxies for socio-economic status both in childhood and adulthood, or other childhood characteristics mediate the effect only marginally. In addition, hunger episodes and socio-economic conditions are the only childhood factors that play a role in subjective survival probabilities, though only through their effect on health and economic status in adulthood. However, even after adjusting for all the aforementioned factors, the effect of war on subjective survival probabilities persists. Importantly, exposed and non-exposed respondents do not show different health outcomes in later life. This fact, jointly with low mortality rates and scarring effects for the cohort under investigation (e.g., Havari and Peracchi 2017), leads us to exclude selective mortality and post-traumatic stress as possible mechanisms driving our findings. On the other hand, war exposure counterbalances the negative effects of bad health conditions on subjective survival probabilities. This result suggests that personal growth and life appreciation may emerge after traumatic events, thereby leading to higher subjective survival probabilities for individuals exposed to WW2.",2

Moen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"OECD countries are struggling to increase their retirement ages to cope with rapidly ageing populations. Conditions imposed by multilateral organizations in the context of public debt relief programs also impose an increase in the retirement age. For instance, during the Eurozone debt crisis, the memorandum of understanding between the Greek Government and the Troika of creditors (the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission) asked for a higher retirement age. In Spain, during the execution of the financial sector rescue program in 2012 the Spanish government was induced to carry out a pension reform aimed at slowing down the rise of pension expenditures. In the case of Italy, the ECB letter outlining the conditions for the massive purchase of government bonds in August 2011 asked for a radical pension reform increasing the retirement age in the midst of a major recession. These reforms meet harsh political opposition even when the increase in the retirement age is temporary, and not only from the workers whose retirement is postponed. Employers oppose the reforms because they close a soft landing scheme widely used in countries with strict employment protection legislation when dealing with redundancies. We document in this paper that there is indeed a negative cross-country correlation between effective age of retirement and strictness of employment protection. An additional factor driving the opposition to reforms is the widespread belief that an increase in the retirement age would crowd out young workers. This lump-of-labor argument is not new. It has been widely used in the past to justify the introduction of early retirement schemes (see Boldrin et al. (1999)). Such a deeply rooted perception was strengthened in the last decade by the observation of diverging trends in employment rates of older and young workers, notably in the aftermath of reforms increasing the retirement age. For instance, in Southern Europe the decline in youth employment ranged between 34% (Italy) and 57% (Spain) while the employment rate of those aged 55 and more was increasing. Economic theory provides solid arguments against the idea that the total number of jobs or of working hours is fixed (Walker 2007). Since employment headcounts or hours worked are key endogenous variables, there is no reason to expect that their total number should be fixed. By the same token, the argument that mandatory reductions in working hours or early retirement options are warranted in order to create employment opportunities for those currently not working has no economic basis. This lump-of-labor concept can be shown to be fallacious on the basis of any undergraduate economics textbook. Standard price theory suggests that forced reductions in labor supply will induce wage adjustments offsetting any potential creation of employment opportunities for those currently not working. However, this argument assumes perfect labor markets, where both wages and employment can freely adjust to changes in the institutional environment. Under more complex (and realistic) institutional configurations, including strict employment protection legislation and wage rigidities, sound economic theory does not rule out trade-offs between employment of young, middle-aged and older workers in the short run, and particularly not under recessions, when the adjustment is carried out mostly along the labor demand schedule. Most of the empirical work to date testing the lump-of-labor idea has been focusing on the intensive margin of employment, drawing on mandatory workweek reductions. For instance, Hunt (1999) analyzed the reduction of standard working hours enforced in Germany through collective agreements in the period 1984 to 1994, which reduced the standard workweek from 40 to 36 hours. Her main findings are that actual working hours followed standard hours quite closely, and monthly wages were hardly affected by the reduction in working hours because workers through bargaining obtained a sufficient increase in their hourly wages to compensate for the reduction in working hours. As a result, the reductions in standard hours caused employment losses among men. France gave researchers other natural experiments. The standard (mandatory) workweek was reduced from 40 to 39 hours in 1982. Crépon and Kramarz (2002) found that this increased the average wage rate, inducing a decline in total employment. Another French experiment that received considerable attention is the 35-hours work week introduced in 1998 with the deliberate goal of reducing unemployment. Although this time the employment costs were partly mitigated by large state transfers to firms that reduced working time, there was an aggregate destruction of jobs (Estevão and Sá 2008). The lump-of-labor arguments were also falsified by a more recent study on mandatory working hours reductions in Japan and Korea (Lee et al. 2012). Surprisingly enough, there is fairly little empirical research on the effects of policies operating along the extensive margin, notably increasing the retirement age. Such policy interventions pose conceptually a different problem than reductions in working hours, because they involve potentially intergenerational substitution of workers. Early retirement has stronger interactions with tenure-related wage policies of firms and employment protection legislation. The effects of an increase in retirement age and labor demand are indeed more subtle than a simple exogenous shift in labor supply. This is because most of the individuals involved are already employed and can not be easily fired. Empirically, the effects of discrete changes in retirement age on labor demand for different age groups have only partly been investigated, and mostly by using cross-country comparisons capturing, at best, only the long-run effects of changes in the statutory retirement age. Retirement is considered by this literature as an irreversible flow from employment to inactivity, while during recessions most of the flows into retirement originate from unemployment, and a non-negligible fraction of retirees continue working after drawing a pension. More importantly, the empirical literature on retirement is typically focused on the labor supply side, and hence ignores trade-offs arising on the demand side, notably in terms of labor costs and intergenerational substitutability of workers. In this paper we treat pension reforms increasing the retirement age as forced expansions at the firm level.Footnote 1 As noted above, such an expansion will be totally offset by wage adjustment if wages and employment were fully flexible. However, when wages are rigid in the short run, and employment protection laws prevent firms from downsizing their stock of older employees, an unexpected closing of the retirement door leads to a forced retention of older employees, and to a sizeable cost shock for firms. This may have ambiguous short-run effects on labor demand for young, middle-aged and older workers. As our model indicates, forced expansion of old workers at the firm level gives rise to two effects: First, there is a negative scale effect due to decreasing returns to scale, reducing the marginal productivity of workers of all ages. Second, there may be a positive complementarity between workers of different ages, which may tend to increase labor productivity of young and middle-aged workers. Which one of the two forces dominates is an empirical matter. The core of our contribution is to investigate empirically the impact of an increase in retirement age on labor demand. We take Italy as a case study, as it is a country with strict employment protection legislation and where a major retirement reform took place in December 2011 in the middle of a run on the Italian public debt. Under the pressure of markets and international organizations, Italy suddenly increased the retirement age by up to six years for some categories of workers. This policy change is now known as the “Monti Fornero reform”, and the paper estimates its effect on intergenerational labor demand at the firm level. We have access to a unique dataset from the social security administration (INPS) archives covering 90% of private employment, unambiguously identifying in each private firm the fraction of workers locked in by the sudden increase in the retirement age. We propose a novel identification strategy that makes it possible to estimate the effects of the lock in of older workers on the intergenerational profile of labor demand. In particular, we isolate the exogenous variation in the share of older workers in a firm, by instrumenting this share by the region, sector and contract-specific mortality rate. Our results indicate that an increase in the number of workers locked in crowds out mostly middle-aged workers, while leaving young workers largely unaffected. We also find that there is not a one-to-one increase in the number of older workers in the firm, as perhaps some of them may find alternative exit routes from employment. The results survive to a variety of robustness checks and holds, although at different intensity, across heterogenous groups (such as temporary or permanent workers, white-collar or blue-collar workers, different sectors). The paper first presents some facts about the evolution of the retirement age in OECD countries and employment rates of young and older workers. Next, it surveys the existing literature on retirement and labor demand across age groups. Then, in Section 4 a simple model of intergenerational labor demand is provided. Section 5 describes in some details the pension reform that took place in Italy in December 2011. In Section 6 we describe the data and spell out the empirical strategy. Section 7 presents the basic empirical results, carries out robustness checks, and provides a discussion of our results. The final section offers a short summary and suggestions for further research.",7

The rise in life expectancy holds true for both men and women, at various ages, and across countries, although recently life expectancy has plateaued, if not fallen, in the UK and the USA (e.g., Case and Deaton 2015; Chetty et al. 2016; Marmot et al. 2020). But are longer lives more satisfied lives? This question is vital for individuals and public policymakers because longer lives might come at the price of lower quality and life satisfaction in old age. Longer lives will be less valuable to people if the additional life years are spent in dissatisfaction and this causes overall life satisfaction (i.e., life satisfaction totaled over the life course minus a death value) to decrease. Both issues are pivotal in the context of private and public decision-making, where decision makers may face the tradeoff between lengthening human life and enhancing the quality of life. Despite its importance for public policy and individuals, little is known about how life satisfaction in old age has changed with improved longevity over time. The previous literature has almost exclusively focused on health-related measures (e.g., Crimmins and Beltrán-Sánchez 2011; Jagger and Robine 2011; and Chatterji et al. 2015 for recent reviews), although health is only one determinant of life satisfaction (Easterlin 2002, 2003) and people partially adapt to poor states of health (Oswald and Powdthavee 2008; McNamee and Mendolia 2014). Evidence on life satisfaction and related concepts of well-being is limited to studies that investigate time trends of average and cumulative life satisfaction (e.g., Perenboom et al. 2004; Yang 2008; Realo and Dobewall 2011), or that analyze patterns of life satisfaction across a person’s lifecycle (e.g., Blanchflower and Oswald 2004, 2008; Baird et al. 2010). However, these studies fail to control for time to death (Gerstorf et al. 2010) and reveal little about changes in terminal life satisfaction over time. Moreover, due to their reliance on cross-sectional data, studies are often unable to separate age, cohort, and period effects (Schilling2005). In this study, I combine two approaches to investigate how life satisfaction in old age has changed with improved longevity in West Germany between 1985 and 2011. The time-to-death approach estimates time trends of average life satisfaction by time to death. This approach focuses on the last five years of life because, unlike earlier life years in old age, these years are characterized by a sharp satisfaction decline (Gerstorf et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2010). Due to its distinction by time to death, this approach can uncover varying end-of-life satisfaction patterns in aging societies across time, such as a shift in the onset or a change in the slope of terminal decline. Hence, this approach is particularly useful for informing end-of-life decision-making in modern societies. The life-expectancy approach estimates time trends of satisfied life expectancy at age 60. Satisfied life expectancy at age 60 is a summary measure that collapses age-specific mortality and satisfaction prevalence rates observed in a given year into a single number. It provides information on the number of satisfied life years that a member of a 60-year-old life table cohort can expect to live given age-specific mortality and satisfaction prevalence rates as of that year. This approach adds to the time-to-death approach by accumulating satisfied life years beyond the age of 60 (analysis in absolute terms) and relating them to total remaining lifetime (analysis in relative terms) for the average individual. In doing so, it weighs increases in (satisfied) lifetime against possible satisfaction losses at the end of life and, thus, informs policymakers about the overall value of longer lives.Footnote 1 To overcome the major shortcomings of previous studies, I use data from the longest running household panel with continuous information on overall life satisfaction, the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). This data set is unique in that it allows researchers to closely follow a respondent’s life satisfaction over the life course until death for more than 30 years now. Due to its longitudinal structure and a large set of controls, this data set allows me to rule out many alternative explanations for the observed life satisfaction changes over time, including, for example, compositional, cohort, period, and time-in-panel effects. This study contributes to the existing literature in four important ways. First, it is the first study to analyze how life satisfaction in the final period of life has changed with improved longevity over time. It provides evidence that the terminal decline in life satisfaction holds over time but has increased in length and magnitude of decline, thereby adding to the small but growing literature on end-of-life satisfaction (e.g., Gerstorf et al. 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Palgi et al. 2010; Berg et al. 2011). Second, this study challenges the conclusions that were drawn about life satisfaction in aging societies based on the age-satisfaction curve (e.g., Steptoe et al. 2015). By introducing a novel framework, this study highlights the importance of the final period of life, as opposed to age, when drawing conclusions about satisfaction patterns in aging societies across time. Third, contrary to most related studies that exploit variation in longevity over time to study well-being in aging societies (e.g., Perenboom et al. 2004; Yang 2008), this study carefully explores the role of explanations other than improved longevity. Therefore, it can exclude a large set of alternative explanations for the satisfaction decline in West Germany over time. Fourth, this study furthers our understanding of successful aging by shedding light on two important mechanisms: health and social isolation. Although these mechanisms are not new to the literature (see Oswald and Powdthavee 2008 for the former and Helliwell 2003, 2006 for the latter), this study is the first to show that health and social isolation also play an important role in aging societies over time. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some background information and gives an overview of related studies. Section 3 discusses the framework that motivates the two empirical approaches of this paper. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents the time-to-death approach and its results. Section 6 presents the life-expectancy approach and its results. Section 7 discusses two potential mechanisms (health and social isolation) and provides some evidence for these mechanisms. Section 8 concludes and provides some policy implications.",7

In most OECD countries, the labor market performance of immigrants lags behind that of the native-born population (OECD 2016). A crucial factor shaping the career success of immigrants is the acquisition of language skills in the destination country’s language. Language proficiency is necessary to obtain information about jobs and to be able to apply for a job. Moreover, many jobs—especially skilled jobs—require language skills in the host country’s language so that workers can communicate with supervisors, peers, customers, and business partners. Immigrants who speak the local language are more likely to find a job and more productive on the job (Chiswick and Miller 2014). In this study, I analyze a language training program for unemployed immigrants in Germany and estimate employment effects for participants in 2014 up to 2 years after the start of the course. This language course is unique in that it focuses on professional aspects. Moreover, some of its features, like application training and work placements, go beyond the contents of a pure language course and are comparable to active labor market policy (ALMP) measures that bring participants into contact with the labor market. Numerous studies show that language skills are important for immigrants’ labor market success. Chiswick and Miller (2014) provide a comprehensive overview of research findings from different countries. Most studies analyze the effects of language proficiency on earnings and find a positive impact (e.g., Bleakley and Chin 2004; Chiswick and Miller 1995; Miranda and Zhu 2013; Ferrer et al. 2006; Budría and Swedberg 2015; Di Paolo and Raymond 2012; Chiswick 1998; Dustmann 1994; and Dustmann and van Soest 2001, 2002). Other studies also consider other labor market outcomes, such as employment (Dustmann and Fabbri 2003; Yao and van Ours 2015) and hours of work (Yao and van Ours 2015). Given that the vast majority of studies find positive effects of language proficiency on immigrants’ labor market success, formal language training could be a helpful means to accelerate integration into the host country’s labor market. In contrast to the extensive literature on the language skills of migrants and the clear evidence for positive labor market effects, there is less evidence on the role of formal language training, and the existing results are mixed. Hayfron (2001) analyzes the impact of language training for immigrants in Norway and finds it improves language skills but has no effect on earnings. Clausen et al. (2009) use Danish data on different active labor market programs and language courses for newly arrived immigrants and show that the improved language proficiency of language course participants has a positive impact on the hazard rate to employment. Sarvimäki and Hämäläinen (2016) find positive earnings effects of the introduction of integration plans for unemployed immigrants in Finland, which, among other things, involved immigrants spending more time in language courses. Åslund and Engdahl (2018) analyze performance bonuses in immigrant language training in Sweden and find no effects on average student achievement but positive effects for specific groups. Lochmann et al. (2019) show that very basic language training provided in France increases the labor force participation of immigrants but has no impact on employment or even on language proficiency. Some studies attribute the observed absence of positive effects of language training on employment (or earnings) to courses covering a very basic level of language proficiency (Lochmann et al. 2019). Moreover, many previously adopted integration measures, such as language courses, have not particularly been aligned with the needs of the labor market (OECD 2017). One exception is the language program I evaluate here. I contribute to the literature by estimating causal effects of a unique language training program with a strong focus on employment-related topics. The program teaches job-specific vocabulary and applications (e.g., writing applications or emails to business partners) of the German language. The language program ends with an internship, during which the participants come into contact with the job market and can directly apply their newly acquired language skills. The internship also provides an opportunity to establish contact with potential employers (BAMF 2013). Evidence on other ALMP programs shows that programs that are closely linked to the labor market, such as wage subsidies and work experience programs, are especially effective in improving immigrants’ labor market prospects (Rinne 2013; Butschek and Walter 2014). For example, Clausen et al. (2009) find that among different active labor market programs for immigrants in Denmark, only wage subsidies increase the hazard rate into regular employment. Thus, combining language training with labor market contact could make the language program studied here especially effective.Footnote 1 For the analysis, I use high-quality administrative data from the German Federal Labor Agency (FEA). In addition to information on participation in language training, the data include detailed information on the employment and unemployment histories of workers and their individual characteristics. As language skills are not observed in my data, I apply an instrumental variable approach to address unobserved heterogeneity. I use the exogenous variation in local language training intensity at the regional level, which is the job center level in my case.Footnote 2 Differences in local language training intensities can be caused by differences in local labor market conditions but also by differences in job centers’ policy styles. The underlying premise of this approach is that local decision makers at job centers have broad discretionary power in regard to the implementation of different labor market programs. As there are no concrete assignment rules, local job centers can choose their individual mix of programs, which is partly determined by their individual experiences and preferences. Policy styles vary between job centers and affect the probability of being assigned language training but are exogenous to jobseekers’ labor market outcomes. After controlling for regional- and individual-level confounders, residual variation in language training intensity reflects the policy styles of job centers. Several studies have exploited regional variation in the policy styles of employment agencies and partly used an instrumental variable approach to analyze the effects of several labor market programs (Frölich and Lechner 2010; Lechner et al. 2013; Markussen and Røed 2014; Boockmann et al. 2014; Dean et al. 2015; Caliendo et al. 2017; Eppel 2017; Dauth 2020). Following this approach, I identify causal effects by addressing selection into the studied program based on unobservable characteristics. I find that the language training program for professional purposes examined here increases participants’ employment probability by more than 9 percentage points after 2 years. In comparison to results found in other studies on language training, this is a highly positive effect, which may be explained by the program’s strong orientation towards the needs of the labor market and its practice-oriented design, which includes an internship. Although there is no significant effect on cumulated employment and earnings 2 years after the start of the program because of a strong lock-in effect during language training, the analysis shows that participants are more likely to find stable and substantial employment. Subgroup analyses show that the early provision of language programs benefits the labor market integration of immigrants. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting considered, followed by a description of the data used for the empirical analysis and of descriptive statistics provided in Section 3. Section 4 presents the econometric approach employed. Section 5 presents the empirical results and Section 6 concludes.",6

School closures of this dimension are unprecedented in modern history (Insights For Education 2020). When instruction is given online, lack of in-person schooling can have negative impacts on children’s development, health and well-being (see, e.g., Donohue and Miller 2020, Dooley et al. 2020). Early evidence suggests a “COVID learning gap”, with increased social disparities in learning outcomes (Engzell et al. 2021), possibly driven by parents with higher social background giving more extensive support to online learning (Bacher-Hicks et al. 2020). Moreover, the value of lost lifetime income due to reduced human capital and reduced parental labor supply is substantial. In Norway, for example, it is estimated at NOK 1.7 billion (200 million USD) each day schools remain closed (Andresen et al. 2020). Studies from Japan suggest that school closures can have deterimental effects on the health of mothers (Yamamura and Tsustsui 2021) and children (Takaku and Yokoyama 2020). Due to their potentially detrimental consequences, school closures have been among the most controversial virus containment policies. To weigh the burdens of school closures against increased contagion risk, policymakers need precise knowledge of how school closures and reopenings affect contagion rates for teachers, students and parents. In this paper, we assess the effects of school reopenings on the number of tests and confirmed incidence of COVID-19 for teachers, students and parents. While the initial school closures were implemented as part of a broader set of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including the closure of many in-person businesses, the timing of school reopenings did not coincide with any other major policy shifts. School reopenings thus provide an attractive context for isolating the impact of school closure policies. To identify the effects of reopenings, we implement a difference-in-differences research design, comparing outcomes before and after schools reopened across groups with different levels of exposure to in-person schooling. Specifically, we compare outcomes for teachers (grades 1–13) to comparable professionals, high school students (ages 17–19) to young adults aged 20–22, and, finally, parents of high school students (ages 17–19) to parents of young adults aged 20–22. We rely on rich register data covering the universe of Norwegian residents. These data include individual-level data on COVID-19 testing and test results, occupation and industry, as well as other demographic information. We can connect children to parents, enabling comparisons of infection rates and testing among parents with (high) school children to parents of young adult children who recently graduated high school. Similarly, the granular data allow us to identify teachers in elementary and secondary schools as well as comparison groups. Our main findings can be summarised along the following lines. First, we show that confirmed incidence rates for students, parents and teachers track closely with rates in their respective comparison groups throughout the first wave of the pandemic, including the school reopening. Consistent with this, event study models fail to find evidence that the timing of school reopenings corresponds with a significant shift in confirmed incidence for either students, parents, or teachers. This result holds both in the country as a whole and in separate analyses of the capital region, which had a relatively higher infection incidence. The precision of our estimates allows us to rule out large increases in confirmed incidence following reopening; e.g., the estimated 95% confidence interval for teachers allows us to rule out increases in confirmed incidence larger than 2.1 weekly cases per 100,000 teachers. Overall, our findings suggests that in a context of low contagion rates, where social distancing policies are maintained both in schools and in society as a whole, school reopenings do not necessarily lead to increased incidence among affected groups. Our findings contribute to the sparse body of knowledge on the impact of school closures on COVID-19 infections. In a recent systematic review, Walsh et al. (2021) identified only ten empirical studies of the effect of school closures on the spread of COVID-19. Effects ranging from no impact to substantial reductions in incidence and mortality were reported. Importantly, most studies could not isolate the effect of school closures. In addition, the studies with the least issues from confounding were among the studies that reported no effects. To our knowledge, only a few quasi-experimental studies aim to identifying the causal effect of school closures on COVID-19 infections. Vlachos et al. (2021) exploit the fact that upper secondary schools in Sweden moved to online teaching, while lower secondary schools did not. They compare teachers and parents of students in the last year of lower secondary school to teachers and parents in the first year of upper secondary school and find somewhat higher infection rates among teachers and parents of the former group. The studies closest to our study, von Bismarck-Osten et al. (2020) and Isphording et al. (2020), exploit similar variations in school closures and reopenings resulting from staggered summer holidays across German regions. These two studies estimate effects of school summer holidays, finding little evidence that school reopenings increased the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, the summer holidays are a period of vast travel in Germany, where people typically travel to regions that had higher infection rates (von Bismarck-Osten et al. 2020). Moreover, Germany introduced a policy of testing travellers at an increasing rate during the summer holiday, potentially changing recorded infection rates even if there were no changes in the true underlying incidence. In contrast, our study estimates effects of school reopenings in a context of extremely limited travel. We leverage individual-level data on testing and show that there was little difference in testing between our treatment and comparison groups. Finally, while von Bismarck-Osten et al. (2020) and Isphording et al. (2020) analyse data at the county-age group level, we leverage linked individual data on occupation and family linkages to identify teachers and parents, groups that have the highest exposure to in-person schooling. Our findings are also related to the rapidly expanding literature on the effects of other non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the spread of the virus (Bonacini et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2020; Lyu and Wehby 2020; Qiu et al. 2020; Sears et al. 2020; Kahanec et al. 2021; Juranek and Zoutman 2021). More generally, our findings shed light on patterns of COVID-19 transmission among teachers and students. Current research suggests that Norwegian teachers had relatively low contagion levels compared to other professions during the spring of 2020, and somewhat elevated levels during the fall of 2020 (Magnusson et al. 2021). Our approach adds to the understanding of contagion in schools by analysing whether changes in contagion and testing around the time of reopening are larger for teachers than for comparable groups. Current evidence suggests that severe consequences of COVID-19 disease are rare in children. However, children’s role in the transmission of the virus is still subject to some debate, and while symptomatic children are found to shed virus in similar quantities and to infect others in a similar way as adults, it is unclear how infectious asymptomatic children are (ECDC 2020). In addition, because children are more often asymptomatic, they are less likely to be tested, thus causing a potential under-reporting of COVID-19 prevalence among children. However, a study comprising systematic testing of contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in 13 outbreaks in schools in the Norwegian capital region during August–November 2020 found minimal transmission from children (below age 14) to peers and adults (Brandal et al. 2021). In this study, we also present some evidence on effects of school reopenings for fourth graders (age 10) compared with fifth graders (age 11). Because schools reopened 2 weeks earlier for the former group, we also compare changes in COVID-19 infection and testing rates among these two groups (and their parents). In accordance with our main results, we find no evidence that school reopenings led to increased infection rates among these two groups. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents relevant background on COVID-19 infection rates and testing in general, and in Norway. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy in this paper, and Section 4 describes the data and presents some summary statistics. In Section 5, we present the results together with a set of robustness checks. Section 6 presents extensions and mechanisms. Section 7 provides a discussion, and Section 8 concludes.",4

By the beginning of March, the early spread of the COVID-19 epidemic led to a debate in France about whether the first round should be postponed. This option was finally rejected and Emmanuel Macron—the French President—announced on the evening of March 12 that the election would take place as planned. This decision was accompanied by the announcement of the closing of all schools and universities by March 16 and was followed by an announcement by Edouard Philippe—the then-Prime Minister—on March 14 about the closing of all non-essential public spaces by the next day to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This marks the start of anti-contagion policies in France. According to an Odoxa opinion poll (Odoxa 2020) published on March 12, 64% of French people approved of the decision to maintain the election and 61% of voters reported that the epidemic would not change their decision to vote. On March 15, 19,863,660 out of 44,650,472 voters in metropolitan France cast their vote, with no alternative but to go to the voting booth in order to do so. Although people were advised to maintain distance while voting and to use hand sanitizer, there was little availability of masks at the time and the recommendation for the general public was to not wear them since it was then believed that COVID-19 mainly spread via droplets rather than via aerosols, so that maintaining distance and hand hygiene would be enough to prevent contamination. On March 16, Emmanuel Macron announced that strict lockdown measures would be put in place from March 17 onwards and that the second round of the municipal elections was postponed sine die. The second round eventually took place on June 28, 2020, after anti-contagion policies had drastically reduced the circulation of COVID-19. In this paper, we show that the first round of 2020 municipal elections caused an acceleration of the COVID-19 epidemic in metropolitan France. Our estimates suggest that elections accounted for at least 3,000 excess hospitalizations by the end of March, which represents 11% of all hospitalizations by this time. Our methodology takes advantage of electoral turnout differences between départements—the third-highest administrative level—to distinguish the impact of the election on hospitalizations from that of simultaneously implemented anti-contagion policies. Our approach builds on methods from the abnormal financial returns and public policies evaluation literatures.Footnote 1 We proceed in two steps. We first fit for each department a simple epidemic model of hospitalizations for COVID-19 suspicion over the period that excludes hospitalizations that might relate to events that took place by March 15 or in the following days. We then use these models to predict the evolution of the epidemic in each department if propagation conditions were held constant and compute daily predictions errors as the difference between the realized and predicted cumulative number of hospitalizations in each department. Second, we relate prediction errors to turnout and to differences in the epidemic stage across departments by that date. This approach allows us to assess the causal effect of elections on hospitalizations while accounting for other contemporaneous events, such as anti-contagion policies, that were a priori uniform throughout the country. This approach explicitly accounts for different dynamics at the local level and builds on the assumption that prediction errors should not be related to turnout and epidemic stage on March 15 in the absence of an effect of the election on hospitalizations. We show that post-calibration errors are increasing with turnout in departments where COVID-19 was actively circulating on the day of the election. In contrast, turnout is not related to post-calibration errors in locations with low COVID-19 activity by March 15. These results reveal the impact of the first round of municipal elections on the COVID-19 epidemic. Applying the same methodology to the second round of the election, held on June 28 after a severe lockdown was implemented, we do not find a detrimental effect of the second round. Our identification strategy is akin to a quadruple-differences method, effectively taking advantage of the following differences: the within-department difference between realized and predicted hospitalizations; the within-department difference between periods before and after the election; the between-departments difference in electoral turnout; and the between-departments difference in epidemic stage on election day. This combination of differences allows us to asses the causal impact of the elections on hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Importantly, our estimation strategy also allows us to effectively remove the first-order effect of factors that might explain differences in the dynamics of the epidemic, such as population density or the population structure. As highlighted by Hsiang et al. (2020), most studies that analyze the impact of policies on COVID-19 rely on complex epidemiological models that require a detailed knowledge of the fundamental epidemiological parameters of the epidemic. Our approach, taken from the standard methods of reduced-form econometrics commonly used to assess the impact of public polices (Angrist and Pischke 2009), does not require such detailed information. It allows us to disentangle the impact of the election from others confounding shocks that may have hidden it without requiring much information about mechanisms of the epidemic. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the link between elections and the COVID-19 spread. Section 3 presents and discusses our methodology. Section 4 presents the results of our analysis of March 15 elections. Section 5 retrospectively discusses the expected impact of the second round of the municipal elections. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",2

Considered by UNICEF a form of violence against women, the practice of underage cohabitation, also known as child marriage, is associated with worse health, education, labor force participation, offspring mortality, and participation in household decisions (Parsons et al. 2015).Footnote 1 In recent decades, decreasing the prevalence of this practice has become a priority for policy-makers of international organizations and developing countries. Moreover, most of the countries with a high prevalence of child marriage have ratified various international agreements, such as the CEDAW, the CCMMAMRM, and the Maputo Protocol that promote the enactment and enforcement of minimum-age-of-marriage laws.Footnote 2 The fight against child marriage has also mobilized considerable resources through integrated programs and national alliances targeting the cultural, social, and economic causes of this widespread practice. Although the overall prevalence of child marriage is declining over time, the eradication of this practice is currently far from becoming a reality (UNICEF 2014; Jensen and Thornton 2003). One of the countries that has embraced the battle against child marriage is Ethiopia. The flagship measure of the Ethiopian federal government aimed at addressing this problem is the Revised Family Code (RFC), which was approved in July 2000. This law raised the legal age of marriage for females from 15 to 18 years in some regions of Ethiopia, while leaving the legal age of marriage for men unchanged at age 18. The law banned underage marriage rather than underage cohabitation. However, since unmarried cohabitation is heavily stigmatized in Ethiopia (Jones et al. 2016), it is plausible that the increase in the legal age of marriage for women has resulted in an increase in the age at cohabitation. This study uses age discontinuities in the degree of exposure to the RFC as an exogenous source of variation in women’s age at cohabitation to investigate the causal effect of delaying cohabitation during a woman’s teenage years on the probability that her first-born child will die in infancy, while also assessing the mechanisms through which early cohabitation might affect infant mortality. The novelty of the analysis presented in this study is based on three main contributions. First, reducing child marriage and infant mortality are central priorities in the policy agenda of many developing countries (Weldearegawi et al. 2015), and the literature has documented the positive association between these two outcomes (Raj et al. 2010). However, since it is possible that the association that these studies detected was driven by unobservable factors, the extent to which child marriage has been contributing to the high prevalence of infant mortality in many developing countries remains unclear. In this study, I add to the thin body of evidence that rigorously explores the latter question (Chari et al. 2017) by documenting the perverse causal effect of child marriage on infant mortality in Ethiopia and by investigating the mechanisms driving this link. Second, although my identification strategy does not allow me to estimate the causal effect of raising the legal age of marriage, the results of my analysis suggest that many women reacted to the increase in the legal age of marriage by postponing cohabitation. The latter finding indicates that even in contexts where the capacity of the state to enforce the law is limited, legal reforms can help to tackle cultural practices that are deeply rooted in tradition. Third, unlike previous studies that used age at menarche as an instrumental variable for child marriage, I address endogeneity in the link between women’s age at cohabitation and socioeconomic outcomes by exploiting age discontinuities in the effective legal age of marriage for Ethiopian females. Using information on women’s month and year of birth from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), I apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the fact that women who were under age 15 when the RFC was introduced were exposed to a legal age of marriage at age 18, whereas women who were age 15 or older when the RFC was introduced had the opportunity to legally marry before they turned 18. The increase in the age at cohabitation that was caused by being fully exposed to a legal age of marriage of 18 is then used as an instrumental variable to estimate the causal effect of delaying cohabitation on the probability of a woman’s first-born child dying in infancy. The estimates for the causal effect of child marriage reveal that, on average, a 1-year delay in a woman’s age at cohabitation during her teenage years decreases the probability of infant mortality for her first-born child by 3.8 percentage points. This is a substantial effect given the mean of 10%. These results are robust to the use of different bandwidths, estimation techniques, and identification strategies, including a difference-in-differences design that exploits the staggered introduction of the law across Ethiopia. Additionally, the results of various placebo tests rule out the possibility that the impact on infant mortality was driven by other legal provisions included in the RFC or other policy interventions implemented around the same time, systematic differences between women born in different months of the year, systematic manipulation of the age reported in the survey, selective migration, or secular trends in infant mortality. The results of the analysis of mechanisms indicate that the impact of delaying a woman’s age at cohabitation on the probability of infant mortality for her first-born child is mainly channeled through the positive effect of delaying cohabitation on the age of the woman at first birth. Other possible channels such as an effect of early cohabitation on woman’s education, marriage market outcomes, labor market outcomes, and participation in household decisions are explored and dismissed in the light of the evidence. The study is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on the socioeconomic effects of child marriage. Section 3 discusses the incidence of child marriage in Ethiopia and presents the law that raised the legal age of marriage for women from 15 to 18 years in some regions of the country. Section 4 introduces the identification strategy and Section 5 describes the data used in the main analysis. Section 6 presents the main results, examining their robustness to the use of alternative estimation methods, bandwidths, and placebo tests. Section 7 investigates the channels through which early cohabitation could affect infant mortality. Finally, Section 8 concludes the study.",6

Danzer,Carsten Feuerbaum,Ludger Woessmann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Many societies wonder about the best policies to integrate immigrants. One important question is the regional allocation of immigrants. To prevent excessive ethnic concentration, many European countries have dispersal policies that assign refugees to regions (Dustmann et al. 2017). Existing evidence tends to suggest, though, that enclaves may in fact facilitate the labor market integration of immigrants (Schüller 2016), presumably through positive network effects within ethnic groups (Dustmann et al. 2016). The successful integration of immigrants into host country societies in the long run may depend on the intergenerational effects of ethnic concentration on the immigrants’ children. Immigrant children’s proficiency in the host country language and their educational attainment play a particularly important role in long-term employment opportunities and in cultural and social integration (e.g., Schnepf 2007; Dustmann and Glitz 2011; Chiswick and Miller 2015). On the one hand, children’s language acquisition as well as educational and labor market integration may benefit from ethnic enclaves that provide useful information, reduced discrimination, and positive role models, e.g., through ethnic entrepreneurs (Andersson et al. 2021). On the other hand, immigrant children may also potentially be hindered by limited exposure to native children, reduced options for language acquisition, and lower socioeconomic opportunities for their families. In this paper, we study the effect of regional ethnic concentration on the language proficiency and educational attainment of immigrant children. Our analysis exploits the regional distribution of immigrants in 1975/1985 based on the placement policy of the German guest worker program. Between 1955 and 1973, the German government actively recruited foreign workers to fill low-skilled labor shortages. The guest workers were enlisted in various countries of origin and then quasi-exogenously placed across West German firms. Workers could not choose specific firms and firms could not choose specific workers, and firms had no prior information about workers’ specific skills or other characteristics. Once recruited, the program implied a guaranteed immigration permit and immediate placement and job start. Location preferences of guest workers were not considered, and they were not free to change location during a lock-in period. The guest worker population was mainly low-skilled: Only 7% had completed over 12 years of education (compared to 27% of other immigrants in Germany at the time), and more than one-third had left school without any degree. The skill level of guest workers was stable over the entire placement period (Marplan 1982). The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) allows us to extract a sample of roughly 1000 children whose parents immigrated into Germany from five different countries of origin during the period of the guest worker program. In contrast to administrative datasets, the SOEP household panel provides information on these children’s host country language proficiency, as well as their educational attainment. In addition, the SOEP contains rich information on parents’ speaking and writing abilities, friendships with Germans, and indicators for parents’ social and labor market integration that allows us to analyze factors that may mediate the effect of ethnic concentration on child outcomes. We merge the SOEP data on individual immigrant children with administrative data on the regional concentration of different ethnicities. The initial regional assignment of guest workers gives rise to what we view as plausibly exogenous variation in ethnic concentration across regions, reducing the concern of potential bias from endogenous sorting of immigrants into enclaves of co-ethnics. A limitation of our data is that we do not observe guest workers’ initially assigned location but only their location in 1985, requiring the identifying assumption that guest workers did not self-select across regions between their arrival in the 1960s/1970s and 1985 in ways that are systematic to our relationship of interest. We argue that this assumption is warranted in our setting by specific features of the German guest worker program: The work permits required guest workers to stay in the initially assigned region for a lock-in period of several years, and immediate integration into the labor market upon arrival minimized incentives to move to other regions. Two pieces of evidence further corroborate the assumption. First, we show that in 1985, demographics of guest worker parents and their children are balanced across regions with low and high ethnic concentration. Second, we show that in the 10 years after 1985, the movement of guest workers across regions was orthogonal to ethnic concentration and to our outcome measures. To additionally account for any type of region-specific or ethnicity-specific differences, our models include region and ethnicity fixed effects. Region fixed effects ensure that any region-specific peculiarities are accounted for to the extent that they are common across guest worker ethnicities. Ethnicity (country-of-origin) fixed effects ensure that any ethnicity-specific differentials in integration are accounted for to the extent that they are common across regions. Thus, we identify the effect of ethnic concentration by observing immigrants who are exposed to differential concentrations of co-ethnics within the same region, thereby alleviating concerns of potential bias from endogenous location choices and from unobserved factors of different ethnic groups such as differing baseline willingness or disposition to integrate. Our results indicate that growing up in ethnic enclaves significantly reduces immigrant children’s proficiency in the host country language and their educational attainment. In particular, a one log-point increase in the size of the own ethnic group in the region—equivalent, e.g., to increasing an ethnicity’s share in the regional population from 1.0 to 2.8—leads to a reduction in the German speaking proficiency of the children of the guest worker generation by 19% of a standard deviation, and a reduction in the German writing proficiency by 17% of a standard deviation. In addition, a one log-point increase in exposure to own ethnic concentration increases the likelihood that the immigrant child drops out of school without any degree by 5.6 percentage points, a large effect given the average of 7.1%. Although less robust, there is some indication that ethnic enclaves also reduce the probability of obtaining an intermediate or higher school degree. Effects tend to be larger for those immigrant children who were born abroad, but they do not differ significantly by gender. The rich background information on children and parents contained in the SOEP allows us to analyze several mediating factors. Potential mechanisms underlying the negative effect of growing up in ethnic enclaves include parents’ lower host country language proficiency, reduced interactions with natives, and lower wages and employment opportunities of immigrant parents. We find that differences in parents’ ability to speak the German language—which is strongly related to their children’s German language proficiency—can in fact account for much of the effect of growing up in ethnic enclaves. Once parental German speaking abilities are controlled for, the estimated effect of ethnic concentration on children’s language proficiency is reduced to close to zero. In this analysis, it proves essential to address measurement error in the self-reported parental language measure by implementing an instrumental variable approach that uses parents’ responses on the same survey item from consecutive years (leads and lags) as instruments (Dustmann and van Soest 2002). While measures of parental writing abilities, friendships with German children, visits from Germans at home, parental unemployment, and household income are also significantly related to immigrant children’s language proficiency, they do not account for the negative effect of ethnic concentration. None of the investigated mechanisms can account for the negative enclave effect on school dropout. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. We use alternative functional forms for the measure of ethnic concentration, instrument ethnic concentration at the time of observation (1985) by the ethnic concentration observed a decade earlier, use social-security and census data to construct the ethnic concentration measure, measure ethnic concentration at different levels of regional aggregation, and account for interview mode (which may influence self-assessed German language proficiency). We also show that after 1985, neither return migration nor regional migration within Germany were selective with respect to ethnic concentration and that ethnic concentration did not affect family size. Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. A number of papers address the link between ethnic enclaves and the human capital acquisition of immigrant children. Grönqvist (2006) finds lower university attainment among refugees in enclaves in Sweden. Cortes (2006) detects no test score disadvantages for enclave schools in the USA. Jensen and Rasmussen (2011) find lower test scores among immigrant children in enclaves in Denmark. In the one previous study directly addressing bias from self-selection into ethnic enclaves, Åslund et al. (2011) use a refugee placement policy in Sweden and find that the concentration of highly educated co-ethnics positively affects the achievement of immigrant students in school. We contribute to this literature by providing novel evidence for a different group of immigrants (low-educated guest workers in Germany), by studying effects on language skills, and by finding that in a different setting, ethnic concentration can have a negative effect on immigrant children’s language proficiency and educational attainment. Given the shared emphasis on identification, it is useful to provide a comparison of our study with the Swedish study by Åslund et al. (2011). The main differences relate to the target population and to the results. Guest workers in Germany arrived with a signed labor contract and were quasi-exogenously distributed across regions, whereas Sweden assigned refugees according to municipal integration capacities, which were related to labor market and educational opportunities. Since all guest workers in Germany were employed upon arrival, our study can switch off one potential channel of how enclaves affect human capital outcomes of children. While our setting focuses on children of a rather homogeneous group of low-skilled labor migrants, an important aspect of Åslund et al. (2011) is to focus on a heterogeneous group of partly well-educated refugees: The sample share who completed over 12 years of education in their setting (39%) is more than five times as large as in ours. Most obviously, our main finding also differs strongly from the Swedish study, indicating that existing evidence from humanitarian immigrants may not generalize to other settings and that any effect of ethnic concentration may strongly depend on the skill and employment levels of co-ethnics in the enclave.Footnote 1 A vast literature studies the effects of ethnic enclaves on the economic integration of adult immigrants (see Schüller 2016, for an overview). Using dispersal policies in Sweden and Denmark, respectively, Edin et al. (2003) and Damm (2009) find positive network effects of ethnic concentration on immigrants’ labor market outcomes. By contrast, studying the same setting as in our paper, Danzer and Yaman (2016) and Constant, Schüller, and Zimmermann (2013) find negative effects of ethnic concentration on adult immigrants’ proficiency in the host country language and their cultural integration, respectively (see Chiswick 1998, for similar results for Israel). In a different German setting, Battisti et al. (2016) find positive short-term but negative long-term effects of ethnic concentration on labor-market outcomes, with the negative effect being related to lower human capital investments and larger job mismatch. Generally, there is growing awareness that immigrants tend to assimilate as communities, emphasizing the importance of ethnic links (Hatton and Leigh 2011). Beyond immigrant integration, another large literature studies the effect of spatial segregation and concentration on the economic success of racial minorities, usually finding negative effects (e.g., Cutler and Glaeser 1997; Fryer 2011). More generally, a growing literature studies the effect of exposure to different quality neighborhoods during childhood on children’s outcomes in the short and long run (e.g., Chetty et al. 2016; Chetty and Hendren 2018; Gibbons et al. 2013, 2017). We contribute to this literature by estimating well-identified effects of growing up in low-skilled ethnic enclaves on the language proficiency and educational attainment of immigrant children and by providing a rich analysis of mediating factors. Our findings indicate that parents’ limited proficiency in speaking the host country language is a key mediating factor of the negative impact of ethnic enclaves on immigrant children’s language proficiency. By contrast, limited interaction with natives and parental economic conditions do not seem to be leading mechanisms. Overall, the opportunity to benefit from large social networks of co-ethnics may be particularly relevant for newly arriving immigrants, but less so for the long-term integration of the children of settled immigrants. In fact, most of the arguments in favor of ethnic enclaves tend to relate to the labor-market integration of adult immigrants but bear less relevance for integration beyond the labor market. Regarding the cultural and educational integration of the immigrants’ second generation, our results suggest that the dispersal policies of several European countries may indeed facilitate integration. In what follows, Section 2 provides institutional background on the German guest worker program. Section 3 describes the SOEP household data and the administrative data used to compute ethnic concentrations. Section 4 introduces our empirical model and shows balancing of demographic characteristics across regions with low and high ethnic concentration. Section 5 presents our main results on the effect of ethnic concentration on immigrant children’s outcomes. Section 6 investigates the relevance of several potential mediating factors. Section 7 provides a number of robustness analyses. Section 8 concludes.",2

Sabia,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"I do think you have to anticipate that this is another [COVID-19] surge event…You had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol. Then these individuals all are going in cars and trains and planes going home all across the country. So this is an event that is going to have public health consequences. Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, January 11, 2021 On January 6, 2021, thousands of supporters of President Donald J. Trump gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest the US Congress’s certification of Joseph R. Biden’s election as the 46th president of the USA. The protest was part of a series of so-called Stop the Steal events held throughout the country following the November 4, 2020 elections. Organized by right-wing populist activists, the January rally was designed to delegitimize President Biden’s election with claims of widespread voter fraud (Sardarizadeh and Lussenhop 2021). While some media reports suggest that the Capitol attack was planned days in advance (Hsu et al. 2021), thousands did heed the President’s call on the afternoon of January 6 to “take back our country” and marched to the Capitol Building. There, the violent intentions of some protesters became known through their physical assaults on Capitol police, penetration of multiple police barricades, and destruction of property in the US Capitol Building (Peñaloza 2021). As of December 2, 2021, 604 individuals involved in the riot were charged with federal crimes (United States Department of Justice 2021).Footnote 1 As much of the public discussion surrounding the Capitol riot was coalescing on its effects on democracy and national unity during the peaceful transition of executive power, public health officials also warned of another threat from the riot: a surge of COVID-19 infections (Ellis 2021). In early January, the USA was in the midst of one of the worst periods of contagion since the onset of the pandemic (Zraick and Robbins 2021). Compared to the 7-day average of US coronavirus cases during the summer of 2020, which was below 100,000, the COVID-19 daily case rate more than doubled to 200,000 per week by early 2021, with over 25 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 420,000 COVID-19-related deaths by January 25 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021).Footnote 2 In the midst of this national surge, there was justifiable public health concern that the January 6 Capitol protest could be a “superspreader” event for COVID-19. COVID-19 is spread via droplets from respiratory expulsion such as breathing, speaking, coughing, or sneezing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a; Fineberg 2020). With widespread distribution of an effective vaccine not yet a reality, public health experts continued to recommend social distancing from non-household members and mask-wearing in public as the most effective strategies to mitigate spread of the novel coronavirus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020b). According to media reports, however, very few Capitol protesters wore masks at the event (Ellis 2021), and fewer still socially distanced from non-household members while protesting (Mandavilli 2021). Moreover, the victims of those who broke federal law by violently entering the Capitol Building often were sometimes forced to choose between their immediate physical safety and their health. Lawmakers, congressional staff members, and law enforcement officials stationed at the Capitol were forced to break social distancing and mask-wearing rules as they attempted to flee violent attack by rioters and sought cover together in small, locked rooms in the Capitol (Cochrane 2021). Dr. Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predicted that the Capitol riot would spur a surge of COVID-19, not only from the increased risk posed to local residents of Washington, D.C., but also for those who have traveled long distances to attend the event and then returned back to their homes (Wilner 2021).Footnote 3 While epidemiologists have nearly uniformly predicted that large gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to community-level spread, the actual public health impacts of such events have been far more heterogeneous (Dave et al. 2020a, 2021a, 2021b; Ahammer et al. 2020; Carlin et al. 2020). This is, in part, because narrow epidemiological arguments often fail to consider health- or violence-related risk avoidance behaviors of non-participants (Dave et al. 2020a),Footnote 4 the impact of increased congestion on stay-at-home-behavior, or the relative risk of counterfactual behaviors in which participants and non-participants would have been engaged in the absence of the gathering (Dave et al. 2020a). This study is the first to estimate the impact of the January 6 Capitol riot on mobility and community-level COVID-19 spread. First, using data on anonymized smartphone pings from SafeGraph, Inc., from January 1 through January 12 and an event-study framework, we document that the January 6 events increased total and non-resident cellphone pings by almost 500 percent in the census block groups (CBGs) that contained the Ellipse, the National Mall, and the US Capitol Building. While some of this increase in pings may be explained by the gathering of US representatives (Congresspersons and Senators) for the presidential election certification, the size of protesting crowds — numbered in the thousands — vastly dwarfs the number of federal representatives and staffers, and, as America learned, the number of Capitol police. When we examine the home resident counties from which January 6 protesters came, we find that 2.4 percent of total smartphone “pings” came from Washington, D.C., residents, 21.9 percent came from bordering Maryland and Virginia, and 75.7 percent came from outside of these judications. Turning to stay-at-home behavior, we detect some evidence of risk avoidance in response to the Capitol Riot, as local residents increased full-time stay-at-home behavior and percent of time spent at home in the period surrounding and following the Riot. This finding is consistent with violence- or health-related risk-averting behavior. Moreover, some of the increase in stay-at-home behavior appeared to continue beyond the days surrounding the protest, consistent with “lockdown conditions” in many quarters of the District in the period leading up to the inauguration of President Biden. Finally, we explore local and nationwide community spread of COVID-19 following the Capitol riot. To explore local spread in Washington, D.C., we use a synthetic control design, creating a “synthetic Washington” using counties with similar urbanicity rates, COVID-19 policy (and testing) environments, and pre-treatment rates of COVID-19 cases and growth rates. We omit from the donor pool those counties with residents whose smartphones were detected at the Capitol riot on January 6 to avoid spillovers.Footnote 5 Our results provide no evidence of community-level COVID-19 spread in the month following the Capitol riot. This may be explained, in part, by risk-averting behavior by local residents and the partial District lockdown. Then, we use a dose–response “difference-in-differences” approach to explore whether county-level COVID-19 cases spread faster in counties outside of the District that drew larger shares of residents to the protest relative to counties without attendees represented in Washington, D.C. Our results provide evidence that the Capitol riot may have contributed to COVID-19 spread in resident counties with relatively higher inflows of Capitol protest participants. For the highest inflow counties, we find that the Capitol riot was associated with a 0.004 to 0.010 increase in the rate of daily cumulative COVID-19 case growth in the month following the event. We conclude that the Capitol riot may have contributed to non-localized community-level COVID-19 spread. Together, our findings document the health impact of the January 6 Capitol protests, which contributes to a more complete accounting of the event’s societal impact. Our findings also add to evidence on differences in behavioral responses that may affect contagious disease spread. Among communities that engage in risk avoidance behaviors (i.e., District residents in the face of the January 6 protests, local communities in the face of Black Lives Matter protests, and residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma following President Trump’s June 2020 campaign rally), infectious disease spread may be curbed. On the other hand, large in-person gatherings among individuals and home communities who do not endogenously engage in risk-offsetting behaviors (i.e., 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally participants and 2021 Capitol protest participants) can generate “super spreader” non-localized disease spread.",1

Economists have exploited the staggered repeal and invalidation of Comstock laws in the 1960s that made it legal to prescribe and distribute the contraceptive pill to adult women (Bailey, 2010), as well as policies governing the right of young, unmarried women to consent to the pill in the 1960s and 1970s (Goldin and Katz 2002; Bailey 2006; Guldi 2008; Hock 2007; Ananat and Hungerman 2012; Steingrimsdottir 2010; Bailey et al. 2012; Zuppann 2012b; Myers 2017). Economists also have exploited the early repeal of abortion bans in certain states to estimate the effects of abortion legalization in the early 1970s (Angrist and Evans 1996; Gruber et al. 1999; Levine et al. 1999; Ananat et al. 2009), but only a few papers additionally consider whether young, unmarried women could consent to abortion services at the time those services were legalized (Hock 2007; Guldi et al. 2008; Myers 2017). The internal validity of the difference-in-differences research designs used in these papers requires careful and comprehensive coding so that the policy environment is fully and accurately described. It is therefore dismaying to discover that there is a great deal of dissonance in the policy coding used by different researcher teams. For example, four papers in the “power of the pill” literature that exploits policies governing young women’s legal confidential access to the pill in the sixties and seventies disagree on the year in which young women gained the right to consent to the pill for 35 of 51 states and the District of Columbia (Goldin and Katz 2002; Bailey 2006; Hock 2007; Guldi 2008). These discrepancies are neither limited to one set of authors nor are they small. Goldin and Katz (2002) and Bailey (2006) differ for 25 states by an average of 2.6 years, Goldin and Katz (2002) and Hock (2007) differ for 25 states by an average of 3.3 years, and Bailey (2006) and Hock (2007) differ for 23 states by an average of 4.0 years.Footnote 1 Similarly, the two empirical papers that had previously coded young women’s confidential access to abortion in the 1970s differ on the year minors gained confidential access to abortion for 18 states (Hock 2007; Guldi 2008). These discrepancies have the potential to substantially impact empirical estimates. In Myers (2017) I revisit the results in Goldin and Katz (2002) and Bailey (2006) and demonstrate that errors and omissions in policy coding contributed to the earlier authors’ overestimation of the effects of contraceptive policy and underestimation of the effects of abortion policy. Furthermore, in Myers (2017) I demonstrate that abortion legalization did not have homogeneous effects across states, but instead that the effect of legalization on young women’s fertility was amplified when the policy environment permitted young unmarried women confidential access to abortion. This current paper is written for scholars seeking to understand the complex history of policies that have shaped young women’s legal access to contraception and abortion in the USA over the past 60 years and to code this policy environment accurately and comprehensively for their own empirical analyses.Footnote 2  I begin with a broad overview of the complicated interplay of common law precedents, state legislative actions, and state and federal judicial rulings that determine when and where contraception and abortion are legal and young women can confidentially access to these services without involving a parent or judge. This review covers the invalidation and repeal of Comstock laws following the introduction of the pill in 1960 and continues through the reform and repeal of abortion laws and policies governing young unmarried women’s confidential access to the pill and abortion through the late 1970s. I also consider the contemporary era of abortion policy, discussing and providing dates for “parental involvement laws” requiring parental notification or consent for minors’ abortions enforced since 1980. I then provide recommended state-by-state coding of the years these policy changes occurred. Finally, I compare this suggested coding to policy coding schemes used by various authors in prior work, document differences across the schemes, and reconcile these differences wherever possible. For readers interested in more state-specific details and documentation, a lengthy online appendix and Myers (2022a) provide a detailed state-by-state review with complete citations of the primary and secondary sources that underpin the state policy coding. These citations reflect an extensive review of primary sources that include annotated statutes, judicial rulings, and state attorney general opinions, and of historical newspapers and medical journals providing evidence of how policy changes were implemented. I also incorporate information from snapshots of the policy environment afforded by reports from the Council of State Governments (1972, 1973), U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1974, 1978), the Center for Adolescent Health and the Law (2006), NARAL (1989–2014), and the Guttmacher Institute (2017a, 2017b), and by a series of scholarly papers published in Family Planning Perspectives (Pilpel and Wechsler 1969, 1971; Paul et al. 1974, 1976). In addition, I review and incorporate information from Merz et al. (1995), who review minors’ access to abortion through the early 1990s, and from Bailey and Davido (2009), who provide information on the enforcement of state Comstock laws. In doing so, I provide a thorough overview of policy changes based on primary sources, augment this with information from secondary sources, consolidate information from other reviews, and reconcile substantial disparities in previous policy codings. This exercise produces a set of unified policy codings, corrects previous errors, and clearly flags states where policy changes were ambiguous and reasonable scholars may disagree. As a result, this more clearly defined and unified set of variables will serve as a useful resource to other researchers. Scholars already have used this revised coding to explore the dynamics of state policy liberalism (Caughey and Warshaw 2016) and to estimate the effects of confidential access to contraception and abortion (Steingrimsdottir 2016; Myers 2017; Cragun 2019; Beauchamp and Pakaluk 2019; Jones and Pineda-Torres, 2021; Lindo et al. 2020; Myers and Ladd 2020; Rim 2021; Forsstrom, 2021; Farin et al., 2021). Readers who are interested in obtaining datasets with policy coding corresponding to this review can find them at Open Science Framework (Myers 2022b).Footnote 3",3

Countries in Asia and North Africa have skewed sex ratios due to sex-selective abortions, female infanticide, and the gross neglect of the health and nutrition of females (Chao et al. 2019). In response to this demographic crisis, several countries, including India and China, have passed laws prohibiting sex-selective abortions in order to reverse alarming imbalances in the sex ratio (Gupta 2019). However, where such laws cannot change the underlying social norms driving son preference, they may simply encourage households to shift to gender discrimination at different margins (Goodkind 1996). The passing of abortion laws has been found to lead to improved health and educational outcomes for the marginal child (Gruber et al. 1999; Pop-Eleches 2006; Ananat et al. 2009), including outcomes that extend well beyond birth, such as the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity in early adulthood (Donohue et al. 2001), as well as fertility decisions made by those children (Gutierrez 2022). In these studies, all drawn from the USA and Europe, the child born at the margin of abortion is found to be relatively wanted and born at a time when parents can provide a relatively nurturing environment, leading to improved human capital outcomes. Similarly, access to sex-selective abortions in countries with strong son preference has led to improved health outcomes for surviving females, even as the number of female births has declined (Lin et al. 2014; Hu and Schlosser 2015; Anukriti et al. 2021). Surviving girls are both more wanted and more likely to be born into smaller families because parents are able to terminate unwanted female foetuses, leading to reductions in female infant and child mortality. Conversely, the removal of access to sex-selective abortions, while intended to improve female survival rates at birth, could also have the perverse effect of widening gender discrimination at other margins of parental investments. This paper analyses the impact of a ban on sex-selective abortions on parental investments in the education of their daughters. The relative increase in the number of female births could affect educational attainment in a number of ways. First, in line with the quantity-quality trade-off observed with respect to health outcomes, an increase in the number of unwanted female births could lead to lower parental investments in schooling due to discrimination, including through the channel of poorer health outcomes. Second, females could be born into larger families after the ban since families resort to fertility-stopping rules, where they keep trying for sons, leading to increased competition among siblings for household resources (Clark 2000). Third, changing access to sex-selective abortion could alter the characteristics of households into which girls are born. On the one hand, sex-selective abortions in India have been found to be more prevalent among educated, urban, upper-caste, and wealthy women (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Jha et al. 2006; Borker et al. 2019). If the ban was successfully implemented for all families, girls could subsequently be born disproportionately into higher-income households, where they would receive higher levels of educational investments (Edlund 1999). On the other hand, wealthier families may be better able to circumvent the ban on sex selection through the use of expensive, underground private-sector abortion clinics, leading to more girls being born into poorer families, with lower investments in schooling. Fourth, the relative increase in females also results in a form of a “marriage squeeze” against females in the marriage market, leading to parents investing more in desirable characteristics of their daughters, including in their education, so as to increase the probability of their matching with a high-quality groom (Lafortune 2013). The net impact on the gender gap in educational attainment is therefore ambiguous. In this paper, we exploit intertemporal and geographical variation in India in the implementation of laws prohibiting the use of sex-screening technology and sex-selective abortions to identify the impact of the ban on the probability of female births and on the educational attainment of surviving females. Laws banning the use of sex-screening technologies were introduced in India gradually from 1988 to 2002, presenting us with a natural experiment which can be used to identify the impact of these laws on our outcomes of interest. The first state to pass such legislation was Maharashtra in 1988, followed by a national law in 1994 extending to what were then 26 additional states and excepting the state of Jammu and Kashmir (henceforth JK). Finally, in 2002, a law was passed in JK as well. We first examine whether the ban did have an impact on the probability of female births. Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) have previously used village-level measures of the sex-ratio to identify an increase in the birth of females after the ban. We build on these results by using a nationally representative individual-level dataset and by using household-level quasi-exogenous variation in exposure to the ban. Following from previous studies that establish that the sex of the firstborn child is quasi-random and that the use of sex-selective abortions is concentrated among families that have a firstborn girl (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Anukriti et al. 2021), we estimate the impact of being born in a treated state after the ban was implemented into a household with a firstborn girl, compared to a household with a firstborn boy. We find a significant increase in the probability of a female birth of 2.5 percentage points, which is even larger among less wealthy households (in the bottom 60% of the wealth distribution). We next estimate the impact of the ban on the gender gap in educational attainment. We compare long-term schooling outcomes of females with males in treated states to find that the ban resulted in increased gender discrimination. Relative to males, females were 2.3, 3.5, and 3.2 percentage points less likely to complete grade 10, complete grade 12, and enter university in treated states, where there was a significant increase in female births. More specifically, while female educational attainment is unchanged, male educational attainment increases. Again, these results are driven by changes in educational investments made by less-wealthy households in the bottom 60% of the wealth distribution. Finally, we explore additional mechanisms that explain our results. We find that our results are driven by the fact that the surviving girls are relatively unwanted, compared to surviving sons, particularly in non-wealthy households, rather than by an increase in the total number of children due to the use of a fertility-stopping rule. We also find marriage market effects of the increase in female births after the ban, with women more likely to be unmarried by the ages of 15 and 18, and an increase in the age at marriage for those who are married. This suggests that the negative impact on the education of girls would have been further amplified in the absence of these marriage market effects. While several studies have analysed the impact of changing access to sex-selective abortions on health outcomes, there is little work on the impact on educational attainment. Anukriti (2013) examines the impact of changing sex ratios on the educational outcomes of women, finding that an increase in male-female ratios leads to a reduction in educational attainment for women relative to men, due to an increase in the bargaining power of women in the marriage market. Our analysis is different in several ways. Her main explanatory variable, sex ratio at birth, is defined and constructed at the state-year level. This variable could be correlated with other state-level outcomes, such as changes in development, rural infrastructure, and societal norms, that affect women’s education. Legal interventions targeted at sex ratios, on the other hand, provide an opportunity to test the impact of changing sex ratios on the educational attainment of women, without the usual endogeneity concerns that affect such analyses. Utilising an exogenous legal change, Kalsi (2015) finds that the legalisation of abortion in Taiwan led to an increase in university enrolment rates among females born at higher birth orders, but not for males, and argues this is an example of parents substituting from postnatal discrimination towards prenatal discrimination. However, in her paper, the change affects the whole country at once, making it difficult to separate out time trends in female educational attainment from the impact of the legal change. Our paper adds to this literature by exploiting the differentially timed implementation of a ban on sex-selective abortions in India to present causal estimates of the effect of changes in sex ratios on the gender gap in educational attainment. In doing so, we also provide robust evidence using alternative data to confirm the results of Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) on the impact of the legislation banning sex-selective abortions on the probability of female births. Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) use measures of village-level sex ratios taken from the Census in 1991 and 2001 to show that the passage of this legislation led to a relative increase in the number of females aged from 0 to 6 years in treated states. Nandi (2015) uses childbirth data from the District Level Household Survey (DLHS) to confirm that the ban led to an increase in female births in the treated state. However, one weakness of these two studies is that they only take a single control state, Maharashtra, into account in their analysis. We re-estimate and confirm their results using much more granular data on the complete fertility history of approximately 235,000 women and by using the quasi-random exogeneity of the sex of the firstborn child to show that the probability of a girl being born increases in treated states to families with firstborn girls when compared to families with firstborn boys. We also include two control states in Maharashtra and JK. A study conducted concurrently with this paper, by Sanjay and Dey (2019), also studies the causal impact of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostics Techniques (PNDT) Act on female educational attainment and finds that the ban on sex-selective abortions led to an increase in female educational attainment in absolute terms. There are several differences between that study and ours. First, Sanjay and Dey (2019) use data from only one state, JK, as a control for treated states. Further, their pre-treatment cohort, rather than being just prior to the ban, constitutes women born between the years 1973 and 1978, while their treatment group is 1996 and 2001. They do not estimate changes in female education relative to male education, and they do not make use of the quasi-exogenous variation in the sex of the firstborn child. Given their difference-in-differences framework with a single state, other changes taking place in JK could biasing their results, particularly when comparing cohorts that were born so far apart in time. Finally, this paper contributes to a literature on the unintended consequences of laws and regulatory actions aimed at improving the welfare of girls and women, particularly in a patriarchal environment with strong social norms around son preference. Bhalotra et al. (2020) find that passing legislation guaranteeing equal inheritance rights to women exacerbates son preference among Indian parents, leading to an increase in female foeticide, mortality, and son-biased fertility stopping. Anukriti (2018) finds that a conditional cash transfer program offered by a state government in India to reward couples for having either fewer children or more girls actually led to an increase in the male-female sex ratio as families with a strong preference for sons became more likely to have only one child — as long as the child was male, despite there being higher financial incentives offered for a single girl child. Our evidence on the impact of educational outcomes also raises concerns that punitive measures against the use of sex-selective abortions that only address a proximate cause of a skewed sex ratio can simply lead to other forms of gender discrimination and the relative neglect of females. Section 2 of this paper provides the context on the ban on sex-selective abortions in India as well as the theoretical motivation for this paper. Section 3 describes the data, Section 4 describes the empirical strategy, and Section 5 presents the results, as well as several robustness checks. Section 6 explores the underlying mechanisms driving the results and Section 7 discusses the findings of the paper.",1

Not surprisingly, the focus of the academic literature on unauthorized migration has been on the impact of irregularity on the host country. However, little is known about the consequences of irregular migration on sending countries. Studying the impact of illegality on the origin country is particularly important since unauthorized migration is often temporary, and many irregular migrants return to their home country either because they are deported or because they planned on temporary migration all along. Return migration is an important phenomenon in the broad picture of international mobility. Although statistics on return migration are not reliable, recent estimates are that roughly one-quarter of all migration events are returns (Azose and Raftery 2019). According to the OECD (2018), the five countries that experienced the largest outflows of foreign populations in 2016 were Germany (1.09 million), Korea (325,000), Spain (243,000), Japan (234,000), and the UK (195,000). At the same time, irregular migration has been on the rise. According to the European Commission, every year, between 400,000 and 500,000 foreign nationals are ordered to leave the European Union because they have either entered or stayed irregularly in the destination country. Irregular migration is not only an issue for OECD countries, but is also a challenge for the Gulf states and middle-income countries like Malaysia and Thailand. For example, the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that every year more than 660,000 people migrate irregularly to Thailand (Schloenhardt 2014). Another example is Mexico, known for being a major migrant-sending country to the USA, for its unauthorized emigration, and for its substantial return migration flows. According to the Mexican National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (ENADID), between 2009 and 2014, about half (48%) of the Mexican immigrant population in the USA was unauthorized, and one million Mexicans returned from the USA, leaving of their own accord (Gonzalez-Barrera 2015).Footnote 1 Many other developing countries are likewise experiencing high return migration rates, as well as an increase in unauthorized emigration. This paper is the first to examine the impact of undocumented migration status on migrants upon return to their home country. It investigates an unexplored question, namely the impact of the legal status of migrants on their wages upon return. We study the impact of return migration on wages by disentangling the effects of overseas legal versus illegal status and ask whether undocumented temporary migration has any impact on human capital accumulation that persists after return. From a conceptual point of view, temporary migrants might acquire human capital and skills due to their work experience abroad and hence earn higher wages upon return compared to non-migrants. However, whether all migrants, documented or undocumented, would benefit from their migration experience upon return is not straightforward. On one hand, if illegal status hinders the human capital accumulation and the skill acquisition of undocumented migrants, the well-evidenced wage premium witnessed by migrants upon return might not apply and we might expect that only documented migrants would benefit from their migration experience. On the other hand, the origin country’s labor market might reward the migration experience regardless of the documented or undocumented nature of migration. If the latter scenario applies, through a signaling mechanism, all migrants would benefit from their experience overseas, regardless of the nature of migration and/or of the human capital and skills acquired abroad. We contribute to the literature on undocumented migration, which is rather sparse given the lack of data. Hanson (2006) provides a survey of the determinants of illegal migration to the USA, focusing on the role of immigration policy and enforcement. Orrenius and Zavodny (2003) examine the impact of amnesty programs on undocumented immigration flows, while Orrenius and Zavodny (2005) study the effect of changes in border enforcement policies on the skill level of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the USA. A few papers have examined the return intentions of undocumented migrants. For instance, Vinogradova (2016) provides theoretical explanations for the optimal timing of return of undocumented migrants, whereby the threat of deportation increases uncertainty with respect to the length of the stay abroad, which in turn reduces the desired migration duration and triggers voluntary return. In line with this theoretical argument, several papers find that a significant share of unauthorized migrants intend to immigrate only temporarily and to eventually return to their home country (Borjas et al. 1991). Reyes (2001) finds that undocumented Mexican immigrants are much more likely to return than documented ones. Coniglio et al. (2009) find that more than 70% of irregular immigrants to Italy planned to return home after an average intended stay of 6 years and that high-skilled clandestine migrants are more likely to return to the origin country compared with those with no or low skills. On the other hand, other studies have found lower return rates among undocumented immigrants due to stricter border enforcement (Kemnitz and Mayr 2012; Massey et al. 2016). Focusing on the impact of illegality on the migrant, the literature has focused on a myriad of outcomes, including the labor market outcomes of undocumented migrants and their consumption behavior.Footnote 2 Under an Italian amnesty program, Devillanova et al. (2018) find that immigrants who are potentially eligible for legal status are more likely than ineligible undocumented immigrants to be employed. Using the 1990 Legalized Population Survey, Rivera-Batiz (1999) estimate a 52% wage penalty for Mexican undocumented immigrants in the USA, while Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark (2002) report a wage penalty that ranges between 14 and 24%. Phillips and Massey (1999) find that the Immigration Reform and Control Act in the USA, which made it illegal to hire unauthorized immigrants, is associated with a larger wage penalty for undocumented migrants as employers pass the costs of unauthorized hiring on to workers. Accounting for selection, Schluter and Wahba (2009) also find a significant effect of illegality on wages in the host country but mixed effects on remitting behavior. On the other hand, Dustmann et al. (2017) find that undocumented migrants consume about 40% less than documented migrants in Italy, partly due to their lower incomes relative to documented migrants. The literature has put forward several explanations for the worse outcomes experienced by undocumented migrants compared with documented migrants. First, several studies show that undocumented migrants have weak bargaining power due to the lack of legal work options. Without viable outside options, undocumented migrants are confined into poor jobs (Gonzales 2011; Gleeson and Gonzales 2012). For instance, undocumented migrants are more likely to work in physically exhausting and dangerous jobs and receive no compensating differential, which is analogous to receiving lower wages than documented workers with similar education levels (Hall and Greenman 2015). Second, the occupational choices of undocumented migrants might be limited by fear of exposure to apprehension by immigration enforcement agencies, and relatedly, being undocumented may limit workers’ ability to maximize their potential, which may lead to lower productivity (Ortega and Hsin 2018). Third, several studies highlight the increased risk of depression and anxiety among undocumented migrants—due to the threat of deportation and poorer labor market conditions—which is also likely to negatively affect worker productivity (Abrego 2011; Gonzales 2011; Patler and Pirtle 2018). There is also a well-established academic literature on the determinants and impacts of migration on countries of origin. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence showing that temporary migration can be beneficial for migrants who accumulate savings and skills, which they use to better themselves upon return (see Wahba (2014) for a survey of this literature). On the impact of temporary migration experiences on return migrants’ wages, several papers find that there is a positive wage premium for return migrants associated with overseas work experience (Co et al. 2000; De Coulon and Piracha 2005). Ambrosini et al. (2015) find that for a source country, like Romania, relatively high rates of temporary migration have positive long-run effects on average skills and wages. Lacuesta (2010) finds an 11% wage gap between returning migrants and observationally equivalent non-migrants in Mexico, but argues that this premium is the result of pre-migration differences in ability and not the result of human capital gains derived from migration. Reinhold and Thom (2013) also find a wage premium for Mexican returnees who worked in the USA. The return to a year of occupation-specific migration experience is estimated to be as high as 9% for some occupations. De Vreyer et al. (2010) examine the labor market outcomes of returnees in seven capital cities in West Africa and find that experience abroad results in a substantial wage premium for migrants returning from an OECD country but not for other return migrants. Controlling for the emigration and return migration selections, Wahba (2015) finds that return migrants experience a wage premium of 16% relative to non-migrants. However, none of these studies has examined the differential effects of return migration on wages with respect to migrants’ legal status. Our paper contributes to the literature in at least two ways. Firstly, while the literature on undocumented migration has focused on the impact of irregularity on destination countries, this paper is the first to investigate the impact of undocumented migration on migrants after they return to their origin country. This is particularly important since many unauthorized migrants return to their country of origin. Secondly, by disentangling the effects of migrants’ legal status, we contribute to the literature on the impacts of migration on origin countries, which has so far overlooked the question of undocumented migration. We use data from the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 2012), which has several major advantages. First, Egypt provides a particularly suitable case study since it is a country with substantial return migration. According to the ELMPS data, in 2012, 9% of individuals between the ages of 15 and 59 were return migrants.Footnote 3 This figure is in line with the World Bank report by Brodmann et al. (2010), who document that Egyptian migrants constitute 85% of temporary workers in Arab countries, representing as much as 10% of the Egyptian labor force in recent years. Based on the Development Economics Group data from the World Bank, Brodmann et al. (2010) show that, in 2005, Egypt was among the top 10 emigration countries in the world. Second, our data provides unique information on migrants’ legal status while abroad, which allows us to distinguish between return migrants according to their type of international migration—documented versus undocumented. Return migrants were asked whether they had a visa or legal document to enter the destination country, as well as the type of document they had. In this paper, illegal status/undocumented migration refers to unauthorized entry, stay, or employment in a country.Footnote 4 Generally speaking, misreporting information regarding migrants’ legal status is problematic. This is especially the case for studies that examine the impact of illegality from the perspective of the destination country, where migrants are asked—during ongoing migration spells—about their legal status. However, in our context, the issue of misreporting is much less of a concern since migrants have already returned to their origin country and there would be no repercussions at that stage. Our empirical analysis relies on a Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) model, following Roodman (2011). The CMP model takes into account the triple selection into emigration, into illegality, and into return migration, and allows us to estimate the effect of overseas illegal status on wages after return. We find that undocumented migrants witness a wage penalty relative to documented migrants but also relative to non-migrants, while only documented migrants witness a wage premium relative to non-migrants. Our benchmark results show an estimated 19% wage penalty for illegal migrants relative to non-migrants, while documented migrants witness a wage premium of 28% relative to non-migrants. Therefore, the wage penalty for undocumented migrants relative to documented migrants is estimated to be around 47%. However, we do not find any effect of migrants’ legal status on occupations or on labor supply upon return to Egypt. We investigate several underlying mechanisms that could be driving the undocumented migrants’ poorer labor market prospects upon return. We examine the effect of migrants’ undocumented status on various outcomes pertaining to the migration experience overseas. We find suggestive evidence of an overseas wage penalty associated with illegality, as our results show that undocumented migrants earn approximately half the wage of documented migrants while abroad. Moreover, our results suggest that undocumented migrants have significantly lower savings overseas, shorter migration duration, lower incidence of remitting, and lower ranked occupations overseas. Overall, these findings suggest that undocumented migrants’ lower earnings after return might be explained by a waste of human capital overseas. Indeed, we find evidence suggesting that the longer undocumented migrants stay abroad, the more their human capital is depleted, while the opposite is true for documented migrants. This is fully consistent with our descriptive analysis that shows that poor working conditions constitute the most important reason for return migration among undocumented migrants. This paper sheds light on the potential costs and penalties of unauthorized overseas work and migration. Our results contest the positive wage premium evidenced in the existing literature, and suggest that the positive impact of temporary migration experience on wages upon return is conditional on the type of migration undertaken and that only documented migrants benefit from their migration experience in terms of higher wages upon return to their home country. Understanding the impacts of undocumented migration on the migrant and the origin country is indeed paramount as the results of this paper suggest that the impact of temporary migration might actually depend on the legal status of the migrants. Therefore, ignoring the legal status of migration and its impact is likely to lead to erroneous policies. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of Egyptian migration, while Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 describes our empirical model and identification strategy. Section 5 presents the results and tests for various underlying mechanisms. Section 6 provides robustness checks, while Section 7 concludes.",2

Despite this long-standing interest, causal estimation of the relationship between temperature and overall conception rates is missing. Existing studies have only examined the effect of temperature on live birth rates, and they have found that exposure to hot temperature causes a decline in birth rates 9–10 months later (Seiver 1989; Lam and Miron 1996; Barreca et al. 2018; Cho 2020). Barreca et al. (2018) also have found that this decline is followed by a partial rebound in the next 3 months. More importantly, the impacts of climate change on human conceptions remain unexplored, even though the projected warming of the climate has prompted numerous studies of its effects on natural and human systems (Dell et al. 2014; Carleton and Hsiang 2016; Scheffers et al. 2016). While there is no causal evidence on the relationship between temperature and the human conception rate, the related literature points toward the existence of a negative impact. First, animal experiments suggest that males exposed to high temperatures are less fertile (Burfening et al. 1970; Wettemann et al. 1979; Jannes et al. 1998; Yaeram et al. 2006; Paul et al. 2008). Evidence suggests that the decreased reproductive performance is caused by impaired sperm quality (Jannes et al. 1998; Yaeram et al. 2006; Paul et al. 2008). Importantly, the impact of heat exposure on the fertilization rate and sperm quality is transitory, and the strongest effects are observed not immediately after the heat stress but a couple of weeks later (Burfening et al. 1970; Brito et al. 2003; Pérez-Crespo et al. 2008; Hansen 2009; Houston et al. 2018; Garcia-Oliveros et al. 2020). Heat shock also influences the maturation of the oocyte (Hansen 2009; Roth 2017), although the impact of preovulatory heat stress on females’ conception capability is less clear (Aroyo et al. 2007; Hansen 2009). Second, human studies have also shown that exposure to heat suppresses spermatogenesis (Macleod and Hotchkiss 1941; Robinson et al. 1968; Brown-Woodman et al. 1984; Carlsen et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2007; Ahmad et al. 2012; Garolla et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). Similar to the animal studies, these papers report a prolonged but reversible impact on various sperm parameters. In these experiments, the indicators of sperm quality gradually worsened but returned to the baseline levels at 5–12 weeks after the end of treatment. In this paper, we analyze the impact of ambient temperature on the overall human conception rate in a Central European country, Hungary. We use administrative data with full coverage on pregnancies recorded by the country’s health care system. Our data cover 6.8 million pregnancies with conceptions occurring between 1980 and 2015, including live births, spontaneous fetal losses, and induced abortions, incorporated into 37,440 county-year-week cells. To estimate the causal effect of temperature on the conception rate (defined by the number of conceptions per week in a given county per 100,000 women aged 16–44 years), we exploit the presumably random year-to-year variation in the calendar week–specific average temperature. We estimate a nonlinear temperature–conception rate relationship. We allow the weekly conception rate to be affected by lagged temperatures up to 25 weeks. This way, we can identify the potential delayed impacts or shifts in conception rates. Next, we combine our historical estimates with projections from 21 climate models to calculate the impact of climate change by the mid-twenty-first century (2040–2059). We project the impacts on the seasonal distribution of the conception rate and its annual level. We find that exposure to hot temperatures (daily mean temperature > 25 °C) has a deteriorating effect on conception rates in the short term (up to 5 weeks after the exposure), showing a U-shaped pattern over the first weeks with the strongest impact ranging from 2 to 4 weeks after the exposure. In addition, we find practically zero coefficients between weeks 6 and 10 and an increased conception rate from week 11 after the exposure, which suggests that exposure to hot temperatures changes the timing of some conceptions. We also show that seasonal differences in conception rates are likely to be larger by the mid-twenty-first century because of climate change. Conception rates in the summer and early autumn months are projected to decrease, whereas conception rates during winter and late autumn are projected to increase. In addition, the annual conception rate is projected to decline. This overall decline is primarily driven by a change in the number of induced abortions and spontaneous fetal losses rather than by a change in the number of live births. Finally, we show that although the overall number of live births will not change significantly as a result of climate change, future warming will change the season of the conception of some newborns. This shift could have important consequences on the affected newborns by altering their in utero temperature exposure. Our study provides several contributions to the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the impact of temperature on the human conception rate using data with full coverage on all pregnancies that are recorded by the health care system (live births, induced abortions, and spontaneous fetal losses). Although previous papers have studied the impacts on birth rates, they could not examine whether the estimated impacts are due to a change in the conception rate or are the results of a change in the risk of fetal loss (or both). As our data include clinically observed fetal losses, we can distinguish between these mechanisms. Using weekly data on conception rates, we are able to examine which pre-conception week is the most sensitive to temperature exposure. Our results may help to understand the channels through which temperature exposure influences human conceptions. Furthermore, we project the impacts of climate change on the overall human conception rate and examine the impacts by pregnancy type. Thus, our paper offers important insights into climate change policy.",6

But why do women keep choosing fields of study that lead to substantially lower-paid occupations (Blau and Kahn 2017)? Although societies have removed barriers to women’s participation in education and the labor force in an attempt to achieve gender equality, gender norms still play an important role for gender differences in behavior and, subsequently, economic outcomes (Akerlof and Kranton 2000; Bertrand 2011; Goldin 2014). In particular, unlike men, women still experience a substantial drop in labor earnings upon becoming a parent, in large part due to a decreased labor supply (Kleven et al. 2019). To better understand why women continue to behave in ways that lead to inferior labor market outcomes relative to those of men, it is essential to know more about the origins of women’s conformity to traditional gender norms.Footnote 1 In this study, I focus on the importance of one key aspect of the childhood family environment—sibling sex composition—for women’s socialization and development of gender conformity. To examine how sibling sex composition affects the development of women’s gender conformity, I use high-quality administrative data on the Danish population from 1980 to 2016. With this comprehensive dataset, I evaluate women’s conformity to traditional gender norms as measured through their choice of occupation and partner between ages 31 and 40 (proxied by the gender share in their own and their partner’s occupations, respectively). I further complement these measures of gender conformity with an examination of whether sibling sex differentially affects women’s response to motherhood in terms of labor supply and earnings. To examine gender-specific parenting as a relevant mechanism, I additionally link the administrative data to rich survey data. To provide causal estimates of the impact of sibling sex, I exploit the random variation in the second child’s sex in families with a first-born daughter, conditional on the parents’ having a second child. In other words, I compare the gender conformity of first-born women with a second-born brother to those with a second-born sister. While sibling sex composition has a small impact on family size, I show that family size is not a confounding factor for the effect of sibling sex composition on women’s gender conformity. This empirical approach distinguishes itself from most previous studies on sibling sex composition, which generally includes all siblings in both the measure of sibling sex composition and the estimation sample. However, as the final sibling sex composition in a sibship is endogenous, including all siblings might lead to biased estimates. By focusing on the second-born child’s sex, I avoid selection bias, as parents do not know the sex of their unborn child when deciding to have another child. My results show that having a second-born brother relative to a sister increases first-born women’s conformity to traditional gender norms. Specifically, women with a brother work in more female-dominated occupations during their thirties and choose more traditional partners. I next document that women with a brother experience a larger drop in labor earnings and accumulate less working experience from the time of their first childbirth through 9 years after, relative to women with a sister. What is even more striking is that this response to the arrival of the first child is entirely driven by women growing up in traditional families.Footnote 2 This effect on women’s gender conformity already appears in their first educational choice after compulsory education at age 16. In other words, the random event of the arrival of a brother to the family instead of a sister changes these women’s socialization within the family to such an extent that they are on a different career path early on. So how does sibling sex affect women’s conformity to traditional gender roles? I provide compelling evidence that an important channel is parents’ response to their children’s sex composition in terms of gendered parenting. Drawing on rich survey data, I examine mothers’ and fathers’ quality time investment in their first-born daughter during childhood and show that parents of mixed-sex children invest their time more gender-specifically compared with parents of same-sex children. This empirical pattern is consistent with a traditional household specialization model with gender-specific parenting human capital (Becker 1973; Becker and Tomes 1986). Mothers might have better knowledge than fathers of problems facing daughters and therefore have the comparative advantage of raising daughters, and vice versa for fathers and sons. Therefore, it would be optimal for the parents to gender-specialize their parenting in mixed-sex families by having the mother spend more time with the daughter and the father more time with the son. This suggests that parents of mixed-sex children more strongly transmit gender-specific human capital and thereby traditional gender norms to their daughters than parents of same-sex children. The results from heterogeneity analyses further show that the effect of having a brother is strongest for women from more traditional families. The key finding that women with a brother acquire more gender-typed human capital and pair with more gender-conforming men implies that they end up creating a more gender-stereotypical family environment for their children. Remarkably, I further show that the effect of sibling sex carries over to the next generation of girls: daughters’ comparative advantage in language over math in school is larger for those from more traditional families (i.e., for daughters of mothers with a brother relative to daughters of mothers with a sister). Thus, I find evidence of persistent long-run consequences of women’s childhood family environment. This demonstrates that women are not only sensitive to the gender role environment shaped in the family after their younger sibling’s birth (caused by sibling sex composition and unrelated to parents’ human capital), but girls are also sensitive to the degree of gender norms in their family environment already shaped before their birth (parents’ gendered human capital). In the existing literature, only a few related studies investigate how a sibling’s sex causally affects labor earnings.Footnote 3 Two recent studies find, similar to my findings, that women with a next-youngest brother experience lower earnings than those with a sister. Cools and Patacchini (2019) consider self-reported earnings around age 30 for cohorts born in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the USA,Footnote 4 while Peter et al. (2018) consider the average earnings between ages 25 and 64 for cohorts born in 1938–1977 using Swedish registry data.Footnote 5Cools and Patacchini (2019) suggest that their findings can be explained by lower parental investment (as measured through expectations and schoolwork monitoring) and more family-centered behaviors (fewer work hours and higher desired fertility). In contrast, Peter et al. (2018) find that women with a younger brother are slightly less likely to ever marry and have children,Footnote 6 while there is no effect on the total number of children. Instead, they argue that the negative effect of having a brother on women’s earnings could occur through increased unemployment, as the job search network of brothers is less relevant than the one of sisters. I complement these two recent studies and contribute more broadly to the literature studying how the social (in particular, the family) environment affects women’s conformity to traditional gender norms in three important ways. First, I provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of how sibling sex composition causally affects the development of women’s gender conformity, using three unique measures (choice of occupation, choice of partner, and the response to motherhood in labor market outcomes).Footnote 7Footnote 8 By focusing on the development of women’s gender conformity, I rigorously examine a potentially important underlying mechanism for the earnings effect. In particular, to reconcile the existing evidence of a “brother earnings penalty” with my findings on a differential response to motherhood by sibling sex, I show that the negative effect of having a brother on women’s earnings emerges exactly around the age when most women have their first child. Thus, the timing of the measurement of women’s earnings is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the brother earnings penalty in a modern setting with equal labor market performance between men and women prior to first childbirth (Kleven et al. 2019). Second, I conduct a large quantitative analysis of how sibling sex composition affects child-parent interactions, thereby providing evidence on a potentially important channel through which the effects on gender conformity operate. Third, I document lasting effects on the next generation of girls, thereby stressing the persistence of gender norms. Importantly, such analysis is only possible thanks to the rich and extensive data, including administratively reported family links.",5

36.0,1.0,Journal of Population Economics,07 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00883-w,Social assimilation and immigrants’ labour market outcomes,January 2023,Matloob Piracha,Massimiliano Tani,Ben Zhe Wang,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Recent literature has shown that ethnic identity/social assimilation plays an important role in the economic outcomes of immigrants (Constant and Zimmermann, 2008; Constant et al., 2009; Battu and Zenou, 2010;Bisin et al., 2011; Cai and Zimmermann, 2020; Carillo et al., 2021). However, there is no consensus in the studies as the results are highly dependent on the type of country under study and the type of data available to determine an immigrant’s ethnic identity. It is, therefore, important to further explore the conditions that affect ethnic identity in different settings and how those are related to the labour market performance of immigrants, especially given that different countries have different immigration and integration policies, and these policies change over time. We contribute to the literature by addressing the following questions: do immigrants who identify with the host country culture have a higher probability of getting a job as well as better wages than those who identify more with the culture of their country of origin? Is social assimilation associated with measures of employment ‘quality’ such as underemployment, satisfaction with job and pay, and job security? How is social assimilation associated with labour market mismatches? Do economic downturns affect immigrants with different levels of social assimilation differently? To the best of our knowledge, this is not only the first paper that uses Australian data to explore the association between social assimilation and labour market outcomes but also the first one in this literature to analyse questions the last three questions.Footnote 1 While ethnicity is generally considered a fixed trait during a person’s lifetime, ethnic identity can change over time.Footnote 2 At one extreme, immigrants may reject the dominant culture, whereas at the other extreme they may shun their own culture (language and/or religion) in favour of the dominant one (Battu and Zenou, 2010). A particular ethnic group can therefore form ‘oppositional identities’ where some belong to one group while others belong to the second group. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) argue that these extreme positions may be a result of discrimination or perhaps due to preferences for solidarity to one’s own culture and/or religion. Oppositional identities may produce economic and social conflict, resulting in adverse economic outcomes for those who strongly identify with their own ethnic background (Bisin et al., 2011).Footnote 3 As noted above, the existing literature has not reached a consensus on the role ethnic identity plays in immigrants’ economic outcomes. For instance, Carillo et al. (2021) use Italian data and show that ethnic identity has a significant positive effect on the probability of finding employment. Similarly, using Chinese internal migration data, Cai and Zimmermann (2020) find a positive and significant impact of assimilation on hourly wages, and assimilation also reduces the number of hours worked. However, Islam and Raschky (2015), using Canadian data, find a negligible effect of assimilation on immigrants’ labour market outcomes. Part of the reason for different results is the country context and the data used, but another aspect is how ethnic identity is measured. For instance, Casey and Dustmann (2010) and Constant and Zimmermann (2008, 2009) both use German data but do not find similar results, primarily because they use different definitions of ethnic identity and different immigrant groups. Casey and Dustmann (2010) follow the strand of literature in which the identity measure is based on immigrants’ self-reporting, generally in terms of their answer to two questions: how strongly do they feel they are from the host country, e.g. “how strongly ‘German’ do they feel”, and how strongly they feel connected to the country of origin, e.g. Turkey. The answers are based on a scale, which then determines their level of attachment to a particular group, i.e. their identity. Using this measure, Casey and Dustmann find that ethnic identity does not play any role for men, though it does have a determinantal impact on women’s economic outcomes.Footnote 4 Constant and Zimmermann (2008, 2009), on the other hand, use a different measure which they call a two-dimensional ethnosizer. The ethnosizer is constructed by using five measures of ethnic identity: language, culture, ethnic self-identification, social interactions and history of migration. Using this measure, they find that those who are assimilated are much more likely to find employment than those who are marginalized or separated.Footnote 5 Nekby and Rodin (2010) use data from Sweden and show that assimilation and integration have similar positive outcomes in the labour market, though this result holds only for male immigrants. We contribute to the literature by exploiting information unique to the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA), a detailed annual longitudinal survey data that started in 2001. Like a number of other immigrant-receiving countries in Europe and elsewhere, Australia has made adopting the host country’s ‘way of life’ one of the key elements of its immigration policy. For instance, the immigration policy change of 1995 increased the level of English required in its selective (points based) system, which was an implicit recognition of the importance of integration once immigrants move to Australia.Footnote 6 A later policy document explicitly stated that immigrants are expected to ‘…embrace Australian values and integrate into the Australian society’ (Department of Immigration and Citizenship, 2009). With this backdrop, it is important to analyse the association between assimilation with immigrant’s economic outcomes. This is especially relevant because Australia uses a selective immigration policy to address labour shortages in the country. As important as it is to understand how immigrants’ level of assimilation is related to their employment opportunities and wages, it is also important to understand to what extent assimilation influences the quality of jobs they get, measured here using job satisfaction indicators. Like the concept of ethnic identity/social assimilation, the notion of job quality primarily comes from sociology, though it is inherent in labour economics within the idea of compensating wage differentials. As Kalleberg and Vaisey (2005: 432) point out, “people differ in their expectations and needs regarding work as well as their preferences about the importance of various job facets and so may differ in their conceptions of what constitutes a ‘good’ or a ‘bad’ job”, which is why it is important to also look at different types and levels of job satisfaction.Footnote 7 Our job satisfaction indicators are happy with job, happy with pay and feel secure about the job. We also measure whether assimilation is related to underemployment (i.e. they would prefer to work more hours but are not given the opportunity), which captures the underutilization of immigrants’ human capital. In addition, education-occupation mismatches are a common problem among immigrants. This phenomenon has been widely studied in the literature emphasizing the determinants as well as the consequences of mismatch and the corresponding potential wage loss individuals experience in the labour market (see Piracha and Vadean, 2013 for an overview of this literature). However, the previous literature on ethnic identity has not analysed the relationship between social assimilation and the education-occupation mismatch. Finally, it is possible that the role of assimilation in labour market outcomes changes when economic conditions change.Footnote 8 For instance, assimilation may not be important when there are plenty of jobs available, although it might still be quite relevant for ‘good’ jobs (that pay well and are more secure than ‘bad’ jobs). On the other hand, in an economic downturn, assimilation may be relevant for both finding a job and keeping one, although people’s views and expectations about the level of job satisfaction, in terms of wages or being overeducated, might change. We therefore repeat the analysis by looking at the association between assimilation and all our outcome measures before and after the 2008 financial crisis. We use three measures of social assimilation: language proficiency, whether an individual is happy to live in Australia (which is our proxy for self-identification) and ethnic concentration, which captures whether the immigrant lives in a high co-ethnic concentration area. We run separate estimations for all three components to ascertain which measure(s) of social assimilation are most relevant for labour market outcomes. Finally, since assimilation is a multifaceted concept that may differ across our three measures, we follow Constant and Zimmermann (2008) in building an index along the lines of the one-dimensional ethnosizer in their paper.Footnote 9 We call our index the assimilation index (AI). The value of AI correlates positively with assimilation, i.e. the higher the value of the index, the more assimilated the migrant. The results show that assimilation has a strong and positive association with the probability of employment as well as a number of job satisfaction indicators for both men and women.Footnote 10 One key difference in the employment indicators is that assimilated men are less likely to be overeducated, whereas there is no such correlation for women. Assimilation is also positively associated with wages for both men and women. When looking at the association before and after the financial crisis, we find differences across different measures of labour market outcomes in the two periods as well as between the genders. We also show separate results for each of the three measures of assimilation. However, since assimilation is across a spectrum of different measures, ‘it is practically impossible to summarize the overall balance of migrant’s commitments by one response’ (Constant and Zimmermann 2008: 428), and therefore, the focus in the paper is on the results using the assimilation index. Finally, we show that assimilation is strongly correlated with the formation of networks, which helps explain the channels through which ethnic identity plays a role in the labour market. It is important to point out that none of the results discussed should be considered causal. This is a common feature in this literature since finding a reasonable instrument in this setting is not straightforward, especially when the data is limited in terms of information about the immigrants, like HILDA.Footnote 11 We, therefore, cannot rule out reverse causality (see, for instance, Casey and Dustmann, 2010; Pendakur and Pendakur, 2005; Nekby and Rodin, 2007). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the theoretical background and explain the measurement of ethnic identity in Sect. 2. Descriptive statistics are presented in Sect. 3, while Sect. 4 explains the empirical strategy. Results on the role of ethnic identity in employment, wages and job satisfaction indicators and social networks are presented in Sect. 5. The last section concludes the paper.",5

Riphahn,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Parental leave—paid or unpaid—is high on the political agenda in many industrialized countries. Many European countries already have generous parental leave benefits, and other countries are considering introducing or expanding such programs. In this paper, we exploit a major reform of a paid parental leave program to identify the causal effect of paid parental leave on the labor market attachment of recent mothers. Parental leave regulations differ in the duration of employment-protected parental leave and in the generosity of parental leave benefits in terms of transfer amount, duration, and eligibility. These regulations vary between countries and within countries over time. Even though a growing literature studies the causal relationship between parental leave and maternal labor market outcomes, mothers’ behavioral responses are still not well understood.Footnote 1 Some studies find strengthened labor market attachment in response to more generous or newly introduced parental leave while others conclude the opposite; Rossin-Slater (2018) argues that leave duration may be crucial. A number of authors show that the availability of (paid) parental leave itself can increase employment rates (see Berger and Waldfogel 2004; Burgess et al. 2008; Rossin-Slater et al. 2013; Byker 2014; Byker 2016; Baum and Ruhm 2016; Del Rey et al. 2021). On the other hand, a substantial part of the literature disagrees. Studies of Canada, Australia, Austria, Germany, and Norway report that mothers increase the time spent at home when maternity leave is extended; also, the availability of leave weakens their short-term labor force attachment.Footnote 2 This paper exploits a fundamental reform of the parental leave benefit program in Germany and identifies the program’s causal effect on maternal employment after childbirth. Before the reform, German mothers could claim “child-rearing benefits” conditional on a means test; the benefits typically paid 300 Euro per month for up to 24 months after childbirth. After the reform, benefits are available to all mothers without a means test. The benefits now generally replace 67% of last net earnings, with minimum and maximum amounts fixed at 300 and 1800 Euro per month. These benefits are paid for 12 months (plus 2 months for a partner). This major revision of Germany’s parental leave policy allows us to identify causal effects that are difficult to identify in scenarios of only minor institutional adjustments. In particular, we study the effects of an introduction of parental leave benefit payments for some mothers (the new benefit recipients) and of a shortening of parental leave benefits for others (the prior benefit recipients); both changes occur simultaneously and in the same economic environment. Among the few studies looking at the introduction of paid parental leave are Sánchez-Mangas and Sánchez-Marcos (2008) for Spain, Stearns (2018) for the U.K., and Rossin-Slater et al. (2013) for California. A much larger literature covers changes in benefit durations (see e.g., Hanratty and Trzcinski (2009) and Baker and Milligan (2008b) for Canada, Lalive and Zweimüller (2009) and Lalive et al. 2014 for Austria, Dahl et al. (2016) for Norway, Yamaguchi (2019) for Japan, and Mullerova (2017) and Bičáková and Kalíšková (2019) for the Czech Republic). The elements of the German reform render our contribution most similar to Lalive et al. (2014), who study the effects of a shortening and an extension of the duration of cash benefit payments in Austria. In contrast to their study of reforms that occurred consecutively, our reform constitutes a program change that simultaneously reduces the duration of payment for one group and introduces payments for another group. Overall, the German reform is of interest to many countries with similar policies and adds new evidence compared to extant studies of prior reforms by Dustmann and Schönberg (2012) and Schönberg and Ludsteck (2014). We compare the labor market outcomes for mothers of children born under the old and the new benefit regimes and address the effect of parental leave benefits on maternal employment over the short, medium, and long term. A sensitivity analysis combines the discontinuity approach with a difference-in-differences (DID) framework in order to account for impacts of the business cycle and general trends. There, we compare the adjustment in the reform period for recent mothers with that of mothers of older children who are not directly affected by the reform. We apply duration models to flexibly describe the determinants of the timing of post-birth events. Several contributions have already investigated the 2007 reform. Kluve and Tamm (2013) and Kluve and Schmitz (2018) found an employment decline in year 1 after childbirth and an increase thereafter using cross-sectional data. Those studies discuss employers’ responses and suggest that the definition of a point of “natural” return to the labor force could be the driving force behind the observed employment patterns. They do not discuss nor investigate the relevance of other channels. In addition, their data is cross sectional and does not provide information on labor earnings of either parent. As we have information on pre-reform gross and net earnings of both spouses, we can characterize more precisely whether couples benefited from the reform. This allows us to more reliably separate prior and new benefit recipients.Footnote 3 In addition, Geyer et al. (2015) estimate a structural labor supply model for mothers and consider outcomes up to 2 years after childbirth. We go beyond these papers in various ways. First and most importantly, we apply rich survey data to differentiate heterogeneous effects for different groups. Our analyses would not be possible with administrative data, which do not provide information at the household level. Second, our data allow us to assess the mechanisms of how mothers respond to incentives in parental leave programs. Third, prior studies use cross-sectional data which observe mothers only at one point in time and cannot follow the path to labor force participation. In contrast, we apply event study methods to carefully model the employment dynamics after childbirth, which we combine in a sensitivity analysis with a difference-in-differences approach. We find that the reform yielded strong labor supply responses in the short- and medium run, whereas long-run labor force participation was not affected. During benefit receipt, i.e., in the first year after childbirth, the rate of labor force return declined (insignificantly) for new benefit recipients, whereas prior benefit recipients hardly responded to the reform. At benefit expiration (month 12), prior benefit recipients’ hazards of returning to the labor force increased by a factor of 3 after the reform. Among new benefit recipients, the reform generated a large and significant increase in the rate of labor force return at the time of benefit expiration. The overall time until an average mother with (without) prior benefit receipt returned to the labor force after childbirth declined by 10 (8) months at the median after the reform. We show that likely pathways for this substantial reform effect are changes in social norms and mothers’ preferences for economic independence. The paper develops as follows. In Section 2, we describe the institutional background and discuss the expected reform effects. Section 3 characterizes the data and our empirical approach. We present the results and robustness tests in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.",6

W. Jongen,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The ageing of the population, the consequences of the Great Recession, and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic put the sustainability of public finances at risk. Governments are looking for cost-effective ways to increase labour supply. To this end, policymakers need good empirical information on how financial incentives affect the labour supply of different groups and the associated changes in public expenditures and revenues. Policymakers receive information from two different sources when considering the effectiveness of tax-benefit reforms. On the one hand, quasi-experimental studies report on the effects of specific reforms (‘natural experiments’) implemented in the past. Advantages of this approach are that it relies on minimal assumptions and has a transparent source of identification (Angrist and Pischke 2009; Heckman 2010). However, disadvantages include the absence of an underlying economic model, the external validity of the treatment effects, and the limited scope for doing counterfactual policy analysis.Footnote 1 On the other hand, policymakers get simulation results from analyses with structural models. The strong points of this approach are the use of an explicit economic model, the possibility to predict treatment effects in external environments, and the wide scope for conducting counterfactual policy analysis (Keane 2010; Heckman 2010). However, structural models rely on more assumptions and the source of identification is not always transparent. Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, they can be said to complement each other. In this study, we combine structural models with quasi-experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness of tax-benefit reforms in the Netherlands. Specifically, we estimate structural models for labour supply of a large number of subgroups, compare the simulated treatment effects of policy reforms in the structural models with the results from three quasi-experimental studies, and then use the structural model to study counterfactual policy reforms that feature prominently in the political debate in the Netherlands and abroad. We estimate a structural discrete-choice model for labour supply, building on a large body of literature, e.g. Aaberge et al. (1995, 1999), Van Soest (1995), Keane and Moffitt (1998), Brewer et al. (2006), and Bargain et al. (2014). Discrete-choice models have the advantage of being able to take into account all the complexities in the budget set that result from the tax-benefit system, such as kinks and non-convexities. Furthermore, the estimation of discrete-choice models does not require ex ante imposition of quasi-concavity of preferences.Footnote 2 We use an exceptionally large and rich administrative household data set that was constructed specifically for this project by Statistics Netherlands: the Labour Market Panel (Arbeidsmarktpanel). Our sample consists of more than 840,000 observations. The size of this data set allows us to precisely estimate preferences over income, leisure, and formal childcare (for parents with young children) for a large number of subgroups. Next, we use the estimated structural model to simulate a number of key reforms implemented in the past and compare the simulated treatment effects with quasi-experimental studies on the same reforms. In particular, we compare the simulated treatment effects of the 2005–2009 reform of childcare subsidies and in-work benefits for households with young children with the estimated treatment effects presented in Bettendorf et al. (2015). Furthermore, we compare the simulated treatment effects of the 2002 reform of the in-work benefit for single parents with the estimated treatment effects presented in Bettendorf et al. (2014). Finally, we compare the simulated intensive margin (hours worked per employed person) elasticities of the structural model with the estimated intensive margin elasticities presented in Bosch and van der Klaauw (2012) and Bosch and Jongen (2013), who use the 2001 tax reform that substantially reduced marginal tax rates. Part of the variation used in the quasi-experimental studies is also used in the estimation of the structural model, but part of the variation also comes from outside the data period used to estimate the structural model.Footnote 3 Our main findings are the following. First, we uncover large differences in labour supply elasticities between demographic groups and decision margins. Indeed, there are large differences in labour supply elasticities by age of the youngest child. We also find large differences in the relative importance of the extensive margin (participation) and the intensive margin (hours per employed person), with the intensive margin response still substantial for women with young children but small for most other groups. Second, we find that the structural model gives a good prediction of the treatment effects estimated in quasi-experimental studies on past reforms. Therefore, we feel confident to simulate counterfactual tax-benefit reforms using the structural model. Third, we find that reducing marginal tax rates is not an effective way to promote labour supply. In-work benefits targeted at low-wage earners appear to be more effective, and policies targeted at working mothers with young children generate the largest labour supply response and also cause a noticeable drop in gender inequality in wage income. However, policies targeted at working mothers with young children generate little additional revenue for the government because that group already receives substantial subsidies when working. Using the structural model we also simulate some large counterfactual tax reforms that feature prominently in the political debate. We find that proposals for a move towards a flat tax system, a basic income, or joint taxation are not effective, including a steep rise in gender inequality. Indeed, an efficient tax system accounts for the large heterogeneity in behavioural responses we uncover and hence cannot be too simple. This study contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways. The size of our data set allows us to estimate preferences separately for subgroups that earlier studies did not consider (previous studies typically only focussed on couples, e.g., Van Soest and Das 2001; Van Soest et al. 2002) or had to pool due to the limited number of observations (previous studies typically pooled households with and without children, e.g., Bargain et al. 2014). We consider a large number of household types, do not pool the data over the various household types, and uncover much more heterogeneity in the behavioural responses than previous studies. We also exploit detailed administrative data on the use and price of formal childcare, information that is not readily available in most other labour supply studies (e.g. Blundell et al. 2000; Van Soest and Das 2001; Blundell and Shephard 2012; Bargain et al. 2014). Furthermore, previous studies had to rely on one cross-section of data or on a few repeated cross-sections from a period when there was hardly any change in the tax system (e.g. Van Soest and Das 2001; Van Soest et al. 2002; Bargain et al. 2014). Hence, identification in those studies comes only from cross-sectional differences in financial incentives due to non-linearities in the tax-benefit system. In contrast, we use several years of data, which includes a major reform of childcare subsidies and in-work benefits for working parents. These reforms strengthen our identification by generating large exogenous variation in budget constraints. Also, we compare the predictions of the structural model with results from a number of quasi-experimental studies on key past reforms and thus contribute to the growing body of literature that evaluates the performance of structural models by comparing simulated policy responses with the results from (quasi-)experimental studies (e.g. Attanasio et al. 2011; Bargain and Doorley 2017; Brewer et al. 2006; Cai et al. 2008; Todd and Wolpin 2006; Geyer et al. 2015; Hansen and Liu 2015; Pronzato 2015; Thoresen and Vatto 2015). In addition, because our structural model is fully integrated with a detailed tax-benefit calculator, we are able to study the effectiveness of various reform proposals, taking into account the budgetary effects of the behavioural responses to the reform. Indeed, the integrated model allows us to go beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations on the effectiveness of different reform proposals (as in, e.g. Blau 2003; Lokshin 2004). The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the Dutch labour market and policy environment. Section 3 outlines the structural model and empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the data set used to estimate the structural model and Section 5 presents the estimation results and corresponding labour supply elasticities. Section 6 then compares the simulated treatment effects of the structural model on a number of key past reforms with the estimated treatment effects from quasi-experimental studies. Next, Section 7 studies the effectiveness of a number of counterfactual tax-benefit reforms. Section 8 discusses our findings and concludes. Supplementary material is given in an Appendix.",2

Although the literature has converged on the conclusion that fertility rates decline as a country’s population becomes more educated (see, e.g., Frejka and Calot 2001 and Fort et al. 2016),Footnote 1 such conclusions are less clear at the individual level. If pursuing higher education makes it more costly to raise a family, then individuals may be forced to choose between accumulating more human capital and raising children, a fear that appears relevant for career-oriented women in many countries. On the other hand, human capital may be complementary to fertility if it increases attractiveness on the marriage market relative to competing peers. At the same time, a separate, but equally large, literature has documented that human capital indicators, family values, and other key determinants of social and economic outcomes are shared within families and transmitted across generations. These patterns naturally raise questions regarding the extent to which associations between education and fertility are artifacts of transmitted family traits, and how such a transmission process is best understood. Family-based skill endowments, but also wealth and preferences, may affect both the possibilities of pursuing higher education and fertility outcomes. In this paper, we present the most comprehensive evidence yet on the role of shared family background for shaping the associations between skills, education, and fertility outcomes. We also provide a stylized theoretical framework that can explain the empirical patterns we unravel. We analyze the role of family background for fertility outcomes of both men and women using data from Swedish population-wide intergenerational registers. We link to those data a very broad set of human capital measures covering years of schooling, compulsory school grades, cognitive ability, and non-cognitive ability, all drawn from Swedish register data. Key to our analysis is that our intergenerational registers allow us to isolate pairs of twins or close siblings who share a joint family background.Footnote 2 The bulk of the existing literature has found negative associations between fertility and education, at least for females.Footnote 3 But this (raw) empirical association is likely to be confounded by predetermined factors, such as skill endowments, preferences, and wealth, that may affect both the pursuit of higher education and fertility outcomes. As we conjecture that an important set of confounders are shared within families, we aim to provide a detailed assessment of how family background affects the associations between education, skills, and fertility. The aim is to isolate the full impact of a shared family background without restricting the analysis to dimensions that are measurable in available data.Footnote 4 Empirically, we therefore follow in the tracks of a set of recent studies that removed the confounding impact of family background by controlling for family fixed effects when regressing fertility measures on education (see, e.g., Amin and Behrman 2014; Kohler et al. 2011; Nisén et al. 2013; Nisén et al. 2014; Nisén et al. 2018). The evidence from these studies is mixed; perhaps partly because of small sample sizes, but the overall pattern tends to suggest that the inclusion of family fixed effects reduces the negative association between education and fertility. Several papers have relied on compulsory schooling reforms to directly estimate the causal impact of education on female fertility (see, e.g., Cygan-Rehm and Maeder 2013; Fort et al. 2016; Grönqvist and Hall 2013; Monstad et al. 2008). However, the results are mixed, and the lack of statistical precision makes the approach less useful for our purposes as it makes it difficult to precisely isolate the role of family background factors. A related set of studies have directed attention to the association between initial skill endowments (mainly intelligence) and fertility (see, e.g., Chen et al. 2013; Kanazawa 2014; Meisenberg 2010; Wang et al. 2016), thus focusing on the impact on fertility of endowments that are predetermined at the time when schooling and fertility choices are made. Generally, the above studies document a negative association between intelligence and fertility for women and a relationship close to zero for men. In a recent paper, Kolk and Barclay (2019) find a positive relationship between skills and fertility for men after controlling for family background factors.Footnote 5 In this paper, we combine elements of these earlier approaches, but with a sharper focus on the role of family background factors instead of the causal impact as such. This focus relates our study to the enormous literature on how shared family factors that affect individual outcomes are transmitted across generations. A large number of empirical studies document that families share, within and across generations, fundamental traits and outcomes such as cognitive and non-cognitive abilities (e.g., Grönqvist et al. 2017 and references therein), education (see Fleury and Gilles 2018 for a meta analysis and Havari and Savegnago 2020 for a recent study), family values (e.g., Yi et al. 2004; Copen and Silverstein 2008), and criminal behavior (see Besemer et al. 2017 for a meta analysis and Dobbie et al. 2018 for a recent study) just to name a few. But to the best of our knowledge, this literature, which also inspired a set of theoretical models to explain the underlying processes (see, e.g., Caucutt and Lochner 2020 for a recent example), has not scrutinized the extent to which shared family traits shape the joint distribution of human capital, education, and fertility. We analyze how family background affects the relationships between skills and fertility and between educational attainment and fertility using twin and sibling fixed-effects models. An advantage relative to most previous fertility studies is that we are able to use nationwide register data on several different measures of human capital. These measures cover standard outcomes related to completed education and fertilityFootnote 6 as well as skill endowments in the form of grades and cognitive and non-cognitive abilities (for men only)Footnote 7 measured before family formation and entry into further education. One unique feature of the data is the possibility of precisely estimating the relation between fertility and cognitive and non-cognitive ability within male twin-pairs. This is a novel contribution in its own right; in particular as non-cognitive abilities otherwise mostly tend to be available in small-scale survey data sets that do not allow for the inclusion of family fixed effects. We show that these non-cognitive abilities are less related to educational performance than cognitive abilities (that instead are highly correlated with school grades) but instead matter more for family formation outcomes. Overall, we are able to give a very comprehensive picture of the role played by family background factors in forming the relations between skills, education, and fertility for men and women. Our results highlight that family background is a key determinant of the raw empirical associations between human capital measures and fertility. For women, we find significant negative raw associations between years of schooling, compulsory school grades, and fertility, as in most previous studies. However, after accounting for twin (or sibling) fixed effects, the associations are close to zero. For men, the raw associations between human capital (years of schooling, compulsory school grades, and cognitive skills) and fertility are close to zero, but after accounting for twin (or sibling) fixed effects, estimates become positive. Overall, we thus conclude that the raw associations overemphasize (relative to the within-family associations) the degree to which human capital accumulation crowds out childbearing for women. The raw associations similarly underestimate the degree of complementarity between human capital and fertility for men. These patterns imply that there must exist some important family background factor (shared between twins and siblings) that is positively related to grades, cognitive abilities, and acquired education but negatively related to our fertility measures (consequently pushing the raw associations in a negative direction) for both men and women. With respect to non-cognitive ability, which has not been studied in the previous literature and which we show to be very strongly positively related to fertility, we instead find the opposite pattern; the inclusion of twin fixed effects pushes the association with fertility in a more negative direction. We end the paper by showing that all of these patterns can be reconciled in a stylized theoretical model where shared preferences within a family are allowed to affect both the types of skills children accumulate and the choices these children make later in life. We postulate, in line with our empirical patterns, that cognitive skills are relatively more important for schooling whereas non-cognitive skills are more important for marriage and fertility. Families with relatively strong preferences for education then have incentives to focus their skill investments in the cognitive domain, whereas families with a relatively strong preferences for fertility have an incentive to focus more on raising children with non-cognitive skills. If the underlying preferences also are transmitted across generations, this justifies why fertility is particularly low in families where children have high education/cognitive skills. As a consequence of the shared intergenerational traits, these associations will always be more negative across families than within families. A first-order testable prediction is that parents with high education (fertility) conditional on the own skill-set should raise children with more cognitive (non-cognitive) skills. We show that this prediction is borne out in the data. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the existing literature. Section 3 presents our Swedish register data. Section 4 presents the main empirical results. Section 5 presents the theoretical model and tests thereof. Section 6 concludes.",4

Our motivation stems from the fact that there is no clear explanation within the same theoretical framework for the fertility decline during the demographic transition and the reversal of the fertility decline above a certain income threshold. Although the demographic transition and the factors causing the fertility decline have been examined extensively, the fertility rebound is a relatively new phenomenon that has not been adequately analyzed and understood by researchers.Footnote 1 To this end, several recent studies corroborate that the decline in average fertility rates has reversed in high-income countries in recent decades.Footnote 2 A fertility rebound also occurs as a relative increase in fertility rates of high-income agents in the cross-section of the population (Hazan and Zoabi 2015). Such a cross-sectional rebound in fertility is represented by an inverse J-shaped curve. For example, Fig. 1 shows a curve of the nexus between the total fertility rate (TFR) and years of education based on US data. The figure shows that the relationship between fertility rates and years of education changed over time. In 1990 and 2000, the fertility rates declined with higher levels of education. However, in 2010 and 2018, fertility rates rebounded for high-income women. Another notable pattern is that the fertility rates in 2010 and 2018 are higher compared with those in 2000 at all education levels, thereby implying that the average fertility rates have risen in recent years. In addition, the fertility rates of high-income women with the same education levels in 2018 were higher than in 2010. Thus, based on the observations above, we can conclude that fertility rates rebound in the cross-section of the population and the shifts in the relationship between fertility and human capital levels increased the average fertility rates over time.
 Data from the General Social Survey (GSS) by Norc at the University of Chicago, https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/ Evolution of the fertility differentiation across education levels in the USA. The rebound of the average fertility rates is illustrated in the following examples. Figure 2 shows that an inverse J-shaped relationship between the average TFR and the average human capital level is present for high-income countries in recent years. Similar patterns can be detected in the evolution of the country average cohort fertility rates (CFRs). Figure 3 shows the country average CFRs have a similar inverse J-shaped pattern over time (Fig. 3, panel d). The evolution of the nexus between CFRs and education levels is not homogeneous across education levels and countries. The cohort fertility rates of women with basic tertiary education (ISCED4-5B) increased after 1999 (Fig. 3, panels a and b). In 2014, the CFRs of women with post-secondary education (ISCED3-4) and tertiary education (ISCED5) were considerably higher compared with the CFRs in previous years.
 Except in (d), the following countries are included: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The average years of education and fertility rates by country are used, except in (a). In (a), the average fertility rates are calculated for a group of countries with the same average education level in a given year. The curves are determined using the loess smoothing method. Source of data: World Development Indicators, World Bank, which includes the Barro and Lee dataset on education Total fertility rates-education nexus in a sample of high-income countries, 1960–2010. In (b) and (d), the following countries are included: Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the USA. In (a) and (c), the following countries are included: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. The curves in (b) and (d) are determined using the loess smoothing method. Educational level is coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education 1997 (ISCED). ISCED0-2A stands for “no to lower-secondary education”; ISCED3-4 — “upper-secondary education to post-secondary non-tertiary education”; ISCED4-5B — “up to first stage of tertiary education”; ISCED5 — “tertiary education.” It is assumed that cohort fertility is completed when a woman is 44 years old. Source of data: (a), (b), and (c) Zeman et al. (2017); (d) Human Fertility Database (2021) Cohort fertility-education nexus in a sample of high-income countries. The reason for the inverse J-shaped pattern between economic development and fertility remains ambiguous from the theoretical perspective. First, the literature highlights that the steepness of the decline in fertility rates during the demographic transition and the shifts in the income–fertility relationship over time cannot be fully explained only by the trade-off between the quantity and quality of children caused by income growth and the related decline in infant and child mortality (Doepke 2005; Jones et al. 2010). This implies that the theoretical framework focusing on fertility choice lacks important factors that contribute to the observed fertility decline. Second, the literature does not provide a clear explanation for the factors causing a rebound in the average fertility rates.Footnote 3 Although Day (2016), Futagami and Konishi (2019), and Hirazawa and Yakita (2017), and Ohinata and Varvarigos (2019) achieved significant progress in analyzing the forces behind the recent fertility rebound, clear insights into some important aspects of this phenomenon are still missing. These studies on the fertility rebound identified that the decreasing relative costs of child-rearing (childcare and education costs) and longevity are preventing further decline or driving the fertility rates upward. However, these studies are based on models that lack some important features: Social externalities or human capital accumulation are not considered (Day 2016; Futagami and Konishi 2019); the fertility rebound cannot be explained if the opportunity cost of child-rearing is used instead of the direct cost (Ohinata and Varvarigos 2019); and the fertility rebound cannot be explained if the old generation is not allowed to work (Hirazawa and Yakita 2017). Finally, the literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation for the relationship between the fertility rebound observed in the cross-section of agents (Hazan and Zoabi 2015) and the dynamic rebound in the average fertility rates. To address the issues above, we extend the standard fertility choice modelFootnote 4 by incorporating additional features. First, our model incorporates the following factors along with agents’ human capital: consumption and human capital externalities, the probability of child survival, social norms related to the number of children, relative childcare costs, and substitution of mothers’ child-rearing time with fathers’ time. Second, we capture the nexus between income and fertility in a more general form by modeling child-rearing costs using the opportunity cost of labor and the economic cost of education. Third, our approach generalizes the modeling of childcare time costs by incorporating market-based childcare services (Hazan and Zoabi 2015) and fathers’ involvement in child-rearing (Siegel 2017). Finally, we consider the effect of externalities on an agent’s consumption stemming from others’ consumption in society, which also affects fertility choice through the budget constraint. The analysis based on the extended fertility choice model yields the following results. The steep decline in fertility rates during the demographic transition is caused by the quality-quantity trade-off, which is augmented by the fertility effects of social externalities and increases in child survival rates. Specifically, consumption externalities reduce the fertility rate by increasing the marginal value of consumption compared with that of having children. Moreover, the higher benchmark human capital negatively affects fertility by raising the survival and education of children and benchmark consumption. In addition, the declining benchmark fertility rate has a magnifying effect on the overall fertility choice dynamics. Therefore, the observed steepness of the decline in fertility during the demographic transition is also attributed to the changes in the benchmark fertility that reinforce the fall in fertility rates. The paper also suggests an explanation for the recent rebound in fertility rates in high-income countries. This rebound is caused by the interplay of several factors. First, at significantly high benchmark levels of human capital and consumption, the marginal effect of these external factors on fertility diminishes. Therefore, further increases in benchmark levels of human capital and consumption do not have any additional negative effect on the fertility rate. Second, a decrease in child-rearing costs generated by market-based childcare services causes a fertility rebound among high-income agents. Given the increase in the benchmark fertility rates, externalities stemming from fertility norms push the average fertility rates up.Footnote 5 This positive effect of fertility externalities becomes relatively strong due to the presence of diminishing marginal effects of consumption and human capital externalities on fertility with income levels. As a combined outcome of these two effects, the average fertility rates increase. This paper contributes to the literature by developing a novel explanation for the fertility rebound in a more general setting than the ones considered in existing studies. For example, Hazan and Zoabi (2015) examine a cross-sectional fertility rebound; however, unlike our model, their model is not dynamic. In addition, we capture the discontinuous effect of heterogeneity among agents on childcare costs by making the childcare cost endogenous only for agents who have sufficiently high human capital and thus can afford market-based childcare services. Our paper also differs from papers that address the fertility rebound from a dynamic perspective. Unlike Futagami and Konishi (2019), Hirazawa and Yakita (2017), and Ohinata and Varvarigos (2019), by accounting for the heterogeneity of agents, our model captures social externalities stemming from differences among agents in consumption, human capital, and fertility. In our model, the rebound in the average fertility rates does not require a decrease in inequality, as in Day (2016). In contrast, we use inequality (heterogeneity) to generate social externalities in terms of consumption, human capital, and fertility norms. From this perspective, our model reconciles the rebound in the fertility of high-income agents relative to low-income agents and its dynamic implications for the average fertility rebound. We test the findings of this study by simulating fertility rates using plausible parameter values calibrated to match the empirical moments from the distributions of human capital and completed cohort fertility rates for high-income countries. We use average completed cohort fertility rates as the appropriate statistic to represent the average fertility rate captured in our model, because the model determines the completed fertility rates of the adult agents in each generation.Footnote 6 The simulated average fertility rates exhibit an inverse J-shaped relationship between human capital and completed cohort fertility observed in high-income economies (Figs. 4 and 5). Specifically, the simulated fertility rates fall initially, emulating the demographic transition; then, at higher income levels, the fertility rates rebound and reach the level of average cohort rates observed in high-income economies over 1980–2020. The simulated model also generates an inverse J-shaped fertility-income relationship in the cross-section of heterogeneous agents with high average years of education (see below).

The model is calibrated to target the CFR for 1985. The simulated total fertility rates (SCFRs) to 2105 are presented. The horizontal axis measures time in years, and the vertical axis measures the fertility rates. Each generation spans 25 years Simulated and observed fertility rates in high-income countries, 1960–2085. The parameter values are given in Appendix A Simulated cross-section fertility–human capital relationship for distributions with different initial average human capital (education) \(\bar {h}_{1}\). Therefore, our model captures the relationship between human capital inequality and fertility in the cross-section, which, in the presence of social externalities and endogenous childcare costs and child survival, provides a plausible explanation for the non-monotone evolution dynamics of fertility over long time horizons. In addition, we experiment with the calibrated model by shutting down effects stemming from social externalities. The results show that one cannot fully emulate the observed pattern of fertility evolution in high-income countries by omitting the social externalities and endogenous childcare costs from the model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the basic model with social externalities. In Section 3, we present an equilibrium analysis. In Section 4, we carry out a calibration analysis to establish whether the theoretical model can capture the documented evolution of the average fertility rates by exhibiting their initial decline during the demographic transition and the subsequent rebound at high-income levels. In Section 5, we conclude the paper.",3

While developed countries experienced this transition predominantly during the second half of the nineteenth century, fertility rates started to decline across developing counties towards the second half of the twentieth century, contributing to an apparent convergence in fertility rates across the globe. This study analyzes the patterns of convergence in fertility rates across 190 countries over the period 1950 to 2018. It explores whether the fertility rates have been converging globally or whether the deep historical factors that have contributed to the persistent gap in the wealth of nations have led to the emergence of convergence clubs in fertility rates. Unified growth theory (UGT) suggests that reinforcing interaction between the rate of technological progress and the size and composition of the population in the course of human history accelerated the pace of technological progress beyond a tipping point, where rudimentary education became essential for the ability of individuals to adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment. Fertility rates started to decline and the growth in living standards was liberated from the counterbalancing effects of population growth, paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth. (Galor, 2011; Galor and Weil, 2000; Galor and Moav, 2002). Nevertheless, UGT does not imply that the level of fertility will be similar across the globe. Since fertility rates are affected by economic incentives as well cultural, institutional, and societal characteristics, convergence in fertility rates will take place only if institutional, cultural, and societal characteristics will converge as well (Galor, 2011). Hence, in view of the variations in these characteristics across the globe, UGT suggests fertility rates will differ across world regions in the long run. In particular, deep-rooted historical forces such as migratory distance from Africa and its impact on interpersonal population diversity (Ashraf and Galor, 2013a, b), as well as the time elapsed since the onset of the Neolithic Revolution and its impact on political institutions and cultural traits (Diamond, 1997), would be expected to lead to differential timing of the transition from stagnation to growth across the globe and to persistent difference in fertility rates in the long run. I follow this theoretical framework to test the hypothesis that ancestral determinants of the contemporary diversity of development levels also explain different stages of the demographic transition around the world. I approach this question through the lens of club convergence analysis, which provides a descriptive synthesis of strong nonlinearities involved in the transition to low fertility. Then, I interpret convergence clubs as the outcome of barriers with different magnitudes to global fertility convergence and search for the ancestral factors that may explain the current variety of transitional paths. The decline of fertility across the world is characterized by heterogeneity and nonlinearity of time paths. The first significant distinction is between countries converging to the low-fertility club and countries that are still in the pre-transitional regime. Even among the transitioning countries, the timing of the onset of the transition varies substantially. Moreover, in some cases, fertility declines along nonmonotonic time paths with trend inversions due to specific events without changing the direction of the long-term transition. I study club convergence of fertility by applying the econometric methods of Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009), which allow nonstationarity, nonlinearity, and heterogeneity of the time series, in contrast to \(\beta\)- and \(\sigma\)-convergence approaches. I cluster countries according to fertility at the end of the period (2018) and at the beginning (1950) using a reverse convergence regression. Hence, I also detect one club of countries in transition from high initial total fertility rate (TFR) to a low TFR. In this way, I identify four convergence clubs that face diverse obstacles to join the (fifth) club of the forerunners of low fertility. I investigate the determinants of the barriers to global fertility convergence on a sample of 138 countries using available data on a large set of regressors. Here, the focus is on ancestral factors that may explain the origins and persistence of the striking variety of reproductive behaviors in the world: interpersonal population diversity, as determined by migratory distance of the ancestral populations of each country from east Africa (Ashraf and Galor, 2013a), genetic distance to the United States (US) (Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2009; 2018), and years since the transition to agriculture (Diamond, 1997; Olsson and Hibbs, 2005). The results show that the probability of lower barriers to fertility decline mainly depends on interpersonal population diversity according to an inverted-U shaped relation. Ashraf and Galor (2013a) found a similar relationship between interpersonal population diversity and income per capita. I also find that increasing genetic distance to the US and time since the transition to agriculture decrease the probability of a country facing low barriers to fertility decline. The last result is in accordance with some research that detects a negative effect of the years elapsed since the onset of the Neolithic transition on important aspects of economic growth (e.g., Ashraf and Galor, 2013a). This effect can be attributed to the persistence of some cultural features of rural society detrimental for growth and behavioral change. This research makes the following contributions to the literature. First, it produces the first empirical analysis of the role of the ancestral factors: interpersonal population diversity, genetic distance to the US, and years since the Neolithic revolution, in the explanation of persistence of fertility convergence clubs in the world. The paper finds significant confirmations of the UGT, which sees the demographic transition as part of the long-run process of the evolution of the whole economy. Second, this paper’s regression framework relies on a dependent variable that summarizes the results of the study of club convergence. Using the approach of Phillips and Sul (2007), I address important nonlinear and stochastic features of the international time series of fertility, producing a reliable convergence club classification. Also, I obtain two clubs in the value of the TFR in 1950 using the same methods with a reversion of the time direction. This novelty in research on convergence allows for the rigorous identification of a club of countries transitioning from high to low fertility. While there is no literature on the determinants of fertility club convergence, the descriptive part of this paper relates to studies of the time path of international fertility that identify regularities and show remarkable variation across nations with respect to both the onset and pace of fertility decline (e.g., Dyson and Murphy, 1985; Bongaarts and Watkins, 1996; Wilson, 2011). Dorius (2008) investigates β-convergence and σ-convergence of the TFR of a panel of 195 countries from 1955 to 2005 and finds some evidence of fertility convergence in the world but only after the 1980s. Strulik and Vollmer (2015) study the evolution of the world's fertility distribution from 1950 to 2005 by estimating the coefficients of a mixture of two normal distributions for each 5-year interval. Silverman's test suggests that the TFR distribution is characterized by two peaks before 1995 and one peak after 1995. My paper investigates fertility convergence in the world using panel time-series methods, which allow for general patterns of heterogeneity across individuals and over time. I find that the world distribution of the TFR is characterized by four convergence groups in the 2000s.Footnote 1 The next section presents the methodology and results of the analysis of club convergence in the TFR. Section 3 presents the empirical investigation of the influence of ancestral factors on the barriers to global fertility convergence carried out with the estimation of an ordered probit model. Section 4 concludes.",

When immigrants and natives differ in many dimensions,Footnote 1 social integration of the former is a serious challenge. Here, our objective is to investigate the determinants of social integration of refugees and its impact on their decision to stay in the host country. The Syrian crisis showed how sensitive the issue of immigration was in rich European countries where internal political equilibria were totally shaken in favor of nationalist and populist parties (Zimmerman 2016). Germany hosted almost 600,000 Syrian refugees between 2014 and 2016. This was, as of the time, the largest inflow of asylum seekers in a developed country since the Second World War. This German “exception” in Europe can be attributed to the leadership of the German chancellor Angela Merkel in opening the doors to refugees and the “Willkommenskultur” of the German population, which strongly believes in the obligation to support refugees (Mosel et al. 2019). According to Helbling et al. (2017), while the attitude of the German population is attributable to humanitarian and cosmopolitan behavior, it also reflects economic pragmatism given Germany’s aging society and its urgent need for skilled workers. The first aim of this research is to study the determinants of social integration of Syrians in Germany. Prior to that, we need to define the concept of integration, relying on Berry’s (1997) dynamic approach. A migrant is integrated when they have both values and norms from their country of origin, and through exchanges and interactions with the host community. Assimilation takes place when the first component disappears. Separation occurs when interactions are limited to the migrant’s own community. The literature defines three forms of social connection: social bonds between members of the same family, ethnicity, religion, or nationality; bridges with other communities; and social links to the state’s structures (Putnam 1993; Woolcock 1998; Cheung and Phillimore 2014). Here, we focus on social integration with the host community as we think that it is the biggest challenge presently. There has been extensive conceptual and qualitative work on refugees’ integration. However, the empirical literature on social integration has not been prolific (Cheung and Phillimore 2014). The scarcity of data and the absence of a consensus indicator to measure social integration may have discouraged scholars. Indicators of social integration include measures of self-identification by refugees and behavioral outcomes (Laurentsyeva and Venturini 2017). In contrast to social integration, economic integration is often proxied by employment and represents the most commonly researched area of integration (Constant and Massey 2002; Tomlinson and Egan 2002). Our second aim is to investigate how integration, and particularly social integration, affects refugees’ decision to stay in the host country. Driven from their homes by push factors, refugees’ decision to stay permanently in Germany will depend on both pull and push factors. Given the scarcity of literature on refugees’ return, we extend the review to papers encompassing other forms of migration. However, when analyzing our study’s findings and comparing them to the literature, we differentiate between papers dealing with refugees and economic migrants to highlight the specificity of refugees’ outcomes, when relevant. In neoclassical migration theory, return migration is perceived as a decision related to the degree to which migrants’ expectations are met, in terms of earnings, in the host country (Sjaastad 1962; Todaro 1976; Duleep 1994). Return migration is considered by Cerase (1974) as a “return of failure” because those who integrate well in the host country do not return. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the new economics of labor migration (NELM) perceives return migration as a “success” when people have specific income goals, such as accumulating savings and generating remittances, to diversify the sources of income in their home country household and go home once they achieve these goals (Piore 1979; Stark 1991). The empirical evidence seems to support the neoclassical migration theory, finding a negative impact of integration on the decision to return (Waldorf 1995; Constant and Massey 2002; Jensen and Pedersen 2007; De Haas and Fokkema 2011). Both theories consider migration to be based on economic incentives. However, there are other reasons behind migration decisions. Hence, various typologies of return should each be addressed differently (Kuschminder 2017). There is no singular theory that explains return migration (Massey et al. 1993). The case of forced migration in the context of war is more problematic since return conditions and the ability of the refugees to reintegrate and contribute to development in the country of origin are among the main issues to be addressed (Black and Gent 2006; Van Houte and Davids 2008). The aim of this study is threefold. First, we study the determinants of social integration, including aspects of economic integration. Second, we investigate the determinants of economic integration to compare our results to previous work. However, we do not deal with the impact of social integration on economic integration (Cheung and Phillimore 2014; Danzer and Ulku 2011). This is because it does not seem possible to find an instrumental variable for social integration that does not impact employment directly. For example, social networking skills are also non-cognitive skills that impact employment outcomes. Finally, we investigate the impact of social and economic integration on the intention to stay permanently in Germany. Our econometric strategy is to estimate a simultaneous equation model for two-by-two variables of interest using the conditional mixed process method, handling endogeneity issues through an instrumental variables strategy. Our data is based on the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey 2016. From a methodological point of view, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate simultaneously social integration, economic integration, and intention to stay in an instrumental variables framework. The second contribution is to study the integration of Syrian refugees in Germany (whose displacement is a major event in recent history), while most papers focus on their impact on host countries. The third contribution is related to the novelty of some results. Among these we can cite the impact of economic integration on social integration, which holds only for low- and medium-educated refugees. Furthermore, we confirm the absence of an effect of economic integration on refugees intention to stay, as highlighted by De Haas and Fokkema (2011), in contrast to the literature on economic migrants, that finds a positive effect. Finally, we find no effects of ethnic enclaves on social integration nor on the intention to stay. Moreover, education, English proficiency, and the number of daughters in Germany reduce the intention to stay.",1

Dang,Paolo Verme,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The sharp growth in the global count of forcibly displaced people during the past decade has created new challenges for host governments and aid organizations that will require a new approach to the measurement of poverty.Footnote 1 Host governments are keen to know the number and status of refugees living in their countries, as they struggle to maintain internal order while assisting the newcomers. Humanitarian organizations charged with managing displacement crises are confronted with increasing financial needs and, when these needs are not met by donors, with budget cuts and a shift from universal assistance to means-tested targeting. The increasingly protracted nature of displacement also challenges development organizations to design sustainable poverty reduction programs for displaced people and host communities. For all these actors, measuring poverty among displaced populations has become a key ingredient of any effective economic policy. It also becomes increasingly clear that achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) number 1 goal of poverty reduction will not be possible if the forcibly displaced are excluded from the count. Measuring poverty among refugees is not an easy task. It is more complex than for regular populations because refugees are more mobile. They also live in areas that are often difficult to reach due to environmental or security barriers. Indeed, the global count of the poor excludes, for the most part, displaced populations because these populations are not usually captured by censuses and, as a consequence, are largely excluded from consumption surveys, the main instruments used to measure poverty. The various challenges related to micro survey data collection, such as survey administration, sampling, and questionnaire design or funding, are exacerbated for displaced populations and will require years of efforts to meet the poverty measurement standards that we are now accustomed to seeing in (most) low-income countries. Not surprisingly, studies on refugee poverty are very rare. Refugee studies tend to either focus on the impact of refugees on host communities (see, e.g., Verme and Schuettler (2021) for a review) or on the impact of various policies including aid on refugees (see, e.g., Alix-Garcia et al. (2019) or Alloush et al. (2017)). Organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Bank are now fully committed to bridging this data gap, but past experiences with measuring poverty in low-income countries suggest that this is going to be a long-term process. For example, the UNHCR has attempted to collect consumption data for the Syrian refugees in Jordan using large-scale surveys that interview as many as 5000 households per month (or 60,000 households per year). In other refugee contexts, where fewer resources and more logistical challenges exist, such large-scale surveys may not be feasible or sustainable.Footnote 2 In this paper, we make several new contributions to the poverty measurement literature. First, we address the data challenge in the refugee context by demonstrating that it is feasible to apply cross-survey imputation to obtain poverty estimates for refugees. In particular, we combine census-type administrative data that have no consumption measures with consumption household survey data collected by the UNHCR on Syrian refugees in Jordan in 2014. We subsequently employ a recently developed cross-survey imputation method to estimate poverty among these refugees. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment of its kind.Footnote 3 Poverty studies that make use of cross-survey imputation methods have now become more frequent (see, e.g., Dang et al. (2019) for a recent review), but none of these studies has shed any light on refugee populations. Second, we show that it is feasible to provide imputation-based poverty estimates for one geographical location based on the imputation model from another. This question has more practical relevance than one might think. It is well known among survey practitioners that data may often not be collected for a location due to reasons beyond one’s control, such as inaccessible roads due to various forms of unexpected natural calamities (i.e., flood, storms or landslides), or conflict and violence. In the context of refugees, aside from these occurrences, even temporarily volatile security situations may also result in data not being collected for specific locations. Or it can simply be that prohibitively expensive survey costs prevent data collection at a specific location. In these cases, if the welfare variable exists for another geographical location that is comparable to the location without these data, we can employ our proposed technique to provide imputation-based poverty estimates for the latter location. Finally, we provide theoretical and new empirical evidence that relatively small survey samples can be combined with those from the census-type registration system to provide updated estimates of poverty. Moreover, our imputation models are rather parsimonious and use variables that are already available in the UNHCR’s administrative database, which is consistent with the findings in recent studies for imputation-based poverty estimates for regular populations. Our findings show that the imputation-based poverty estimates are not statistically different from the non-predicted consumption-based poverty rates (henceforth, the “true” poverty rate), and even fall within one standard error of the latter in quite a few cases. This result is robust to various validation tests, including alternative poverty lines, disaggregated population groups, and different modelling assumptions. Furthermore, these poverty estimates are found to have smaller standard errors than other poverty measures based on asset indexes or proxy means testing. They also perform better than average for standard targeting indicators such as coverage and leakage rates. While our estimation results are encouraging, a note of caution is necessary. Our study focuses on Syrian refugees in Jordan because the data available were particularly suitable to test the methodology proposed. It is clear that validating this methodology will require further supportive evidence from other countries, refugee groups, or other sources of data. However, if our proposed imputation method is further validated, it can offer a cost-effective and logistically efficient way to obtain poverty estimates in data scarce environments. The remainder of the paper consists of four sections. We discuss in the next section the basic theory and analytical framework. We subsequently provide in Sect. 3 the country background, a description of the data, and the empirical results for imputation for the whole population and from one geographic location to another. This section also offers various robustness tests to alternative poverty lines, disaggregated population groups, and a stronger modelling assumption. Section 4 discusses further methodological challenges related to survey sample sizes, and other related poverty measures such as asset indexes, proxy means tests, and targeting ratios. We conclude in Section 5.",

Kunz,Male,Male,Male,Male,"International migrants in developed countries are increasingly highly educated. The number of immigrants with a tertiary degree heading to OECD countries grew by nearly 130% between 1990 and 2010 (OECD 2013). Foreign-born talent is unevenly distributed not only across destination countries, with four Anglo-Saxon countries (the USA, the UK, Canada, and Australia) accounting for nearly 70% of all high-skilled immigrants in 2010, but also across regions within destination countries (Kerr et al. 2016; Peri 2016). Understanding the driving forces behind the growth and unequal geographical distribution of foreign talent is important. Several studies highlight that high-skilled migrants contribute to growth and innovation (Peri et al. 2015; Kerr and Lincoln 2010; Beerli et al. 2021), facilitate international trade (Gould 1994; Head and Ries 1998), may have positive effects on public finances in host countries (Dustmann and Frattini 2014), and often benefit natives in the labor market (Beerli et al. 2021).Footnote 1 Consequently, policies facilitating the entry of foreign talent are popular among policymakers.Footnote 2 Evidence from previous research based on cross-country data typically highlights that destination countries with higher earnings inequality attract larger shares of immigrants with a college degree (Grogger and Hanson 2011). Growth in earnings inequality has also been at the focus of a separate literature, reviewed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Autor (2015), that documents the profound impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on the labor markets in OECD countries during the last 30 years. New automation technologies, which substitute for middle-skilled jobs and complement high-skilled ones, fueled the demand for talent and contributed to increasing earnings inequality. Little is known, however, about whether and how immigrants respond to these changing economic opportunities brought about by technological change. As promoting the entry of foreign talent is a commonly argued policy response to the growing inequality and “shortage of skills,” it is crucial to understand how skill-biased changes in demand affect the flow, skill types, and location decision of immigrants. In this paper, we provide comprehensive evidence that the local growth in foreign-born talent is a response to shifts in the local demand for skills driven by exposure to computerization. We focus on Switzerland, which is well-suited to study high-skilled immigration. From 1990 to 2010, the country experienced a considerable inflow of immigrants, increasing the share of foreign-born citizens from 20 to 29%. The share of new immigrants with a tertiary education grew from 17 to 44%, overtaking the share of natives (25% in 2010).Footnote 3 In 2002, Switzerland implemented a free movement policy (FMP), which abolished immigration restrictions for all EU citizens, but not for those from other parts of the world. This policy change allows us to study whether increased openness to immigration affected the skill supply of foreign workers. We exploit census data detailing the educational attainment of immigrants from an extensive set of origin countries settling in Swiss local labor markets from 1990 to 2010.Footnote 4 Our focus on local labor markets as destinations, where newly arriving immigrants settle, is motivated by testable predictions about the impact of ICT exposure on local economic opportunities. We augment these hypotheses with those from the literature on the location choice of immigrants with different skills. Together, this produces novel insights on the effects of ICT exposure on local economic opportunities and immigrants’ response to them. We proceed in three steps. First, we document the change in economic opportunities across local labor markets in Switzerland. We hypothesize that local labor markets are differentially exposed to computerization to the degree their industries were initially specialized in occupations with a high-routine task content. This hypothesis is inspired by the work of Autor and Dorn (2013), who document the impact of ICT on local labor markets in the USA more generally but not on newly arriving immigrants. The (testable) assumption is that ICT substitutes for workers with intermediate skills employed in routine-intensive occupations (e.g., clerks, assembly line workers, and machine operators) and complements highly educated workers in occupations with a high degree of abstract tasks, such as managers, professionals, and technicians. Falling ICT costs induce firms to substitute routine-intensive employment for computer capital and to hire workers complementary to ICT. We exploit that a region’s industry mix in 1970 strongly determines its specialization in routine employment in later decades. This allows us to use a region’s industry specialization in 1970 as an instrument for its routine specialization during our sample period. Paralleling the US experience, we find that local labor markets with higher initial routine specialization experienced stronger ICT investment and adoption, stronger employment growth at the top of the wage distribution, and a larger reduction of employment in intermediate wage ranks. Furthermore, we find evidence for a considerable increase in the wage gap between college and middle-educated workers in these regions. A novel result is that, in contrast to evidence for the USA, we find no indication of stronger employment growth at the bottom of the skill distribution due to ICT, in so-called manual or low-skilled service jobs. The ICT-induced growth of low-skilled service jobs, therefore, may be seen as less robust to changes in context. Similarly, the wage gap between middle-educated and lower educated workers did not change differentially across regions. We interpret these findings as suggestive evidence that progress in ICT fueled the demand for high-skilled workers in Swiss regions and, thus, increased the economic opportunities for them (relative to those with intermediate skills). Second, the main result of this paper is that the changes in economic opportunities due to ICT exposure had a strong impact on the skill mix of newly arriving immigrants. Our empirical analysis is guided by a simple location choice model (e.g., Grogger and Hanson 2011). Consistent with the prediction from this framework, we find that regions with higher routine specialization, and hence a larger increase in economic opportunities for talented workers, experienced a considerably stronger inflow of highly educated immigrants while the inflow of middle-educated immigrants was weaker in both decades between 1990 and 2010. Our preferred specification suggests that, on average, a 5 percentage point higher local routine specialization (roughly equal to the cross-region interquartile range) led to a 14% higher inflow of tertiary educated immigrants relative to those with middle education. At the lower end of the skill spectrum, we find no evidence for a differential inflow of immigrants with intermediate relative to lower skills. This is consistent with the insignificant change in the relative economic opportunities of the lower two skill groups. The change in the education mix of immigrants is paralleled by a change in their occupational composition: while the typical, newly arriving immigrant in 1990 was working in a lower qualified occupation such as craft, elementary, and service occupations, ICT exposed regions attracted more new immigrants working as professionals, managers and technicians and fewer working in middle-skilled craft occupations. We explore numerous alternative explanations for the differential inflow of highly and moderately skilled immigrants including the regional importance of ethnic networks, agglomeration effects, offshoring, and manufacturing decline. None of these factors nor a comprehensive set of sensitivity analyses invalidates these findings. Investigating the heterogeneity of these effects across sectors and regions, we find a much more pronounced inflow of highly educated immigrants into the service sector compared to manufacturing. Third, we analyze whether and how the inflow and location decisions of immigrants with different education levels changed when immigration restrictions were significantly altered. We exploit that Switzerland adopted a free movement policy in 2002, which liberalized access to the Swiss labor market for workers from EU member states. Immigration from other countries continued to be subject to quotas and restrictions. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that the FMP strongly increased the inflow of EU relative to non-EU immigrants in all education groups. We cannot reject the hypothesis, however, that the policy only affected the total inflow of immigrants but not the relative supply by skill group. Taken together, our results suggest that exposure to skill-biased technology led to strong shifts in the relative demand for highly educated versus middle-educated workers, changing their relative economic opportunities. The change in the landscape of relative economic opportunities attracted the supply of foreign talent (in absolute as well as relative terms). The last part of our analysis suggests that the abolishment of immigration restrictions did not alter this response. This paper makes important advances to a number of literatures. First, it relates to a growing literature on the determinants of talent flows and immigrant sorting across destination countries and regions (see, inter alia, Beine et al. 2016; Parey et al. 2017). While the growth in highly skilled migration and their clustering in Anglo-Saxon countries or across regions in the USA has been highlighted previously (Peri 2016; Kerr 2019), we know relatively little about factors driving these patterns across time and space. An exception is Grogger and Hanson (2011), who show that countries with higher earnings inequality attract a higher share of tertiary educated immigrants, a phenomenon referred to as positive sorting. We extend this analysis in at least four ways. First, we find evidence for positive sorting already in 1990 in different regions within Switzerland as one destination country. Second, an important novel finding is that positive sorting accelerated considerably between 1990 and 2010. This is consistent with the increase in the number and clustering of immigrant talent across countries documented globally. Third, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper extending prior work by highlighting the central role of ICT as one specific cause for these trends. Fourth, by exploiting a plausibly exogenous shock to a full range of relative economic opportunities, we offer an alternative to the common approach in the literature studying immigrant sorting, which typically correlates immigrant flows with potentially endogenous earnings differentials.Footnote 5 This is advantageous since earnings differentials might only capture part of the relative differences in economic opportunities, as pointed out by Amior and Manning (2018, p1942), that foreign-born workers factor into their immigration decision (next to employment opportunities created). In short, our findings show that Gould and Moav’s (2016, p. 1090) observation that economic inequality “determine[s] how a country competes internationally to attract high skill immigrants” extends even to the sub-national local labor market level. Second, our paper relates to a larger literature documenting the impact of ICT on local labor markets within countries.Footnote 6 This literature highlighted several adjustment mechanisms, e.g., the within-country reallocation of high-skilled workers across differentially exposed regions and of low-skilled workers across occupations (Autor and Dorn 2013; Autor et al. 2015), and the predominant role of young workers in the growth of high-skilled employment (Autor and Dorn 2009). In this paper, we highlight the entry and endogenous location decision of newly arriving immigrants as one important, and previously undocumented, local adjustment mechanism to the impact of ICT. Larger entry of foreign-born talent is one way local supply of skills may increase. This channel is complementary and potentially faster than the endogenous skill supply through youth’s investment in higher education. Concurrently developed as our paper, Mandelman and Zlate (2022) and Basso et al. (2020) show for the USA that the ICT-induced growth in low-skilled service sector jobs at the bottom of the wage distribution documented by Autor and Dorn (2013) is mainly driven by low-skilled foreign workers. Our findings illustrate that the absorption of foreign workers into low-skilled service jobs is possibly specific to context. For the Swiss context, we show that the absence of a strong differential response of middle-to-low-educated immigrants can be rationalized by the fact that economic opportunities did not change differentially in the lower half of the wage distribution. We do find, however, a strong response of highly educated immigrants adopting work in high-paying occupations, which was more modest in the USA. Finally, our study contributes to the literature evaluating the effect of immigration policies on the inflow of immigrants and their impact on the local economy. Earlier studies pointed to a complementarity between weaker immigration restrictions and greater demand-pull forces in destination countries leading to larger total inflows of immigrants (McKenzie et al. 2014; Mayda 2010; Ortega and Peri 2013). One example from our context is Beerli et al. (2021) who find that the abolishment of immigration restrictions for EU workers in Switzerland after 2002 led to a strong inflow of mostly highly educated immigrants and benefitted firms in skill-intensive sectors and those expressing difficulties to recruit skilled workers prior to the reform.Footnote 7 Our paper’s results highlight that a strong, long-term, and technology-induced increase in the demand for skills is the underlying cause that led to relatively stronger inflows of highly educated immigrants. This trend in the skill mix was already present before the reform. However, the reform accentuated the inflows of immigrants in all education groups and might have allowed regions with the largest skill demand to attract even more talent. The remainder of this study proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we lay out the conceptual framework and empirical strategy of our main specifications. In Section 3, we describe the data and variable construction we use, the context of immigration policies, and present descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we discuss our main results: the impact of ICT exposure on economic opportunities, the response in the skill mix of immigrants, and to what degree the free movement policy affected this response. Section 5 concludes our paper. All referenced supplementary material (including tables and figures denoted with alphabetic letters) can be found in Beerli et al. (2021).",2

Deole,Marc Oliver Rieger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As per the latest Gallup World Poll, if the opportunity arises, approximately 15% of the world’s adults—or more than 750 million people—would prefer to move to another country (Esipova et al. 2018). Their preferred destinations include the usual suspects of host countries, such as the USA, Canada, and Germany. As most preferred host countries are developed economies, it is safe to assume that economic motives form the basis of potential migrants’ decision to migrate. However, successful immigration depends not only on immigrants’ economic motives (Akgüç et al. 2016; Gibson and McKenzie 2011; Jaeger et al. 2010) but increasingly on the economic benefits they can bring to the host country. Consequently, many countries are designing immigration policies that maximize natives’ benefit net of immigration’s fiscal burden, as in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (Brücker et al. 2012; de Haas et al. 2018).Footnote 1 To understand immigration’s economic impact on the host country, a better understanding of immigrants’ economic preferences and culture is mandatory. Among the economic preferences, risk and time preferences play an essential role. To this end, this paper provides a detailed empirical investigation of the immigrant-native gap in economic preferences (EP gap hereafter) in one of the preferred host countries, Germany. Such a gap might have multiple causes, e.g., cultural or economic differences between the migrant’s home country and Germany, or a self-selection effect among migrants. Instead of attempting to distinguishing between diverse origins of the EP gap, in this paper, we restrict our focus to investigating the EP gap’s extent and evolution for Germany and list factors associated with this gap. More precisely, we first estimate the EP gap and underline its demographic and economic correlates. After that, we ask whether the EP gap has evolved in the last 70 years and list the correlates explaining its evolution. In particular, we ask whether the European Refugee Crisis in 2015, during which Germany received almost 890,000 asylum seekers (BAMF 2016; BMI 2016),Footnote 2 might have widened this gap and, if so, whether this is caused by a more considerable cultural distance of recent immigration cohorts or by reduced assimilation, caused by the arrival of a large number of immigrants within a relatively short timespan which overwhelmed usual integration programs. Following the existing research (Bonin et al. 2012; Constant et al. 2011), we highlight the pertinence of immigrants’ assimilation of host characteristics and identity in explaining the immigrant-native gap. Finally, we ask whether immigrant type (refugee vs. non-refugee, EU vs. non-EU origin) and their reason for immigration to Germany (economic vs. noneconomic) help moderate the EP gap. Our empirical analysis employs the latest waves of the German Socio-economic Panel dataset (SOEP, v35). To estimate the EP gap, we apply the random effects estimation technique with economic preferences as dependent variables. We consider the respondents’ following two economic preferences: risk attitudes and time preference (patience). The immigrant-native gap in these economics preferences are hereafter referred to as the risk gap and the time gap, respectively.Footnote 3 The estimation sample is restricted to first-generation immigrants (FGIs hereafter) and German natives with no immigration background. Our focus on FGIs stems from the intention to shed light on immigration policy’s role in deciding the EP gap in the host country. Before discussing our main results, in Fig. 1, we provide a plot of the raw data showing the extent of the EP gap in Germany. The figure compares the average economic preferences of German natives to those of major immigrant groups in Germany and shows that the EP gap is substantial. In other words, immigrants in Germany report lower average risk-taking levels but register as being more patient than German natives. We also notice a significant variation in the immigrant-native gap across different immigrant groups, which we exploit later in the empirical analysis. Economic preferences of immigrants in Germany The formal empirical investigation begins by confirming earlier observations of the existence of a non-zero EP gap in Germany. After that, we study whether the immigrant respondents’ demographic and economic characteristics help explain the narrowing of the gap in economic preferences. Regarding demographic characteristics, we find that being married further widens the risk gap compared to their non-married counterparts. Female immigrant respondents report a narrower risk gap than male immigrant respondents. Regarding economic characteristics, on the one hand, the respondents with lower education and those working in low-skilled occupations or being inactive on the labor market report a wider risk gap than their respective reference counterparts. On the other hand, compared to employed respondents, while unemployed immigrant respondents report a wider risk gap, the self-employed report a narrower risk gap. Concerning the individual-level correlates of the time gap, while the self-employed immigrant respondents report a narrower time gap, females and unemployed immigrants report a wider time gap. Next, we ask whether the EP gap has changed during the last few decades in Germany. In Fig. 2, we plot the averages of the absolute difference in economic preferences, a proxy indicator of the EP gap against the immigrant respondents’ year of immigration to Germany. We construct this indicator by subtracting the natives’ average value of the economic preference for the survey year from the immigrant respondent’s economic preference (for details, see Subsection 3.2). The size of the bubbles indicates sample weights applied using the number of observations in each immigration year. We make the following two observations: First, the EP gap is very high but remarkably stable across immigration years, especially the gap in patience. Second, recent immigration cohorts show a substantial increase in the risk gap, but we do not find any noticeable pattern in the time gap. Immigration cohort and the immigrant-native gap in economic preferences in Germany A priori, the increase in the risk gap for recent immigrant cohorts might simply be an artifact caused by their recent arrival in Germany: The gap might close once they have been here for a longer time. Therefore, using the respondents’ year of immigration to Germany, we investigate whether recent immigrant cohorts report distinct levels of the immigrant-native gap compared with older cohorts, controlling for the time since their arrival. Our results find that recent immigrant cohorts to Germany indeed report a larger risk gap, but do not report a distinctly different time gap. As immigrants nowadays often originate from culturally distinct parts of the world, we additionally study the role of immigrants' assimilation of host characteristics and identity in bridging the immigrant-native gap. The results indicate that the immigrants’ host language skills, both written and oral German, are negatively associated with the risk gap, irrespective of the risk gap’s association with their year of immigration to Germany. Moreover, immigrants’ assimilation of the host identity is negatively associated with the risk gap. Interestingly, the time gap is not associated with the respondents' host language proficiency.Footnote 4 We investigate the role of the immigrants' origin, the reason for migration, and the intended duration of stay. Our results indicate that the recent cohorts of European immigrants report a smaller risk gap than others, whereas immigrants originating from other world regions report a recent widening of the risk gap. Regarding the above discussion of the 2015 European Refugee Crisis, we also ask whether recent refugee immigrants report distinct risk gap patterns. While recent refugees report a much larger risk gap than non-refugee immigrants do, we do not see any evolution patterns of refugee immigrants’ time gap. Finally, we employ the information on immigrant respondents’ reason for migration and intended duration of stay together and conduct a policy-relevant investigation distinguishing how the EP gap differs between “stayers” and “opportunity-seeking” immigrants to Germany. For this analysis, we divide the immigrant sample into two broad categories of our own construction: We define opportunity seekers as those immigrants who immigrated to Germany for economic reasons and have a finite intended stay in Germany. We define all other immigrants with a permanent intended stay in Germany as stayers. The results indicate that opportunity seekers report a smaller risk gap than Stayers.Footnote 5 The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 summarizes relevant literature, particularly on immigrants’ risk and time preferences in various contexts. Section 3 describes the survey instrument, the data set, and the statistical methods we employ. Section 4 presents the main results of our paper and discusses them. Section 5 concludes.",2
36.0,2.0,Journal of Population Economics,09 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-022-00935-9,Economic geography of contagion: a study of COVID-19 outbreak in India,April 2023,Tanika Chakraborty,Anirban Mukherjee,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in November 2019 has created havoc worldwide. One of the striking features of the COVID-19 epidemic is the cross-country variation in terms of the number of infections and deaths. Even within countries, there is significant regional variation in the extent of the contagion. Factors that may explain such cross-regional differences include population density, urbanization, available infrastructure to carry out effective quarantine, and reporting errors. We propose an economic geography-based explanation. We argue that the degree of contagion depends on the degree of movement of people and goods between different regions, which in turn depends on the geographical pattern of regional development. Specifically, we argue that regions with an unequal distribution of economic activity are characterized by greater movement of goods and people and, hence, run a higher risk of contagion than area characterized by regional equality. The theoretical structure underlying our argument draws heavily on the new economic geography theory of economic development (see Krugman, 1991; Krugman and Venables, 1995). This theory argues that conditional on the level of transport cost, the process of economic development may end up creating a heavily industrialized, small core area surrounded by a large non-industrial periphery. Such areas are typically characterized by regional inequality, where goods are produced in the industrialized core and distributed to the periphery while people move from the periphery to the core in search of jobs. Hence, one may logically expect greater movement of goods and people in such an unequal region compared to relatively equal regions where sub-regions are self-sufficient. It is the degree of movement of goods and people that connects regional inequality with the risk of contagion. In an unequal region, the remote sub-regions (periphery) are all connected with the economic hub (core) and therefore to each other. If any of the hubs get affected—which is a likely scenario as hubs are densely populated—the contagion is more likely to spread to the remote areas as well as through the movement of goods and people. Given the heavy dependence of peripheral areas on the core in a core-periphery structure, in the event of an outbreak, any attempt to isolate the core will impose a very high economic cost on the peripheries. While economic geography could potentially explain at least part of the cross-country differences in the spread of infection, conducting the empirical analysis on cross-country samples hardly makes any sense as differences across countries could be due to a host of factors—like institutional, cultural, and political—that are difficult to measure and use as control variables in a regression. We, instead, explain variations in infection rates by variations in the extent of the core-periphery economic structure across regions within a country—India. We argue that a state with a greater degree of within-state regional inequality in economic activity will also have greater intra-state mobility, which in turn contributes to a faster spread of the epidemic. We propose a nightlight-based measure of inequality in economic activity and test our hypothesis using data on the spread of COVID-19, and mobility, between April 2020 and February 2021 along with information on the pre-COVID-19 incidence of nightlights across the districts of India. Night-time luminosity is a well-established measure used to compare economic and industrial activity across countries, as well as across regions within a country (Henderson et al. 2012; Prakash et al. 2019). We construct an index of regional inequality in economic activity based on night-time luminosity data across the districts of India to measure the core-periphery structure of a region. Higher inter-district nightlight inequality within a region reflects a stronger core-periphery structure in that region.Footnote 1 The COVID-19 data that we use is reported at the district level. India consists of 28 states and 8 union territories that are further divided into districts. At the time of the last census in India in 2011, there were 640 districts.Footnote 2 The districts are further subdivided into sub-districts and sub-districts into blocks. Given that the districts are the unit of observation, inequality must be measured at a level bigger than the district. The administrative level above the district—the state—is the natural choice. However, COVID-19 handling policies are determined at the state level and the organization of economic activities is also likely to be state-specific. Hence, state-level unobserved heterogeneity might confound the observed relationship between nightlight inequality and COVID-19 spread. Measuring inequality at the state level, however, prevents us from using state fixed effects to mitigate the problem of unobserved heterogeneity at the state level. We therefore construct nightlight inequality at the sub-state level, in the neighborhood of a district, and estimate its effect on the extent of the contagion in that district and use state fixed effects and state-level linear daily trends in our empirical specifications (see Sect. 2 for details of the inequality measure). While this strategy allows us to control for the unobserved heterogeneity at the state level, some concerns regarding identification remain. For example, we are unable to account for the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity at the district level since our measure of regional inequality does not vary within a district. In the Indian context, institutional decisions are made at the state level, which our fixed effects strategy takes care of. We also control for district-level nightlight, which accounts for the level of economic activity and associated factors at the district level. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity emanating from factors such as cultural differences across district clusters. These factors may lead to heterogeneity in policy implementation at the district level. For instance, a district that has better health infrastructure and stricter COVID-19 policy implementation could also belong to a region that is more equal in terms of economic activities. To address this, we control for a wide range of demographic, economic, and disease-environmental covariates at the district level. Our findings remain robust to the staggered inclusion of these covariates. Our primary findings suggest that higher nightlight inequality is associated with a greater extent of contagion. We argue that movement of people plays a key role in explaining this finding. Inequality in economic activity within a region leads to higher mobility, which in turn drives the contagion. We provide evidence on this channel in three ways. First, we use differences in potential mobility over lockdown and unlock periods announced by the Indian government to test whether the relationship between COVID-19 and regional inequality varied across the different lockdown phases. Second, we use mobility data from the Facebook Data for Good project to study the mechanism directly. Third, we use unemployment rates as a proxy for movement of people (or lack thereof) and investigate their interaction with the core-periphery structure.Footnote 3 The heterogeneity analysis using phases of lockdown shows that the core-periphery structure contributes to the spread of the COVID-19 infection only when the economy is not under lockdown. The results are absent or muted during the lockdown periods and early phases of unlock. We also find that movement of people as measured by the Facebook mobility data is strongly correlated with our measure of regional inequality and is the main driver of the primary relationship. Finally, using unemployment as a proxy for lower mobility, we find that for any two states with the same level of inequality in nightlights, the one with higher levels of baseline unemployment experiences a lower extent of contagion. The findings in this paper contribute to the section of the literature which looks at the policy response of governments in face of COVID-19. Milani (2021) shows how social connectedness across countries explains the cross-country similarity in social responses to COVID-19 pandemic. In the pre-vaccine phase of the contagion, the most common strategy practiced by any government was that of lockdown, which is complemented by health policies whose implementation and success in curbing the contagion varied across countries (Chiplunkar and Das 2021; Qiu et al. 2020). Lockdown policies affect economies in various nuanced ways. Bonacini et al. (2021a), for example, show that lockdown-induced work-from-home creates the risk of exacerbating income inequality. Bonacini et al. (2021b) show how people’s expectation formation can mitigate the effect of lockdown policies. Whenever a lockdown was imposed, it often was imposed homogeneously across all the regions of a country. Estimates of costs of a general lockdown vary, but they are all unequivocally large. In the context of India, for example, quite a few papers estimated the negative impact of lockdown policies on economic outcomes (Beyer et al. 2020, 2021). Hence, many have argued in favor of targeted lockdowns (Brunnermeier 2021). The findings in our paper suggest a road map of selective lockdown that can minimize the economic costs. The key driver of our results is mobility induced by regional inequality. This way, our paper is related with Caselli et al. (2022) who examine the effect of localized lockdown policies on individual mobility in Italy. Our findings suggest that contagion is likely to be more severe in areas characterized by higher mobility and that nightlight inequality is an easily available proxy of mobility. Accordingly, lockdown policies can be heterogeneous and the variations can be determined based on pre-existing nightlight data. While lockdown has been the most popular intervention to prevent the COVID-19 contagion, it is important to note that the policy implication of our paper applies to all possible anti-epidemic measures. After the COVID-19 vaccines were invented, vaccination spearheaded the anti-COVID policy measures. Nevertheless, the policy approach remains homogeneous, as in the case of lockdowns—vaccination drives were implemented with similar intensity across the country. We propose an ex ante selection criterion. We suggest that any anti-COVID-19 policy—be it creation of special COVID hospitals, lockdown or vaccination—can be more effective if implemented on a priority basis in areas with higher inequality in economic activity. The essence of our policy suggestions, however, is not COVID-19 specific; they can provide useful guideline for combatting any episode of pandemic in future. Nevertheless, we must emphasize that these are only suggestive policy implications. While we have controlled for a wide range of covarying factors at the district level that could drive our results, it is not possible to rule out unobserved heterogeneity completely. In the absence of strict exogeneity conditions, we must exercise caution in interpreting the results of our paper causally. Our paper is structured in the following way: We elaborate our argument and issues related to our framework in Sect. 2. We discuss the data and descriptive statistics in Sect. 3, the empirical strategy in Sect. 4, and the results in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6, we conclude.",

The USA went from a few dozen confirmed cases of COVID-19, caused from a novel coronavirus, to almost 800,000 cases in less than two months from late February to late April 2020 and had more than 30 million confirmed cases by the end of March 2021. In an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, several states and localities issued guidelines regarding social distancing and orders requiring workers to stay at home. Even when states did not enact strong stay-at-home orders, mobility data indicated a marked reduction in travel outside the home as Americans tried to avoid the threat of disease. The joint effects of pandemic-related fears and shutdowns shocked labor markets, reducing overall employment. While extended unemployment benefits and direct cash payments may have been sufficient to compensate some of those affected, others may have been pushed to seek additional public assistance or even early retirement to compensate for the loss in employment. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a particular threat to older and disabled workers, who are economically and physically vulnerable to the twin threats of long-term health impacts from virus spread and shutdown policies that reduced labor demand and supply. COVID-19 is associated with higher rates of mortality among those at older ages and with comorbidities (Rosenthal et al. 2020). While the longer-term health effects of COVID-19 are still not well understood, preliminary evidence suggests that lingering symptoms may preclude a return to work for those with “long COVID” or other persistent health concerns. Older and disabled workers are also more vulnerable to permanent labor market exits during recession-induced job losses and have additional margins of response due to the potential availability of benefits through Social Security. In particular, older and disabled workers are more likely to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) available to low-income individuals with disabilities, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) that provides income replacement to individuals with sufficient work history and a qualifying disability, and Social Security retirement (SSR) benefits for retired older adults with sufficient work history. In this paper, we examine labor market outcomes and Social Security spillovers among older individuals over the course of the economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We use the Current Population Survey (CPS) to track monthly employment outcomes at the individual level. Our analyses distinguish between workers aged 50–61 and 62–70 because there are differences in eligibility for Social Security benefits and different rates of baseline employment across these two groups. We also examine overall state-level monthly claims for SSDI and SSI and national-level monthly claims for SSR. All Social Security Administration (SSA) benefit claiming requires proof of eligibility, with SSDI and SSI requiring healthcare provider assessment. Actual receipt of benefits will lag the event triggering the application due to the time needed to apply, administrative processing, and in some cases, a potentially lengthy appeals process. Therefore, we include state-level monthly Google Trends data on online searches for retirement and disability to analyze benefit-claiming behavior and search activity that may indicate future benefit-claiming plans. We find evidence that employment among older workers declined sharply in April 2020 before slowly recovering and leveling off, leading to an average deviation from predicted employment of 5.7 percentage points for 50–61-year-olds (8.3%) and 3.9 percentage points for 62–70-year-olds (10.7%) between March 2020 and March 2021. For 50–61-year-olds, approximately 63 percent of the decline is due to increases in unemployment and 30 percent is due to increases in labor force exits due to reasons other than retirement and disability. Among 62–70-year-olds, the decline attributed to increases in unemployment is 50 percent and the next largest component is an increase in retirement of 1.2 percent, accounting for 30 percent of the employment decline, and representing a 2.4 percent increase relative to the baseline retirement level. Our results show consistent evidence of declines in labor market exits due to disability and applications for disability after the start of the pandemic. Older workers are 0.4 percentage points (4–5 percent) less likely to report exiting the labor force due to disability in the first year after the start of the pandemic. We find a larger (15 percent) decrease in overall disability applications, which appears to be driven by reductions in applications for SSI and concurrent SSI and SSDI applications. The average age of disability program applicants declines by 0.44 to 0.73 years in the post-COVID period, suggesting that older Americans are part of the “missing” disability applications. We also document a decline in Google search intensity for disability and related words of 7 percent. The implications of the pandemic for retirement behavior are more mixed. While the CPS shows increases in labor market exits due to retirement for 62–70-year-olds in particular, we do not find evidence that SSR applications changed differentially between March 2020 and March 2021 relative to predicted levels. However, our results do show a shift from SSA retirement applications filed offline to those filed via the internet. Our analysis of online search activity for SSR benefit claiming-related search terms finds declines of 7 percent relative to the period prior to the pandemic. Together, our results suggest that elevated labor market exits due to retirement have not yet been accompanied by a large increase in older workers transitioning to SSR during the first 12 months after the pandemic relative to what would have been predicted in its absence. We also examine heterogeneity in labor market outcomes by demographic characteristics. A differential impact on the more vulnerable is persistent throughout our results, in line with the marked reduction in SSI applications. Those with less education and Black and Hispanic people generally experienced worse labor market outcomes and were less likely to not be in the labor force for retirement reasons. Finally, we explore several potential mechanisms for our findings. While we cannot rule out supply-side explanations for reductions in employment, such as caregiving needs or virus fears keeping people out of employment, we also find evidence of demand-side explanations, such as employment reductions resulting from business closures and statewide shutdown policies. We do not find evidence that disability applications changed differentially based on state shutdown policies, degree of teleworkable jobs, or internet connectivity; however, survey data reinforce the fact that a non-trivial fraction of individuals decided not to apply for SSR benefits as a result of the pandemic (United States Census Bureau 2021). This rate was higher among those receiving unemployment insurance, suggesting that expanded Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits resulting from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, and the American Rescue Plan, signed into law on March 11, 2021, may have reduced incentives to apply for disability insurance or claim early SSR benefits. We contribute to a large and growing literature examining the labor market consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Bartik et al. 2020; Cajner et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020; Forsythe et al. 2020; Quinby et al. 2021). However, unlike this previous literature, we investigate how COVID-19 impacted labor market outcomes among the population aged 50–70, as well as applications to Social Security’s disability and retirement programs, which to our knowledge have not been examined in prior work. In addition, our research adds to the literature on the effects of recessions on older and disabled workers more generally and allows a comparison of how older workers fared in the COVID-19 recession relative to prior recessions. Prior research finds that when recessions occur near the time of retirement, older workers are more likely to leave the labor force and collect SSR benefits sooner (Coile and Levine 2007; 2011). Munnell and Rutledge (2013) document widespread effects of the Great Recession on SSI, SSDI, and early SSR claiming. Other work has found that older workers delay retirement in an effort to recover lost earnings and wealth (Brooke 2011; Chan and Stevens 1999; Gustman et al. 2010; Goda et al. 2011). This recession, however, differs in two primary ways from prior recessions. One, the catalyst was a global pandemic rather than a financial crisis, and two, the policy response was more extensive than during prior recessions. In addition to extensive public health-related policy responses not seen during the Great Recession, the CARES Act offered substantially more initial support for unemployed workers than any policy implemented during the Great Recession, both in terms of the scale and by expanding eligibility to workers traditionally ineligible for unemployment insurance, e.g., self-employed workers, independent contractors, and gig workers (Isaacs and Whittaker 2020). A large existing literature has found that disability claiming through SSI and SSDI is sensitive to economic conditions and the generosity of other related public programs, such as UI (Stapleton et al. 1998; Autor and Duggan 2003; Coe et al. 2010; Cutler et al. 2012; Maestas et al. 2015; 2018; Schmidt 2012; Black et al. 2002; Charles et al. 2018). These studies generally find that higher rates of unemployment lead to larger numbers of applications for SSI and SSDI, increasing both processing costs and benefit obligations substantially. Although more generous UI benefits are also associated with reduced SSDI claiming (Lindner 2016), the expiration of UI benefits did not lead to meaningful increases in SSDI applications during the Great Recession (Mueller et al. 2016). By contrast, our findings suggest that disability claiming has declined over the course of the pandemic. We explore several features of the COVID-19 recession that differ from prior recessions, including the profound health risks of in-person work, dramatic increase in the availability of telework, caregiving needs from school closures, and the immediate and sustained financial response providing stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits to many Americans who might have otherwise turned to Social Security programs. Our results support a literature showing that the most economically vulnerable likely experienced the greatest negative economic impact from the pandemic. Prior studies have documented that economic impact of the pandemic particularly affected employment among the oldest workers (Bui et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2020), the youngest workers (Montenovo et al. 2020), Hispanic and Black workers (Clark et al. 2020; Montenovo et al. 2020), immigrant men (Borjas and Cassidy 2020), women (Alon et al. 2020; Bui et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2020; Montenovo et al. 2020), and lower-earning workers (Bartik et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2020). Other studies have documented that the negative economic effects of the pandemic are not only acutely larger in magnitude for more vulnerable populations, but also reverse more slowly with reopening policies than for other worker groups (Cheng et al. 2020). In addition, evidence prior to the pandemic shows that disability applicants with low education and earnings levels are disproportionately affected by SSA field office closures (Deshpande and Li 2019) and that reducing transaction costs for disability insurance benefits can lead to higher levels of applications (Foote et al. 2019). Finally, our study also expands recent work using Google Trends to identify real-time internet search behavior that could be predictive of future population-level outcomes. Recent works by Gupta et al. (2020) and Bacher-Hicks et al. (2021) use Google Trends to identify effects of COVID-19 on unemployment insurance claiming behavior and inequality in online schooling across households, respectively. Our paper adds to this literature by analyzing Google Trends search indices for “disability,” “retirement,” and “Social Security,” which complements our analysis using application counts.",4
36.0,2.0,Journal of Population Economics,13 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-022-00916-y,Optimal interventions in networks during a pandemic,April 2023,Roland Pongou,Guy Tchuente,Jean-Baptiste Tondji,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this study, we develop a theory of optimal lockdown policy for a social planner who prioritizes population health over short-term wealth accumulation during a pandemic that spreads through networks of physical contacts. Using unique data on nursing home networks in the USA, we calibrate the model and quantify state-level preference for prioritizing health over wealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also uncover new results on the effects of network configuration, network centrality, and health policies on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. The application of our model to the spread of COVID-19 is timely and fitting. COVID-19 has affected millions of individuals and claimed many lives globally. To reduce its spread, governments worldwide have relied massively on lockdown and social distancing policies (Buchholz 2020). While lockdown measures have had some positive results, the associated economic costs have been considerable (Marquez-Padilla and Saavedra 2022). The gross domestic product in both developed and developing countries has decreased significantly as a result of economic contraction (International Monetary Fund 2020). The significant costs associated with quasi-complete lockdowns have forced governments to think about alternative policies that are less costly, such as imposing quarantine measures only on certain individuals while letting others go back to work. The natural questions that arise are how do we design optimally targeted lockdown policies that account for social network structure, and how do these policies affect health and economic dynamics? We address these questions for a society that, to a certain extent, prioritizes health over short-term wealth accumulation.Footnote 1 The problem is formalized using an N-SIRD model with lockdown as follows. Agents (including individuals and social infrastructures) are connected through a weighted undirected network of physical contacts through which the virus is likely to spread. At any point in time, an agent is in one of the following health compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and dead (D). Susceptible agents can become infected, while infected agents can recover or die. To reduce the contagion, a social planner enforces a lockdown which modifies the structure of the prevailing social network. Susceptible, infected, and recovered agents can all be sent into lockdown at different individual probabilities. The disease dynamics follow an individual-based mean-field model for epidemic modeling on networks.Footnote 2 The planner’s objective is to determine the lockdown policy that contains the spread of the disease below a tolerable infection incidence level, and that maximizes the present discounted value of real income (or alternatively, that minimizes the economic cost of the pandemic), in that order of priority. In other words, the social planner can allocate the “work-from-home” rights to achieve these goals. An appeal of our approach to the social planner’s problem is that it does not force us to assign a precise monetary value to health or to life.Footnote 3 Rather, it allows some flexibility in how to design policies, with clear health and economic goals in mind. For instance, the social planner could set an infection incidence level that allows to keep the number of infected individuals below hospitals’ maximum capacities. We apply our theoretical model to analyze: (1) the effect of network structure on the dynamics of optimal lockdown, infection, recovery, death, and economic costs; (2) the tradeoff between public health and wealth accumulation; and (3) how different measures of network centrality affect the probability of being sent to lockdown. To solve the planner’s problem, we first characterize the disease dynamics in our epidemiological model and obtain a unique solution under classical conditions. The rates of infection, recovery, and death at any given time are functions of the lockdown variable and the initial network of contacts that captures social structure. The basic reproduction number, R0, plays a role in enforcing mitigation strategies, including lockdown, when facing a potential virus spread.Footnote 4 The planner’s problem admits a unique solution that depends on both the infection incidence level tolerated by the planner and the prevailing network of physical contacts that characterizes the society. The tolerable infection incidence level and the network of physical contacts determine the disease dynamics and the economic costs of lockdown. The lockdown policies affect the total number of individuals experiencing infection during the outbreak. Using simulations which rely on realistic early COVID-19 transmission rate data, we conduct several comparative static analyses of our theoretical findings. Our results show that a higher tolerable incidence level results in lower lockdown rates and a smaller loss in economic surplus. While this finding illustrates the health-vs-wealth tradeoff the social planner faces, it does not prescribe any resolution since the planning decision depends on the relative value assigned to population health and short-term economic conditions by society. We also illustrate how lattice, small-world, random, and scale-free network structures affect optimal lockdown probabilities and disease dynamics, respectively. Our simulation results show that the cumulative proportion of the population sent into lockdown is always higher in random and small-world network structures than in lattice and scale-free structures. These lockdown policies translate to different epidemic and economic cost dynamics for each network. We extend our analysis to examine the potential impact of network density (or the interconnections between agents in a network) in our N-SIRD model for a small-world network. Our simulations show that optimal lockdown probabilities increase with network density.Footnote 5 Third, we illustrate how measures of network centrality affect optimal lockdown probabilities and disease dynamics. We present correlations between four network metrics—degree, eigenvector, betweenness, and closeness—and the average lockdown probabilities in a small-world network. Our simulation results suggest that individuals who are more central in such a network are more likely to be sent into lockdown. This implies that more restrictive lockdown policies have a greater effect on individuals who are more central in networks. Overall, our simulation results confirm the intuition that not all agents should be placed into full lockdown under the optimal policy (e.g., Gollier 2020a, 2020b, Acemoglu et al. 2021, Bosi et al. 2021, Chang et al. 2021, and ; Pestieau and Ponthière 2022). We calibrate our model and test some of its key predictions using unique US nursing home networks data. The senior population in the USA accounts for a significant share of America’s COVID-19 deaths (National Center for Health Statistics 2020; Conlen et al. 2021). The surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes led the American federal government to ban nursing home visits on March 13, 2020. This restriction enabled researchers from the “Protect Nursing Homes” project to construct a US nursing homes network, using smartphone data (Chen et al. 2021). We use this network data in conjunction with other nursing home and US state-level datasets to calibrate the N-SIRD model.Footnote 6 This calibration allows us to estimate the value of the tolerable COVID-19 infection incidence level (λ) for 26 US states. The parameter λ estimates the state government’s tolerable COVID-19 infection incidence, which by assumption represents the relative value the state assigns to population health and economic prosperity. As such, a higher value of λ describes a policy that tends more toward a “laissez-faire” regime (Gollier 2020a), indicating a planner’s inclination to maximize short-term economic gains. We find that the tolerable infection incidence level varies significantly across US states, making it possible to test some theoretical predictions of our model. We can attribute variations in λ to interstate heterogeneity and differences in states’ demographic and political characteristics, including the gender of a state’s governor, the party affiliation of a state’s governor, a state’s geographic location, and the number of COVID-19 fatalities in a state. These findings complement other studies showing an association between the political affiliation of a US state’s governor and COVID-19 cases and deaths (e.g., Neelon et al. 2021, and ; Baccini and Brodeur 2021). Using regression-based analyses, we find that laissez-faire policies are associated with more COVID-19 deaths, consistent with the results from the simulation analysis. Nursing homes that are more central in the network experience more COVID-19 deaths. However, laissez-faire policies are more harmful to nursing homes that are more peripheral in the network. We also find that the detrimental effect of laissez-faire policies on COVID-19 fatalities in nursing homes is potent in poorer counties and in for-profit nursing homes. In another empirical test of the N-SIRD model with lockdown, we investigate the relationship between US states’ tolerable infection incidence level for COVID-19 and the state’s GDP growth for 2020. We find that laissez-faire policies are associated with higher GDP growth, consistent with our simulation results. Interestingly, we find that the positive economic effect of laissez-faire policies is reduced for US states with a Democratic governor. Our paper contributes to several literatures. The epidemiological framework that we use to model the planning problem is a continuous-time individual-based mean-field model which belongs to the class of theoretical approaches for epidemic modeling on undirected heterogeneous networks; Pastor-Satorras et al. (2015) provide a review of these epidemiological models. This literature includes a class of mean-field models (Kephart and White 1992; Barabási et al. 1999; Green et al. 2006) and N-intertwined models via Markov theory in both discrete time (Ganesh et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2003) and continuous time (Van Mieghem et al. 2008). Asavathiratham (2001) and Garetto et al. (2003) review other general models for virus spread in networks based on Markov theory. These models extend the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) and SIRD (Hethcote 2000) epidemic processes to heterogeneous networks. To this literature, we add a reversible lockdown state to model disease dynamics in an SIRD epidemic framework. The targeted lockdown policy allows the planner to achieve specific health and economic goals. In this perspective, our study contributes to the literature interacting epidemiology and economics to address a variety of issues. Our model differs from previous approaches in two key respects: a lockdown variable and a weighted network of contacts that is not necessarily random.Footnote 7 In this weighted network, we also assume that agents are heterogeneous with respect to the intensity of their connections and their individual characteristics. Most importantly, we introduce a lexicographic approach to the planning problem. Our goal is to provide a dynamic economic and epidemiological model of lockdown, in which a planner must choose a lockdown policy which keeps infections below a certain threshold level at the minimum economic cost. Contrary to Bosi et al. (2021), who proposes a model where the planner imposes a single lockdown policy which remains constant over time, we propose a model where lockdown policy is dynamic, reversible, and subject to change over time. In this respect, our model is more in line with Gollier (2020a), Acemoglu et al. (2021), Alvarez et al. (2021), and Pestieau and Ponthière (2022).Footnote 8 Our study is also connected to the economic literature on the design of optimal interventions in networks. Ballester et al. (2006) and Banerjee et al. (2013) examine the optimal targeting of key players (that is, the first individuals to receive a piece of information) in a network. Galeotti et al. (2020) analyze optimal interventions that change individuals’ private returns to investment in a network. Nganmeni et al. (2022) analyze stable, inclusive, and Pareto-efficient vaccine allocations in spatial networks. Our research question differs in that we study optimal lockdown interventions in a network. In our model, the choice of lockdown strictness operates to control the spread of infection through the network. By focusing on contagion, our paper relates to the studies of Young (2009) and Young (2011), who investigate the diffusion of innovations through networks. Our work is also connected to the models of social learning dynamics in Buechel et al. (2015) and Battiston and Stanca (2015), with the main difference being that infection diffusion is exogenous in these models. Our epidemiological model also complements and extends (Peng et al. 2020), by allowing for diffusion dynamics similar to Lloyd et al. (2006). Additionally, since our network structure is not necessarily random, we are able to develop new applications. Although we only apply our model to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our theory has implications for other infections that spread through physical contacts. In line with Pongou and Serrano (2013), Chang et al. (2021), Fajgelbaum et al. (2021), Debnam Guzman et al. (2022), and Pongou et al. (2022), our study also contributes to the growing literature investigating the importance of network structure in the distributional effects of virus spread. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the N-SIRD model with lockdown. Section 3 describes and solves the planning problem. Section 4 uses simulations to provide comparative statics analyses of our theoretical findings. Section 5 provides an empirical application of the theoretical model. Section 6 discusses some policy implications and offers concluding remarks. The Appendices contain complementary information for the N-SIRD model and additional simulation and empirical results.",2

However, sickness benefit programs can, like any other insurance, be misused; employees who are fit to attend work may call in sick or may request benefits for longer periods than their health status calls for (Henrekson and Persson 2004; Hesselius et al. 2013; Dionne and St-Michel 1991). To reduce moral hazard, both welfare states and private insurers may require a medical certificate from a physician to verify sickness (OECD 2010). Physicians are used as gatekeepers to prevent illegitimate claims of paid sick leave. This is a costly practice, and it is not clear how well it works. This paper looks at the effect of a reform that removed the physician as a sickness certifier. In 2008, one municipality in Norway allowed all workers employed in the municipal sector to self-declare health-related absence for a whole year, which is the maximum entitlement period for temporary sickness benefits in Norway. The municipal workers were free to self-report sickness absence, but had to report regularly about their health and work capacity to their line leader. In other municipalities, and in the reform municipality prior to the change, the rule was that workers could self-declare periods of absence shorter than 9 days. For longer periods, they needed a medical certificate to obtain benefits. Normally, physicians also play a role in dialogue meetings (counselling) between the employer and the worker who is on sick leave. The reform naturally relegated the physician also from that scene. Instead, the employer took a more direct and active role in the counselling of sick-listed workers. If workers’ demand for sickness absence were unaffected by the reform, removing the requirement of a medical certificate would increase absenteeism. By how much depends on how strict physicians are as gatekeepers. However, the reform may reduce workers’ demand for absence. Workers’ demand for sickness absence depends on their health, on the replacement rate of the benefits and on the utility difference between staying home and attending work. Allowing workers to self-certify absence will probably not directly affect the health of the workers, nor will it change the replacement rate. The reform can, however, influence the non-pecuniary costs of calling in sick. The reform that we study here was announced (by the municipality) as the “Trust Project.” Recent research in behavioral economics has shown that many individuals want to return (reciprocate) the treatment they receive from others. For example, employers who show distrust towards their employees by imposing excessive control mechanisms may induce misbehavior (Ellingsen and Johannesson 2008; Falk and Kosfeld 2006). According to this logic, allowing self-certification of absence can foster greater loyalty and motivation among employees, which in turn may lower the demand for paid sick leave. In addition, frequent meetings with the employer (the line leader) while sick, without having the physician as a counselor, may also reduce the intrinsic utility (increase the hassle) of asking for a sick leave. Our data contains registered sickness absence for all workers in Norway during 2001 to 2014. To assess the impact of the reform on sickness absence, we compare absence among municipal workers in the reform municipality (Mandal) before and after the reform with the change in absence among municipal employees working in all other Norwegian municipalities. That is, we apply difference-in-differences (DD) logic, with Mandal as the treated unit and the other municipalities as controls, to assess the effect of the reform. We also consider the same model for employees who work in the private sector or for the central government as a placebo exercise. This helps us rule out the possibility of other contemporary shocks that may have affected Mandal. In addition, we use the synthetic control method to construct a control that better resembles the treated unit (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie et al. 2010). We can rule out large positive effects on absence in Mandal in the post-reform period, with strong evidence that the policy change actually resulted in a reduction in absence for female workers. One of the stylized facts regarding sickness absence is that in almost every country, women tend to have higher absence levels than men (Mastekaasa and Melsom 2014). It is interesting that extending self-certification of sick leave reduces the gender gap in absence. Since the female share of the labor force is around 80% in Mandal’s municipal sector (which is in line with the rest of the municipal sector), the effect of the reform is far stronger than if the same change in behavior had occurred among the male workers. We also find that the number of spells decreased, while the average length of the remaining spells increased. This suggests that the reform had a larger impact in preventing relatively shorter absence spells. Our main finding stands in stark contrast to the result from a Swedish experiment where a random sample of workers was granted 1 week of extra self-certification of sickness absence (Hesselius et al. 2009). We discuss potential reasons for these opposing results at the end of the paper. Although the main ingredient of the Mandal reform is that municipal workers are granted the right to self-certify absence, it also contains other elements, such as a stronger involvement in the sickness absence counselling by the employer. We do not have data to disentangle the importance of the different elements of the reform, so our results should be seen as the aggregate effects of all these elements. The main contribution of this paper is to use quasi-experimental data to estimate the effect of a policy that, at its core, excludes a costly procedure for constraining moral hazard in paid sick leave. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that Norwegian primary physicians spend as much as 10–15% of their working time on sickness absence certification.Footnote 1 Our finding that sickness certification can be taken out of the hands of the physicians without a subsequent rise in sickness absence should be of considerably policy relevance. The paper unfolds as follows. “Section 2” provides a brief introduction to the sickness insurance system in Norway and a description of the reform. “Section 3” presents a conceptual framework for analyzing the relation between medical health certificates, gatekeeping and sickness absence, and a discussion of how our paper relates to relevant literature. “Section 4” describes our data, while Section 5 presents our empirical setup. The results are reported in Section 6, along with some suggestions to their channels in Section 7. Section 8 discusses our findings and concludes the paper.",
36.0,2.0,Journal of Population Economics,20 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-022-00929-7,Health shocks and spousal labor supply: an international perspective,April 2023,Nicholas A. Jolly,Nikolaos Theodoropoulos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Researchers and policymakers have long been interested in the economic well-being of individuals suffering from work-limiting health shocks. With advances in the application of panel data techniques, researchers have been able to document the dynamic, long-term impact health shocks have on workers, specifically focusing on earnings, income, and hours worked. The onset of a work-limiting disability is associated with a large reduction in labor earnings (Stephens 2001; Charles 2003; Mok et al. 2008; Meyer and Mok 2019), which leads to downward movement in the earnings and income distributions (Nagi and Hadley 1972; Jolly 2013). An area that has received less attention is how the onset of a work-limiting disability influences the labor market outcomes of the affected individual’s spouse. This paper uses longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from 2006 to 2019 to study the relationship between labor supply and spousal health shocks. While understanding the individual experiences of disabled workers is important, it is necessary to explore the impact that work-limiting health shocks have on affected workers’ spouses, particularly if programs designed to assist the disabled are to be structured efficiently (Riphahn 1999). Given the financial distress caused by disability, it is reasonable for spouses to adjust their labor supply. Knowing the extent of this adjustment is necessary for understanding whether the loss of the disabled worker’s earnings is a permanent loss to family income or is offset by increased spousal earnings. Theory does not provide a clear prediction as to the directional relationship between work-limiting health shocks and spousal labor supply. On the one hand, the onset of a disability should increase spousal labor supply through the added worker effect. A permanent decline in a disabled worker’s earnings decreases spousal non-labor income, which should increase labor supply, assuming leisure is a normal good. The added worker effect may be amplified along four dimensions (Coile 2004; Wu 2003). First, a liquidity-constrained household that cannot borrow to insure against a permanent income shock may experience a larger added worker effect. Second, if the affected worker needs to leave the labor force and loses employer-sponsored health insurance, then the spouse may face added pressure to increase labor supply to qualify for insurance. Third, household expenses may increase due to out of pocket medical expenses, thus increasing the need to work. Finally, one spouse’s home production may substitute for the other’s. If the disabled individual increases time spent on home production, then this will free up market-based time for the spouse.Footnote 1 On the other hand, health shocks may reduce spousal labor supply. This occurs if the healthy spouse needs to provide in-home care to the disabled individual. Additionally, work-limiting health shocks reduce workers’ labor supply (e.g., Charles 2003), which leads to an increase in time spent at home. If non-market-based time of one spouse complements the other’s, then the disability should reduce spousal labor supply because of an increase in the consumption of joint leisure. Finally, public assistance programs that provide financial aid to those who suffer from work-limiting health shocks may crowd out spousal labor supply. Berger and Fleisher (1984) provide evidence of public program crowd out. The authors do not differentiate between the types of public assistance received; however, Chen (2012) provides evidence showing spousal labor supply crowd out from Social Security Disability Insurance. In this paper, we use 2006 to 2019 SHARE data to analyze the relationship between work-limiting health shocks and spousal labor supply. The SHARE data contain survey responses from individuals aged 50 or older and their spouses irrespective of age across 28 European countries and Israel. On average, our results show that men do not alter their labor supply decisions upon the onset of their wives’ health shock. Women married to men who suffer a health shock experience an increase in the probability of retirement and an increase in the desire to retire early. Additional analysis suggests that the need to provide care and the desire to consume joint leisure dominate any added worker effect that may exist. The results presented here add to a growing literature that has, to date, provided inconsistent results regarding the effect of spousal health shocks on labor supply. Each of the earlier studies on this topic uses data from a single country. Countries studied include the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, South Korea, and China. Differences in public assistance programs and social norms may lead to discrepancies in the estimated effects of health shocks on spousal labor supply decisions. Furthermore, there is variability in the type of health shock studied across the earlier literature (e.g., heart attacks versus self-reported work limitations). There is no reason to expect that different health shocks lead to the same spousal labor supply response. Our study contributes to this earlier literature by using SHARE data. The SHARE data contain survey responses from individuals across 28 European countries and Israel. Here, we focus on a single health shock and apply common sample selection criteria across all countries. This harmonization across countries, in addition to including individual-level fixed-effects in the estimated equations, allows us to control for any country-specific characteristics that may serve as potential confounding factors. In fact, we present evidence of substantial cross-regional heterogeneity in the estimated effect of health shocks on labor supply, thereby replicating the differences in the estimated effects found in the earlier literature. The paper proceeds by discussing the relevant literature in Section 2. Section 3 details the data and empirical methodology. Section 4 describes the results, while Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",

The gender earnings gap in particular has received increased attention over the past decade. One fact emerging from research is that the gender gap in earnings tends to be wider among university graduates than among those with lower education levels (Goldin et al., 2017; OECD, 2020). Existing literature suggests that an important part of the gender pay gap among university graduates stems from choices made earlier in the life course, namely university majors (Brown and Corcoran, 1997; Charles and Bradley, 2002; Machin and Puhani, 2003; Black et al., 2008). Men are more likely than women to study STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields. Women are overrepresented in humanities, social sciences, and educational sciences (Leuze and Strauß, 2009). Women are more likely to choose majors that typically lead to occupations with lower earnings and fewer opportunities for career progression (Charles and Bradley, 2002; Blau and Kahn, 2017). Gendered major choices thus have direct consequences on occupational segregation, on wage gaps, and on so-called glass ceilings—the idea that there are invisible barriers that prevent women from achieving top incomes and positions (Ponthieux and Meurs, 2015; Bertrand, 2018). Sex segregation by university major also has important indirect consequences. For example, it may reinforce existing gender norms and stereotypes, thereby limiting the perceived educational choices of future generations (Charles and Bradley, 2009). Most research seeking to explain the determinants of gendered major choices focuses on one of two types of factors. Some show the relevance of individual-level characteristics. These include personality traits such as competitiveness, beliefs about enjoying coursework, and preferences over expected jobs (Antecol and Cobb-Clark, 2013; Zafar, 2013). Others focus on the role of the social environment such as teacher role models or sex of high school peers (Carrell et al., 2010; Brenoe and Zoelitz, 2019). However, few studies have investigated the role of parents in shaping the choice of university major (e.g. Humlum et al. 2018; Vleuten et al. 2018). This is despite the fact that parents transmit occupation-specific resources to their children (Vleuten et al., 2018). Moreover, children observe and learn from the gender roles enacted by their parents (Crouter et al., 1995; Platt and Polavieja, 2016). For example, children learn about the degree to which their parents follow traditional gender roles by observing their occupations (Polavieja and Platt, 2014). This is because occupations differ in the degree to which they are regarded as typically female or typically male. The aim of this paper is to analyse whether the degree of femininity of mothers’ occupation and the degree of masculinity of fathers’ occupation affect whether their adult children choose gender-typical majors at university and to study underlying transmission channels, using Germany as a case study. Specifically, I distinguish between the transmission of occupation-specific parental resources and the transmission of gender norms. To capture the degree to which a mother’s occupation is regarded as typically female, I construct a rank-based measure based on the share of women in the occupation she held when her child was aged 15. I call this measure ‘femininity rank of mothers’ occupation’ or ‘mothers’ rank’. Similarly, I construct masculinity rank in fathers’ occupations (fathers’ rank), masculinity rank in sons’ majors (sons’ rank), and femininity rank in daughters’ majors (daughters’ rank). I use the term ‘gender-typicality rank’ to refer to masculinity and femininity rank at the same time. Similarly, I use ‘gender-typical’ when referring to typically male and typically female majors simultaneously. I exploit unique survey data of a nationally representative cohort of first-year undergraduate students in Germany in 2010. Using regression analysis, I examine the association between femininity rank of mothers’ occupation and masculinity rank of fathers’ occupation on the one hand and the gender-typicality rank of young adults’ university majors on the other hand. I thereby capture intergenerational positional changes in each person’s position relative to others of the same cohort and sex. Germany is an important case study because its labour market exhibits low occupational mobility. This means that initial major choices at university have long-lasting effects on career outcomes, such as lifetime earnings (Aisenbrey and Brückner, 2008). Approximately three-quarters of the gender earnings gap at labour market entry in Germany is explained by university major choice (Braakmann , 2008). This matters especially given that the gender pay gap in Germany is particularly high among university graduates. In 2006, women with Abitur (school-leaving certificate) and a vocational qualification earned 38% less than equally qualified men, while tertiary-educated women earned 42% less than men with comparable qualifications (OECD, 2008). I find that sons choose less typically male majors if their fathers worked in less typically male occupations, as measured by their respective ‘masculinity rank’. Sons’ choice is not correlated with their mother’s occupation. Daughters choose more typically female majors if their fathers worked in less typically male occupations and if their mothers worked in more typically female occupations. While the father-son and father-daughter associations hold generally, the mother-daughter association is statistically significant only under certain conditions: if mothers possess tertiary education, if mothers were employed, and among those living in East Germany. Moreover, the relationship between mother’s occupation and child’s major appears to be linear, whereas for fathers there are important nonlinearities. Specifically, results from quantile regressions and heterogeneity analyses show that the significant effects appear to be driven by fathers and students in less gender-typical occupations and university majors, suggesting that fathers in gender-atypical occupations can help break gender stereotypes and that the findings of the paper are at least partially driven by sons and daughters who defy gender-stereotypical major choices. In terms of effect size, a one standard deviation increase in masculinity rank in fathers’ occupation is associated with a 3% decrease in daughters’ femininity rank and a 5% increase in sons’ masculinity rank in major. As to why these effects occur, a large part of the results appears to be driven by children choosing a major that is closely related to parental occupation.Footnote 1 This supports a ‘direct transfer of resources’ channel, that is, the transfer of occupation-specific skills, resources, and networks from parents to their children. The results also suggest that at least some of the father-son associations are due to a transmission of gender roles, as embodied by fathers via the gender typicality of their occupation. The findings from this study have important implications. First, the relevance of parental socialisation points to the importance of policies that address early roots of gendered major choices. Second, the interactive effect of parental education with masculinity/femininity in parental occupation suggests that the status of role models may matter more than their sex for young people to identify with them. Third, the finding that intergenerational associations are strongest between fathers and sons points to a need for policy to focus on men (and not predominantly on women) when attempting to tackle sex segregation in the labour market. While it is important to encourage women to enter highly paid STEM fields, policy should also aim at changing men’s attitudes and encouraging them to enter traditionally female-dominated fields. The finding that sons with fathers in less gender-typical occupations choose less typically male university majors is therefore encouraging. I make three contributions to existing literature. First, the paper improves the understanding of gendered major choices by providing the first analysis on the role of gender typicality of parental occupation in Germany. Second, I introduce a new rank-based measure, which is used in research on intergenerational income mobility (Chetty et al., 2014) but has not been applied to gendered occupational and major choices. This is unfortunate because previously used measures, based on the share of women in an occupation/major, are affected by changes in the sex composition of the workforce as a whole. Instead, rank measures capture positional mobility between parents and their children, whereby each person’s position is relative to others of the same cohort and sex. Finally, I am able to distinguish between two different transmission channels by disentangling the transmission of parental resources from that of gender norms. I thereby contribute to the literature on the intergenerational transmission of gender norms, which mainly draws evidence from intergenerational associations in female labour force participation and does not allow for such a distinction. Identifying transmission channels is important for the design of effective policies to address sex segregation in university majors. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews existing evidence on the determinants of gender differences in university major choice, and describes how university major choice operates in Germany. Section 3 presents the data and methods. Section ‘4’ reports the results, section ‘5’ studies transmission channels, and the last section concludes.",

Urbanization refers to an increase in a country’s urban relative to its rural population (United Nations 2014; IOM 2015). In 1950, approximately 30% of the world’s population lived in urban areas. By the 2010s, this share had increased to over 50%, and approximately 66% of the world’s population is projected to live in cities by 2050 (United Nations 2014). Global warming refers to the observed heating of the Earth’s land and ocean surfaces since the mid-twentieth century. This process is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (IPCC 2014). From 1880 to 2012, global temperatures increased by approximately 0.85 °C, on average, when considering the combined land and ocean surfaces (IPCC 2014: 40). What is more, average surface temperatures are estimated to be between 0.4 and 2.6 °C higher in the 2046–2065 period compared to the 1986–2005 period, with further increases being likely for the remainder of the twenty-first century (IPCC 2014: 60). In this contribution, we examine whether the trends in urbanization and global warming are related. We focus on global warming because persistent increases in temperature are the starting point for a broader range of similarly persistent phenomena associated with global climate change, including, e.g., rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers, the increased prevalence of extreme weather-events (e.g., heat waves, floods) and changing precipitation patterns (IPCC 2014). For our empirical analysis, we use country-level data on temperature for 118 countries between 1960 and 2016 and link this data to national urbanization rates. Consistent with the literature, we argue that these urbanization rates primarily reflect rural–urban migration (e.g., IOM 2015). We show that higher temperatures are related to higher urbanization rates (and thus rural–urban migration) in the long run, where such long-term linkages are much more pronounced than any short-term ones. What is more, we find that the relationship between global warming and urbanization is particularly relevant to countries characterized by relative economic and institutional underdevelopment and strong dependence on agriculture, suggesting that these countries are less adaptive and more vulnerable to global warming. Furthermore, we find that the relationship between global warming and urbanization matters more strongly to initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones, which points to further heterogeneity in the global warming-urbanization nexus. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity and pro-urban shifts in public goods provision and that the global warming-urbanization nexus is partly mediated through these channels. Consequently, relying on a push–pull model of internal migration, we argue that global warming promotes migration both by contributing to poorer rural conditions (e.g., by adversely affecting agricultural production and wages) and an increased relative attractiveness of urban centers (e.g., by increasing demand for public goods primarily provided in cities). Our analysis is related to earlier empirical efforts that link other indicators of climate variation (e.g., shortages in rainfall, natural disasters) to urbanization and find that such variation tends to promote urbanization, especially in poorer countries (e.g., Barrios et al. 2006; Annez et al. 2010; Gray and Mueller 2012; Mueller et al. 2014; Beine and Parsons 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Mastrorillo et al. 2016; Maurel and Tuccio 2016; Henderson et al. 2017).Footnote 1 We add to these studies in four ways. First, we employ statistical tests and econometric methods to adequately account for various data features such as non-stationarity, cointegration and cross-sectional dependence. Disregarding these features (such as the obvious trending in urbanization and global warming) may have seriously biased previous empirical estimates of the relationship between temperature and urbanization. Second, our study is the first to differentiate between the short-run and long-run linkages between global warming and urbanization. This is advantageous because the short- and long-run consequences of increasing temperatures may differ, e.g., with respect to the nature and size of estimated relationships. We identify these short- and long-run effects using the dynamic fixed-effects estimators in a panel vector error correction framework. Third, within this framework we can identify heterogeneous linkages in the global warming-urbanization nexus that are governed by country-specific mediators. While previous research has already shown that differences in the levels of economic development, the role of the manufacturing sector, dependence on agriculture and agricultural policies may moderate the association between rising temperatures and urbanization (e.g., Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Maurel and Tuccio 2016; Henderson et al 2017; Peri and Sasahara 2019; Chort and de la Rupelle 2022), we extend this analysis by also looking at previously unappreciated mediators such as initial urban bias, i.e., the preferential treatment of urban center with respect to public investment as well as access to markets, institutions and public goods. Fourth, we explore the role of potential transmission channels by means of a suggestive mediation analysis, studying both the influence of potential mediators on the warming-urbanization relationship and the association between temperature and variables that reflect the proximate mechanisms. Here, we can corroborate earlier evidence that rising temperatures undermine agricultural productivity (e.g., Beine and Parson 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Maurel and Tuccio 2016), but we further consider a hitherto unappreciated transmission variable, showing that temperature increases also correlate with stronger differences in the provision of public goods between urban and rural areas. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss in more detail how increasing temperatures may be related to urbanization. In Sects. 3 and 4, we introduce our data and examine it for the presence of cross-sectional dependence, panel unit roots and the existence of a long-run relationship between rising temperatures and urbanization. In Sect. 5, we run a series of panel vector error correction models to estimate the short- and long-run effect of increasing temperatures on urbanization. We also study how the global warming-urbanization nexus is moderated by a variety of country-specific conditions and explore potential mechanisms. Section 6 concludes.",1

Ajefu,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The birthweight of a newborn is an important health indicator that has implications for short-term and long-term health risks. In utero exposure to a wide range of shocks during gestation can affect birthweight (Alderman and Behrman 2006; Almond and Currie 2011). This implies that the level of exposure to external shocks during gestation may affect not only health at birth but also the trajectory of an individual’s health and socioeconomic outcomes.Footnote 1 The main objective of this paper is to fill a research gap by providing evidence that extends the literature on the impacts of drought shocks on birth outcomes in Sub-Sahara Africa. The research gap relates to the detailed exposition of the interrelationship between birth outcomes and shock timelines. The primary research question addressed in this paper is, does the timing of the drought shock matter in understanding health outcomes at birth? This study focuses on the timing of the occurrence of drought shocks in early life and explores the underlying variation to capture timeline-bound exposure. There are several pathways along which extreme weather events (precipitation and temperature) across early life timing can affect birthweight.Footnote 2 Complementary primary pathways include food security captured through harvest variations and water scarcity that affects household access to water through low rainfall during gestation. Other pathways include the disease environment through excessive rainfall during gestation and destruction of infrastructure from historically excessive rainfall. This conceptual framework distinguishes impacts of precipitation shocks observed during the most recent planting season from those observed during the gestational period.Footnote 3 In this study, we test a hypothesis on the impact of each precipitation pathway using reduced form analyses on maternal history data from a low-income country. This approach separates the implied resource variability from the direct intrauterine shocks in a manner that presents a detailed understanding of the impact of weather shocks on birth outcomes. The existing literature depicts birth outcomes in response to exposure to in utero nutrition or to direct gestation shocks in isolation. This paper bridges a gap in the literature by investigating interaction effects of harvest and gestation weather-induced shocks on birth outcomes. It is unclear whether this approach will reveal differential impacts from exposures to harvest and gestation shocks. This is because measures of harvest yields have an overlapping capacity with the gestation period that is not feasible for direct gestation shocks. This has important implications for targeting of intervention programs to mitigate impacts of weather-induced shocks for pregnant women in low-income populations. For instance, a broader understanding of the different components of weather-related shocks on socioeconomic outcomes could provide insights into how to improve child and maternal health outcomes in rural areas. We therefore investigate how strategic components of rainfall shocks impact birth outcomes. In this paper, we focus on maternal health data from Sierra Leone. This setting is important for the following reasons. First, Sierra Leone is a fragile country due to the history of civil war (which ended around 2002) and has been at the center of disease outbreak in the last decade. For example, Sierra Leone suffered a serious Ebola outbreak that ravaged Africa between 2014 and 2015. This history may lead to weaker institutions thereby intensifying the impacts of adverse early life shocks compared to other low-income countries in Africa. It is well established that conflict halts the development of infrastructure across diverse sectors of the economy including agriculture and healthcare (Murdoch and Sandler 2004; Blattman and Miguel 2010). Second, University of Delaware weather data for Sierra Leone between 2002 and 2014 show a prevalence of low precipitation shocks — drought spells — relative to the norm across its 153 chiefdoms. Our paper tries to tease out potential malnutrition pathways for intergenerational weather shock impacts of birth outcomes. Third, Sierra Leone has one of the highest incidences of low birthweight in Sub-Sahara Africa. In 2015, about 14.4% of births in Sierra Leone were in the low birthweight category (WHO 2021; World Bank 2021). In 2019, Sierra Leone recorded about 3080 infant deaths. The infant mortality rate of approximately 8.1% is significantly high relative to the world average of 3.8% in the same year (World Bank 2021). These factors distinguish our paper from existing studies in the region while also providing additional insights into alternative pathways for weather shocks (Bakhtsiyarava et al. 2018; Grace et al. 2015). To achieve the above objectives, we match birth outcome data from the Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) with precipitation data from the University of Delaware historical weather archive. The findings of this paper show a somewhat symmetric impact of alternative drought pathways on birth outcomes. We interpret harvest variability results from the harvest drought shocks as depicting a reduced-form impact from the maternal nutrition or food security pathway. This result shows that an incidence of harvest drought reduces average birthweight by approximately 4% while increasing the incidence of low birthweight (LBW) by 59%. Placebo regressions using the out-of-season, past and future rainfall droughts show no association, hence reinforcing our hypothesis that seasonal impact is through harvest patterns. We make an inference on the contemporaneous water scarcity pathway during gestation by estimating the results of gestational drought shocks. Our findings show weak evidence on the contemporaneous gestational drought only for the low birthweight indicator. We interpret this as an association between water scarcity and the propensity for low birthweight of around 54%. We provide alternative sensitivity tests to address endogenous and selection issues to support the robust association of these shocks and birth outcomes to enhance causal interpretation of the estimated treatment effects. Heterogeneous impacts of the estimated shocks on birthweight show a concentration of impacts for households at the bottom of the pyramid of wealth distribution with further evidence of mitigating patterns by access to antenatal healthcare. This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways: First, it fills the knowledge gap on the timeline-bound impacts of in utero droughts on birth outcomes. Second, it demonstrates that the mitigating role of antenatal care for disadvantaged pregnant women during unanticipated shocks is limited to harvest droughts. The use of droughts from timeline variation extends the literature on the interaction of droughts and birth outcomes. More importantly, this approach helps to understand the underlying determinants of child and maternal mortality with in-depth insight (Kalipeni et al. 2017; UNICEF 2016; WHO et al. 2014). Hence, this paper helps to provide context to support evidence-based decisions for intervention on pregnancy-related health outcomes. Our findings also contribute to another strand of the literature on the interaction of underlying impacts of local transitory weather shocks on welfare outcomes of smallholder farmers in low-income countries. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the data sources and define shock pathways in association with drought timelines. Section 3 provides the empirical methods. In Section 4, we present the estimated results and discuss the main findings, and conclude in Section 5.",1

This had led policymakers to view university access as a key to social mobility and spurred a large literature on higher education and social mobility (Blanden and Machin 2004; Britton et al. 2016; Chetty et al. 2017, 2014). In the interest of improving access, universities across the world have introduced affirmative action policies to diversify the profile of their student intake and increase the participation of disadvantaged individuals who were traditionally less likely to attend university (Arcidiacono and Lovenheim 2016). In this paper, we explore the labor market returns of a specific disadvantaged group that is targeted as part of the affirmative action policy in England, the Widening Participation (WP) agenda (Gorard and Smith 2006): “first-in-family” (FiF) university graduates, those whose (step) parents do not have a university degree. The goal is to understand whether university serves as an equalizer for their outcomes or if they face a penalty for their socioeconomic background in early career. The existing evidence on how FiF individuals fare in the labor market is limited to the USA and is contradictory. Manzoni and Streib (2019) show that there is a substantial gap in wages between first-generation and continuing-generation students (those whose parents have degrees) 10 years after graduation in the USA. They find a similar raw “generational” wage gap among men and women (11% and 9%, respectively). Controlling for race and motherhood decreases the gap to an insignificant 3% among women while controlling for these characteristics as well as for early educational attainment and labor market choices (industry, occupation, hours worked, and location) decreases the gap to an insignificant 4% among men. Simply comparing raw wages across FiF and non-FiF graduates in the 90s, Nunez and Cuccaro-Alamin (1998) find no difference in wages one year after graduation among those employed in the USA. In this same period, Thomas and Zhang (2005) find a small FiF penalty shortly after graduation that increases to about 4% by the end of the fourth year in the labor market. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence on the labor market outcomes of FiF graduates outside the USA. This paper documents how FiF university graduates fare in the labor market in England. First, we compare the probability of employment, hours worked, and the annual and hourly wages of FiF and non-FiF graduates using regression and decomposition methods. This allows us to explore whether FiF graduates have different labor market outcomes than their non-FiF graduate peers (those whose parents are also graduates). Second, we estimate the returns to graduation for the entire group of individuals who had the potential to go to university based on their secondary school attainment. This allows us to probe our earlier findings and disentangle the effect of an individual’s graduation from their family background. This helps us understand whether potential FiF young people earn differential returns to graduating university than young people whose parents are graduates. We use linked survey-administrative data on a sample of young people born in 1989/90 in England. While being FiF is not random, we exploit rich data on the observed pre-university characteristics of young people, including detailed childhood measures of family background and prior educational attainment. Furthermore, the data allow us to look at how university and employment choices and general adult life circumstances contribute to wage differences between FiF and non-FiF graduates. Our results show that controlling for a rich set of pre-university individual characteristics, most importantly for early educational attainment, FiF graduate women face a 7.4% wage penalty in term of log hourly wages compared to non-FiF female graduates who match their parents with a university degree. The magnitude of this association is stable across several robustness checks, including entropy balancing and propensity score matching, but it loses significance in some specifications. We find no evidence of this penalty for male FiF university graduates. In fact, we find that conditional on pre-university characteristics, male FiF graduates earn more on average than non-FiF male graduates, although this relationship is not stable across all robustness checks. We find no evidence of a meaningful FiF disadvantage for men or women in terms of the probability of employment or hours worked. We investigate the potential channels of these differences using a Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition, which decomposes the FiF wage gap into an explained part that is the consequence of FiF and non-FiF graduates having different individual characteristics (endowments) and an unexplained part that consists of the different returns they have to these characteristics. We find that for women, some characteristics of FiF graduates explain two-thirds of the female FiF penalty. These include lower pre-university educational attainment, a lower probability of going to an elite university, a higher likelihood of working in a job that does not require their highest educational attainment, a higher likelihood of choosing “Education” as a university course (major), a lower likelihood of working at large firms, and a higher likelihood of having a child than non-FiF graduate women. Interestingly, some of these characteristics are true for FiF men, too: FiF men are also more likely to work in a job that does not require their highest degree and less likely to work at large firms than non-FiF graduate men. While theoretically, FiF graduate men also should earn less than non-FiF graduate men based on their endowments, they close this endowment gap by about two-thirds via different returns to these characteristics. We propose that as men are less likely to graduate on average than women, men are more positively selected not just in their observed but most likely also in their unobserved characteristics, which could explain why men overcome some of their social disadvantage, but women do not. Lastly, we find that the average returns to graduation in terms of hourly wage are insignificant and close to zero for both genders at age 25. However, these models also reveal that the association between being a potential FiF and wages is significantly positive among men and significantly negative among women. Thus, the gendered FiF-wage relationship that we observe in the sample of graduates is not exclusive to graduates. It is clear, however, that the negative female FiF wage gap is the consequence of the large negative effect of having non-graduate parents in general and not the consequence of the returns to graduation being smaller for women with non-graduate parents. This implies that the intergenerational transmission of labor market advantage via parental education is gendered and not exclusive to graduates. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. We present an overview of related literature in Section 2, the data in Section 3, and our empirical approach in Section 4. We compare the labor market outcomes of FiF and non-FiF graduates in Section 5.

This is apparent not least in the country’s skewed sex ratios and the large number of missing girls and women (Sen 1992; Clark 2000; Klasen & Wink 2002; Jha et al. 2006; Anderson & Ray 2010; Jayachandran 2017; Milazzo 2018). Studies have also documented unequal health investments between girls/women and boys/men (Arnold et al. 1998; Mishra et al. 2004; Jayachandran & Kuziemko 2011; Dercon & Singh 2013; Barcellos et al. 2014), as well as gender gaps in education within families (Kingdon, 2005; Azam and Kingdon 2013; Kaul 2018; Hervé et al. 2022). Son preference refers broadly to the view that sons are more valuable than daughters (Clark 2000). Patrilocality and patrilineality, which often render sons a primary source of old age security for their parents, are two of the most prominent factors contributing to son preference (Das Gupta 2010; Jayachandran 2015). Parents’ preference for sons can manifest itself in different ways. One way is outright preferential treatment of boys, whereby parents act more favourably towards sons than daughters. Son preference can also lead to behaviour aimed at ensuring the birth of a son. Indian parents often have a strong preference for having at least one son (with much weaker preference with regard to the gender of additional children) (Pörtner 2015; Jayachandran 2017). To ensure the birth of a son, parents may either continue childbearing until they have a son, i.e., gender-specific fertility stopping, or use sex-selective abortions.Footnote 1 We will refer to these behaviors broadly as gender-biased fertility strategies. Therefore, our use of the term son preference encompasses both outright favoritism of boys and the use of gender-biased fertility strategies by parents, and our use of the term gender-biased fertility strategies encompasses both sex-selective abortion and continuing childbearing until the birth of a son. In this paper, we investigate the impact of son preference in India on gender inequalities in a number of education indicators. Our main aim is to distinguish the impact of preferential treatment of boys from the impact of gender-biased fertility strategies on education inequalities between girls and boys, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in a rigorous way. While preferential treatment of boys and gender-biased fertility strategies are both expressions of son preference, they are distinctly different phenomena. Preferential treatment of boys refers to the relative treatment of children who have been born, and can be thought of as son preference on the intensive margin. Gender-biased fertility strategies are son preference on the extensive margin, affecting whether boys or girls are born, and into which type of family. As such, preferential treatment of boys is expected to directly affect education inequalities in favor of boys. The effect of gender-biased fertility strategies on education inequalities is, however, less straightforward. It has been suggested that sex-selective abortions may reduce gender inequalities, since girls will more often be born into families where they are wanted (Goodkind 1996; Davies & Zhang 1997; Anukriti et al 2022; Rastogi and Sharma 2022). However, sex-selective abortions are more common among high caste families and better-educated mothers in well-off families than among economically disadvantaged (Chakraborty and Kim 2010; Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Jayachandran 2017; Pörtner 2022).Footnote 2 Therefore, boys are more likely to be born into families with high socioeconomic status (SES). Edlund (1999) argues that this in turn could potentially create a female under-class. Similarly, in families that continue childbearing to have a son, the birth of an additional girl increases family size. This creates gender inequalities in education due to girls living on average in larger families, which, according to the theory of a quality-quantity trade-off, invest less per child (Jensen 2003). In addition, high birth order children have an educational disadvantage compared to low-birth order children (Behrman and Taubman 1986; Congdon Fors and Lindskog 2023). Parents’ decision to continue childbearing and their decision on how soon they try to have another child will also create inequalities between girls and boys in early-childhood investments (Jayachandran and Pande 2017; Pörtner 2022), which has potential consequences for education performance and investment later in life. Therefore, gender-biased fertility strategies may lead to education inequalities even when girls and boys are treated equally within the family. Economic development appears to reduce preferential treatment of boys (Grant and Behrman 2010; Kleven and Landais 2017; Evans et al. 2020; Dao et al. 2021; Perrin 2022). When families become richer, they can afford to invest (equally) in all their children. However, the desire to have a son seems to be deep-rooted in India and there is little indication of a decreased use of gender-biased fertility strategies. Sex ratios at birth have steadily worsened over time (Kulkarni 2020), driven largely by a preference for smaller families coupled with the unchanged desire to have at least one son (Arnold et al 2002; Jayachandran 2015). This begs the question whether it is possible to achieve equal opportunities for girls and boys (who are born) in the presence of gender-biased fertility strategies, or whether these fertility strategies in themselves create disadvantages for girls, even if parents (or the society at large) do not discriminate against girls (who are born). Policies that would reduce favorable treatment of boys or the use of gender-biased fertility strategies are likely to partially diverge. For example, dowries should increase the desire to have a son rather than a daughter but do not necessarily induce parents to invest more in their son than in their daughter, since investments in daughters may partially substitute for dowries in the marriage market (Jayachandran 2015). Therefore, eliminating dowries would be expected to impact education inequalities primarily via the impact on the use of gender-biased fertility strategies. Policies aimed at reducing the incentive to have a boy at all costs, for example a pension system or programs aimed at reducing the perceived financial burden associated with daughters should also help to eliminate education inequalities due to gender-biased fertility strategies.Footnote 3 Since parents appear to prioritize boys’ education over girls’ education when they are credit constrained, policies that reduce or protect against poverty are likely to reduce favorable treatment of boys. Programs that address gender-specific barriers such as access to toilets or safe transport, will also reduce preferential treatment where these barriers matter (Adukia 2017; Muralidharan and Prakash 2017). To distinguish between the impact of preferential treatment of boys and the impact of gender-biased fertility strategies, we rely on the division of families into those with first-born girls and those with first-born boys. The division of families by the gender of the first-born serves to separate families that are more likely to use gender-biased fertility strategies from families that are much less likely to do so. Since sex-selection was not common for first births in India during the time period covered by our data (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Jha et al. 2011; Bharadwaj et al. 2014; Pörtner 2015; Rosenblum 2013, 2017), gender of the first-born can be considered random. However, the gender of the first-born has important consequences for the use of gender-biased fertility strategies. Families with a first-born girl might use these strategies to ensure the birth of a son, while families with a first-born son have less reason to use such strategies. In short, we will treat the gender of the first birth in all families and the gender of all children in families with first-born boys as exogenous. In Sect. 2.2, we provide evidence that gender of the first-born is random, and that gender-biased fertility strategies are widespread in first-born girl families while they are rare in first-born boy families. To estimate preferential treatment of boys we use the estimated gender effect in families with first-born boys, where gender of later-born children is exogenous. To estimate gender inequalities that are due to gender-biased fertility strategies, we compare the first-born girls’ and the first-born boys’ families. We essentially use a difference-in-difference strategy where first-born boys’ families are the counterfactual without gender-biased fertility strategies and first-born girls’ families are the “treated” group who frequently resort to gender-biased fertility strategies. The interaction term between first-born girl family and gender reveals if girls fare worse in the families that frequently resort to gender-biased fertility than in the families that do not. Note that we estimate an average effect of the combined use of sex-selective abortions and gender-specific fertility stopping in first-born girl families and cannot separate between them. Even if first-born girl families have more reasons to use gender-biased fertility strategies, everyone will not need and want to. We also investigate heterogeneity with respect to characteristics likely to be associated with the strength of son preference: whether the state sex ratios are skewed or in the natural range, age of the mother at first birth and co-residence with the fathers’ parents, where paternal grandparents will often have strong son preference (Robitaille and Chatterjee 2017). We next move on to further investigate sub-channels. We first investigate whether education inequalities are due to boys more often being born into high SES families and girls into low SES families that also end up having more children. For first-born girl families, we test whether there are systematic differences between the families where subsequent girls end up and the families where subsequent boys end up. We then estimate the consequence of the inferred difference between boys’ families and girls’ families on educational indicators. Since there can be additional differences between girls’ and boys’ families these will be lower bounds.Footnote 4 Next, by adding family fixed effects, we investigate education inequalities between siblings in the same family due to either gender-biased fertility strategies or preferential treatment of boys. However, since this can only be identified for a sub-sample of rather large families with at least three children (the first-born plus one girl and one boy), results should be interpreted with care. We use a wide range of education indicators, including indicators of performance (completed grades and test scores) as well as indicators that can be considered pathways: time investment (enrollment and hours spent on school), pecuniary investment (the private–public school choice and education expenditure) and height-for-age (HAZ). HAZ is a potential link between inequalities in early-life environment and investment and later-life education outcomes. This is interesting since the earlier literature documents implications of gender-biased fertility strategies on early-life investments (Barcellos et al. 2014; Jayachandran and Pande 2017). Our results show that both gender-biased fertility strategies and preferential treatment play a role in creating education inequalities between boys and girls, but gender-biased fertility strategies appear to be more important for most outcomes. This suggest that, as long as the desire to have a son persists, economic development will not automatically eradicate the gender gaps in education. Further, we show that gender-biased fertility strategies cause systematic differences in the types of families girls live in compared to the types of families boys live in. Our within-family estimations, on a sample of relatively large families, indicate within-family effects of gender-biased fertility outcomes on pecuniary investment. They also show that preferential treatment of brothers over their own sisters seems to be of at least equal magnitude compared to preferential treatment of boys compared to girls in the main estimations. We contribute to the literature on son preference in several ways. This literature has mostly considered effects on early-life outcomes and/or survival (Sen 1992; Clark 2000; Klasen & Wink 2002; Jha et al. 2006; Anderson & Ray 2010; Milazzo 2018; Arnold et al. 1998; Mishra et al. 2004; Jayachandran & Kuziemko 2011; Dercon & Singh 2013; Barcellos et al. 2014; Jayachandran & Pande 2017). Education investment and outcomes have received less attention. While there are papers documenting gender gaps (Kingdon, 2005; Azam and Kingdon 2013; Kaul 2018, Hervé et al. 2022), these typically do not explain the connection to son preference and gender-biased fertility strategies. The seminal paper by Jensen (2003) shows how gender-specific fertility stopping leads to girls living in larger families than boys, and how this can create inequalities in education investment even if girls and boys were treated equally within families. We extend the analysis of Jensen (2003) by analyzing more recent data, when sex-selective abortions were widely available and fertility rates were much lower. We also use a different strategy to identify gender inequalities that are due to different sources. In particular, gender-biased fertility strategies can also lead to within-household differences, as has been shown by, e.g., Jayachandran and Pande (2017) and Barcellos et al. (2014). As such, one cannot simply use a within-between family distinction to investigate the impact of gender-biased fertility strategies versus preferential treatment. As pointed out by Edlund (1999), the more frequent use of sex-selective abortions in high compared to low SES families implies that girls and boys are born into different types of families, thus potentially creating a female under-class. However, as noted by Goodkind (1996) and Anukriti et al (2022), sex selective abortions could also decrease gender inequalities, if families with stronger son preference use them more often. It is thus an open question whether the combination of sex-selective abortions and gender-specific fertility stopping create large differences in the types of families that girls and boys live in. We investigate this, and the implications thereof on education investment and performance, empirically. We contribute to the literature that estimates gender gaps in education. In this literature, within-family gender gaps are typically interpreted as favoritism (Kingdon 2005; Azam and Kingdon 2013; Kaul 2018). However, gender-biased fertility strategies imply that gender cannot be treated as exogenous in the Indian context. Family fixed effects, which is the strategy typically employed in the literature, is not enough to deal with endogeneity of gender (see, e.g., Bharadwaj et al. 2014). Within family gender gaps could be influenced by gender-biased fertility strategies, and so does not only reflect pure within-family favoritism of the boys. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2 we describe the data and present total gender inequalities and evidence of gender-biased fertility strategies, while in Sect. 3 we present the empirical strategy. In Sect. 4 we present the empirical results, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",1

In this study, we take explicit account of the timing of childbearing in order to enrich our understanding of the factors that cause its delay. We show that, by accounting for factors that have so far eluded the attention of the aforementioned literature, we can uncover empirically observed patterns in the dynamics of cohort fertility rates, both analytically and quantitatively. In this respect, our framework can facilitate a more accurate design of policies aimed at the economic impact of demographic change (e.g. population ageing). Increasing mean age at birth in recent decades Since the latter parts of the twentieth century, some developed countries witnessed a moderate, but also persistent, increase in their total fertility rate (TFR) known as the ‘fertility rebound’ (Luci-Greulich and Thévenon 2014).Footnote 2 For some researchers, this marked the end of low fertility rates (e.g. Goldstein et al. 2009)—an outcome with significant socio-economic implications, since it occurred in countries with below-replacement fertility rates. Although the TFR increase has been modest, the cumulative impact could have significant repercussions by alleviating the strain that population ageing imposes, and will continue to impose, on social security systems and on national healthcare services. Nevertheless, in light of the delay in childbearing, and given the methodology used to measure the TFR, one could argue that the observed reversal in fertility trends may, at the outset, reflect a mere tempo adjustment: the initial stages of childbearing postponement cause a notable drop in the TFR measurement, but as higher birth rates eventually materialise at older reproductive ages, the TFR adjusts upwards. Obviously, if the fertility rebound is just a figment of the TFR measurement in an environment of postponed childbearing, then any attempt to delve deeper into its underlying characteristics and its potential implications seems of rather limited interest. Is it a mere statistical correction though? A look at Fig. 2, which depicts data on completed cohort fertility (CCF)—a measure which, compared to TFR, reflects the intertemporal elements of fertility choice more accurately—reveals that this is not always the case.Footnote 3 While Japan and South European countries have seen successive generations of birth cohorts bearing fewer children on average, other developed nations, e.g. USA, Canada, Nordic countries, and Northwestern European countries, have either already experienced increased fertility from several successive generations of birth cohorts, or seem to be entering a similar phase of demographic change. For these countries, the tempo effect of delayed childbearing seems to have coincided with an actual quantum effect of increased overall childbearing. Put differently, for some countries, and for a significant number of successive cohorts, the increase in the number of births at older reproductive ages was more pronounced than the decrease in the number of births at younger reproductive ages, thus leading to an actual increase in cohort fertility. This outcome has also been pointed out by Andersson et al. (2009) whose empirical analysis led them to the conclusion that ‘fertility postponement does not always imply fewer children’ (Andersson et al. 2009; p.325). The evolution of completed cohort fertility (CCF) Motivated by these facts, our study aims to present a model that is consistent with the aforementioned trends in the timing of childbearing and the dynamics of cohort fertility. It emphasises and formalises the idea that, for a reversal towards higher cohort fertility to emerge, factors that have a direct impact on childbearing preferences (e.g. cultural change, medical advances, family-related policies) must complement economic factors (e.g. the return to education)— and be sufficiently strong as well— in contributing to the postponement of parenthood as the economy grows. When these conditions do apply, then a rebound of cohort fertility is a genuine change in demographic trends, rather than a mere statistical correction. To motivate our approach even further, consider the 2020 Inglehart-Welzel world cultural map, which distinguishes groups of countries whose populations’ cultural profiles are open to more progressive changes, from groups of countries whose populations’ cultural profiles are more rigidly attached to traditional values.Footnote 4 Based on this, the 2020 Inglehart-Welzel index of secular-rational vs traditional values gives a numerical score, with higher values indicating a greater degree of cultural openness (as opposed to cultural rigidity). In Table 1, we report these scores for the groups of countries whose data we use in Fig. 2a–c. Computing the average across each group, we observe that Nordic countries display a greater degree of cultural openness than the groups of countries whose demographic data are displayed in Fig. 2b and c. What is particularly interesting from the combined reading of Fig. 2a–c and Table 1 is that the CCF rebound is more pronounced in countries with a high degree of cultural openness, whereas countries that are culturally rigid are the ones that see motononically declining CCF rates. So far, existing models have focused solely on the return to human capital investment as the factor that generates a postponement of childbearing (e.g. Iyigun 2000; d’Albis et al. 2018). This is an outcome that emerges in this study as well: we construct an overlapping generations model in which parents have two reproductive periods. In the first period, they face a trade-off between childrearing and human capital investment; in the second period, the trade-off is between childrearing and labour supply. We verify that the rise of the return to education motivates individuals to postpone parenthood for the latter stage of their reproductive age—an outcome that finds strong empirical support in the existing literature (e.g. Bloemen and Kalwij 2001; McCrary and Royer 2011). Nonetheless, the existing evidence suggests that the return to education is not the only factor promoting the postponement of childbearing. On the contrary, there are several other factors that can have a more direct impact on the timing of childbearing. For example, cultural changes towards gender equality, female emancipation, the gradual decline of the importance of traditional family values, and the corresponding gradual increase of the desire for individual autonomy have been shown to be major determinants of the postponement of parenthood (e.g. van de Kaa 1987; Liefbroer 2005; Bernhardt and Goldscheider 2006; Mills et al. 2011). This is aptly reflected in Beaujouan’s (2020) argument that the ‘rise in late childbearing across the low-fertility countries […] certainly reflects the diversity of childbearing norms and constraints across different countries’ (Beaujouan 2020; p. 225). These changes in cultural values and social norms, which have raised the desirability and the acceptability of late childbearing, have been supported by medical advances that gave individuals more freedom and ability to choose this aspect of family planning—advances such as improved contraception methods (e.g. Goldin and Katz 2002) and in vitro fertilisation (e.g. Tan et al. 1992). It is also worth emphasising the example of Nordic countries, where the institutional and policy environments are considered models on how to sustain relatively high fertility rates in developed nations (Bernhardt 1992). Some researchers have argued that these policies merely reflect and, at the same time, accommodate the progressive cultural environment of Nordic countries. Andersson (2008) could not be more explicit when he argues that ‘family policy has never specifically targeted childbearing but has rather aimed at strengthening women’s participation in the labour market and promoting gender and social equality […] Policies are explicitly focusing on individuals […] the goal is to enable women and men to raise the number of children they want to have’ (Andersson 2008; p. 90). Our model’s novelty is to capture the aforementioned ideas by incorporating a direct, preference-related factor that reinforces agents’ desire to delay some of their childbearing in the process of economic growth. We show that an intermediate stage of demographic change in a developed economy, where cohort fertility actually recuperates, emerges if and only if this preference-related factor contributes to the postponement of parenthood. This outcome is consistent with existing views and evidence that link the recuperation of fertility rates to culturally induced changes that directly affect people’s preferences (e.g. Arpino et al. 2015; Esping‐Andersen and Billari 2015; Feichtinger et al. 2017; Beaujouan 2020). Nonetheless, the model also shows that the trend reversal from declining to increasing cohort fertility is followed by yet another reversal towards once more decreasing fertility rates. This latest phase of demographic change will eventually lead to a cohort fertility that is even lower compared to the one that marked the onset of the fertility rate’s recuperation. This outcome has major policy implications: It implies that, even when the rebound the fertility is a true change in demographic trends, it is still a temporary one. The likelihood that cohort fertility will eventually drop below the one that marks the onset of the CCF rebound means that governments should be less reluctant and more proactive in the design and implementation of policies that will address the adverse future socioeconomic implications of population ageing. We also undertake a series of numerical examples to test our analytical results quantitatively, using data from countries whose cohort fertility dynamics display the different phases of demographic change that emerge in our model. This quantitative analysis shows that our model is a reasonably good fit for the actual data of completed cohort fertility in these countries. In light of the fact that there are countries which, despite experiencing a shift in the timing of childbearing, have not undergone a rebound in cohort fertility rates, we should emphasise that our model is consistent with such outcomes. As we indicated previously, the preference-related factors that reinforce the delay in childbearing must be sufficiently strong to generate a rebound of cohort fertility; if the impact of these factors is not strong enough, cohort fertility declines monotonically. If anything, the fact that the rebound in completed cohort fertility is observed in countries that are widely considered as the most progressive ones, in terms of their cultural norms and in terms of their family-oriented policies, offers even more credence to the ideas and mechanisms that we advance through our model. This is perhaps a testament to the fact that the explicit consideration of the direct, preference-related factors relevant to the timing of childbearing, opens an avenue for further research. This research can uncover several relevant, but yet unexplored mechanisms, in the joint dynamics of demographic change and economic growth. Indeed, the reduced-form manner through which we incorporate the preference characteristics that underlie the timing of childbearing opens up a wide array of possibilities for future research and policy implications. Given that the results of our model are inexorably linked to the so-called fertility rebound in developed economies, this study is also related to research work that has uncovered this phase of demographic change in models of economic growth. In Futagami and Konishi (2019), a fertility rebound emerges because of the rising longevity induced by R&D-driven technological progress, whereas Ohinata and Varvarigos (2020) attribute the fertility rebound to differences in the human capital elasticities of childrearing costs and output. However, none of these studies considers issues pertaining to the timing of childbearing, which is actually the key underlying mechanism of this study.Footnote 5 Furthermore, the fertility rebound in these models is the final phase of a three-stage process of demographic change; i.e. they do not uncover a reversal back to declining fertility rates. However, a look at the completed cohort fertility of Nordic countries (see Fig. 2a) is indicative of yet another reversal towards declining fertility rates—a reversal that it is likely to occur gradually in other developed nations. The remaining analysis is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the model’s set-up and derive the optimal choices regarding fertility and human capital investment. Section 3 is devoted to the dynamics of cohort fertility. Section 4 presents the quantitative investigation and implications of our analytical results. In Sect. 5, we conclude.",

Recent studies have also shown that human capital is essential in explaining the link between institutions and economic development (Gennaioli et al. 2012; Glaeser et al. 2004). Under the assumption that political power is linked to landownership concentration in pre-industrial economies, assessing the role of land inequality becomes fundamental for understanding the path of development of countries and regions. This paper aims to analyze the relationship between land inequality and literacy rates in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century in Italy.Footnote 1 I build a new dataset at both the district and province levels in Italy from 1871 to 1921, which allows me to exploit both the temporal and cross-sectional dimensions of the relationship between landownership concentration and education. I estimate several regressions at each point during the considered period, showing how this relationship seems to be fairly stable over time. However, when I explore the panel dimension of the dataset, the relationship vanishes over time. This was likely due to different institutional shocks such as population enfranchisement and polity regime changes to implement public policies (i.e., decentralization vs centralization). The most important shock was the introduction of the Daneo-Credaro law in 1911, which transferred the decisions to invest in public schooling from municipalities to the central government, thus limiting the political power of local notables. By interacting the initial level of landownership concentration with time shocks, I employ a stepwise difference-in-differences strategy to account for the differential effect of those institutional changes on areas with a different distribution of political power. The dataset’s cross-sectional and panel structure creates several advantages in terms of identification strategy. The panel dimension allows me to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, whereas the cross-sectional dimension permits me to exploit the advantages of an instrumental variable approach that helps identify a causal relationship between landownership concentration and education levels. More specifically, I use malaria pervasiveness as a source of exogenous variation in land inequality. Extensive research documents the link between latifundia and malaria. This thesis was put forth by Celli and Fraentzel (1933), who linked malaria endemicity with the creation of large estates, a pattern observed for centuries in the Pontine marshes, a plain in the surroundings of Rome. At the same time, extensive literature documents the greater capacity of large farmers to cope with the risks of malaria-infested areas (see Snowden (2008)). They were forced to manage adverse shocks and adopt appropriate incentive-compatible strategies, while rural workers were discouraged from living close to the lands, thus influencing their settlement pattern. I find the following results. First, separate cross-section estimates at different points in time reveal a negative impact of the measure of land inequality on literacy rates. Second, IV estimates, using malaria as an instrument, rule out concerns regarding potential endogeneity. Third, the validity of the exclusion restriction hypothesis is addressed in Section 5.3. Although malaria may affect education outcomes through health channels, robustness checks demonstrate that the main findings are hardly changed under second-order assumptions. Finally, once I explore the panel dimension of the dataset, further evidence to support the negative association between land inequality and education levels is provided, albeit it seems to vanish over time, in line with the “passive modernization process” Italy was facing at that time (Felice 2013). The main contribution is twofold. First, although much literature at a global level has already documented the impact of extractive institutions and inequality on growth factors, I find that the epidemiological environment is a strong predictor of historical land inequality. Specifically, this paper demonstrates that malaria virulence was a major driver of landownership concentration in Italy. Second, I explore the mechanism of the effect transmission behind the observed relationship to distinguish between the impact of supply and demand factors. I argue that landownership concentration may have adversely affected literacy rates, not only influencing the supply of schooling through the political process but also affecting the private demand for education of landless peasants. A vast amount of literature has primarily focused on the role of landowning elites in preventing the poor majority from gaining education and power. Assuming that large landowners rule local municipalities and acquire decision autonomy to invest in human capital, as in Italy in the post-unification decades, their interest lies in the vote against the expansion of public spending on mass schooling. I gather information on the number of public schools and the corresponding appointed teachers and municipal expenditures and restrict the sample to rural areas with low urbanization rates to test the relationship between supply factors in education and land inequality. I find partial support for the hypothesis that the transmission mechanism worked through political voice. Consequently, while local notables, on the one hand, might have low returns to invest in public schooling, on the other hand, they could have burgeoning stakes in the industrial sector.Footnote 2 However, since the industrialization process presumably made for a greater demand for education (see Galor and Moav (2006)), I assess whether demand factors played a role too. Using data on enrollment rates and child labor, I find that the poor majority, which faces tightening budget constraints and limited opportunities for upward mobility and offering their labor outside agriculture, had fewer incentives to invest in human capital. Hence, land inequality affects human capital accumulation in diverse ways. This influence not only operates through the role of extractive institutions blocking the supply of public schooling infrastructures but also via demand effects. I proceed as follows. In Section 2, I survey the corresponding literature review. In Section 3, I briefly provide a historical background of post-unification Italy. Section 4 describes data, while Section 5 outlines the econometric methodology and reports the main empirical results, focusing on the role of malaria as a source of exogenous variation of latifundia. Moreover, I conduct several robustness checks, enabling the identification of a plausibly causal relationship between land inequality and education. Particular attention is also devoted to panel estimates, with a stepwise diff-in-diffs approach. Section 6 focuses on the different possible channels of transmission of the effect. Finally, Section 7 provides concluding remarks.",1

This increase, also known as demographic change, is often regarded as a one-dimensional phenomenon. In reality, though, demographic change is a combination of several developments coinciding. The two most important causes are that people are living longer (longevity effect) and that large “baby boom” cohorts are currently close to retirement (cohort effect). These two effects differ substantially. The longevity effect is slow and monotonic and will (probably) be sustained. By contrast, the number of births per year and net migration can move in either direction and changes more rapidly over time. The impact of past birth rates and migration on the demographic structure diminishes in the long run, however. This paper illustrates how a longer life expectancy and fluctuating cohort sizes differentially affect PAYG pension systems. More specifically, the paper asks who achieves higher returns due to these effects within a PAYG pension system. Furthermore, the paper answers the question of how the type of a PAYG pension system alters the results. Developing a sustainable solution for PAYG pension systems requires separating the two effects. To answer these research questions, the paper decomposes the effect of demographic change into cohort and longevity effects, taking Germany as an example. A simple theoretical model provides intuition for the underlying mechanisms. It illustrates how the two effects, in general, alter the payment structure within various kinds of PAYG pensions systems. The paper then applies a large quantitative overlapping generation (OLG) calibrated to the German population. This model shows that differences between the rates of return of cohorts within different PAYG pension systems are economically sizeable. The model also decomposes the overall rate of return differential. It quantifies how much of the differentials stem from the longevity effect, the cohort effect and a third employment effect originating from the rising labour force participation. Contrary to the widespread view, decreasing mortality rates have an unambiguously positive impact on the rates of return generated within a PAYG pension system. Holding the cohort size at birth constant, longer life of individuals results in a population increase. In turn, the population increase expands the budget of the pension system. In a PAYG pension system (permanent), expansions result in gains that are distributed depending on the specific pension system. Varying cohort sizes, by contrast, result in winners and losers in PAYG systems. The key difference to the rise in life expectancy is that the impact of a large cohort is transitory. So each expansionary gain to the system is offset in the long run with a loss. However, cohorts benefiting from gains are not necessarily those bearing losses. Overall, the demographic change in Germany has a positive impact on the rates of return participants realize in the German PAYG pension system. The distribution among the cohorts is unequal, with a difference of 1.3 percentage points per year over the whole life cycle. The cohort that benefited the most is the birth cohort of 1939, with an excess return of 1.2 percentage points compared to a world without demographic change. The birth cohort of 2026 will have a slightly negative excess return of − 0.1 percentage points. The longevity effect drives most of the excess return. The maximum excess return due to the longevity effect realized by birth cohort 1937 is 0.8 percentage points. The cohort effect is responsible for a maximum excess return of 0.2 percentage points for the cohort born in 1936. The 2005 cohort loses out on returns to the tune of 0.4 percentage points. So the maximum return differential between cohorts is 0.6 percentage points compared with a demographic setting without cohort fluctuations. To evaluate the welfare consequences of different pension systems and the interplay with the population scenario, I compute consumption equivalent variations (CEV). The CEVs are the percentage change in consumption over the life cycle required as compensation for individuals to be indifferent between the benchmark German pension system and alternative pension systems, i.e. fixed contribution and fixed benefits. For most cohorts, a pension system with fixed benefits would be better than the current German pension system. On the other hand, only a few cohorts would be better off under a pension system with fixed contributions instead of the current system. This study is related to papers that investigate the role of demographic change in pension systems and its scope for reforms using microsimulation models, including Werding (2013) and Börsch-Supan et al. (2016). Fenge and Peglow (2018) identify the isolated effects of mortality, fertility and migration developments on the dynamics of the German pension system. These papers use budgetary linkages between the pension system and the rest of the economy to forecast pension variables and investigate the sustainability of specific PAYG pension systems. In contrast, this study shows how demographic change affects the economic benefits of PAYG pension systems from a generational perspective. This study also investigates this generational perspective under different forms of PAYG systems. In this sense, this study relates to a strand of the literature that uses small-scale general equilibrium OLG models to derive analytical results for the effect of changes in demographic variables in PAYG systems. Gori and Fanti (2008) show how crucial the capital share in production is to determine whether prolonged longevity increases or decreases the pension level in PAYG systems. Fanti and Gori (2012) analyse how a change in fertility affects pensions. They find a falling fertility rate need not necessarily cause a reduction in the pension level in the long run. Building on this, Cipriani (2014) shows in a two-period OLG framework with exogenous fertility as well as endogenous fertility that increased longevity implies a reduction of pension payouts for those who survive until retirement. In a three-period OLG model, Cipriani (2018) shows that when retirement decisions are endogenous, the effect of longevity on payouts in PAYG pension systems is in general ambiguous. Dedry et al. (2017) show also in a two-period OLG framework that both the type of ageing, i.e. declining fertility or increasing longevity, and the type of pension system are important for capital accumulation and welfare. This study adds to the literature by deviating from these papers in three ways. First, the applied model excludes any indirect effect that stems from behavioural responses of households or general equilibrium effects. Even though these endogenous reactions are important in a full economic analysis, they fundamentally rely on the specific model assumption, e.g. the degree of capital market integration. By ignoring general equilibrium and behavioural effects, this study determines the direct effects of the demographic change that would otherwise be disguised. This study also assumes that individuals cannot optimize their participation in the state-run PAYG pension system.Footnote 1 Second, a multi-period OLG model like in this paper is better suited to fully capture the demographic change observed in the data. The complex population structure of the model allows for a more detailed discussion of quantitative results. This is not equally feasible in the two- or three-period OLG framework of the above-mentioned studies used to obtain analytical results.Footnote 2 Third, as with the first strand of literature, the discussed papers focus on the effect of changes in demographics on pension benefit levels or contribution rates at specific points in time. This paper takes a more general approach and calculates the rate of return each cohort makes within the PAYG system. This rate of return better reflects the life cycle of cohorts and it also takes the changing demographics into account, e.g. decreasing mortality risk. This study describes the effects of different aspects of ageing on the rates of return within a PAYG pension system. It focuses on the interplay between demographic change, balanced intratemporal pension budgets and lifetime cash flows of individuals. Given the current structure of such a system, this paper evaluates the redistributional effect of the demographic change within PAYG pension systems. The remainder of this analysis is organized as follows. In Section 2, the paper presents the empirical details on the demographic change in Germany. It contains a decomposition of the general demographic change into its components. In Section 3, a simple analytical framework illustrates the effects these demographic developments pose for different types of PAYG pension systems. In Section 4, a quantitative OLG model is presented that incorporates these effects in a more complex setting. The calibration of the quantitative model is shown in Section 5. Quantitative results for the rate of return within PAYG systems are then presented in Section 7 and welfare implications in Section 8. Section 9 discusses the limitations of the analysis and Section 9 concludes the paper.",1
