Wells describes the horrific implications of a purely capitalistic system. His warning portends the inevitable consequence that wealth between social classes will necessarily diverge further and further if the lower classes are consistently exploited by what one would infer to be the social inefficiencies of capitalism. This kind of criticism should be expected from Wells and other Marxists, but this trend has spilled over into mainstream thought, and such critiques are commonplace. As a result, an expectation that the government will intervene and solve the inefficiencies of the market has taken root. Unfortunately, sometimes the cure is worse than the disease, and oftentimes, sweeping government actions have undesirable side effects. According to the Austrian School, this is the case with monetary inflation. This paper will analyze the implications that changes in the money supply have on wealth inequality and show how government-sponsored monetary inflation actually exacerbates wealth inequality. A new model is proposed here that links these two variables to demonstrate how changes in the money supply directly affect wealth inequality. This work further hypothesizes that these effects are more pronounced at the extremes of the wealth distribution. It subsequently tests that hypothesis by comparing the effects of our model to various measures of inequality, including some that emphasize inequality at the extremes. Finally, it is concluded that as a result of these effects, government monetary policy must be reexamined. The problem of wealth inequality has been a topic of debate for centuries, and much has been written on the subject. Marx and other socialist writers of the nineteenth century focused their analyses on the consequences of wealth inequality and the immorality of its existence. Contemporary writers, however, have analyzed its causes in an effort to find solutions to the problem. Kuznets (1955) drew a relationship between economic growth and wealth inequality, contending that the advancement of industrialization and urbanization widens the wealth gap. Over time, as more workers enter the newly-productive sectors of the industrialized economy, the gap will begin to tighten, creating an inverse-U-shaped path. The declining end of the Kuznets’s U-curve is also marked by political and social factors that further bring the wealth extremities together. Kuznets’s inverted-U hypothesis has been the topic of many studies since he first proposed it. Piketty and Saez (2003) expanded on Kuznets, noting that since the 1970s, the inverse-U seems to have doubled back on itself, and wealth inequality is back on the rise. They argued that possibly another industrial revolution has taken place and that we are on the increasing end of another Kuznets U-curve. Piketty and Saez also noted the precipitous drops in top wage shares after two major disasters in the 1900s: the Great Depression and World War II, emphasizing the role of the upper income brackets on wealth inequality. Methods of measuring income inequality are very significant when discussing the widening of the wealth gap. Braun (1988) discussed eight different measurements of income inequality, including the Gini coefficient, Theil’s index of inequality, Atkinson’s measure, and the Nelson index. Using 19 independent socio-economic status variables, Braun showed that the most significant factor in all relevant measures affecting income inequality is education, specifically the standard deviation of educational attainment. Mean family income comes in a distant second. Nelson (1984) suggested top wage earners are afforded more economic opportunities, leading to a further disparity between them and the lower and middle wage earners. The wealth inequality literature to date has focused primarily on the ability of high-wealth individuals to compound their wealth by taking advantage of industrialization, education, or access to more economic opportunities relative to those with less wealth. These analyses imply that while wealth for all classes rises together, the resultant inequality comes from the rate of growth varying across different income brackets. This mode of thinking is one-sided, concentrating only on factors that increase wealth while neglecting possible causes of wealth erosion. If a disproportionate rate of growth widens the wealth gap, then certainly a disproportionate degree of wealth erosion is likely to exacerbate wealth inequality as well. When investigating the potential causes for wealth erosion, inflation immediately comes to mind, but wealth inequality literature has not analyzed inflation as an explanatory variable. While the majority of work written on wealth inequality seems to neglect the significance of inflation, does mainstream work written on inflation draw this connection? The idea of an “inflation tax” has been well documented since as early as the 1700s, when David Hume formulated his quantity theory of money. Hume (1970) focused on the units-change aspect of money stock inflation and how such changes would be irrelevant to rational people. Changing the number of monetary units in circulation in the economy would only have a proportional effect on prices in terms of that money while leaving economic behavior unaltered. It should be noted that in such a situation, there would be no widening of the wealth gap because the inflation tax would erode everyone’s money equally, and inflation would seem to not have an effect. In theory, this notion is absolutely correct if two assumptions are made: that the additional money stock is distributed equally to all economic actors in proportion to their current money stock and that all actors are fully aware of this change in the money stock at the same time. Since these assumptions are not likely to hold, the consequences of relaxing these assumptions should be discussed. Hume recognized that money changes are not implemented proportionally and as a result wrote: When any quantity of money is imported into a nation, it is not at first dispersed into many hands but is confined to the coffers of a few persons, who immediately seek to employ it to advantage. Here are a set of manufacturers or merchants, we shall suppose, who have received returns of gold and silver which they sent to Cadiz. They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly, who never dream of demanding higher wages, but are glad of employment. (Hume 1970, p. 38) At the same time, Hume also touched on the consequence of imperfect information distribution: In this example, the merchants who have the additional money have an advantage over the workmen who are unaware of the shift in the money supply and have no reason to think anything has changed. Lucas (1996) emphasized the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated inflation. Lucas first cited McCandless and Weber (1995) to give strong statistical support for the monetary neutrality aspect of Hume’s quantity theory. McCandless and Weber (1995) showed strong correlations between the inflation rate and M2 (.95), M1 (.96), and the monetary base (.92).Footnote 1 He then expanded on Hume, noting a paradox that while changes in money are “neutral-units changes,” they can also induce movements in employment and production. The solution to this paradox has come from the extensive research done in the 1970s, revealing that anticipated changes and unanticipated changes in inflation have very different effects. Fully anticipated inflation would have no real effects, implied by Hume, but unanticipated inflation can lead to an array of consequences from stimulating production to inducing depression. Bulíř (2001) demonstrated that inflation is indeed a factor affecting income distribution. He first grouped people into two types of workers: “insiders” who accept inflation-adjusted wage contracts and “outsiders” who accept only nominal contracts. Bulíř analyzed how inflation would affect either group. His primary argument, however, focused on the classical definition of the “inflation tax,” which is the erosion of value from holding a nominal asset, implying that correctly anticipating inflation is the major factor that separates both ends of a widening wealth spectrum. While it is clearly true that inflation would widen a gap between those who hold inflation-indexed investments and those who do not, such an analysis is an oversimplification and downplays the more important redistributive effects of inflation as discussed by Mises (1996) and Rothbard (1994). Nordhaus (1973) came closest to a statistical argument closely connecting inflation and wealth inequality. He also identified the same problem with current work on the subject: Virtually all empirical work on the distributional effects of inflation considers the effects on short run income, with little consideration of effects on assets; virtually all theoretical work considers long-run effects in equilibrium systems. (Nordhaus 1973, p. 478) While Nordhaus claimed to be applying empirical work to long-run scenarios, his only data source for economic distribution was the Federal Reserve Survey of Financial Characteristics
of Consumers. This survey focused only on the wealth distribution in 1962. Nordhaus still used theoretical arguments to estimate the effects of inflation, albeit very complex theoretical models of his own. Comparing the theories of three separate schools, Classical, Neoclassical, and Keynesian, Nordhaus augmented his complex model to predict the distribution of welfare in the future. His model, by his own admission, “is quite complicated [and] is sensitive to the assumptions.” His model differentiated economic actors based on a variety of factors; however, his models did not take into consideration the dissemination of information or distribution of monetary units over time, which would expose actors to the redistributive effects of inflation differently. The focus here differs from the above work in several ways. It will differ from the work on wealth inequality in that its focus will be on the erosion of wealth of those at the lower strata of the wealth spectrum rather than the compounding of wealth at the upper strata. The analysis of inflation will transcend the simple notion of the “inflation tax,” which simply wears away the value of nominally held assets, and will focus more on inflation’s redistributive effects. The motivation for this paper is primarily Austrian, and thus the theoretical framework for this work will come from the writings of Mises (1996) and Rothbard (1994). This paper will apply empirical statistical analysis to provide evidence consistent with their hypotheses.",15

It was realized that developed countries do not only import raw materials and export manufactured goods, but rather they trade in differentiated consumer goods and/or intermediate goods belonging to the same industry. This empirical generalization began to be called intra-industry trade (Grubel and Lloyd 1975). Economists produced a number of theories to explain the causes of this phenomenon. Every one of these competing theories describes one aspect of intra-industry trade and approaches it from a different perspective. The present paper attempts to add to the existing set of explanations another, complementary one.Footnote 2 Most of the existing theories of intra-industry trade deal with distinct, final products. The approach adopted in this paper sees consumption as a consequence of production and therefore deals with the phenomenon of intra-industry trade from the point of view of production chains and describes how production is organized in our modern world. This perspective allows us to see that the aggregation of various traded goods within a particular industry conceals the vertical integration of production across countries, which is what we believe a satisfactory theory of intra-industry trade should explain in the first place. The approach to production and its application to international trade adopted in this paper are based on the analysis of production undertaken by Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and their followers. It was these economists who emphasized the role of time in production and saw production as a process consisting of stages and, accordingly, treated capital as heterogeneous. Understanding production as a process consisting of stages allows us to highlight time and place aspects of production, or rather the intertemporal and interspatial aspects of production. We believe that these aspects will prove essential for the analysis of intra-industry trade. The school of economics beginning with Carl Menger that later began to be called the Austrian School of economics is methodologically rooted in subjectivism of human action and methodological individualism. In the present paper we will work within this methodological tradition and we will, following Menger (1994), focus on individual human action rather than on any aggregate concepts. Since, as noted above, intra-industry trade is an empirical observation with a number of competing theories attempting to explain this observation, we do not fear any methodological clashes with rival explanations. Rather, as noted above, we distinguish our approach from the competing theories in looking at production structure rather than at distinct, final products. The paper is structured as follows. The “Structure of Production and Capital in Historical Perspective” roots our approach in a historical perspective and tries to highlight important steps in the development of the theory of production and capital. Emphasis will be on the structure and process of production and the heterogeneity of capital. Next “A Simple Theory of the Production Structure” develops a simple Austrian theory of production structure, highlighting time and place aspects of production. This section provides us with an analytical tool that will be of help in “Intra-industry Trade and the Structure of Production” when dealing with sliced-up production chains across countries. “The next section” starts with a review of existing explanations of intra-industry trade and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses. It then tries to explain intra-industry trade through considering sliced-up production chains across countries. Applications of the theory of production structure and the stages approach to production may help us to highlight various international aspects of production, especially the time and place aspects of internationally organized production. Finally “Implications and Conclusions” concludes and puts forward some implications of our approach for optimum currency areas theory and business cycle synchronization within the European Union.",5

The central pillar of this literature is Michael Porter and his theory of clusters. In a few words, a cluster is a bundle of industries that gain in efficiency through co-location. After the publication of Porter’s The Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990) he quickly became the foremost advocate of industrial policy, arguing that clusters should be central to any competitiveness agenda. Porter’s influence is phenomenal throughout the world.Footnote 1 He is a “guru” of economic development, “spiritual father” of numerous research institutes, cluster initiatives and projects, and advisor for economic development policy in many countries. In Europe in particular, where governments are more prone to a centralized development strategy, clusters have become increasingly an objective of economic policy.Footnote 2
 The cluster theory—reflecting the professional formation of its author as management strategist—underlines the gains expected to accrue from the regional concentration of related industries and makes the normative statement that governments should boost the development of clusters. Whatever its influence on policymakers across the world, the theory lacked any positive explanation about the necessity of government intervention in the natural functioning of the market.Footnote 3 Emphasizing the merits of industrial agglomeration, it did not provide an answer to the essential question: could not these benefits be obtained on a free market, in the absence of any interference by the government? Does the potential existence of cluster benefits validate the common suggestion that countries should promote regional development through cluster policies? A number of economists have attempted to anchor the appetite for clustering initiatives in solid theoretical bedrock. They have pointed out an interesting market failure that may prevent the emergence of profitable clusters and thus jeopardize overall economic development: the failure of individuals to coordinate changes in their actions in order to reap the benefits of a better situation.Footnote 4 Although the literature on coordination problems has a long tradition,Footnote 5 only recently has it become concerned with the relation between this supposed type of market failure and the alleged benefits of industrial agglomeration. Economists like Rodrik (2004) and Rodriguez-Clare (2005a, b) have used this particular market-failure argument as justification for a Porterian-style “new industrial policy,” the goal of which is to induce entrepreneurs to invest in those projects with the highest social return. As the coordination externality argument goes, many investment projects require simultaneous investments in complementary production processes. Firms can improve their performance if entrepreneurs realize that their individual success is dependent on the actions of other market participants. They can get organized to identify common challenges, for example, that all companies would profit from a specific training program at the local university, from an investment in improving transport facilities, or from a joint effort to upgrade the local power or water supply. For an individual company it would not make sense to address such issues, but for the group as a whole they become hugely beneficial efforts. Put differently, the social rate of return on investments in key projects is higher than the purely private rate. This means that coordination will be undersupplied and that government should correct market failure, providing proper incentives in order to reach the optimal level of coordination. This paper intends to provide a refutation of the idea that coordination failures as manifested in the inability of clusters to emerge can serve as grounds for government intervention. It uses the Porter–Rodrik–Rodriguez-Clare thesis as an example of this approach and criticizes the claim that coordination externalities prevent the market process from allocating resources optimally. In our view, such an essay is important given that in recent years the experimentation with various cluster policies has intensified considerably. Indeed, one significant lesson that can be drawn from the existing literature on clusters is that discussion of alternative cluster policies has eclipsed cluster theory. People stopped asking questions about the meaning of cluster and started to implement various cluster policies instead. The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the coordination failure argument which pushes the case for industrial policy, with a focus on the relationship between coordination problems and Porter’s theory of clusters. Section 3 presents the policy prescriptions advanced in the new development economics literature. Section 4 provides a critical analysis of the coordination failure-based development economics. It explains at the outset the role of entrepreneurs in achieving coordination on a free market. Then, it criticizes the notion of coordination failure and underscores the weaknesses of cluster theory, explaining the risks associated with attempts to build clusters. Section 5 explains why the new argument of market imperfection fails to support the case for industrial policy. The last section concludes the paper.",9

Cwik,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Austrian theory of the business cycle is a bit of a misnomer. The theory has primarily focused on the causes of the downturn through the upper-turning point.Footnote 1 For example, the two classic Austrian works on the Great Depression, Lionel Robbins (1934) and Murray Rothbard (1963), focused on the events through the early 1930s. The liquidation and recovery phases have received little attention. Since the revival of Austrian analysis (in the early 1970s), research on the recessionary phase has remained scant. According to traditional Austrian business cycle analysis, the malinvestments that are built up during the artificial boom need to be liquidated in order for sustainable growth to occur. As Rothbard states, The “depression” is then seen as the necessary and healthy phase by which the market economy sloughs off and liquidates the unsound, uneconomic investments of the boom, and reestablishes those proportions between consumption and investment that are truly desired by the consumers. The depression is the painful but necessary process by which the free market sloughs off the excesses and errors of the boom and reestablishes the market economy in its function of efficient service to the mass of consumers. Since prices of factors of production have been bid too high in the boom, this means that prices of labor and goods in these capital goods industries must be allowed to fall until proper market relations are resumed (1978, p. 85). What happens during the liquidation phase may be as important a topic to analyze as the cause of the downturn. To many, it may be more important. The general public might say, “Sure it was the expansion of credit that caused our problems and we promise not to do that again, but we don’t care about that now. Just tell us how to best get out of this mess.” The economist who simply states that we should, “Let the markets work,” opens himself up to attack. Supporters of government interventionism could very easily claim that capitalism caused the recession and reject putting faith into the very system that caused this problem. The first response by an Austrian would be to argue that the recession was not the fault of the market; the Austrian would thus fall into a trap. The Austrian would now be off topic and would lead back to the public’s statement, “We don’t care about that now. Just tell us how to best get out of this mess.” I contend that this is precisely what happened during the great business cycle debates in the 1930s. The Keynesians said that they had a plan for recovery, while the Austrians said little more than “let the market work.” While little attention has been given to the recession phase of the business cycle, it does not mean that Austrians have nothing to say or add to the discussion. The Austrians, too, should have a plan for recovery. However, before such a plan can be constructed, the liquidation phase of the business cycle and how it becomes a recovery needs to be examined in detail. The purpose of this paper is to trace the course of the business cycle from a corporate finance point of view, showing how the downturn can only become a recovery through the liquidation process. The standard Keynesian and Monetarist prescriptions lack the ability to identify the problem (malinvestments) and thus cannot offer suitable solutions for economic recovery.",11

According to Wicksell, markets can be strongly affected by a divergence between the short-term real interest rate and its natural level. And, under some conditions, this divergence can explain business cycle fluctuations. Within this framework, the natural interest rate is a cleared market real rate: it strikes a balance between investments and savings, leaving prices constant. In the sectors where they are settled, entrepreneurs measure this natural interest rate. A boom-bust cycle is then launched when the money market rate fallsFootnote 1, and its magnitude directly depends on how economic agents perceive this fall. Hence an appropriate definition for expectations is needed. However, no such credit boom is sustainable if it is not underpinned by real savings. During economic expansion, entrepreneurs develop new projects as they have easy access to credit. As lending expands, investment projects become riskier. This growing risk is followed by inflationary pressures, and commercial banks increase their lending rates. This credit restriction induces economic recession. Business cycles thus result from banks’ decisions. Their lending activity destabilizes the economy because it leads to excessive credit distributionFootnote 2 and inflation. Using the hypothesis that individual speculation is motivated by the difference between the short-term real interest rate and its natural level, we argue that Wicksellian interest rate gaps can play a major role in the long-term business cycles of four European countries (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain). In the first part of this paper, we present the specific dating methods and filters used in order to distinguish between short-term and long-term growth cycles (Duality of European Business Cycles section). In the second part, we propose various indicators (using different expectations of inflation) for the long-term growth cycles of these four European countries (Inflationary Incentives for European Long-Term Growth Cycles section and Introducing Adaptive and Rational Expectations of Inflation section).",1

Mulligan,Gary A. Lombardo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The actual practice of regulating the maritime industry often fails to follow the modes economists have typically expected to observe. Entrepreneurs innovate to take advantage of market opportunities. Entrepreneurial ability manifests itself in an awareness or sensitivity toward market opportunities overlooked by others. Part of this ability is applied toward better satisfying established consumer wants which are observable to entrepreneurs in advance; but more noteworthy is entrepreneurs’ experimental attempts to satisfy incipient or latent wants they are among the first to imagine or anticipate (Harper 1996). In a regulated market, entrepreneurs’ focus is shifted toward regulatory imperatives. Regulation offers different opportunities for entrepreneurial innovation, as well as imposing new constraints. This results in entrepreneurs developing strategies for satisfying regulatory authorities in hopes of receiving rate increases, monopoly power, subsidies, tax benefits, exemptions from regulation, or other rewards regulatory authorities can dispense. In the absence of regulation, entrepreneurial awareness is applied exclusively to satisfying consumer wants. In a regulated environment, entrepreneurs must also apply awareness toward opportunities created by regulatory limitations. Maritime regulation is founded on four independent and partially conflicting bases which thus mimic Hayek’s (1945) fragmented knowledge of consumer preferences. Maritime regulation is complex in that there is an overriding statutory imperative in the form of cabotage legislation, a legal requirement that shipping between two U.S. ports must be U.S. flagged, owned, and crewed. In addition, two agencies have been charged with regulation since 1961: the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission, the primary regulatory authority charged with maintaining industry stability and protecting the shipping public, and the U.S. Maritime Administration, charged with promoting the industry and protecting domestic interests. The Maritime Administration regulates coastwise shipping, while the Federal Maritime Commission regulates foreign trades, shipping between U.S. and foreign ports. Additionally, the U.S. maritime labor force is licensed by the U.S. Coast Guard. The article is organized as follows. The section titled “Regulation and Strategic Behavior” addresses the implications of business regulation in terms of Kirzner’s knowledge problems, strategic incentives, and the differing information content of regulated versus unregulated prices. “Maritime Regulation: The U.S. Federal Maritime Commission” profiles the maritime industry and interprets the legislative mandate and responsibilities of the Commission, the American regulatory authority which oversees the maritime industry. Finally, the “Conclusion” provides concluding comments.",2

For the purpose of this paper we need not go into technical details of what a set is, and we rely instead on basic intuition.Footnote 1 A set is called countable infinite if it has many elements such as the set of natural numbers or, equivalently, if it can be arranged into a list (if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between our set and the set of positive integers). The set is called uncountable (and infinite) if it has “more” elements than the set of natural numbers, meaning that it cannot be put into a list (formally, if there does not exist a one-to-one correspondence between the set and positive integers). As Murphy notes, an example of a countable set is the set of all even integers {2, 4, 6, …, 2n, …} and an example of an uncountable set is—by Cantor’s diagonal argument—the interval [0,1]. The readers should however bear in mind that although we have just provided an example of an uncountable set, such objects cannot be meaningfully said to exist in the real, physical world. They are but abstract concepts and make sense only in the rigorous realm of modern mathematics. Somewhat ironically, this point has been observed even by Robert Aumann, the very person who incorporated the concept into economic reasoning. Writes Aumann (1964, pp. 39, 41): We submit that the most natural model for this purpose [of developing the notion of perfect competition] contains a continuum of participants, similar to the continuum of points on a line or the continuum of particles in a fluid…. The idea of a continuum of traders might seem outlandish to the reader. Actually, it is no stranger than a continuum of prices or of strategies or a continuum of “particles” in fluid mechanics. In all these cases, the continuum can be considered an approximation to the “true” situation in which there is a large but finite number of particles (or traders or strategies or possible prices). (emphasis added). This short note is not the place to discuss the use—or misuse—of continuum in economics, but the following quote from Paul Ormerod gives the right impression on how absurd it would be to try to use uncountable sets in economics (or social sciences in general): To take just one example, the phrase “assume a continuum of traders” will be encountered in many theoretical papers on the idealized market economy.… But what does this phrase “continuum” actually mean? It sounds quite innocuous, yet spelt out in words it might lead people to query the realism of any academic paper based on this assumption, or even begin to doubt whether the article was worth writing in the first place. For the phrase means that the number of people, whether as individuals or as firms, carrying out trade in this theoretical economy is not just large but quite literally infinite. In fact, to be strictly accurate, it even means rather more than this. If one were to start to count the whole numbers—one, two, three and so on—one could go on for ever. There is an infinite number of them.... But mathematicians have the apparently bizarre but nevertheless logical concept of infinities which are even bigger than this infinity! A continuum is exactly one of these. In other words, it is assumed that there is not just an infinite number of traders, in the sense that the set of whole numbers is infinite, but there is an even bigger number of them than this. (Ormerod 1995, pp. 43–44). After these preliminary remarks we may move on to the question of what do the countable and uncountable sets have to do with the calculation debate. Murphy argues that the principal objection to Mises’s claim that socialism could not calculate, and hence effectively allocate resources, was the mathematical argument that given consumer preferences and all the relevant information concerning production functions, etc., the omnipotent dictator could arrange a list of equations determining the equilibrium, market clearing prices. Should the conditions change in any significant way, the planner would simply tinker with the original vector of prices and by a method of trial and error reestablish another temporary equilibrium. Thus, so long as computational power is not the issue, the socialist economy could function just as smoothly as the free market. Strictly speaking, however, this was the contention of Barone and Dickinson rather than of Lange himself. In his famed essay Lange clearly explains that his answer to Mises has nothing to do with equation-solving: Thus the accounting prices in the socialist economy can be determined by the same process of trial and error by which prices on the competitive market are determined. To determine the prices the Central Planning Board does not need to have “complete lists of the different quantities of all commodities which would be bought at any possible combination of prices of the different commodities which might be available” (Hayek 1935, p. 211). Neither would the Central Planning Board have to solve hundreds of thousands (as Professor Hayek expects) or millions (as Professor Robbins thinks) of equations. The only “equations” which would have to be “solved” would be those of the consumers and the managers of production plants. These are the same ‘equations’ which are solved in the present economic system.… Consumers “solve” them by spending their income so as to get out of it the maximum total utility (Lange 1936, pp. 66–67). And that is exactly why Hayek in response to Lange did not return to the equation-solving argument, although he mentions that this sort of mathematical solution has been proposed at some point (Hayek 1940, pp. 127–28). But leaving this aside, Murphy’s argument runs as follows: if the socialist planners really are to mimic the market outcome, they would need to publish a list containing, not merely a huge number of prices, and not merely an infinite number of prices, but rather a list containing an uncountably infinite number of prices. (Murphy 2006, p. 8) To clarify why this should be so Murphy considers the case of innovation: Back when Hayek and Lange were arguing, there were no market prices for, say, laptop computers. Thus, even if socialism could mimic the market for a few years, it would eventually fall short because it would lack the introduction of new goods that is so typical in market economies. (Murphy 2006, p. 8) Nevertheless, this statement seems to contradict what Lange thought about his own method, since he was not at all concerned about goods that would be invented and produced only at some later point in time. We also fail to see why the fact of not having accounted for all the possible new inventions should pose any serious problem to Lange’s solution. But for the sake of argument let us suppose that this is so (we shall come back to this assumption later on) and that socialism really should fall short after not having taken into account the introduction of new goods. Murphy claims that the straightforward answer that a defender of Lange’s method would give to that charge is that all the Central Planning Board needs to do is include in its calculations all the conceivable goods and then arbitrarily set prices for them high enough so as to make sure that, since the quantity supplied is 0 (goods are not being produced yet), the quantity demanded would also be 0. But then follows a non sequitur on Murphy’s part. He states that: Once we realize that all conceivable goods and services that might be offered, must have corresponding prices included in the planners’ official lists, we understand that such lists would necessarily contain an uncountably infinite number of items. (p. 9) According to Murphy this “is inescapable,” but all he offers to support his claim is that the planner would have to publish prices, e.g., for every single book that could possibly be written in the future. Fair enough, but how does this prove that the number of equations (prices) set up by the planning committee should be uncountable?Footnote 2 Murphy seems to believe that the number of books that can conceivably be written is uncountable, but there is nothing further from the truth. As the linguist Stephan Anderson puts it: A human language such as English…produces new messages…by combining discrete elements in new ways. As a result, the number of sentences in such a system is the same as the number of rational numbers, or א0. (Anderson 2004, p.79) What Anderson implies is that the set of all conceivable sentences in English, or any other language for that matter, is countable. Now, any book may be thought of as a finite sequence of sentences (maybe repeating themselves). An elementary set-theoretic result is that there only can be countably many such sequences (Hrbacek and Jech 1999, p. 76). As different books might consist of different—but always finite—number of sentences, the set of all conceivable books is simply a union of many countably countable sets, and thus also has to be countable (Jech 2002, p. 50). This reasoning, slightly generalized, applies also to the general case of “all conceivable goods.”Footnote 3 Therefore, contrary to what Murphy holds, the number of equations (prices) that the socialist planner should have to put on his list is definitely not uncountable. Even though our deliberations certainly lack mathematical rigor, it should be sufficiently clear that it is not so easy to give a real life example of an uncountable set. This should not be disturbing, however, since the crux of the matter is that the number of equations (prices) that the omnipotent planner has to come up with essentially does not matter, either in Lange’s approach, or in reality.",1
11.0,2.0,The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics,21 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12113-008-9039-1,"Operators are not Parameters, the Dimensions of Operators and Variables Must be Invariant, and Indices may not be Dimensioned: Rejoinder to Professors Folsom and Gonzalez",June 2008,William Barnett II,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Barnett (p. 29) used a standard CD production function: \(Q = AK^\alpha L^\beta \). Section one of F&G is hard to deal with because it confounds several issues; however, I think the key mistake they make, and which leads them into other errors, is that they misunderstand the nature of α and β in that function; to wit: F&G (p. 47, emphasis in original) state:Footnote 1
 So far, so good—except for a minor quibble: we would describe A, α, and β all as “parameters.” A quick-and-dirty definition of “parameter” might be “variable (changeable) constant”—a constant whose value (magnitude) can change, but only exogenously. Therefore, parameters are not coordinate variables. Certainly, in this case, A is a parameter. But what of α and β? Are they parameters, also? They appear to be symbols for (real) numbers, but are they? In fact, they are neither parameters nor real numbers. Rather, in this context, both are operator names or symbols.Footnote 2
 One easy way to see this is to consider that x
0 = 1 ∀ x, such that 00 = 1, whereas \(0^x = 0\;\forall x \ne 0\). Obviously, the exponent 0 is not a number, but instead a function that maps every x → 1. And, that mapping applies to dimensions as well as magnitudes; for example, \(10^0 \equiv \left( {10{\text{ }}\operatorname{m} } \right)^0 \equiv \left( {\left( {10{\text{ }}\operatorname{m} } \right)^2 } \right)^0 \equiv \left( {\left( {10{\text{ }}\operatorname{m} } \right)^3 } \right)^0 \equiv 1\), where m = meter. Clearly, the exponent 0 is not the number 0, but an operator that maps any number, including dimensioned numbers, to one. Furthermore, “An exponent is the power p in an expression of the form a
p. The process of performing the operation of raising a base to a given power is known as exponentiation” (emphasis added).Footnote 3 An equation of the form y = a
x is a function, provided that for fractional values of x, the range is restricted to a single value for each value in the domain.Footnote 4
 It turns out, then, that F&G’s “quibble” that α and β are parameters is not a quibble because it is not correct, and, unfortunately, improperly classifying α and β as parameters is not a trivial error, as will be shown below. F&G (p. 48, italics in original, bold emphasis added) state: Therefore, a function’s parameter dimensions (and values) simply are whatever they need to be (including roots and powers) to describe the relationship fully and accurately—including that the left and right side dimensions must match.... 
Variables
must have (understandable) dimensions. Parameters may or may not have dimensions. If they do not they are pure numbers (not necessarily invariant constants). If they do, their dimensions need not be understandable (although it is nice if they are). Instead, parameter dimensions’ only requirement is that they describe the relationship between the function’s dependent and independent variables’ dimensions. If one thinks that α and β are parameters, and as such may take on whatever values are necessary to “describe the relationship,” and if one forgets that the operation of raising a variable to a power creates a function, it is easy to see how one can think F&G’s conclusions that α and β may take on fractional values, and that the dimensions of A may be unreasonable. Let us examine these conclusions. We may rewrite \(Q = AK^\alpha L^\beta \) as Q = AVW = AZ, where \(V = K^\alpha \), \(W = L^\beta \), and Z = VW are functions and V, W, and Z are variables. Consider then the dimensions of the variables V and W. Because the dimensions of K and L are machine-hours/year and man-hours/year, respectively, the dimensions of \(V\left( { = K^\alpha } \right)\) and \(W\left( { = L^\beta } \right)\) make sense only if α = β = 1. Any other value of α or of β yields meaningless dimensions; e.g., α = β = 0.5 (yields machine-hours/year)0.5 and man-hours/years)0.5. Moreover, even if α = b = 1, the dimensions of Z (machine-hours × man-hours)/year2 are meaningless. Therefore, even if we accept arguendo, F&G’s contention that parameters may take on any values that are necessary to “describe the relationship,” α and β cannot take on fractional values, as they maintain, because that results in meaningless or, to use their term, unreasonable, dimensions. Barnett (p. 30) also maintained that α = β = 1 is unreasonable because: “For, if α = β = 1, the marginal products of both K and L are positive constants (the law of diminishing returns is violated) and there are unreasonably large economies of scale—a doubling of both inputs, ceteris paribus, would quadruple output.” F&G (p. 48) maintain that “the solution is to require α < 1 and β < 1,” but note that “Barnett does not accept that solution.” But as we have just seen, that “solution” violates the requirement, with which they agree, that variables have meaningful/reasonable dimensions. F&G (p. 49) state: parameter A has dimensions [necessary] to describe ... [the] assumed relationship between output and input variables... to allow the ... α and β parameters to be the percentage change in output that results from a percentage change in real capital or labor input. So unless one rejects the idea that output quantity depends on input quantities, how can one reject the ideas that the percentage change in output quantity could depend on the percentage change of input quantity, and that the percentage relationship could be less than one? ... Barnett ... claims that any fractional values for the ... α and β parameters are “meaningless” or “economically unreasonable” simply because they are roots of input quantities. To us, that claim makes no sense, given the role of parameters in defining a production function’s relationship between output and input. Perhaps my claim that fractional values for α and β are meaningless or economically unreasonable would make more sense to them if they understood that α and β are operators, not parameters, and that input variables, and powers of such variables, include dimensions as well as magnitudes. Moreover, that paragraph contains a serious non sequitur. Certainly inputs affect output and no doubt such relations may be expressed in terms of percentages, at least conceptually. One may agree with that, as I do, and still reject: (1) the idea that A may take on any dimensions necessary, however meaningless and unreasonable, so that α and β may be fractional elasticities; and, (2) that α and β may be fractions. All one needs do is remember that we are doing economics here after all, not mathematics, and reject the idea that the CD function can express economically meaningful and reasonable production relations. To sum up my response to their first section, I maintain that: (1) their claim that α and β are parameters is incorrect—they are operators; (2) a fortiori, their claim that α and β may take on whatever values are necessary “to describe the relationship between the function’s dependent and independent variables’ dimensions” because they are parameters is incorrect; (3) their claim that variables must have understandable dimensions is correct, with the consequence that they are mistaken when they maintain that α and β may take on any values other than one;Footnote 5 and, (4) a fortiori, their claim that because α and β are elasticities, they may take on fractional values is incorrect.",
11.0,2.0,The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics,20 August 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12113-008-9040-8,Hayek the Neoclassical Font: A Review Essay on Hayek’s Challenge,June 2008,Sudha Shenoy,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Caldwell surveys major fields of neoclassical economics to show that certain of Hayek’s writings do not just contribute to, but indeed can lead, neoclassical theorizing. The first five chapters of the book set the scene. Then, in chapters 6–13, Caldwell sets out systematically and comprehensively, what neoclassical economists can gain from this selection of Hayek’s writings, which he shows, is a very great deal indeed. Caldwell compares these selected writings with those of Hayek’s major contemporaries on the same topic (e.g., Hutchison on methodology). He also relates them to new developments in neoclassical theorizing (e.g., complexity theory). As he proceeds, Caldwell brings in and comments on virtually every significant item in the secondary literature on these selected writings; and he traces through the various lines of development in this literature. Chapter 14 provides a summing-up and assessment. In chapter 15, Caldwell sets out his own views on Hayek’s relevance and importance to neoclassical economics. Caldwell feels Hayek is especially significant in indicating the path forward: how neoclassical theorizing can remain scientific without the albatross of falsifiability, along with pointers toward new areas of theorizing. Finally, there are four appendices: two examine various views on how far Hayek can be said to have changed direction in the 1930s, and one reviews the different interpretations made of Hayek’s essays on “Scientism and the Study of Society.” The fourth is a translation of Gustav Schmoller’s review of Menger’s Principles. The whole is expressed with Caldwell’s characteristic lucidity. It is an exceptional piece of work. All future neoclassical writings on Hayek will have to be measured against it. Caldwell begins with the necessary preliminaries to what he finds in Hayek to commend so strongly to Neoclassicals. These preliminaries are what the Neoclassicals can find in Menger, the Methodenstreit, and Mises and their respective significance to the development of neoclassical/scientific economics. As noted, Caldwell puts Hayek at the leading edge in key areas of neoclassical theorizing; Hayek has developed, over his lifetime, his own unique vision of what doing scientific economics means (pp. 12, 9). Menger is mostly, but not entirely, at the beginnings of this science; while Mises is nearly, but not quite outside the pale. Thus Hayek has a far greater and a very different potential for the neoclassical than the other Austrians who are usually grouped with him. Caldwell sensibly rejects the notion held by twentieth-century economists that theory is identical with mathematical formalisms (p. 20). In other words, there are other ways of being scientific which are demonstrated throughout. Thus Carl Menger’s ideas are perhaps on the cusp of science, but “to a modern reader,” many of Menger’s discussions (in his Principles of Economics) would seem more “like simple common sense…hardly the stuff of real science.” Menger’s work still has “certain other” scientific attributes. For one thing, it is extremely systematic. And Menger feels he is “making a scientific contribution” because he derives “laws” from individuals’ attempts to maximize utility (p. 21). Thus Menger’s formulations, though early, nevertheless do contribute to a number of issues within the neoclassical framework. Useful goods are scarce, so choices have to be made (Menger’s starting point). Various “laws” then follow (e.g., the value of inputs derives from their capacity to produce consumption outputs [p. 21]). Furthermore, the economizing activity of individuals, unimpeded by governments, leads to unintended and beneficial results, such as the development of trade. Money then emerges as the “most marketable” amongst traded commodities. The prices of goods depend on subjective evaluations, not on their costs of production. This allows all prices to be brought under the one explanatory umbrella (pp. 25–26). Monopoly defeats itself: monopoly prices induce suppliers to enter the market and consumers to search out substitutes (pp. 23–25). In his discussion of marginal utility, Menger aims not at mathematical precision, but according to Caldwell, to explain social phenomena. Menger is concerned with “propositions about real-world economic phenomena [that are not] easily incorporated into mathematical models.” In reality, there are transactions costs; “production takes time and the future is uncertain”; agents’ plans are based on beliefs about the future, beliefs that may be erroneous (p. 31). Economic progress occurs as people learn more about their real needs and the actual capacity of goods to satisfy those actual needs: “A thing is a good…because the causal relation between the thing and a need truly exists” (p. 33). Thus the number of “imaginary” goods declines. With social progress, people learn how to plan better for their future consumption (pp. 33–35). Thus Menger works out whatever follows “from the logic of economizing activity” (p. 21). He terms this methodology “empirical” which moderns find confusing, since they would see Menger’s opponents, the younger German Historical School, as also pursuing empirical methods (pp. 21–22). In sum, Menger invokes the invisible hand; holds that competition emerges naturally; and that “beneficial social institutions” develop naturally from “the economizing actions of individual agents” (p. 34). Thus Menger’s systematic approach and his aim: “to discover the…laws governing economic phenomena”—render the Principles a “scientific treatise” (pp. 21, 20). Thus (pace Caldwell) the neoclassical inquirer finds only familiar, early themes in Menger’s Principles, an early attempt at being scientific. In terms of the neoclassical framework, Caldwell shows the Methodenstreit is also shot through and through with neoclassical concerns; it is also however, something of a damp squib. Here, the Historical School opposed the classicals’ laissez-faire, hence its members also opposed theory in general and the assumption of self-interest. Menger wished to show that both were legitimate (p. 74). Hence he now moved on to bigger things, of which “diminishing marginal utility…was only a small part” (p. 73). Menger demonstrates theoretically that “individuals, acting in their own self-interest, give rise to social institutions” that have unintended effects, and that are often “benign” (pp. 73–74). In his Investigations (Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics), Menger supports abstraction, as a method of scientific analysis, against the Historical School. All sciences abstract from reality and so each theory focuses on a particular aspect of a phenomenon. Indeed Caldwell notes that this is precisely what distinguishes a “theoretical treatment of a subject” from an historical one (p. 68). Menger then moves from this reasonable generalization to defend a “specific” position that “economic motivation and self-interest” are dominant motives, so to abstract on their basis is to capture perhaps “the most important side of human life” (p. 69). It is this “special side of life that theoretical economics isolates” (Caldwell affirms Menger is saying). In sum, Menger is addressing the all-important neoclassical question whether self-interest is the correct abstraction (i.e., does it clarify rather than obfuscate the phenomenon?). In effect, Menger says “yes” and this then raises the familiar neo-classical problems that are still being discussed: the justification of the claim that “self-interest” is so overwhelmingly important; what is acceptable “evidence” for and against this claim; definition of the content (e.g., is it narrow or broad); is it a psychological phenomenon or a general category (p. 69). Thus for Caldwell, discussion in this area by Menger moves along familiar neoclassical lines. In dealing with social institutions, Menger’s sole target is the organicist approach. According to Caldwell, “Menger concedes” that spontaneous social structures are “analogous to a body’s organs,” but there are also designed structures that “are best studied” pragmatically. Furthermore, self-interested actions also generate “benign…institutions” as law, language, money, markets, etc. Caldwell feels that Menger thus demolishes his “organicist rivals” brilliantly and that the “atomistic approach” can explain undesigned institutions theoretically and provides a better explanation (pp. 71–72). Thus, theory enters where “previously” only “historians and organicists” were found before (p. 73). Similarly, the issues between Schmoller (i.e., empirical work, data collection, and sifting of facts) and Menger (i.e., theory) are pre-eminently neoclassical. According to Caldwell, Schmoller saw Menger as simply redistilling, for the nth time, the “abstract theories of the old dogmatism” (p. 75), but that the two were closer together in neoclassical terms than they thought. Rather than rejecting theory altogether, Schmoller “thought that…extensive additional data collection” was needed to make “more universal generalizations.” Current theories had a limited coverage (p. 76), and Menger, far from rejecting “empiricism,” thought strongly that his theories “identified essential elements of…reality” (pp. 75–76). Thus Caldwell feels “a debate on the actual disparities” between the two “would…have been worthwhile” (p. 77), but instead they “wasted energies” in hardening their positions and in mutual rudeness (pp. 77, 75–76). Thus their common views were obscured. Caldwell finds several common views. Both relied on some sort of “acting man” in their thinking. The Historical School’s man had complex motives, while the Austrians’ man lay between this and the neoclassicals’ “passive automaton.” Both groups opposed positivism and Marxism (p. 77). Both regarded “the origin of social institutions” as a key economic question; the Germans investigated the issue historically, the Austrians, theoretically. Both followed Friedrich Carl von Savigny in one respect: he denied that institutions rationally designed for one society, could be transplanted into another and both “felt that institutions grow organically.” The Germans felt such institutions reflected a peoples’ or nations’ characteristics while the Austrians considered that institutions reflected “a specific set of cultural or social norms and values,” and both were, initially, suspicious of democracy (p. 78). These issues, it will be noted, are already neoclassical (“motives”) or else quite conformable to neoclassical thinking—fitting in easily as extensions or complements. As Caldwell sees it, a “separate Austrian School” was created by the disputes and intransigence of the Methodenstreit while “Schmoller’s ostracism promoted unity” (p. 80). Thereafter, the Austrians really became known through Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser, who helped to transform Menger’s wider analysis into a narrower marginalist one. In this, they possibly benefited from the rise of marginalism “in England and Lausanne” (p. 127). Thus, the School became identified with marginal utility, capital theory, and anti-Marxist arguments, not the analysis of social institutions (pp. 81, 82) and therefore “Menger’s efforts were an utter failure” (p. 74). Mises now enters the scene as a member of Böhm-Bawerk’s seminar, which also included Joseph Schumpeter, Otto Neurath, Rudolf Hilferding, and Otto Bauer. Böhm Bawerk was already a well-known critic of Marx’s value theory which had led to modifications on the Marxist side. The debate was carried forward during the first year of Böhm-Bawerk’s seminar. Additionally, the Austro-Marxists adopted the new, positivist argument to defend the “scientific” nature of socialism (pp.102–05). Mises’s views on economic calculation and method develop through responses to the issues raised in the writings of Schumpeter and Neurath. In his first book (published in 1908), Schumpeter examined many standard neoclassical issues. Like the Austro-Marxists, he also adopted an instrumentalist view of scientific theory, from Ernst Mach and Henri Poincare. He therefore plumped for the “truly scientific approach” exemplified in the Walrasian general equilibrium framework (p. 109). These equations perfectly represented the “functional relations” and “mutual interaction” that existed amongst “objective [economic] entities” such as “prices and quantities” (pp. 109–10). Thus “Schumpeter…used Mach’s theory of science to clarify and defend the Walrasian approach” (p. 110). An instrumental theory need not be realistic. Thus, with “a given social phenomenon,” its “historical study” and its “theoretical treatment” are “quite clearly…distinct.” In short, “[t]heory and history…occupy separate domains,” without any conflict. Instrumentalism also allowed the dispute over the “truth” of Marxist and subjective theories of value, to be simply by-passed (p. 110). Instrumentalism further by-passed the ontological dispute between the Austrians and Vilfredo Pareto. The former held that subjective value theory referred to “Aristotelian essences” (Menger) or psychological states (Wieser). Pareto defended indifference curves because they eliminated all metaphysical “reference to unobservable states.” Instrumentalism didn’t need to raise such questions; it merely asked, How well does the theory work? (p. 111). We may note that Schumpeter thus emerges as a clear and significant forerunner to neoclassical discussions in these areas. Even before 1914, Neurath argued that a war economy had to be run centrally. During the war, he was a very senior economics official in the War Ministry. After 1918, he argued the war had shown the economy could be run as a single enterprise and it ought to be so organized to achieve justice. Money was “uncontrolled and disorderly.” And so, under “full socialization,” economic calculation would be in terms of physical quantities. This would mean “scientific economic management” (pp. 114–15). “Mises, the monetary theorist,” made clear the intimate links between “two apparently unrelated subjects” (p. 117). Entrepreneurs, faced with “innumerable possible” factor combinations engage in “a self-interested search” for the “best” such combination, the one which minimizes their costs. This benefits society as resources are guided to “their most highly-valued uses.” But it is also difficult as there are multiple factors and production takes time all during which all sorts of changes might occur in supply and demand. In a market economy, factors have money prices “that reflect their relative scarcity.” But “under socialism” the state owns all factors and “there is…no market for them.” So “[s]ocialist managers” would have no price signals to tell them about the relative scarcity or abundance of factors (p.116) and so they could not calculate and avoid waste (p. 117). This is the standard neoclassical picture: motives, plus a single isolated firm, duplicated, and reduplicated. “Mises recognized” that prices would “reflect relative scarcities and…guide production,” “[only] when the value of money [was] reasonably stable.” And so, “[f]or Mises, sound money and freely adjusting market prices…together make a private enterprise system work” (p. 117). In short, Mises is an American conservative or a reasonably intelligent member of the Tory Party in England (i.e., just as ignorant about the real analytical issues). Caldwell considers only Mises’s 1920 article. At the time, “[s]socialization schemes were being proposed everywhere”; Socialism is a response. For neoclassicals, this view of the book is quite proper as the analysis there is “praxeological” and therefore in a nonscientific area, in relation to neoclassical economics. In terms of neoclassical economic science, Mises puts a “firmer…neo-Kantian” frame around Austrian value theory (p. 119). He developed his apriorism as a contribution to the “philosophical foundations of economics” (p. 120). His “praxeological science of human action” starts from “the idea that scarcity forces all humans to act, purposefully.” Introspection provides everyone with this “basic insight.” In logical terms, the axiom is a priori true and apodictically certain as any correctly deduced theorems are equally certain (p. 129). This “basic category of action” is used in “all descriptions of human action, including historical narratives” (p. 129). Contrary to Max Weber, “[f]or Mises, human action is investigated both historically and theoretically.” Theoretical investigation involves comprehending “elements that are always present in all human actions. The most basic common element is the concept of action” (p. 121). Caldwell cites Allen Oakley’s observation of the “bewildering array of suggestions as to [Mises’s] philosophical” position. Caldwell himself objects principally to Mises’s apriorism (NB as here outlined) because it is incompatible with fallibilism (pp. 124–25, n. 20). Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Wieser, Mises, etc., are united by their common oppositions: to Schmoller, Neurath, Marxism, etc. (p. 126). Also note that Neoclassicals have very different things to learn from each of Menger, Mises, etc. When on the table of common oppositions this variety of dishes is set out, we have the “Austrian School” with their common range of oppositions plus the various lessons that neoclassicals can glean from these proto-neoclassicals. Hayek, in his turn, selected some and rejected other of these items (p. 130) and what neoclassicals can gain from Hayek is vastly more, and vastly more substantive, than anything they might obtain from the other Austrian economists usually grouped with him. Thus, for neoclassicals Hayek is distanced from the other Austrians, especially Mises. As is evident from the brief summary at the start of this essay, Caldwell covers a vast ground. In what follows, therefore, I am forced to be drastically selective. From the 1920s to 1941, Hayek tried “to construct an inter-temporal general equilibrium model of a capital-using monetary economy” (p. 176) and was in short addressing neoclassical issues. Initially, in Prices and Production, “capital theory [was] prominent…in explaining the cycle.” As Caldwell sees it when the market rate of interest falls below the natural rate, more capital goods are produced relative to consumer goods. “This lengthening of the capital structure cannot…be sustained” and ultimately it contracts (p. 178). Note that in this picture, all capital goods are perfect substitutes for one another; likewise with consumer goods. Exactly neoclassical! This formulation was widely criticized; for one, by Piero Sraffa who asked why forced saving should be unsuccessful? Frank Knight criticized the concept of the average period of production, which Hayek and others used (p. 179). So Hayek began “rethinking his views.” The 1930s saw “a long process” of adjusting his models, followed by “fresh criticism and new adjustments.” He thought “to reconstruct a more suitable capital-theoretic foundation” and then return to his original problem, “the role of money in a dynamic capital-using economy.” Caldwell found that he admitted that even with the publication of The Pure Theory of Capital, “the task was unfinished.” Therefore, in Caldwell’s assessment Hayek’s “efforts to build a dynamic equilibrium model of a capital-using monetary economy never reached fruition” (p. 180). In sum, Hayek’s “unfinished” work on capital offers little, if anything, to the neoclassical economist. “Hayek’s varied insights into the ‘knowledge problem’ probably constitute his most enduring legacy in economics” (p. 338). Those theoretical economists who have developed the economics of information certainly acknowledge him as one of their forebears (p. 338). The 1930s saw problems emerging from the notion of equilibrium, especially with the assumption of perfect foresight (p. 224). Hayek first doubted whether “static equilibrium theory [could] capture certain essential features of a free market economy.” Agents did not have “objectively correct knowledge” (p. 337), but differing subjective perceptions of objective data (p. 213). Imperfect but purposeful, these fallible agents each had “access to different bits of knowledge” and these moreover were “dispersed, fragmented…often difficult to communicate” (pp. 337, 286). Hence Hayek’s new definition of equilibrium as the compatibility of plans under conditions of dispersed knowledge and subjective perceptions (p. 224). This insight as set out in the article “Economics and Knowledge” is a major new departure in Hayek’s thinking related to his contributions to the socialist calculation debate (pp. 210–14) and it also marked a break with Mises’s apriorism. Although Hayek latter used the term apriorism in “Facts of the Social Sciences,” he seems to have meant “introspective knowledge,” which is quite neoclassical, but Caldwell is puzzled by the passage. Mises, of course meant something quite different by apriorism—fundamental axioms that are “apodictically certain and logically prior to experience” but also about the real world (p. 222). Next, the obvious question: How is it ever possible to co-ordinate human action (p. 337; also see p. 225)? Standard economic analysis “gets things exactly backward” as it starts “with rational agents” (p. 286). Thus the conditions that give rise to the question are assumed away in static equilibrium theory (p. 337). The price system and other “social institutions that help co-ordinate actions of market participants” bring about such co-ordination as is observed. “[F]reely adjusting market prices” are produced by actions that reflect the “beliefs, plans, intentions of millions of market participants.” Market prices and competition transmit information and provide incentives for discovering “new information, products, processes” (p. 337). In his political writings Hayek deals with a “fuller set of institutions” that create an environment offering the least hindrance to “co-ordination of knowledge” (p. 338). Thus Hayek and some new institutional economists address the same question: “What set of institutional arrangements might best assist fallible individuals to make better decisions and better use of their knowledge?” The assumption of a “homo oeconomicus” could not produce this question (p. 286) for a market system to work properly, it must be enclosed in nonmarket social institutions such as democracy under the rule of law “enforced and exchangeable property rights”; constitutional protection of a private individual sphere. Such notions are not found much in mainstream discussions and probably belong in discussions of growth, development, and planning. There they are more subtle and convincing than mainstream or Marxist notions (p. 348). Thus Hayek foreshadows, complements, enriches, or forges ahead of, neoclassical thinking in the areas noted. In The Constitution of Liberty, Hayek lays out the complex institutions and beliefs that promote the discovery, transmission, and use of knowledge. Thus individuals are allowed the best chance of using local knowledge in the pursuit of their goals. The rule of law provides a criterion for ruling interventions in or out (p. 290). In summary Hayek’s “agent is a real human being who inhabits a specific social space [which] contains institutions that are both a product of and a constraint on” the behavior of agents. This is a challenge to standard undergraduate micro textbooks which have an “atomistic…asocial automaton” (p. 286). In his very long essay on “Scientism,” Hayek distinguishes between the natural and the social sciences, in terms of the explanatory schema they use. The essay’s critical argument “for many social phenomena,” including the market mechanism, was that it was only possible to explain their principle of operation. In short, in the social sciences, only pattern predictions could be made, not more specific ones. The essay contained a strong criticism of behaviorism (i.e., it was also concerned with psychology (pp. 271, 340, 341). According to Caldwell, the distinction between the natural and social sciences made the latter into “some sort of special case.” Ernest Nagel criticized “Scientism” for arguing that explanation in the social sciences “was of a fundamentally different kind,” while Popper defended the unity of scientific method. These criticisms came from “influential and legitimate philosophers of science” that had “to be taken seriously” (p. 304). Hayek found an answer after his investigation into theoretical psychology. Caldwell feels Hayek “probably did not realize at the time” how important an influence it would be on his thought (p. 341). 
The Sensory Order tackled behaviorism head on. Behaviorism wanted to eliminate mental phenomena and interpretation from the study of human behavior, and treat the latter simply in terms of physical stimuli/responses. They sought to extend their views to social phenomena (pp. 270–71). For Hayek the mind was another spontaneously organizing complex structure (p. 346, also p. 341) and he worked out the actual complexity of the brain. The central nervous system is a “giant classification mechanism.” The “mind” is “a vast network of interconnected neurons” (p. 264). Networks interconnect with other networks, classifications move into higher levels, and there is “a huge increase in the complexity of the system” (p. 266). Such networks are formed continuously. Gradually the organism builds up an imperfect “map” of relations amongst classes of external events. Within this, “models” are built of existing situations, models that help to evaluate and classify new impulses at many levels. Thus these “models” are checked and revised continuously (pp. 268, 269). Consequently an explanation of the principle is all that is possible here: mental events can never be explained as fully as “the rest of the physical world” (p. 276). The situation is not mechanistic, however: people are as individual as snowflakes; they differ in their response to stimuli (pp. 268, 269). There is also much evidence for purposive behavior. An essential aspect of this is using models to try out a possible range of outcomes, from which the preferred one is selected (p. 270). This means that “knowledge based on introspection” can be used “to explain and to some extent predict” what others might do (p. 277). The classical economists and philologists [sic] had identified “complex adaptive orders.” Hayek also “encountered [such orders] in his research on the brain.” Hayek now discovered they “were…found in…other scientific fields”—they were ubiquitous. In “the study of complex phenomena…only ‘explanations of the principle’ or ‘pattern predictions’ are possible” and; this is “a fundamental characteristic.” Hayek’s “chief exemplar” was evolutionary theory (p. 304). Caldwell finds that “pattern prediction” describes pretty well what microeconomic theory is capable of (p. 383). Economics was severely limited in the predictions it could make. Hence “Hayek was…keen to establish the ubiquity of complex phenomena.” This meant “many other sciences” were just as severely limited; they too were forced into “explanations of the principle.” Hayek now decided to abandon the old, traditional distinction, “natural science/social science” (p. 305). He now distinguished between the sciences that studied simple phenomena, and those that studied complex phenomena (p. 304). He did this “to preserve the scientific status of economics.” This “new distinction” made it clear that the social sciences were “fully scientific”— they were amongst those that dealt with complex phenomena (p. 305). The distinction also fitted better with “the unity of scientific method” (p. 311). Here Hayek provided a “new framework” which endorsed “much of the standard philosophy of science of [the] day,” although there still remained some important differences with Popper (pp. 304–05.) Summarizing Hayek, Caldwell says: Theories about complex orders are “less falsifiable”—they “forbid fewer events.” Caldwell then quotes Hayek, who says: Advance into these fields means a necessary decrease in falsifiability. That is the price of advance (p. 310). And so, as Caldwell sees it, Hayek “remained to the end a believer in science. His specific goal was to provide foundations…[in] natural science (and…physiological psychology) for…economics and the social sciences” (p. 260). Caldwell feels Hayek has provided “a scientific foundation for…an interpretive…social science.” Hayek’s “explanation of the principles” for the mind shows that two individuals in the same environment would nevertheless form different mental maps so their knowledge and beliefs would also differ and it is our abstract mental maps that determine our observations. “We always interpret from the standpoint of a theory.” Thus the insistence that “all observation is theory-laden” has a “neurophysiological foundation” (p. 277). In The Sensory Order, Hayek used new terms, “rules” and “order.” These new terms continue through The Constitution of Liberty, into the discussion of “cosmos” and “taxis” in Law, Legislation, Liberty. The last appearance of these terms, together with “evolutionary themes,” is in that work’s Epilogue, with its reference to “learnt rules” that provided a sort of model of the environment (pp. 313–14).",

Klein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Austrian School of economics—the causal-realist, marginalist, subjectivist tradition established by Carl Menger in 1871—has experienced a remarkable renaissance over the last five decades (Vaughn 1994; Rothbard 1995; Oakley 1999; Salerno 1999b, 2002). Austrian economics flourished originally in Vienna during the last three decades of the nineteenth century, and in Europe and North America through the 1920s, then entered a prolonged eclipse in the 1930s and 1940s. Kept alive by important contributions from Hayek (1948), Mises (1949), Lachmann (1956), Rothbard (1962), Kirzner (1973), and others, the Austrian tradition emerged once more as an organized movement in the 1970s, and remains today an important alternative to the “mainstream” tradition of neoclassical economics. It is not always clear, however, exactly what distinguishes the Austrian School from other traditions, schools of thought, approaches, or movements within economics and its sister disciplines. As a social movement, the Austrian School possesses the formal markers usually taken to demarcate a school of thought, such as its own institutions—specialized journals, conferences, academic societies, and funding agencies—and the patterns of self-citation emphasized by Crane (1972). Here, though, I am concerned not with the sociology of the Austrian School, but with its core theoretical doctrines, propositions, and modes of analysis, particularly as they apply to everyday, pedestrian, ordinary economic problems. These are the basic problems of price theory, capital theory, monetary theory, business-cycle theory, and the theory of interventionism, problems that are central to any approach within economics. Price theory—the theory of value, exchange, production, and market intervention—was what Mises (1933, p. 214) had in mind when he made the statement, often surprising to contemporary Austrians, that the Austrian, Walrasian, and Jevonian versions of marginalism “differ only in their mode of expressing the same fundamental idea and . . . are divided more by their terminology and by peculiarities of presentation than by the substance of their teachings.” These are not the words of a young, enthusiastic author yet to appreciate the important differences among rival schools of thought; the essay was written in 1932, when Mises was a mature scholar. Hayek, likewise, wrote in his 1968 entry for the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences that his (fourth) generation of the Austrian School can hardly any longer be seen as a separate school in the sense of representing particular doctrines. A school has its greatest success when it ceases as such to exist because its leading ideals have become a part of the general dominant teaching. The Vienna school has to a great extent come to enjoy such a success. (Hayek 1968, p. 52) A few sentences later Hayek singles out “value and price theory” as the key Austrian contribution to modern economics (recognizing, of course, the influence of Marshall, and presumably Hicks, Allen, and Samuelson as well). These statements hardly can mean that Mises and Hayek failed to recognize the important distinctions among the three marginalist traditions, given their substantial work on the methodology of the Austrian School (Mises 1933, 1962; Hayek 1952). Instead, they indicate that both Mises and Hayek considered value and price theory to be central to the Austrian tradition, an emphasis broadly shared among all theoretical economists. Consider that Mises’s 1932 essay focuses on the differences between theoretical economics and the historicism of the Younger German Historical School. Indeed, Mises’s usual doctrinal targets were historicism, institutionalism, and other forms of what he considered to be “anti-economics,” not alternative versions of theoretical economics (let alone different strands within the Austrian School). In the fight for theoretical economics, Mises considered the Lausanne and British neoclassical tradition as allies. All three marginalist traditions took value, price, exchange, and production theory to be their central core.Footnote 1
 Perhaps recognizing the close ties between Austrian value and price theory and that of mainstream economics, recent commentators have looked elsewhere for the distinguishing characteristics of the Austrian School. Klein (2008, p. 361), for example, identifies the Hayekian notion of “spontaneous order” as the main contribution of the Austrian tradition, urging that the label “Austrian,” with its specific historical and geographical connotations, be replaced by “spontaneous order economics” or “Smith-Hayek economics.” Austrian economics, he argues, is part of a broader tradition that includes key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment, French classical liberals of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and twentieth-century thinkers such as Michael Polanyi.Footnote 2
 While I agree with Klein (2008) that the Austrian tradition is part of a larger, liberal movement, I argue here that Austrian economics is nonetheless a distinct kind of economic analysis, and that the essence of the Austrian approach is not subjectivism, the market process (disequilibrium), or spontaneous order, but what I call mundane economics—price theory, capital theory, monetary theory, business-cycle theory, and the theory of interventionism. Call this the “hard core” of Austrian economics. I argue that this hard core is (1) distinct, and not merely a verbal rendition of mid-twentieth-century neoclassical economics; (2) the unique foundation for applied Austrian analysis (political economy, social theory, business administration, and the like); and (3) a living, evolving body of knowledge, rooted in classic contributions of the past but not bound by them.Footnote 3
 A different view is found in Vaughn’s (1994) influential book on the modern Austrian movement. Vaughn’s characterization of the post-1974 “Austrian revival” has proved controversial (Gordon 1995; Rothbard 1995; Ekelund 1997; Thornton 1999). Her interpretation of the first three generations of the Austrian School, by contrast, has received relatively little attention. Vaughn consistently characterizes the price theory of Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, and Rothbard as backward-looking, inconsistent, and often wrong. Their elaborations of mundane economics, she says, are mainly verbal “neoclassical” economics, because they rely heavily on equilibrium constructs; indeed, Menger’s price theory is that of a “half-formed neoclassical economist” (Vaughn 1994, p. 19). Menger’s distinctive Austrian contribution, Vaughn (1994, pp. 18–19) argues, is “his many references to problems of knowledge and ignorance, his discussions of the emergence and function of institutions, the importance of articulating processes of adjustment, and his many references to the progress of mankind.” These issues, which attracted considerable attention during the “Austrian revival” of the 1970s, are discussed in Menger’s 1883 book Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere [Investigations into the method of the social sciences with special reference to economics]. They are largely absent from the Principles, however. Specifically, Vaughn maintains that there is a fundamental contradiction in Menger and Mises’s understanding of markets because they simultaneously employ equilibrium theorizing and talk about time, uncertainty, “process,” and in Menger’s case, institutions. Mises’s Human Action, for example, combined “some fundamental Mengerian insights with the apparatus of neoclassical price theory to the detriment of both” (Vaughn 1994, p. 70). I argue here against this characterization of Menger, Mises, and their contemporaries. As explained below, Austrian economists from Menger to Rothbard were fully aware of time, uncertainty, knowledge, expectations, institutions, and market processes. Indeed, their understanding of these issues was sophisticated. They employed equilibrium theorizing, but in a precise and deliberate manner. They understood clearly the distinction between their own understandings of mundane economics and that of their Walrasian and Jevonian colleagues. They devoted their energies to developing and communicating the principles of mundane economics, not because they failed to grasp the importance of knowledge, process, and coordination, but because they regarded these latter issues as subordinate to the main task of economic science, namely the construction of a more satisfactory theory of value, production, exchange, price, money, capital, and intervention.",21

Salerno,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard were the main architects of the distinctly Austrian theory of production as it exists today. The quotes above indicate that all three conceived the entrepreneurial function in the actual market economy as presupposing the ownership of property, specifically capital. And yet, many, and possibly most, contemporary Austrian economists conceive the entrepreneur as a pure decision-maker possessing superior “alertness” but owning no resources. This pure entrepreneur earns profits by “discovering” and seizing objectively existing but previously unperceived opportunities to arbitrage price discrepancies between a bundle of complementary inputs and the output it yields. That this is the essence of “the” Austrian theory of the entrepreneur and profit is accepted as a matter of course by those among the broader economics profession who are sympathetic to the Austrian theoretical approach. It is not the intent of this paper to dispute over what constitutes “the” Austrian theory of entrepreneurship; nor is it to present a full-blown alternative theory of the entrepreneur. Rather its goal is the more modest one of demonstrating that there is in the Austrian tradition traceable back to Menger, a very definite and prominent strand of thought that conceives property ownership as central to the tasks that the entrepreneur characteristically performs in the real-world market economy. The first section “The Pure Entrepreneur: Whence He Came” addresses the question of how the notion of the propertyless pure entrepreneur, as formulated in the works of Israel Kirzner, came to play a central role in Austrian economic theory during the last quarter of the twentieth century. In “The Pure Entrepreneur: An Imaginary Construction” it is argued that when Kirzner’s mentor, Ludwig von Mises, first introduced the rigorous conceptualization of the pure entrepreneur he did so with the sole purpose of analytically isolating and identifying the functional sources of the various factor incomes in the market economy. Mises explicitly warned against the dire consequences of confusing what he called the “methodological makeshift” or “imaginary construction” of the pure entrepreneur with the richer conception of what he called the “promoter entrepreneur,” formulated to capture the fullness of entrepreneurial action in the real market process. This latter concept, which has been re-dubbed the “integral entrepreneur” for the purposes of this paper, is delineated and contrasted with the Kirznerian pure entrepreneur in “The Integral Entrepreneur: A Leader Among Men”. Finally, “The Integral Entrepreneur: A Man of Means” surveys the Austrian tradition from Menger through Mises and Rothbard with respect to the evolving view of the entrepreneur’s function as a property owner and the specific productivity and income attributable to this function. The highlight of this section is the identification of a third form of income, analytically separable from pure profit and pure interest, earned by real-world entrepreneurs.",45

With the country being on the verge of hyperinflation and disaster, Mises worked out two plans for monetary reform—an official one proposing action for “normal” times, and a secret contingency plan in case of a sudden emergency. The plan for currency reform that virtually monopolized the attention of the Austrian government and public in the first few months of the republic was a proposed currency union with the German Reich. Prevailing wisdom had it that Austria was incapable of solving her problems on her own and that political and monetary union with the Reich was vital for the country. Mises was charged with defining the Austrian position for the upcoming negotiations with the Germans, and was invited to contribute an expert report on the question to a special Verein für Sozialpolitik volume that analyzed the Austrian economy. This report is still relevant in today and can be read as a blueprint for the unification of paper monies, as exemplified in the case of the European Monetary Union (1999). Mises pointed out that all problems of Austria's proposed monetary unions with the German Reich arose from the fact that both countries presently used paper monies. A currency community of two states on the basis of a paper currency is hardly feasible if there is not from the very outset the intention to abstain from any further inflation, and if this intention is not strictly put into practice. As soon as inflationary measures are resorted to, to add to the state treasury, there must arise differences of opinion about the distribution of the new quantities of money that are to enter circulation. (1919a, p. 156) The only example of such a currency community based on paper money was the Austro–Hungarian dual monarchy, which had been established in 1867 and featured two states using the same currency, namely the currency of their common predecessor, the Kaisertum Österreich. Yet this currency community could be successful because it was based on the principle that the total quantity of banknotes in circulation could not be increased. Thus distributive conflicts were avoided from the outset. But if the proposed currency union involved any inflationary measures, the only way to avoid such distributive conflicts was to establish a common financial administration, he thought. It is therefore clear from the outset that German–Austria's adoption of the German Reich's currency can begin only once the political unification has been [if not achieved, then] at least unchangeably decided. (1919a, p. 156)Footnote 3
 As for the ratio for the conversion of kronen into marks, Mises argued that it should be based on the prevailing market exchange rate between the two currencies. The ratio would also have to account for the future redemption rate of marks into gold. He recommended that this rate be based on the prevailing mark-price of gold. Attempts to reestablish the prewar rate would hurt exports, which would be devastating under the present circumstances, especially for the Austrians. The transition from the present state of two independent paper monies to the desired currency union could most suitably be achieved through the intermediate creation of a mark-exchange standard. In this scheme, the Austrian central bank would start redeeming its notes for marks, thus making kronen de facto money substitutes for marks. “By this very fact, German–Austria's adoption of the German currency is put into practice. The krone is nothing but a name for a part of the mark” (1919a, p. 164). The final step would be the replacement of krone notes by mark notes.Footnote 4

Writing in 1912, he was able to solve the classical dichotomy between microeconomics and monetary-macroeconomics and to answer the question: How does money get its purchasing power, or rather, how is the purchasing power of money determined? (Mises 1981). His important and famous solution was the regression theorem, in which Mises posited that (a) the value of money today was based on its purchasing power yesterday and that (b) this causal chain of reasoning goes back to the point in time when money did not exist, and to that point just prior to a particular commodity going into use as a medium of exchange. Thus, not only did Mises solve the classical dichotomy, he also made an important contribution concerning the nature of money: whatever money is, it must first serve as a commodity demanded in the marketplace. Of course, Mises went on to make many more contributions to economic theory and analysis. Particularly noteworthy are his contributions to the socialist calculation debate, business cycle theory, the nature of economics within the social sciences, and the relationship between economic theory and economic history. His contributions to the socialist calculation debate are particularly noteworthy because Mises has been credited with both starting and winning the debate over a dominating chorus of opponents. For nearly 70 years Mises’s theory was ridiculed—with nearly the entire economics profession believing that it was socialism that would eventually be triumphant. And then, to almost everyone’s surprise the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union disintegrated, and Red China converted to capitalism and now is in the process of buying up the rest of the world. Although he himself would scoff at this proposition: real-world events have proved that Mises was right.Footnote 1
 Mises’s other contributions have not yet been so fortunate. His proof of the microeconomic foundations for the determination of the purchasing power of money— the regression theorem—has not been accepted by the mainstream economics profession, except in the very limited sense that they accept the notion that the value of money must have some microeconomic basis, but not the particulars of Mises’s approach and certainly not his conclusion that money has a foundation as a commodity good and cannot be created de novo.Footnote 2 Mises’s “theoretical metallism” was, according to Schumpeter (1954, pp. 289–93), more popular prior to Mises’s extension of the doctrine, than after. Mises’s contribution to business cycle theory, where he combined Wicksell’s contributions with existing Austrian theory to produce the Austrian business cycle theory, was largely ignored by mainstream economics until the posthumous recognition associated with the granting of the Nobel Prize in economics to Mises’s student, F. A. Hayek, for his elaboration of Mises’s work. Finally, Mises’s work on the nature of economic science and its relation to history is “positively” deplored by mainstream economists who stubbornly maintain their mantra to positivism. The looming question is: how will history ultimately report on Mises’s contributions? Will he be a one-hit wonder with the socialist calculation debate and be otherwise forgotten? Or will he be vindicated by his other contributions? Will mainstream economic analysis continue to be dominant? Or will it be seen one day in the future as a hopelessly ill-conceived and a painfully long detour away from sound economic analysis? The purpose here is to provide one insight, using a very important but mostly ignored example, that will give us some foresight on how that future will unfold.Footnote 3 This insight is based on an examination of how well economists such as Mises forecast the twentieth century’s most important economic event—the Great Depression. We compare Mises’s performance to that of Irving Fisher, the inventor of modern mainstream economics.Footnote 4 The results of this investigation are much more than of simple antiquarian interest. The investigation provides evidence regarding the validity of Mises’s and Fisher’s contributions to economics, and their contributions in turn represent the foundations of modern mainstream and Austrian economics, especially with respect to the nature of money and interest, monetary and business cycle theory, and the role of history in economic methodology. Representing nearly polar-opposite views, Fisher placed prediction at the heart of his science and yet had no foresight of the Great Depression, while Mises cast economic forecasting outside the realm of economic science and yet was able to predict the depression and accurately describe the pitfalls of Fisher’s monetary system in 1928. As such, this comparison provides evidence for the merits of Mises’s contributions and the likelihood of their ultimate triumph.",2
11.0,3.0,The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics,03 December 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12113-008-9048-0,An Austrian Foundation for Microeconomic Principles,December 2008,John B. Egger,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Everyone who teaches Microeconomic Principles faces a welter of judgments. Many involve pedagogy, like the proper balance between individual and group work, the role of technology in the classroom, and the appropriate level of intellectual engagement to be expected of the Principles student. It would be naïve to deny that student evaluations, relied upon by administrators and many faculty members—those with high ones, at least—as precise quantitative measures of teaching ability, play a role in these judgments. No advice on these matters is offered here. You’re on your own. If the professor is an Austrian economist, though, the judgments extend beyond pedagogy. Unlike neoclassical colleagues who believe their graduate school experience as Teaching Assistants has equipped them with certain knowledge of the nature and method of microeconomics, the Austrian economist knows an alternative view of the subject. The teacher with a strong intellectual commitment to the Austrian School and the dominating professional obligation to offer his Principles students the best course possible must reconcile these two powerful forces. The thesis of this paper is, simply, that there is no conflict between them. Incorporating properly chosen attributes of Austrian theory makes one’s Microeconomic Principles course better. It is neither a substitution of one equally good technique for another, nor a compromise in which the professor indulges his own preferences at the expense of his students. An Austrian-grounded course has significant advantages over conventional courses based on neoclassical microeconomic theory. The paper is not directed to those at the few colleges where Microeconomic Principles is taught as pure Austrian economics, and it will have little practical relevance to those who must labor under tight departmental controls that permit little discretion: a departmentally selected common textbook, committee-prepared syllabus, maybe even departmentally written exams common across sections. This paper is addressed to Austrian economists who teach “ordinary” Microeconomic Principles and enjoy some freedom to shape their own courses. The role of Austrian economics in a good Microeconomic Principles course depends on what one thinks of each of them. An appropriate beginning is to outline some of the attributes of each that support integrating Austrian economics into Microeconomic Principles.",1
