Insolvency laws are to be considered an integral part of the complex bundle of property rights creditors have. Claessens and Klapper (2005) argue that a good insolvency regime prevents managers from taking imprudent loans and borrowers from lending with high default probability, while still stimulating entrepreneurship in the economy. Moreover, it is important the regime enables a time and cost efficient resolution of the financial distress in case of insolvency. This paper provides empirical evidence on the efficiency of the resolution of financial distress of Dutch bankrupt firms. We document and explain direct costs and recovery rates because these are the key variables that determine the efficiency of bankruptcy laws, rules and practices. We investigate a unique data set of 137 Dutch bankruptcies, based on the files of trustees and court offices. This data includes the characteristics of the firms, the details of the bankruptcy process and the outcomes. The contribution of our analysis is twofold. First we add to the ongoing discussion about bankruptcy systems and their efficiency. We compare our findings for the Dutch liquidation-based system to other studies in similar and different systems, such as the US reorganization-based system. A recent analysis by Djankov et al. (2006) shows that The Netherlands is particularly interesting, because in a sample of 88 countries, Dutch procedures and practices lead to the highest efficiency score in liquidation-based resolutions. Because Djankov et al. (2006) apply a stylized setting based on a single case, it is interesting to consider a large sample of actual cases in the Dutch system. Our second contribution is that we focus both on firm characteristics and on the details of the Dutch legal procedures. Within the boundaries of the legal setting, the management, creditors and trustees influence the results of the resolution of distress by their decisions to engage in or abstain from using certain legal procedures. For example, creditors can dispute against the trustees’ ruling and the trustee has the option to continue operations during the procedure. In existing studies this discretion is largely ignored. Thus, while a comparison with other countries allows us to investigate whether the Dutch legal environment has an effect on the efficiency of the bankruptcy process, we can also measure the influence of specific procedures on efficiency within the Dutch setting. We find that direct costs are on average 16% of realized assets. The costs are lower in larger firms and in firms with more bank debt, while costs increase with the time it takes to sell assets and the number of disputes the trustee has to deal with. The firm recovery rate is on average 37%. The firm recovery rate in our study is influenced by the asset structure and the capital structure. Moreover, continuation in bankruptcy improves the recovery rates, whereas liquidation has a negative effect. Overall, we find strong effects on costs and recovery of firm characteristics, i.e. size, asset structure and capital structure. Additionally, we find that some characteristics of the legal procedures turn out to influence costs and recovery. Particularly, the number of disputes increases the costs and the opportunity to continue operations in bankruptcy—chosen by about half the firms—has a positive effect on firm recovery rates. Despite the relevance of these legal procedures, our overall conclusion is that bankruptcy costs and recovery rates are mainly driven by firm characteristics. Our results partly explain why Djankov et al. (2006) in their study find that The Netherlands has a relatively efficient bankruptcy system. The firm characteristics proxy for asset value, which in turn drives recovery rates. Legal procedures may consume cash or destroy asset value, but may also enhance recovery. In this study, we find little negative effects and some positive ones. Thus, what matters in the Dutch regime is not so much the rules, but the economic characteristics of firms filing for bankruptcy that explain costs and recovery. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of the existing theoretical and empirical work on costs and recovery rates and of the Dutch bankruptcy system. Section 3 describes our data set. Section 4 provides summary statistics and the regression analyses for direct costs and recovery rates of Dutch bankrupt firms. Section 5 concludes.",26

In the second sentence, instead of “less restrictive transfer rules” it should read “more restrictive transfer rules”. The correct version of the abstract is given below: 
Abstract Transfer restrictions have a long tradition in professional sports but came under heavy attack in recent years (e.g. Bosman ruling, Monti system). Based on a bargaining model with stochastic player productivity, we show that more restrictive transfer rules reallocate ex post bargaining power from players to clubs. This reallocation is efficient and in the ex ante self-interest of players. The right to charge transfer fees enables clubs to insure their players. The players, in turn, benefit by converting risky future income into riskless current income. Overall, player utility is higher under more than under less restrictive transfer rules.",

On one side, marginal utility—and thus demand factors—are not sufficient to define equilibrium price of paintings. Production costs, on the other side, are not able to settle any natural value underlying a painting. In the literature, two alternative positions on OMP price determination coexist. The first one states that “the demand fluctuates widely, following collectors’ fads and manias and paintings prices are therefore inherently unpredictable” (Baumol 1986, p. 10). According to Baumol’s view, no fundamental value can therefore be identified for paintings. The opposite view assumes that some crucial issues can be detected in the market price, although a natural price linked to production costs does not exist for paintings (Frey and Pommerenhe 1989). According to this statement, market forces determine prices for art objects, as for any other economic good. Following this second approach, the literature has recently focused on the mechanisms of price formation in the OMP markets and the on the methodologies aiming at building price indexes that valuate the profitability of investment in art. However, the heterogeneity of artworks; the institutional setting where transactions are carried; the monopolistic power held by the owner of the painting(s); the infrequency of trading, and the existence of different segments in the art markets, all constitute specific and problematic issues, linked to the determination and to the measurement of prices, the research still has to deal with. In this paper, we take an “intermediate” approach. On the one hand, we believe that it should be possible to find a common structure that explains the determinants (or some determinants) of OMP price formation in art markets. On the other hand, we acknowledge the limitations and difficulties of the existing applied methodologies, and therefore, propose an integration of an existing approach. In particular, we focus on the institutional setting where art markets transactions are carried. We develop a preliminary attempt to embody legal provisions in empirical models. We consider a particular regulation applicable only in Italy, the “export veto” for art objects that are particularly relevant for the national cultural patrimony. We proxy such legal provision in order to include it in the statistical analysis and to check whether it affects the OMP price differentials between pre-auction estimated price and post-auction hammer price. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 surveys the economic literature and explains the paper’s motivation. Section 3 introduces the data, the used methodology and presents some of the main results. Section 4 concludes and paves the way for further research.",10

Some remarks on the Austrian school of economics’ role in the development of law and economics,February 2010,Michael Litschka,Kristoffel Grechenig,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Early works in law and economics, understood in today’s meaning of an interdisciplinary inquiry, date back at least to the late nineteenth century. Victor Mataja (1857–1934) was one of the most prominent scholars who analyzed the law with economic tools (Winkler 2004). In the monograph “Das Recht des Schadensersatzes vom Standpunkte der Nationalökonomie” (“The law of torts and contractual liability from the point of view of political economy”), published in 1888 (see Mataja 1889) he analyzed the incentive effects of a negligence rule versus strict liability (Englard 1990; Winkler 2004). In the course of elaborating a German Civil Code, this question was of utmost importance. In the case of an act of God, he argued that the costs of damage should not be borne by the owner but by the one who can best prevent the damage. In his analysis, he anticipated the cheapest cost avoider argument later made by Calabresi (1970), Calabresi and Hirschoff (1972), Demsetz (1972). With reference to Böhm-Bawerk, Mataja noted that, due to the decreasing marginal utility of wealth, the costs of damage should be spread over more than one person (Mataja 1889, pp. 27 et seq). Whether distributional effects should be taken into account when designing private law (or whether transfer payments, such as through the tax system, would better fit the task) was later heavily discussed (Kaplow and Shavell 1994, 2000). Mataja was criticized by the legal community for his methodology, not for his results. He was said to have applied a non-legal, and thus, an inadmissible line of arguments (Grechenig and Gelter 2008b). It is relevant to note that Mataja was an important figure at that time. After having finished his doctorate in law at the age of 26 and his “Habilitation” (that is a postdoctoral qualification for becoming a university professor) in “political economy” 1 year later, he was appointed Professor, being Böhm-Bawerk`s successor in Innsbruck, and then secretary of trade (Winkler 2004). Mataja would not have been so openly attacked, had there not been a widespread consensus against his methodology. What Mataja did was to search for an optimal design of legal rules, when traditional legal scholarship argued that certain rules evolved over time, e.g., out of Roman law (Savigny 1814). In our dichotomy, Mataja’s work stands for legislation through intentional social design by humans. Even though, Mataja is sometimes considered Austrian due to his economics publications (Hayek 1992 with reference to Mataja 1884), as a law and economics scholar, he was not advertising a subjective and evolutionary approach. A second very notable, but similarly disregarded work was Erwin Steinitzer’s “Ökonomische Theorie der Aktiengesellschaft” (“Economic Theory of the Public Corporation”) of 1908, in which he anticipated several insights of economics, such as the principal-agent problem (Steinitzer 1908, pp. 55 et seq, 64 et seq) and the perspective of the corporation as a nexus of contracts (Steinitzer 1908, pp. 48 et seq; contemporary research regarding ‘nexus of contracts’ includes, e.g., Jensen and Meckling 1976; Easterbrook and Fischel 1991). By means of four different types of firms, he discussed the misalignment of incentives (or interests, resp.) where ownership and control is separated. Moreover, Steinitzer argued that with an increase in ownership dispersion, shareholders lose power. Because they are not organized, they are subject to an inherent collective action problem (Steinitzer 1908, pp. 64–65). Other scholars at that time used an economic approach for designing and interpreting the law (Merkel 1895; Mauczka 1904; Unger 1891) or at least recognized economic effects of legal norms (e.g., Steinach 1888). Their main point was that the legal discipline had to look at the law and its effects from a private welfare and social welfare perspective (Winkler 2004). For them, an Austrian approach to lawmaking would have resulted in complete, scholarly apathy when it comes to discussing legal reform. Under this approach, it would not have been the task of lawyers or any other scholars to say whether a legal norm was good or bad, as advocated later by Kelsen (Grechenig and Gelter 2008b). In spite of this movement, the economic analysis of law in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century remained marginal (Englard 1990; Winkler 2004). For the economic analysis of law to enter the legal discourse a “genuinely legal argument” had to be found first. For this, the Austrian school of economics formed the basis, unintentionally of course, and added a critique to neoclassical law and economics. It contributed to a better understanding of marginalism and subjectivism which are central in modern law and economics inquiry. From a legal point of view, the development has managed to reconcile a fundamental dilemma: first, the fact that we have to evaluate the law, according to some external criteria, when talking about legal reform as well as interpretation (see Gelter and Grechenig 2007 with references to legal realism); and second, the fact that this evaluation is difficult, if not impossible.",8

For the first time since the foundation of the European Community more than 50 years ago, an explicit option of withdrawal from the Community has been set down in the Treaty of Lisbon, article 50. This act is a novelty since neither are any details concerning withdrawal processes laid down in previous treaties the European Union (EU), nor does the International Law give any specific guidelines. In fact, during the integration process that started with the foundation of the European Community no country has withdrawn from the community.Footnote 2 However, the European integration process faces new challenges due to numerous enlargements: The objectives and institutional regulations set up for the initial Community consisting of six neighbouring national economies at a quite similar stage of development are partly losing relevance in a more heterogeneous Community of now 27 member states. Unanimity decision-making becomes increasingly difficult. The majority decisions brought in to solve this problem may lead to the scenario of a country being outvoted several times and getting increasingly unsatisfied with the membership conditions. The option of withdrawal might become a serious alternative for this country and at the same time reduce tensions within the Community. The latest developments during the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon also support the importance of a (future) right of withdrawal: The Irish citizens’ refusal (still valid so far) of the Reform Treaty as well as the critical attitude of Poland and the Czech Republic have caused discussions showing a wide range of possible consequences with excluding states reluctant to support reforms on one end and founding a new European Union without them on the other. The right of withdrawal is a new instrument for the member states which on the one hand helps them to oppose to excessive EU centralization tendencies—which strengthens the principle of subsidiarity (Buchanan and Faith 1987, p. 1031)—and that on the other hand can be used as a threat in order to impede decisions or to at least enforce compensations for a decision taken against their interests. Does this mean that member states now have regained a negotiation power comparable to the right to veto or are they becoming even more powerful by threatening to leave? This study provides an answer to these questions. It is organized as follows: Sect. 2 first deals with the relevance of a withdrawal by assessing the costs and benefits coming along with EU membership and then refers to the threat of withdrawal. Section 3 presents the model which is applied to three different voting schemes: unanimity voting, majority voting without an exit option and majority voting with an exit option. The obtained results are modified in Sects. 4 and 5 by dropping certain assumptions of the basic model. Section 6 concludes.",4

This document marks the culmination of 10 years of the Commission’s consultation with political, commercial and academic stakeholders, and the start of the legislative process at the European level. One of the key reasonsFootnote 2 for the Commission’s interest is that the very diversity of contract laws (hereinafter ‘legal diversity’) within the European Union (EU) is said to hinder the ability of firms to conduct cross-border commerce and adversely impacts consumer confidence. A range of solutions is presented, spanning the spectrum from hard law to soft law instruments, and toying with both mandatory and non-mandatory rules. Of these alternatives, the frontrunner appears to be that of an optional instrument—having garnered a respectable degree of support from a number of key stakeholders.Footnote 3
 In other words, an optional instrument is presented as the means to improve the functioning of the Internal Market by removing obstacles to cross-border trade allegedly caused by legal diversity, the latter in the form of 27 different national contract laws. Fundamentally, since these 27 national laws are themselves considered as the problem, will firms flock to an optional instrument to govern their cross-border transactions instead of one of these laws? This rumination can no longer be viewed as moot, especially in light of recent developments in the area.Footnote 4
 As one of the main beneficiariesFootnote 5 of this reform, it is crucial to understand whether and how the firm perceives of legal diversity as a problem and an optional instrument as a solution in cross-border trade. In so doing, this article attempts to shed some light as to the appropriateness of introducing an optional instrument within European contract law. This article proceeds in the following manner. In Sect. 2, the relevant background is set out, including what the Commission has identified as problematic of contract laws within the EU, along with the key features of an optional instrument. Drawing largely from Cyert and March’s A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTF), Sect. 3 describes how firms crystallise aspirations, how they perform, and how they perceive and resolve problems. Section 4 draws from feedback given to the Commission from firms themselves regarding their views on cross-border trade and on what they perceive to be the benefits and burdens of legal diversity. These may, but sometimes do not, coincide with the Commission’s position on the matter. These views are used as a starting point to construct how, generally, a firm makes decisions regarding choices of law governing cross-border contracts; and particularly, whether and when a European optional instrument is considered in the firm’s decision-making process. The results appear dependent not only on the type of problem arising from the diversity of contract laws and the content of the optional instrument, but also the occasions when and manner in which firms choose laws. The resultant effect of an optional instrument is mixed: some firms may ignore it, though other may use it. Larger firms appear to benefit from its availability, rather than smaller firms. Section 5 concludes.",7

One policy is the imposition of European-wide equal norms. In contrast to that stands the desire to promote diversity and flexibility throughout the Member States (MS). The central question becomes how far the European Union (EU) legislator is to have the final say on the laws to be adopted in the MS or how much discretion should be given to national legislators to consider national particularities? How can this form of federalism be organized? Depending on the choice of the legal instrument effective implementation of European law can depend to a large extent on the cooperation of the MS (Rehbinder and Stewart 1985). It is for them to decide on the ‘necessary organisational, legal and institutional arrangements’. They furthermore highly differ as to their administrative tradition which leads to different necessities when integrating EU law (Falkner et al. 2005, p. 319; Siedentopf and Hauschild 1990, p. 451; Knill 1998, p. 7).Footnote 1
 Many economic scholars have dealt with harmonization, centralization and decentralization labeled as the theory of federalism and the theory of regulatory competition (Tiebout 1956; Stigler 1957; Arcuri and Dari-Mattiacci 2010),Footnote 2 and also particularly as to its shape in the EU (Van den Bergh 2002a; b; Weatherill 2004; Ott and Schäfer 2002; Kieninger 2002). This paper will approach the question on the degree of uniformity in particular settings from an innovative new point of view: the rules versus standards debate. The rules versus standards debate in Law and Economics and legal literature dates back to a seminal paper by Louis Kaplow from 1992 (also Kaplow 1995, 2000).Footnote 3 Since then this line of research has seen various applications, e.g. to the literature on effective laws in developing countries (Cooter and Schäfer 2008; Faure 2008, 2010; Ogus 2008; Schäfer 2006) or the extensions to behavioural effects (e.g. Korobkin 2000) or e.g. applications in the field of anti-trust (Crane 2007). While the debate is generally used in a national context as to the relationship between legislature and judiciary, in the context of the EU the debate shall be lifted up to the relationship between two legislators: the European legislator and the national legislator: The literature on ‘rules versus standards’ shall be revisited in the light of law-making in the EU, centrally dealing with the question how much discretion shall be given to the national legislator; and under which circumstances; and further by which type of legal norm this can be reflected? When it comes to legal norms the discussion, as will be motivated, shall focus on the differentiation between the European legal instruments regulation and directive. Notwithstanding this application to the EU context, a more general usage of the theory is possible in any setting where differing legal traditions are organized in a somewhat federal way and some discretion as to law-making can be left to a lower level. The established decisive factors for the choice of a rule or a standard in a national setting (complexity, volatility, judges’ specialization and frequency of application) will be enhanced by two new crucial factors (switching costs and the benefit of uniformity in terms of information costs) in order to assess law-making policies on European level. After a summary of the ‘rules versus standards’ debate (1), the analogy to EU law making will introduced (2), illustrated and the two new factors applied (3) followed by conclusions (4).",5

Zedner (2007, p. 262) recently described this change: “In important respects we are on the cusp of a shift from a post- to a pre-crime society, a society, in which the possibility of forestalling risks competes with and even takes precedence over responding to wrongs done. In consequence, the post-crime orientation of criminal justice is increasingly overshadowed by the pre-crime logic of security.”Footnote 2 In a pre-crime society, people demand measures to prevent “potential criminals” from engaging in criminal behaviour. For that purpose risk assessment and early intervention may be used. Risk assessment refers to the process of estimating the likelihood that an individual will engage in criminal behaviour. In general three main approaches can be distinguished: unstructured clinical assessment, actuarial assessment, and structured clinical assessment (Philipse 2005). The unstructured clinical assessment refers to a practice where each individual professional estimates risk on the basis of a subjective selection and weighing of information. Actuarial risk assessment is based on factors that have been shown to correlate with future behaviour. A large number of risk assessment tools fall within this category. Structured clinical assessments take actuarial assessments as a starting point, but allow individual variations. By early interventions we mean interventions to prevent high risk individuals from engaging in criminal behaviour. Early interventions may be aimed at preventing first time offences or recidivism. There are numerous programs that aim at reducing future criminal behaviour. Examples include pre-school programs and juvenile offender programs, such a multi-systemic therapy.Footnote 3 Basically, these programs try to mitigate risk factors and stimulate protective factors.Footnote 4
 There is an extensive literature on risk taxation and early intervention, especially in the fields of criminology and forensic psychiatry. In the law and economics of crime, hardly any attention seems to be paid to pre-crime interventions. The focus is mainly on post-crime interventions, that is law enforcement. The basic idea is that law enforcement yields a welfare gain if the benefits from the deterrent and incapacitation function of sanctions exceeds the costs of law enforcement.Footnote 5
 In this paper we look at the case where “pre-crime interventions” are introduced given the system of “post-crime interventions”. Adding pre-crime interventions to the existing system may lead to a reduction in crime, thus reducing the harm inflicted on victims and reducing the need for law enforcement activities. Since there are both costs and benefits associated with risk assessment and early intervention, we investigate the welfare implications. More specifically: what constitutes an optimal application of risk assessment and early intervention? This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 investigates the welfare consequences that can be expected if risk assessment is used as a guide for early intervention. More specifically, we look at the welfare implication if “pre-crime interventions” are introduced, given the existing system of “post-crime interventions”. We investigate the optimal application of risk assessment and early intervention. Section  3 makes a step from theory to practice. After discussion practical problems, this section presents three rules of thumb to identify conditions where pre-crime interventions may be welfare enhancing. Section 4 concludes.",2

These clauses allow the legislature to authorize a statute for a limited time and govern temporarily. In contrast to “normal” permanent legislation, temporary legislation does not require additional legislative action for its rescission. It loses any legally binding effect when it reaches its predetermined date of expiration and can only be extended if the legislature passes a new bill that specifies an additional period of legal validity. Recent literature on legislative timing rules treats the effect of temporary legislation as dependent upon the continued existence of a legally binding rule (Parisi et al. 2004; Gersen 2007; Gersen and Posner 2007; Luppi and Parisi 2009; Yin 2009). The discussion assumes that when legislation expires, any compliance effect associated with that legislation also expires. No explicit consideration is given to the possibility that legislation can produce effects independent of statutory enforcement. For example, temporary law can be expressive, and change the level of social sanctioning around the substance of a law (Cooter 1998; McAdams and Rasmusen 2005; Funk 2007; Feldman 2009). Temporary tariffs and industry regulations can lead to the permanent destruction of an industry or the emergence of substitute products (Nye 2007). Lobbies and coalitions can form around temporary policies, and can remain in place to seek other opportunities after a temporary policy expires (Rasmusen 1993; Grossman and Helpman 2001). Temporary polices that inform or create focal points can permanently change modes of coordination (Dharmapala and McAdams 2003). Generally, policies that change prevailing behavior can leave residual effects, even after those policies have expired. This article extends the research on timing rules by examining the interrelation between the choice of temporary timing rule and its post-expiration effect. When temporary laws leave residual effects, the benefits of lawmaking that the literature has confined to the period of statutory enforcement can spill over into future periods, where statutory enforcement is no longer in place. If legislators can anticipate such a spillover, then they may choose a temporary timing rule instead of a permanent timing rule to save costs. Our model explicitly deals with their anticipation, and how they can save those costs.",2

The day following François Hollande’s great victory in French presidential elections, the left-leaning news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur denominated his election as the hope for a “New Deal à la française”. In fact Europe has a legitimate ground to consider the current status of financial crisis as the European equivalent to the mid-war crisis in the US. Irrespective of the soundness of the positive analyses given about the factual surroundings in the 1920’s, the similarities before 2008 in Europe are evident: political stability, a general feeling of social prosperity for a glooming middle class, comfortable and wide circulation of money through loose bank lending policies, relatively small part of income coming from labour, weak control over markets due to lack of effective mechanisms and the lack of institutional means of direct intervention to support member states at the level of the European Central Bank (ECB).Footnote 1 After the explosion of the crisis, facts are getting increasingly similar: huge expansion of unemployment,Footnote 2 increase of suicides, elimination of middle class and financial depression eventually resulting in psychological depression.Footnote 3
 Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal has been so widely cited in the last 4 years in Europe, in a way that one might reasonably expect Europe to turn to legislation resembling to the 100-day reform package. This is partly true. New Deal measures aiming at the stability of family and the prevention of bank bankruptcies have been inspirational for European states, such as legislation for the protection of families with excessive bank loans (Home Owners Loans Act), the protection of family bank accounts (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), the introduction of transitory benefits for unemployed workers (Civilian Conservation Corps, apart from the employment with the public sector) and the financial injection on collapsing banks to improve their cash flows (Reconstruction Finance Corporation). However, the essence of the growth strategy of the New Deal programme has not been transplanted to Europe, namely the provisions for the creation of infrastructures (Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration Act), the employment of redundant workers in large scale public works (Civil Works Administration), the strengthening of the collective bargaining guarantees for workers (National Labour Relations Act, known as Wagner Act) and the intensification of social security and public health schemes (Social Security Act).Footnote 4
 Over and above, New Deal appears now in Europe as the symbolic allusion of a successful project to get away with what was considered to be at the time an unprecedented crisis in the economy. It suggests a liberal welfare state, as opposed to a social-democratic welfare state or a post-industrial conservative-corporatist welfare state.Footnote 5 Of course now, unlike mid-war, the main venue of the crisis is Europe and the main cause to blame is not the stock market but the overall systemic asymmetry in economy, i.e. financial and production inequalities among the states of the Union, even within the states. This is why the crisis, although triggered in the US, was mainly influential in Europe where structural deficiencies were much more evident. Banking, debt and deficit problems became all more intensive in Europe because of the exorbitant level of loans by certain states in order to finance mainly social state goals and by individuals to sustain consumption needs. Reasonably, ephemeral prosperity undermined the right of future generations to enjoy an adequate level of wealth. The present paper will try to cast light exactly upon these asymmetries. What is suggested is that the contemporary crisis in Europe is not merely economic but came up because of the institutional imbalance within the European Union, especially the Eurozone. Monetary Union seems today in retrospect as a project that was due to expire as stood in its original form: It was based on a community without democracy, then on democracy without politics and, eventually, on politics without principles. It all sum up in an institutional default (Part 1) that brought along political, social and psychological consequences far beyond the traditional boundaries of economy (Part 2). As such, the position of the study is that trying to deal with such a multilevel conundrum by simply using tools of economy is entirely unrealistic and vain. A whole restructuring, both in terms of the institutional architecture, as well as the substantive rules to secure sustainable and balanced economic and social growth, is required that would bring European states a step closer to substantive unity; otherwise a rational choice would be disintegration.Footnote 6

“In Memoriam: Gary S. Becker, 1930–2014”.Footnote 1 It is through this lapidary “Farewell Post”, announcing that the “the Becker–Posner blog is terminated”, that a number of Richard Posner’s followers might have learned the death of his friend and colleague at the University of Chicago, Gary S. Becker. Becker was a major influence in economics, and was awarded in 1992 the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for “having extended the domain of microeconomic analysis to a wide range of human behaviour and interaction, including non-market behaviour”.Footnote 2 Posner never missed an opportunity to remind the reader that Becker had exerted the strongest influence on the development law and economics (e.g. Posner 1993). Yet, it is noteworthy to mention that Becker’s direct contributions to the field were scarce: one can (only) think of two papers: the 1968 “crime and punishment: an economic approach” and the 1974 “law enforcement, malfeasance, and compensation of enforcers” (co-authored with George Stigler). This is somewhat illustrative of Becker’s scholarly work throughout his life. Becker’s influence on economics was both direct and indirect. He published numerous seminal contributions on topics that had not really been analyzed with microeconomic tools before him (the economics of the household, human capital, etc.). Yet he was primarily interested in broadening the scope of economics, that is, in invading new and virgin territories to the economist, rather than in focusing exclusively on a particular subfield.Footnote 3 Becker’s indirect influence, though, was massive, and was channeled mostly through the work of his students and colleagues, who made those subfields he contributed to create flourish. Becker is remembered by many as both a trailblazer and a mentor who played a fundamental role in supporting early controversial research. By taking a quick glance at his career, where the University of Chicago appears to be a centripetal force, it is easy to see that Becker played on the careers of his colleagues and protégés a very similar role as his own Chicago mentors—especially Milton Friedman—played on him.",7

Major works concentrate on the role of patents (Mansfield 1986), some focus also on trademarks and designs (Goldstein and Strauss 2009). The results indicate varying evidence for the impact of intellectual property, depending on sector specific characteristics, enterprise structures or culture (Thurow 1997; Mansfield 1994). Nevertheless economic theory suggests a positive influence of intellectual property on the generation of innovation and growth potentials and the practise in enterprises and markets supports this by intensive utilization processes. Especially the German economy showed in the past expansive IPR implementation efforts together with strict protection regimes, ensuring efficient monitoring and sanctioning of infringements of protected property. Therefore the question arises, if the IPR regime rewarded the German economy in the past with adequate chances of growth and prosperity for bearing the systemic costs of this strict IPR protection. The empirical study investigates the economic impact of registered intellectual property at the German Patent Office in Munich (DPMA) between 1999 and 2009 on the German economic development. It tries an answer to the question, what benefits or losses contributed registered patents, utility models, trademarks and designs in Germany to the economic performance in the last 10 years. From this perspective follows an attempt to derive implications about the German IPR profile, influencing the future economic development in Germany.",7

However, a case-by-case analysis of MFNs creates challenges for businesses and legal practitioners due to the necessity for extensive legal research created as a result, and the limitation of the guidance to the issues presented in the relevant cases. Businesses that are engaged in commercial negotiations with respect to a wide variety of parameters have a pressing need to reach business decisions quickly and the widespread use of MFNs in numerous industries shows that they are a common tool that businesses rely upon. To that end, gleaning through isolated decisions in order to come to a conclusion about the legality of a given business decision may translate into delays which increase transaction costs and may even threaten the successful conclusion of deals which are under intense time pressure. While it is understood that businesses will proceed under legal advice from professional practitioners, a singular guideline which sets forth clear criteria (such as, safe harbors, presumptions of illegality and primary competition law concerns, etc.) will also offer distinct advantages for the legal practitioner in terms of timing and cost. Indeed, the existence of a guideline would also make it easier for practitioners to spot possible legal issues in advance. This is particularly true in civil law settings where legal practitioners are used to proceeding primarily on the basis of legal instruments rather than case law. Even in the case of advanced competition law regimes, such as the US and EU, the number of decisions concerning (traditional and retail) MFN clauses are relatively few, despite the recent and increasing level of attention on retail MFNs in particular. Furthermore, the precedential value of some of the existing cases is complicated by the fact that they have been resolved by commitments or consent decree procedures which do not result in a formal finding of a violation. For instance, in the case of the EU, past enforcement efforts concerning MFN clauses have ceased without formal proceedings due to voluntary elimination of the relevant clauses,Footnote 6 or, as in the case of the e-books case, in a commitment decision, which also does not constitute a finding of a competition law infringement even though it is binding. The preparation of a guideline will also benefit competition authorities as, through a guideline, the case handlers of competition authorities will themselves have access to clear-cut criteria which will minimize the chances of investigations concerning cases that do not present competition law concerns, allowing the competition authority to conserve its resources for more important cases and allow for efficiency in case load management. The preparation of a guideline which offers the opportunity to highlight the relevant competition law issues in a complete manner and in an ex ante basis therefore seems to be the much more advantageous alternative from an ideal antitrust compliance/enforcement perspective compared to leaving the treatment of MFN clauses to the eventual unfolding of case law. This is because the preparation of a guideline would (1) reduce legal delays and transaction costs through providing guidance on potential legal issues in a manner which can be easily accessed, (2) reduce legal uncertainties especially for relatively young competition law jurisdictions where the case law may not yet be sufficiently developed, and (3) allow competition authorities to conserve their resources by eliminating non-problematic cases easily as a result of safe harbors identified by the relevant guideline. In line with the need for greater predictability and a singular source of information which is both comprehensive and easily accessible, we argue that a guideline should provide the following main elements: Definitions of restrictions encompassed within the concept of MFN; Theoretical discussion of general antitrust concerns posed by MFN clauses and market dynamics or contractual characteristics which present a strong risk of anti-competitive effects and possible presumptions of illegality; Efficiencies and justifications which may be created by MFN clauses and particular contexts where they may be pro-competitive; Safe harbors which set out under which conditions the presence of MFN clauses are unlikely to lead to any competition law concerns and therefore should be presumed legal by the courts and/or competition authorities. For the sake of clarity, these elements should not be thought of as an exhaustive list, but as the essential terms of a model. Based on the points of convergence in existing case law in different jurisdictions and the academic literature on MFN clauses, below we propose the content of the various issues outlined in the above headings. One legitimate inquiry for jurisdictions that follow the EU approach and exempt certain vertical agreements entirely from the application of the competition law would be whether the MFN clauses benefit from the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (“VBER”) (or from a similar vertical block exemption regulation adopted under local law), and if so, whether there would still be a need for an MFN guideline. For this reason, before we provide our recommendations on the content of a model guideline on the MFNs in the following section, we initially provide some discussion on whether MFN clauses should benefit from the VBER, and if so, how the model MFN guideline should interplay with the VBER (or a similar block exemption regulation formulated for vertical agreements). In jurisdictions, such as the EU, vertical agreements that satisfy certain criteria can be exempted from the application of the competition law. Take, for instance, the VBER that is currently enforced in the EU. So long as the parties to the agreement operate at different levels (one supplier and the other purchaser) of a supply chain and so long as their individual market share in the relevant market does not exceed a certain threshold (i.e. 30 %), VBER would allow the parties’ agreement to be exempt from the application of Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). Under the VBER, hardcore restrictions, such as resale price maintenance (“RPM”), would not be exempted. As MFN clauses are essentially vertical restraints, they are theoretically subject to the VBER and the Guidelines on Vertical Restraints. Article 2 of the VBER provides that “pursuant to Article 101(3) of the Treaty and subject to the provisions of this Regulation, it is hereby declared that Article 101(1) of the Treaty shall not apply to vertical agreements.” Given that the above provision provides a blanket exemption for vertical agreements subject to certain exceptions, vertical agreements between a supplier and the purchaser of the relevant good or service which contains an MFN clause would be exempted from the scope of Article 101(1) of the TFEU subject to the provisions of the VBER.Footnote 7 Against the foregoing, it can be argued that as vertical restrictions, MFN clauses stand to benefit from the block exemption provided by the VBER. On the other hand, as of yet, this conclusion has not been confirmed in any Commission decision. Similarly, neither the VBER nor the Guidelines on Vertical Restraints provide specific guidance concerning MFN clauses. In fact, the VBER does not mention MFN clauses at all, while the Guideline on Vertical Restraints includes only the following reference in paragraph 48 which concerns RPM: Similarly, direct or indirect price fixing can be made more effective when combined with measures which may reduce the buyer’s incentive to lower the resale price, such as the supplier printing a recommended resale price on the product or the supplier obliging the buyer to apply a most-favored-customer clause. The same indirect means and the same ‘supportive’ measures can be used to make maximum or recommended prices work as RPM. While the above language notes the RPM-related competitive concerns arising out of a supplier obliging the buyer to apply a MFC clause, it does not shed any light on the treatment of the use of MFN clauses in and of themselves. It has been suggested by the German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”) that MFNs could potentially be considered within the scope of Article 4(a) of the VBER concerning resale price maintenance, and therefore as a hard-core restriction that does not benefit from the block exemption, though this was ultimately left open (FCO 2013c, para. 181 et seq.). In this respect, the FCO acknowledged that the restrictions in question are not covered by a strict reading of the wording of Article 4(a) (FCO 2013c. Para. 183) as the clauses do not restrict the resale price of a buyer. Nevertheless, the FCO argues that the competitive effect of the MFN clauses is similar in character to the vertical price maintenance covered under the relevant article (FCO 2013c. para. 184–185). As the market share of HRS in the relevant market exceeded 30 % and HRS did not benefit from the VBER, the FCO ultimately left open the question of whether MFN clauses are hard-core restrictions. However, such an interpretation is open to criticism for being too expansive as MFN clauses do not necessarily limit the resale price of the buyer in a vertical relationship but in fact impose a pricing limitation on the supplier. Furthermore, an MFN clause does not formally restrict the ability to discount but merely obliges a supplier to offer the same discount to the buyer (although this obligation can create an incentive not to offer discounts). The FCO also elaborated on its stance towards the use of retail MFNs in its “Vertical Restraints in the Internet Economy: Meeting of the Working Group on Competition Law” paper (FCO 2013a) which was published about two months before the HRS decision. In its discussion of MFN and price parity clauses, the FCO emphasizes that MFN clauses reference the prices of competitors, and therefore they go beyond a mere vertical restraint and have a horizontal dimension (FCO 2013a). In its enforcement history against the use of MFN clauses, the European Commission has taken action against the use of MFN clauses in cases where it deemed that they were being used to facilitate a horizontal agreement or concerted practice (e.g. the e-books case—discussed below), or cases where their use was so widespread that the cumulative effects threatened to create exclusionary effects (e.g. the theater digitalization case—discussed below) or cause the harmonization of commercial terms (e.g. Pay TV 2004). The most recent investigation conducted by the Commission against Amazon, launched in June 2015, also illustrates the Commission’s stance on MFN clauses. Its probe will arguably also consider whether Amazon’s contractual arrangements with publishers lead to the exclusion of Amazon’s competitors given that according to the Commission, Amazon is the largest e-books distributor in Europe. The Commission launched the investigation due to Amazon’s contractual MFN-type clauses with publishers concerning Amazon’s sale of e-books. The press release provides that the clauses allow Amazon: (1) the right to be informed of more favorable or alternative terms offered to its competitors; and (2) the right to terms and conditions at least as good as those offered to its competitors. The Commission will investigate whether “such clauses may hinder the level playing field and potentially decrease competition between different e-book distributors to the detriment of consumers” (Amazon 2015). Considering the above arguments raised, it is inevitable that MFNs may or may not benefit from VBER (or a similar block exemption regulation formulated for vertical agreements). We argue that in cases where the relevant jurisdiction does not have a block exemption regulation formulated for vertical agreements or that the relevant authority finds that MFNs are hard-core restrictions that are not exempt by the relevant block exemption regulation, then the model guideline on MFNs becomes ever more useful. Needless to say, however, as a number of jurisdictions including the EU have block exemption regulation formulated for vertical agreements, the more important question is whether in case the MFN clauses benefit from the vertical exemption regulation, how would that interact with the model MFN guideline. In case where the MFNs were to benefit from the VBER, the guideline could for instance provide the circumstances in which MFNs benefit from the VBER, and distinguish cases that do not benefit from the VBER. An alternative could be that the vertical exemption regulation could be amended to clarify the recent case law on the MFNs and take a position on the types of MFNs that would be exempt by the vertical block exemption regulation, and distinguish cases, such as, for example, MFN-plus arrangements, that may not benefit from the block exemption.",2
42.0,1.0,European Journal of Law and Economics,14 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-015-9514-z,"Labour law, enforcement and the rise of temporary contract workers: empirical evidence from India’s organised manufacturing sector",August 2016,Rahul Suresh Sapkal,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The effect of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) on the growth in a size of temporary contract workers in developing countries is widely debated in the recent economic literature. Since the past two decades, the share of temporary contract workers as compared to regular workers has increased rapidly (ILO 2012). A segment of temporary contract workers mainly consists of those who are recruited by firms through third party contractors or temporary work agencies, and who lack the security of a definite tenure as well as basic employment protection. Temporary contract workers not only constitute a significant share of the labour market in developing countries, but their share has also seen a substantial rise in many developed countries.Footnote 1 At a micro level, this growth has closely been associated with an attempt to increase labour market flexibility-an employment adjustment technique for flexible management of labour (OECD 2014). In the absence of this flexibility, labour markets in many developing economies would likely to experience high levels of unemployment. Firms in developing countries tend to depend excessively on temporary contract workers as it enables them to adapt to fluctuations in the business cycles. Thus, this growth has generally been perceived as a positive development in the labour market. On the other hand, this positive development has its own drawback. A growth in their share is coupled with poor working condition, low productivity and lack of social cohesion with regular workers (World Bank 2012). This suggests that the demand for temporary contract workers to adjust firms’ workforce is actually making them more vulnerable workforce, if they are not covered under any employment protection laws. And therefore, it is likely that supply and demand factors could have influenced the growth of temporary contract workers. Earlier studies argues that the growth in a size of temporary contract workers is triggered by the stringent EPL, in particular strict dismissal laws, that increase the adjustment costs of regular workers and discourages firms from adjusting their workforce in the presence of adverse economic conditions (Boeri and Jimeno 2005; Cahuc and Postel-Vinay 2002; Booth et al. 2002). According to these studies, a higher magnitude of firing costs of regular workers also increases the compliance costs of overall labour regulation and offers less flexibility to firms in balancing workforce in response to the product market competition. As a result, when faced with strict EPL, firms are likely to avoid the burden of adjustment costs and overall compliance costs labour regulations through employing temporary contract workers. This large body of literature has two main features. First, it mostly focuses on the developed countries where labour regulations are perfectly enforced (Botero et al. 2004; Schneider and Enste 2000). Second, most of these studies have overlooked the role of the imperfect nature of enforcement in analyzing the effects of EPL (Almeida and Poole 2013; Deakin et al. 2007). Much of the empirical literature has been extended to analyse both-the impact of strict EPL on the firm’s demand for temporary contract workers, where perfect compliance with labour regulation was implicitly assumed, (Pierre and Scarpetta 2013; Cuesta and Martin 2009; Autor 2003), and the impact of enforcement intensity on compliance with labour regulation that constrains the demand for temporary contract workers (Almeida and Carneiro 2012; Ronconi 2010; Di Tella and MacCulloch 2005). However, none of these studies have looked at a case of labour markets in developing countries where there is a weak compliance with labour laws, and the de facto level of regulation is lower than the de jure level (Feldmann 2009; Djankov and Ramalho 2009). Given this context, this paper aims to estimate the joint effects of EPL and variable enforcement intensity on the growth in a size of temporary contract workers in the organised (formal) Indian labour market. In particular, it examines-whether firms located in a stricter EPL regime hire differentially more temporary contract workers in response to variable enforcement intensity. India provides an ideal setting to study the growth in a size of temporary contract workers in the organised Indian labour market. India has highly restrictive employment protection laws but its enforcement is very poor. In India, the share of temporary contract workers has increased from 10 % points to 27 % point; the share of regular workers has decreased from 68 % point to 54 % point for the period 1995–2010 respectively (Fig. 1). The Industrial Dispute Act of 1947 (hereafter IDA, 1947) sets out the regulations governing employer-worker relations and covers various aspects such as the resolution of labour disputes, hiring and firing workers, closure of establishments, retrenchment, strikes and lockouts. This act covers regular workers who are directly employed in the formal sector, through long-term contracts, and are largely represented by the trade unions. However, temporary contract workers are exempted from the application of severance payment, mandatory notice or retrenchment authorisation from the state (Rajeev 2010; Deshpande et al. 2004). Such exceptions from the legal compliance incentivise employers to hire an increasing number of contract workers due the flexibility it offers in the formal labour market (see Fig. 2). Ratio of regular and temporary contract workers. Source: Annual Survey of Industries, various years Share of temporary contract workers across different labour regimes. Source: Annual Survey of Industries, various years The theoretical premise for an empirical analysis is derived from a simple model of dynamic labour demand developed by Adhvaryu et al. (2013) and Bertola (1990). According to their theoretical model, firing and compliance costs, as mandated by the strict EPL, factor into forward-looking employment decisions of the firm. If strict EPL, that protects the rights of regular workers and enforcement of those legal rights, are perfectly complied then it is possible for firms to circumvent those laws. They would do so by reducing the demand for regular workers and increasing the demand for temporary contract workers since the latter category of workers are exempted from legal compliance. In this context, we expect that firms located in strict EPL states, and faced with high enforcement intensity, are likely to experience higher incidence of temporary contract workers as compared to those firms located in less strict EPL states, facing low enforcement intensity. For an empirical analysis, this paper uses the dataset of Annual Survey of Industries to compute the share of temporary contract workers. Next, it exploits variation in EPL and enforcement intensity measures, across thirty-one Indian states, for the period 2000–2007. The results suggest that the average effect of strict EPL and high enforcement intensity on the growth in size of temporary contract workers is positive and statistically significant across Indian states. The average effect is stronger for enforcement intensity than EPL. This implies that strongly enforced legal rights for regular workers increases the demand for temporary contract workers relative to strict EPL. Second, compared to firms in more flexible labour regimes, those in an increasingly restrictive labour regime hire differentially a higher number of temporary contract workers as response to variable enforcement intensities. And finally, the study report that the demand for temporary contract workers is rising in almost all labour intensive industries but the magnitude of the growth is slightly higher in inflexible states as compared to flexible states. The topic discussed here is important for two reasons: first, it adds to the growing literature on labour laws and economics and provides empirical evidence on how labour regulation as stipulated in the national legislation and their variable enforcements generate incentives to use temporary contract workers. Second, in the context of India, labour regulation is criticised for being restrictive since its strict enforcement may create obstacles to economic activity. Due to variation in EPL and enforcement intensity across Indian states, some firms may be more affected than others; thus, the present study provides a better understanding of this complex interplay of institutions which is crucial for allocative efficiency in the labour market. The paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 provides a snapshot of previous studies; Sect. 3 provides an overview of labour regulation and enforcement climate; Sect. 4 describes the dataset and variables; Sect. 5 looks at identification strategy and summary statistics; Sect. 6 reports empirical results and robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 7 provides the conclusion.",30

The current mortgage law traces its roots back to the first mortgage credit act of 1850, probably the oldest in the world. Early mortgage markets were developed through mortgage credit associations on the basis of property rights secured through a century old legal tradition of public announcements and land book records, now transformed into a fully digital legal property registry. In the following collateral safeguards are analyzed in view of both stable and dynamic features in search of the roots of collateral performance. The composite nature of collateral security is mapped out, and it is discussed how a low risk environment was built. A mortgage deed is a money-creating debt contract secured by a registered interest in the concerned property, but security of collateral is not a narrow legal issue, as elaborated below. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle, a principle that continues to be vital to the system. Through the balance principle a number of risks are eliminated, in combination with strong property rights. The qualities of the securitization model are highlighted in a number of comparative studies (Wyman 2003; Suarez and Vassallo 2004; Nadler 2005). A study by the International Monetary Fund stated that the Danish mortgage system is widely recognized as one of the most sophisticated housing finance systems in the world (IMF 2006). The mortgage system remains highly competitive in present day capital markets, as evidenced by the size of the mortgage bond market relative to county size (Chong 2010). By April 2014 international investors held 45 % of all Danish bonds.Footnote 1
 The paper takes its point of departure in the legal and specific foundation of credit arrangements, while collateral of mortgage intermediaries is mentioned briefly, because the security backing mortgage deeds determines the quality of collateral pools, a critical issue in current negotiations on future international financial regulations, Basel III and CRD IV.Footnote 2
 Mortgaging in Denmark is governed by the ‘Mortgage-Credit loans and Mortgage-Credit Bonds etc. Act’ (in brief the Mortgage Credit Act,Footnote 3 MCA). Mortgage credit issued by the specialized mortgage banks (originally mortgage credit associations) are only issued against a registered interest on the real estate in the legal property register pursuant to the MCA §2. The mortgage contract constitutes the document of registration (mortgage deed), and functions as well as the debtor’s promissory note (Spang-Hanssen 2009). In this manner a registered mortgage deed represents both a (personal) contract between the lender and the borrower, and an (impersonal) property interest. Collateral performance will be explored with reference to principles and practices of mortgaging, property rights, and to the related institutional arrangements: In Sect. 2 the basic ideas and historic roots of the mortgage finance system are outlined with a focus on the securitization principle, risk profile, organization and the mortgage market in Denmark. In Sect. 3 observations are made on the performance of the Danish mortgage system during previous chocks and formative market events like the economic crisis in the 1930’s, urbanization, integration into the European community and the recent global financial crisis. The discussion in Sect. 4 focuses on different dimensions of collateral security and the robustness of the mortgage finance system achieved through its particular blend of regulation, organization and securitization technique within a market paradigm. Conclusions are summarized in Sect. 5 on the incentive structures and on the safeguards that created the preconditions for high collateral performance.",5

From this fundamental right follows, firstly, the primary responsibility of a judge to ensure his impartiality and to recuse himself when his impartiality can reasonably be questioned, and secondly, when the judge does not do this on his own motion, the necessity of a legal system to have a mechanism to challenge the jurisdiction of the judge or judges during court proceedings because of real or reasonably apprehended bias or lack of impartiality. This article focuses on the latter. The terminology differs between countries with different legal traditions and between regional and international courts. In this article we will refer to this mechanism as “challenging the (impartiality of the) judge(s)” and “challenging procedure”. The mechanism is triggered by a “request” or “motion” “to recuse” or “for recusal” by one of the parties or by their legal representation on their behalf. We will use these different wordings without meaning any difference in substance. A distinction can be made between objective and subjective impartiality. Objective impartiality concerns the absence of factors that can be objectively established and throw doubt on the impartiality of the judge, especially conflicts of interest stemming from e.g. family or other social or business ties between the judge and a party or his legal representation. Subjective impartiality relates to personal attitudes or opinions of the judge that lead to doubt about his impartiality. While breaches of objective impartiality can in most countries be established more easily and objectively on the basis of existing guidelines or codes of conduct for judges and the facts of the case, infringement of subjective impartiality is much harder to establish, and therefore requires a full judicial procedure to decide charges of subjective partiality. For both categories it is sufficient for a motion to recuse to succeed, to establish that, despite the fact that in all legal systems the personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof of the contrary,Footnote 1 there is an apprehension of bias, i.e. a reasonable and informed person would be concerned that the judge might be biased. The challenging procedures differ across countries (Giesen et al. 2012). Differences are about, for instance, whether or not the main case is halted once a motion for recusal has been made, which judge or judges hear the motion, whether or not (financial) sanctions follow a rejected motion. A motion for recusal is in some jurisdictionsFootnote 2 (in first instance) heard by the judge whose impartiality is questioned, in others (most European countries) the motion is heard by other judges from the same or in some cases from another court. If the motion is not followed by recusal, the judge continues. Otherwise, another judge takes his place. In many countries among which Belgium, France and the UK there are concerns about the improper use of this mechanism (Giesen et al. 2012). Improper use may aim at retarding the main procedure, at replacing the judge when a party has the impression that the judge will not rule in favor of him on legal and/or factual grounds, or at venting frustration with the legal system in general or the course of events in the case without offering any indication of partiality. In several countries, these concerns have led to a higher bar for charges of impartiality by, for instance, introducing a court fee or requiring that charges can only be made by a lawyer, and the introduction of financial sanctions in case of improper use. For instance, financial sanctions can be imposed in England, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, while in France a financial sanction must be imposed if in criminal cases a charge is dismissed. Another approach is to summarily dismiss charges that evidently have no ground. See again Giesen et al. (2012). In other countries barriers are resisted. The Netherlands are a case in point. In 2013, 479 challenges were made in the first instance court, of which 12 were upheld, while in the appeal courts 147 challenges were made of which 9 were upheld (Raad voor de rechtspraak 2014, Tables 31 and 32).Footnote 3 These figures point to a very inefficient procedure, as there is no reason to assume that the decisions on challenges were biased against the challengers. It should be noted that not only improper use of the challenging procedure may cause this huge difference between challenges and upheld challenges. For instance, lack of information and emotional reactions to unexpected and/or undesired decisions of the judge play a role, especially for parties that do not have (adequate) legal counsel. This, however, does not alter the inefficiency of the procedure. Lawyers and judges alike consider barriers and, in particular, financial barriers an unwarranted infringement of the right of an impartial trial, although the general population believes otherwise (Van Rossum et al. 2012). Also, financial sanctions are considered to be ineffective by these actors. Empirical research about actual challenge behavior of parties is scarce. In Sect. 2 we will discuss the literature known to us. To our knowledge, no empirical research has been undertaken to establish the impact of barriers. In the absence of facts, everybody can pick his own argument, congenial to his normative position. Given the divergent approaches and opinions, the subject merits research. The data for the Netherlands indicate that challenge procedures that have no barriers are extremely inefficient. The inefficiency is likely to increase, as in many countries the role of the judge in a case is changing from a passive to an active role, increasing the potential for conflicts between judge and parties (see Sect. 3). The issue is, therefore, how to increase the efficiency of challenge procedures, while maintaining the right to an impartial trial. We will focus on a financial sanction in the form of a fine and will address two questions. First, are fines effective in discouraging unfounded challenges? Second, do they lead to well-founded challenges not being made? We use experimental methods in an economic framework to address these questions. Section 2 addresses briefly what is known about challenge behavior, while Sect. 3 examines changes in the role of the judge that will have an effect on the use of challenge procedures. Section 4 sets out the model, Sect. 5 the predictions and Sect. 6 the experimental design. The results are presented in Sects. 7 and 8 concludes.",4

 The full effectiveness (…) and, in particular, the practical effect of (…) Article [101(1) TFEUFootnote 3] would be put at risk if it were not open to any individual to claim damages for loss caused to him by a contract or by conduct liable to restrict or distort competition.Footnote 4
 Five years later, the ECJ added in Manfredi that (…) any individual can claim compensation for the harm suffered where there is a causal relationship between that harm and an agreement or practice prohibited under Article [101 TFEUFootnote 5].Footnote 6
 The ECJ’s holding now also figures in the European directive governing actions for damages for infringements of competition law (EU Damages Directive),Footnote 7 which sets out certain rules “to ensure that anyone who has suffered harm caused by an infringement of competition law (…) can effectively exercise the right to claim full compensation for that harm”Footnote 8 and urges member states to safeguard this right.Footnote 9
 The court’s holding that “any individual” has a right to damages strikingly resembles the language in Sec. 4 of the Clayton ActFootnote 10 providing that (…) any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor (…) and shall recover threefold the damages (…). However, the U.S. courts have developed important limitations on standing, whereas the ECJ’s case law, which is the basis of the EU Damages Directive, apparently excludes any outright restriction besides causality. Nonetheless, up to now, the European private enforcement debate has focused almost exclusively on purchasers,Footnote 11 neglecting many other parties that may incur losses due to a sellers’ cartel. This paper focuses on suppliers, a group that is affected particularly often. While it is accepted that suppliers to a buying cartel (monopsony) are entitled to compensation,Footnote 12 it is mostly overlooked that suppliers to a sellers’ cartel may suffer losses, too.Footnote 13 Whether they have a right to damages for competition law infringements offers insights into how the boundaries of this right are defined in different legal systems. This is important given that, first, private enforcement serves as a policy instrument to discourage infringements,Footnote 14 and second, international cartels usually affect a diverse menu of jurisdictions with different substantive and procedural rules from which potential claimants may be able to choose to a certain extent.Footnote 15
 Our analysis starts from the premise that a right to damages by suppliers to a sellers’ cartel requires that, first, suppliers are worse off due to the cartel in economic terms, and that, second, the respective losses, considering the economic mechanisms that produce them, are caught by the law of damages and the law on standing in the legal system at issue. As to the first condition, Sect. 2 explains analytically that cartel suppliers’ losses are determined by a direct quantity, a price and a cost effect. Concerning the second condition, Sect. 3 analyses whether suppliers are entitled to claim net losses as damages in the U.S. and the EU from a comparative law and economics perspective. We argue that, whereas cartel suppliers are mostly denied a right to damages in the U.S., in the EU the type of loss which the competition provisions are intended to prevent is broader. Importantly, the EU law guidelines on the right to damages are complemented by national law.Footnote 16 We exemplify the interplay of EU law and the law of the Member States by analysing the availability of a right to damages by cartel suppliers in England and Germany, i.e. one common law and one continental law country that currently appear to be among the most popular jurisdictions for follow-on damages actions in the EU.Footnote 17 We also discuss whether and how the English position might change after Britain’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”). Building on our results, Sect. 4 discusses the case for and against cartel supplier damage claims in Europe, examining whether lessons can be drawn from the U.S. approach. We conclude that the EU institutional framework provides for more generous supplier standing than the U.S. one. This offers a further option to discourage cartels and improve compensation in the EU including England. Refuting the objection that supplier claims would not be practically viable, we sketch an econometric approach based on residual demand estimation that allows to quantify all determinants of cartel suppliers’ damages. We thereby also provide policy advice for the future development of UK competition law post-Brexit.",3

It is explicitly stated in the Swedish Budget Act (SFS 2011:203), that all state services should be provided with a high level of efficiency. When dealing with state-provided production, this means that it should be efficient; that is, it should use the least amount of inputs at the given output level or produce the maximum amount of production at the given resource level. The motivation for studying productivity development is therefore, from a policy perspective, straightforward. Swedish applications can, for instance, be found for higher education (Andersson et al. 2017a), employment offices (Andersson et al. 2014), day care (Bjurek et al. 1992), elderly care, and primary and secondary education (Arnek et al. 2016). Economic development is concluded to benefit from an efficient judicial system, internationally (Feld and Voigt 2003; Messick 1999). Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate in the media, as well as in research regarding punishments, criminality, and the judicial system in Sweden (Sturup et al. 2018; Tyrefors Hinnerich et al. 2017). For instance, the share of solved suspicious declined from 2004 to 2014, according to Nordén (2015). The Swedish Government has launched a number of reforms for the district courts during the last 20 years, with the major objective of increasing efficiency and productivity, while maintaining a high degree of law and order (Swedish Agency for Public Management 2007). One such reform has targeted the size of the courts, based on the assumption that scale advantages exist. In 1999, there were 96 district courts in Sweden, but today only 48 exist. Despite the reforms, the Swedish National Court Administration (SNCA) reports that the productivity has declined. However, problems can occur in the study by SNCA, since productivity (i.e., labour productivity) is measured by partial measures, which ignore substitution between inputs. At the same time, new technologies have been introduced in the courts (i.e., the possibility of conducting hearings through video conferences), and these changes are not captured by the productivity measures used. The aim of this study is to measure the Swedish district courts’ total factor productivity (TFP) from 2012 to 2015. To compute TFP, distances obtained by the data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework, proposed by Charnes et al. (1978), is used. TFP is measured by the Malmquist productivity index (MPI), which was first proposed by Caves et al. (1982) and first applied in a DEA framework by Färe et al. (1994a).Footnote 1 Following Wheelock and Wilson (1999), the MPI is decomposed into four parts: changes in (1) pure technical efficiency; (2) scale efficiency; (3) pure technology; and (4) the scale of the technology. A commonly known issue with all types of DEA analysis is that no statistical inference is possible (Simar and Wilson 2000). In this study a bootstrap approach is used to determine the confidence intervals of the different components presented above (Efron 1979). Another issue with DEA is the influence of outliers (Kapelko and Oude Lansink 2015). The analysis of outliers is, to a large extent, omitted in previous studies on court performance. In this study, an outlier detection analysis is performed to investigate whether the results depend on a few extreme observations.Footnote 2
 The findings indicate a decline in TFP of 1.7% on average. However, a substantial variation between courts and between years is present. Between 36 and 57% of the courts have a significantly negative change in TFP, while the share of courts with a significantly positive TFP change is 16–36%. The reason for this is because courts that improve 1 year may show a decline in TFP the following year. Looking at the components, the negative impact is driven by a decline in pure technical change (TC) of 4.7% in 2012–2013. Further, the TFP is significantly negative during 2014–2015. During this period, the number of courts observed to have a significant decline in TFP is larger, and the numbers of courts with a positive and significant TFP development are fewer, in comparison with the rest of the years. The correlation analysis concludes that the rate of change in the caseload has a significantly positive correlation with TFP, which indicates flexibility problems. The caseload variable is defined as the number of pending cases and matters by the start of the year, plus new cases and matters during the year. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief summary of the Swedish judicial system. Section 3 presents the previous TFP and efficiency literature regarding courts. Section 4 describes the methodology. Section 5 examines the data, including outlier detection. The results are reported in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes and discusses the policy implications.",11

Mulder,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A frequently used way to discourage citizens to engage in undesirable behaviors such as illegal downloading, tax evasion or speeding, is sanctioning those behaviors. By installing a sanctioning system, policy makers base their decision on the idea that a sanction changes the attractiveness of the behavior, which deters people to engage in it. This utilitarian view of punishment has been around since Beccaria (1775) and was advocated by many, including Becker (1993). However, research has increasingly paid attention to the role that norms play in citizen’s behavior and has yielded insights that are difficult to reconcile with a pure utilitarian view. For example, tax literature has shown that the majority of people pay their taxes while actually the chances of getting caught when you do not pay taxes, are low (Torgler and Schneider 2005). This illustrates that people pay taxes based on internalized norms such as “tax morale” (Torgler and Schneider 2005) or a feeling of duty (Scholz and Pinney 1995). In criminology it has been advocated that the interplay of moral norms and instrumental incentives should be taken into account. Kroneberg et al. (2010) concluded that shoplifting and tax fraud was only based on instrumental rationality for people who did not feel bounded by moral norms. For those with strongly internalized norms, instrumental incentives had no influence. In line with this, Wenzel (2004) showed that sanctions only influenced tax compliance when personal tax-paying norms where low. Thus, next to sanctions, moral norms importantly determine behavior as well. However, it may be a mistake to regard the topic of sanctions and moral norms as two independent entities. In fact, sanctions may give shape to moral norms and vice versa. After all, sanctions do not only have the instrumental purpose of deterring people from the undesired behavior, but also have a retributive, “just deserts” function (Carlsmith et al. 2002; McFatter 1982; Watamura et al. 2014) which entails that a sanction is seen as a measure to restore an injustice done. Indeed, although often implicit, preference for punishment is often morally-driven (Bilz and Nadler 2009; Wiltermuth and Flynn 2013), stemming from moral emotions (Darley and Pittman 2003; Ellsworth and Gross 1994) or from normative evaluations of an act (Warr et al. 1983). Thus, the inclination to punish a certain type of behavior stems from the idea that engaging in this behavior is “morally wrong”. Similarly, the installation of a sanctioning system has an expressive function of showing what is morally right and wrong (McAdams 2000) as one communicates that the behavior is morally disapproved of and that perpetrators of the rule are morally condemned (Cooter 1998). People may perceive this moral disapproval as stemming merely from the authority who installs the sanction. However, since an authority usually represents a larger society, a sanction may more generally signal that the group or larger society disapproves of the sanctioned behavior. As such, sanctions provide social validation for rules and may actually foster the moral conviction that the sanctioned behavior is “bad” (Williams and Hawkins 1986; Yanagida and Fujii 2004). This expressive function of sanctions may partly explain why sanctions steer behavior. Indeed, in the context of trade secret law, Feldman (2009) has shown that laws steer people’s behavior because they make people perceive the undesired act as immoral. In the same line, Thøgersen (2008) showed that the effect of economic incentives on recycling garbage could largely be explained by a change in personal norms favoring recycling. The above suggests that a sanction may not only work by making the sanctioned behavior objectively less attractive, but also by, due to its expressive function, creating a moral motivation not to engage in the sanctioned behavior. Nevertheless, sanctions may not always succeed in this. In fact, there is also literature that suggest that sanctions have the opposite expressive function (Fehr and Falk 2001; Gneezy and Rustichini 2000; Tenbrunsel and Messick 1999) and may actually undermine moral norms. A nice illustration of this is the study of Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) in which a child day-care center installed a fine for picking up one’s children late. This induced parents to pick up their children even later as they suddenly regarded the situation as a business transaction: In exchange for them paying the fine, their children were cared for a bit longer. In line with this, data of Mulder and Van Dijk (work in progress) shows that the presence of a fine can reduce feelings of shame and guilt after showing the undesired behavior. Thus, sanctions have the ability to positively affect the morality of a decision (by communicating a moral norm), but they may also fail to do so (and even negatively affect morality by transforming an ethical issue into a business transaction). Whether or not sanctions affect morality in a positive way, may depend on various circumstances. Research has identified several moderators of a sanction’s effect on morality. In this paper, we draw from the psychology literature and highlight three factors that have been shown to determine the symbolic function of sanctions. The first is the extent to which a sanction is communicated as a form or retribution rather than as a form of compensation. The second is whether a sanction takes the form of a punishment or a reward. The third is the severity of a sanction.",9

There is broad consensus among legal scholars, however, that judges do not always live up to those standards. Judges are, after all, human beings with emotions and moral and political convictions. The suggestion that judges are not able to completely ignore emotionally appealing but legally irrelevant decision determinants is rather unsurprising from a psychological standpoint. Judges often engage in what psychologists call “motivated reasoning” (Braman 2010; Kunda 1990; Sood 2013; Spellman and Schauer 2012). They want to convince their audience (e.g., individuals in the general public or the regulatory apparatus of the federal government, see Baum 2006; Black et al. 2016) and are focused on reaching certain conclusions. This motivation can affect judges’ information search and processing as well as other components of the decision-making process. This same point finds support in psychological research on confirmation bias (e.g., Snyder and Swann 1978). However, judges are also professionals. They have been trained to distinguish legally relevant from legally irrelevant aspects of a case. Their job is to make decisions on purely legal grounds, and many judges have been doing that for a very long time. In psychology, it is widely accepted that professional decision makers often perform much better at decision-making tasks than their non-professional counterparts. The question, therefore, is if and to what extent legal training, practice, and experience can insulate judges from the possibility of non-legal arguments influencing their decisions (Kahan et al. 2016; Spellman and Schauer 2012). In this article, we provide evidence that judges’ decisions are not influenced by legally irrelevant sentiment toward speculators, even though we find that two independent samples of 123 professional lawyers and 247 law students expect them to be biased against speculators. In another sample of 170 lawyers, we find weak evidence for an anti-speculator bias. This adds to a growing body of literature that posits that a biased audience may perceive unbiased judgments as biased. While this literature usually suggests that this “communication problem” exists between lawyers and non-lawyers (i.e. between judges and the public), we show that a similar problem may exist within the legal community. Law students and professional lawyers perceive judges to be biased, even though in our study the former are not biased themselves.",2

An experiment,June 2019,Michał Krawczyk,Krzysztof Szczygielski,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Many services important for all modern societies, notably legal services and health care are provided by “professions”. While the term is often imprecisely defined, some key characteristics of an “ideal type” profession are easily identifiable. Professions typically provide services (rather than physical goods); these are often sophisticated and entailing a high degree of information advantage over the consumer. A formal organization often exists, which oversees the process of joining the profession, i.a. verifying the competence of a candidate acquired in the course of the education process. It also represents the professionals vis-à-vis the government and other actors in the society. It may also take some of the judiciary duties with respect to the members of the profession, particularly in case they violate a codified or tacit code of ethical conduct. In short, professional organizations frequently perform some regulatory functions (cf. Ogus 1995, 2000; van den Bergh 2004). Because information is asymmetric and formal sanctions limited (and often subject to the decision of the self-regulatory organization), professionals are hoped to observe high ethical standards. In this study we investigate one aspect of willingness to adhere to professional ethics. We want to verify whether professionals are more likely to behave ethically, and whether they are more likely to punish others’ misbehavior, when confronted with fellow professionals, compared to facing a mixed group. These two effects would contribute to sustainability of high ethical standards within a profession. Then again, it is also conceivable that professionals are less willing to punish their peers, which could lead to the opposite effect. The mechanisms we are considering are logically independent of two other important factors: whether ethical individuals tend to self-select to some professions (Handy and Katz 1998; Brekke and Nyborg 2010) and how professional training affects ethical decision making (Frank et al. 1993); the latter issues received considerably more attention in experimental literature, at least as applied to the economist profession. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly review the literature on professions and on the relevant economic experiments. Then, in Sect. 3, we present the experiment and in Sect. 4 we discuss its outcomes. Section 5 concludes.",3

Consequently, the design of corporate law is important.Footnote 1 The legislator should offer a legal framework that aligns the interests of those who control and finance the firm. The law should also facilitate for parties to conclude mutually preferable agreements at low transaction costs. But, how can we assess whether the legislators have succeeded in such an endeavor? With reference to an analysis of Swedish corporate law, we introduce a two-dimension model that addresses this problem. Swedish corporate law uses a one-size-fit-all regulatory technique. This means that there is only one corporate company form, the aktiebolag, and hence, the act must include rules that both fit the needs of public listed firms and small one-person corporations. For decades, scholars and practitioners has questioned if the suit is not too large for the average firm and whether Sweden needs a new corporate form for closely held businesses (see e.g., Nerep 1999; Skog 2006; Arvidsson and Samuelsson 2006). However, to our knowledge none has tried to addresses this question from a law and economics perspective. In this paper, we accept the challenge and offer an economic analysis of the design of Swedish corporate law. For this purpose, we present a two-dimension model that makes it possible to analyze and characterize corporate law with respect to the level of regulation intensity and the level of default. Thus, the model visualizes alternative regulatory techniques and allows for comparison of different legal solutions. The model also serves as an analytic tool for policy changes as it eases the understanding of how transaction costs for individual firms affect the effectiveness of the different techniques and how regulatory techniques can be used to match the needs of different types of corporations, e.g., public corporations, corporation with and without controlling shareholders, closely held businesses and family firms. We limit our analysis to the regulationFootnote 2 of organization and decision-taking organs in the firm. In the literature, at least two main topics on the design of corporate legislation can be identified. The first is how detailed corporate issues should be regulated in legal statutes and to what extent it instead should remain for the parties to regulate by contract. Within this topic, questions such as the usage of rules versus standards and non-regulation are discussed. We call this dimension of corporate law design the level of regulation intensity. The second main topic found in the literature is what we call the level of default, i.e. whether legal rules should be mandatory or non-mandatory and the usage of different default techniques such as opt-in and opt-out regulation. What is new in this paper is that these two dimensions are combined and integrated in one model of corporate law design. The earlier literature treats the dimensions separately. Ehrlich and Posner (1974) analyze rule making. They claim that it is fruitful to apply a specificity-generality continuum, in contrast to a “dichotomy between ‘rules’ and ‘standards’”. We will apply a similar analysis to rule making, but in combination with a consideration to the default character of a legal norm. In the analysis of level of default, we also envision, similar to McDonnel (2007), a continuum, instead of a dichotomy, between default and mandatory rules. Applying our model on the Swedish case, we conclude that the rules are suboptimal for the majority of the firm, i.e. closely held corporations. We find that literature supports a corporate law design with a high level of both default and regulation intensity. To fulfill this support, the lawmaker should be ambitious in designing corporate law as a standard contract to fit the needs of the vast majority of corporations. In Sweden, as in most states, such firms are closely held. To succeed in the accurate level of defaults, the legislator cannot only equip the law with opt-out regulation. Such rules are often associated with excessively high transaction costs to derogate from. For different economic and psychological reasons, parties tend to stick with opt-out rules although they are suboptimal. Instead, the Swedish legislator’s objective should be to lower the costs of contracting by also using opt-ins and menus. In addition, lawmakers in Sweden must acknowledge costs of so-called altering rules and strive to lower such costs, particularly by highlighting and not hiding the default character of legal norms. Our conclusions support policy change and we contribute with suggestions on how lawmakers may amend the Swedish Companies Act of 2005. Alternatively, a new legal form for closely held corporations could be introduced, regulated separately from the current aktiebolag and based on majoritarian defaults. In addition, as our model works as an analytic tool that can guide lawmakers in the choice between regulatory techniques such as the choice between rules or standards and between mandatory or default regulation, we see that it potentially has universal character and can be applied to other corporate law issues as well as other areas of law. The model visualizes alternative regulatory techniques and allows for comparison of different legal solutions, which also make it useful for comparative legal studies. Hence our contribution is twofold: First, we contribute to policy as our conclusions can assist Swedish lawmakers in their choice of regulatory techniques. Second, we contribute to literature and further research with our model as an analytic tool to assess regulatory techniques. The paper will be organized in sections as follows: In section two, we introduce the Swedish case and the set of legal rules, which is the focus of this study. In section three, we present a theoretical background to the field of economic analysis of corporate law and regulation. In this section, we address the double trust problem, the corporation as a nexus for contracts and corporate law as a standard contract. In section four, we present our two-dimension model discussing the default and regulation intensity aspects of corporate law and how economic efficiency/growth and transaction costs are affected hereby. In section five, we apply our model to the Swedish case and show what implication our conclusions have for policy change. In Sect. 6, we briefly illustrate the universal character of our model and how it potentially can be applied on other cases. Summary and final comments end the paper.",3

Ramello,Stefan Voigt,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There are different kinds of revolutions. Some are noisy, bloody and conflictual. Others are silent, bloodless and underground–until they emerge and show that change is unavoidable. The latter type of revolution is less visible but not for this less disruptive, since it has the power to gradually change things until a point of no return is reached. One such revolution was engendered in the mind of a visionary scholar and within the circle of his department colleagues. It matured over a couple of decades, and began to manifest itself at the start of the new millennium. In the twenty years since then it has continued to spread, to become today one of the major innovations in current legal scholarship and its surrounding fields. We are talking about empirical legal studies (ELS), a label that sounds almost like an oxymoron, but which is actually the disruption that has shaken legal academia to its roots in the last two decades. This merit is doubly deserving of applause if we consider that the legal community has for a long time, as a number of commentators note, “been remarkably successful in insulating itself against any infiltration of scientific knowledge” (Loevinger 1949, p. 475). ELS brought about that change. It was disseminated by a handful of scholars at Cornell Law School led by Theodore Eisenberg, a totemic figure among US legal researchers. “Ted”, as he was known to friends and colleagues, was a kind of quiet revolutionary who through hard work and great enthusiasm started the cross-contamination of legal studies and statistics, and made Cornell Law School the birthplace of the silent ELS revolution. Prof. Eisenberg worked there for 33 years, teaching many courses in legal scholarship. He was also a prolific scholar who soon introduced into his writings the use of statistical methods to disentangle complex legal issues such as bankruptcy, damages, and juries. He was, in the words of the Dean Prof. Stewart J. Schwab, “a giant in the legal academia”, who not only conceived the ELS approach but also promoted it around the world. Indeed, while Cornell Law School and the US legal community can be regarded as the ‘cradle’ of ELS, it was Ted who untiringly spread the approach everywhere as “a superstar on the world stage” (Clermont 2014, p. 1), thanks to his intensive travel and teaching in many countries. In particular, he visited Europe several times and there engaged in a number of promotional activities, including giving courses on ELS. As a result, a great many scholars were able to directly learn from him and put his lessons into practice, while many others were indirectly exposed to ELS through various types of meetings. We as individual scholars, and the PhD programs that we chair, were among those lucky enough to have shared his friendship and scholarship to the point of being “infected” by his enthusiasm for statistics, and were thus directly attracted to ELS.Footnote 1 This journal issue springs from a workshop on empirical legal studies held on the occasion of the XIIth conference of the Italian Society of Law and Economics and organized by the International IEL program in Torino. It was prepared in memory of Ted Eisenberg, simply to show once more how his scholarship spread across national boundaries, to create a worldwide group of people who, in one way or another, have taken his lesson on board. Even this journal, which as its title indicates is chiefly devoted to law and economics, has been somewhat influenced by Ted’s scholarship as an author and as a mentor for a generation of researchers.Footnote 2 Today, a large part of what is published in the journal is empirical, and even some of the topics covered, first and foremost among them litigation, are ones that he investigated. Therefore, although this issue is specifically devoted to honoring Ted’s legacy, many of the articles submitted and published in other issues likewise testify to the importance of the ELS revolution, and its impact not just in the place that was its cradle but all around the world.",2

Even worse, in some countries, also in the center of Europe, liberal-democratic institutions started to crumble. These democracies did not collapse and slide back into autocracy, as we have seen so often in Latin America or Africa—electoral democracy has largely been maintained. Instead, they have started to slowly revert previous achievements, e.g., with respect to the rule of law. This raises the question how different political and legal systems safeguard personal freedom, defined as the extent to which people can make the choices they want in personal and public life without being dominated by others. Does electoral democracy suffice, or are complementary institutions, such as those guaranteeing judicial independence, needed? Personal freedom is a widely shared desideratum. It occupies a central role in the liberal tradition—in the utilitarian approach of Mill (1859), in the contract-theory versions of Rawls (1971) and Buchanan (1977), in the Whig-inspired analysis of Hayek (1960) and in the more rights-based tradition of Locke (1689) and Nozick (1974)—but is certainly not restricted to it. Most ideologies allow for and value a personal sphere in which people can live on their own terms. Moreover, economic philosophers like Sen (1999) have stressed that human development should not be measured merely in terms of income levels and poverty rates, but freedom itself constitutes a principal goal and measure of success of development. One basic reason for putting a high value on freedom is that it seems to bring happiness to people (Verme 2009; Rahman and Veenhoven 2017); but even if it did not, it could still be deemed desirable on the basis of non-consequentialist moral theories. We conduct the first empirical study relating personal freedom to two central political and legal institutional arrangements: democracy (defined in a minimal way as political offices being filled through contested elections) and judicial independence (defined, following Feld and Voigt 2003, as the de facto enforcement of court decisions irrespective of the interests of other government branches).Footnote 2 We, thus, study the extent to which either certain political institutions and practices or certain legal institutions and practices protect personal freedom, as well as its seven constituent indicators. In addition, we offer an interaction analysis to see whether institutional complementarities exist between democracy and judicial independence—which is especially important in light of the recent rise of illiberal democracy, alluded to above.Footnote 3 A priori, it is ambiguous in what direction the relationships between democracy and personal freedom and between judicial independence and personal freedom go. While democracy, in the pure electoral sense of the term, offers the majority a chance to affect policy, and while most people, including the median voter, may value personal freedom, they may nevertheless want to restrict it such that it primarily applies to themselves and their in-group. It is certainly not unheard of for majorities to curtail ways of living for various minorities or to make criticism of the government more difficult by intimidating independent media. Sometimes, majorities oppose personal freedom flat out—such as in the case of disallowing religious freedom or the freedom to form legal relationships with whomever one wants (Berggren et al. 2017; Gouda and Gutmann 2020). Still, democracy comes in different forms, and it often goes hand in hand with what one might call “widening circles of inclusion”, which manifests itself in further formal and informal institutions that uphold generality in the treatment of citizens (Buchanan and Congleton 1998). This speaks in favor of democracy bringing about more personal freedom.Footnote 4 When it comes to judicial independence, it is regularly seen as a means to protect personal freedom against encroachment by political decision-makers. If the judicial system is independent of the political system, if it has constitutional authority to block legislative decisions that run counter to the constitution, if there are substantive stipulations of personal freedom in the constitution or in legislative practice, and if judges value personal freedom, there is good reason to expect judicial independence to favor personal freedom. However, some of these conditions may not be fulfilled and it is therefore anything but safe that judicial independence will further the protection of personal freedom.Footnote 5 It may also be that the specific combination of democracy and judicial independence affects personal freedom. For example, in the liberal tradition, it is often asserted that majoritarian rule risks becoming oppressive if the rulers are not constrained in some manner or form, e.g., by independent legal power. Popper (2013, p. 368) stresses this: Democracy cannot be fully characterized as the rule of the majority, although the institution of general elections is most important. For a majority might rule in a tyrannical way. (The majority of those who are less than 6 ft. high may decide that the minority of those over 6 ft. shall pay all taxes.) In a democracy, the powers of the rulers must be limited … 
Hence, although there are good reasons to expect an association between democracy and personal freedom, and between judicial independence and personal freedom, whether the relationship is in fact positive or negative, how strong it is and whether it is based on a combination of democracy and judicial independence, must be settled through empirical analysis. Against this background, our study uses a dataset spanning up to 162 countries to conduct a cross-sectional comparative analysis of the institutional foundations of personal freedom. We find clear indications of a positive and robust relationship between judicial independence and personal freedom, while democracy is not robustly associated with this type of freedom. When we study the interaction between democracy and judicial independence in order to test whether they are interdependent on each other in their effect on personal freedom, we find evidence that judicial independence is needed the most where there is the least electoral accountability, i.e., in political systems without elections or with only one political party. Overall, our findings should mitigate fears that electoral democracy erodes most types of personal freedom (perhaps more common on the political right), as well as fears that judicial independence does so (perhaps more common on the political left). If anything, the opposite seems to hold, especially for judicial independence.Footnote 6",9

Through the harmonization of the laws governing patent rights, the development of a single and unified market for innovation and technology is pursued. European countries have moved towards homogeneity by adjusting their national regimes under the roof of the Strasbourg Convention of 1963 and the European Patent Convention in 1973 (EPC).Footnote 1 Creating common standards across the internal market seeks to establish a level playing field.Footnote 2 A harmonized set of rules allow for an autonomous system of patent protection, hinging on substantive patentability requirements and the establishment of European patents. This effort towards harmonization, however, is undermined if the practices of the national courts systematically diverge.Footnote 3 Anecdotal evidence such as the Epilady litigation has raised doubt upon the success of said harmonization. Claiming that the company Remington had violated its patent through a device with the same function but different mechanism, Epilady launched infringement proceedings in several European countries. Whereas the courts in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands ruled in favor of the infringement, judges in Austria, France and the United Kingdom came to the opposite conclusion.Footnote 4 Disconcertingly, the courts had to interpret the same patent, operate under very similar facts and utilized a common standard of interpretation; yet they came to polar decisions.Footnote 5 Even under harmonized laws, national divergent interpretations remain possible.Footnote 6 The European Patent Office (EPO) offers a centralized examination procedure for the nowadays 38 member states of the European Patent Convention. Once granted, a European patent however requires to be validated at national level and moves in a country-by-country enforcement regime. Despite the harmonization efforts, enforcing a patent infringement lawsuit in Europe still occurs on a per-country basis. That is, proceedings in a national court can only be brought in respect to damages that occurred within that forum.Footnote 7 Previous practices by courts—especially in the Netherlands—to grant cross-border injunctions have been struck down or largely limited by the European Court of Justice.Footnote 8 Similarly, issues of patent validity, with the exception of the opposition before the EPO, are to be determined under the respective national law. Challenging the validity of a European patent in one country thus has effect for this specific national part of the European patent only. Beyond the costs of validation of patents,Footnote 9 the current system is characterized by the legal complexity for litigating parties to enforce their rights at the country level. In the event of a dispute, the enforcement of patents will be subject to a highly variable institutional set of enforcement rules, whose harmonization is far from complete. At the institutional court level, the dual German enforcement system—so-called bifurcation—dissociates infringement and validity claims which are heard by separate courts; in other countries both issues are tried by the same court. The cost structure for enforcing a patent in the United Kingdom (UK) is substantially higher compared to other countries.Footnote 10 Resultant of the difference in experience of judgment-making in patent cases, quality and speed of the courts diverge. A range of procedural provisions such as provisional measures, language of proceedings or rulings on evidence and the onus of proof characterize the individual states.Footnote 11 In terms of damages, the EU Enforcement Directive has harmonized the calculation methods, but variances in the amount of the level of damages across countries exists.Footnote 12 Important differences between European countries in terms of outcomes, share of appealed cases and characteristics of litigants and litigated patents have been revealed in the last years. The first large-scale empirical study of patent litigation was led by Graham and Van Zeebroeck (2014). Relying on a database of nearly 9000 patent lawsuits in the seven largest countries in the European Union, the authors showed that the incidence and base of judicial outcomes widely varied by country and by patented technology. A second empirical project by Cremers et al. (2016) furnished an exhaustive picture of the litigation landscape in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom by evaluating a dataset of hand-coded suits filed between 2000 and 2008. They found substantial differences across countries in terms of case loads and outcomes, and characteristics of both litigants and patents. In addition, several recent studies focused on patent enforcement in one particular jurisdiction, presenting evidence of a European landscape characterized by fragmentation and uncertainty for innovators, patent holders and their competitors.Footnote 13,Footnote 14 In examining the behavior of courts of different jurisdictions, case comparison is complicated by the differentiating subject-matter. Forum shopping enables entities to conduct a gamification of the system by acknowledging the odds of winning and competence of different courts. As such, simply contrasting win rates between two jurisdictions might not be sufficient. Nature of the cases tried by courts differ. Under a harmonized system, systematic differences in the likelihood of patents to be enforced with success should correspond to those characteristics. Put otherwise, patents with similar characteristics and similar strength should, in the limit, reach similar outcomes. By contrast, if the differences rely solely on the country of jurisdiction—and not on the characteristics of the underlying invention—the harmonization policy goal is not being achieved.Footnote 15 This would imply that traditions existing before the entry into force of the European Patent Convention have survived to some extent or that current policies diverge.Footnote 16 To study the extent of harmonization in Europe, this paper investigates the characteristics of patent disputes brought before the courts. We introduce a model that enables us to study patent litigation across countries, despite the selection effect. We propose a model where both litigation and settlement are driven by patent quality. We use patent quality as a novel and broadly laid out term that encapsulates both legal validity and economic value. Put differently, we assume that high quality patents are those with strong legal validity and/or high economic value. We assume that patent quality depends on both broadness and definiteness of the patent, whereby broadness relates to the scope of protection as defined by the patent’s claims and definiteness relates to the precision of these claims. Notably, patent definiteness is not a wholly separate factor to patent broadness, but rather the unobservable portion of patent broadness that sets out the borders of the patent’s claims. While we assume that patent broadness is measurable and certain, the patent definiteness is the unobservable and uncertain portion of the claims. In our model, patent holders and patent infringers decide before proceeding to court whether to settle or litigate based on differences in the perception of the patent’s quality, i.e. based on relative patent quality assessments. We assume that technology-specific differences in patent definiteness exist, leading to different settlement and litigation rates across technologies. Each agent makes his or her own estimation of the patent quality, whereby the patent’s definiteness is the factor which introduces heterogeneity in their estimation. If there is sufficient agreement, a settlement will be reached, otherwise the parties will proceed to trial. At trial, the divergent expectations of the parties are no longer material, it is rather the assessment of the absolute patent quality by the judge, i.e. the composite of both patent broadness and definiteness, which decides the outcome of the case. Notably, unlike the Priest and Klein (1984) model, we do not assume that either plaintiff or defendant is forming their respective expectation with respect to a common judicial standard of fault. This can be rationalized, as our institutional setting is the existing system of heterogeneous European patent courts, whereby patents can be litigated in multiple courts and held to different judicial standards. A limitation of our model is that factors such as misinterpretation or misinformation on the law or on case facts can be decisive in patent litigation. To overcome Priest and Klein (1984), we must assume that the error term, which results from noisy signals, is captured in our model by the patent definiteness factor. All information is captured by one quality expectation factor, which encapsulates the full information set available to parties. The model predicts that technologies where the patent definiteness attribute can be estimated with high accuracy will have higher settlement rates. Furthermore, according to the model, the absolute patent quality will be determinative of case outcome only at the litigation stage. Therefore, in contrast to Priest and Klein (1984), the model predicts that patent litigation cases where high quality patents are under dispute will have a higher probability of success and, thus, we expect to find higher win rates in our empirical dataset. In a perfect natural experiment, the study would focus on a large number of identical patent cases, litigated by the same patent holder and decided at the same moment in time in several jurisdictions, holding all other factors, such as legal expenses or personal characteristics of judges, constant. In the absence of such a stylized setting, running laboratory experiments where judges from different jurisdictions would decide on fictitious patent cases involving different technologies and industries would also allow us to investigate causal effects more directly. In contrast, empirical studies of patent litigation data, like the one presented within this paper, are always subject to considerable limitations. To address some of these concerns, our empirical analysis is guided by our theoretical model. This model suggests that the litigation parties’ divergent expectations of patent quality, broadness and definiteness, determine the population of cases heard in court. Within this initial selection, patent litigants do not form their expectations with respect to a common judicial standard of fault, as suggested by Priest and Klein (1984), but rather strategically select into different forums. The model contends that both patent case characteristics and heterogeneous judicial standards drive selection and case outcomes. Thus, the model makes patent case specific assumptions, which are subject to a number of limitations and may not be generalizable to other domains of the law. However, under this set of stark assumptions, we are able to draw empirical inferences at the patent litigation outcome level, in particular regarding differences across countries, technologies and industries. The paper utilizes empirical methods to investigate whether the characteristics of the patents or the country of litigation predict the outcome of litigation. Examination of the patent characteristics is conducted in line with our model, in that the patent quality, and underlying technology and industry are tested. After detailing our model in the theory section (Sect. 2), we formulate our hypotheses (Sect. 3). We then describe the build-up of the data and its coding (Sects. 4 and 5). Descriptive and empirical results (Sects. 6 and 7) are followed by the discussion and conclusion (Sects. 8 and 9).",2
50.0,1.0,European Journal of Law and Economics,10 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-020-09661-7,On the Application of Nash Bargaining in Reverse Payment Cases in the Pharmaceutical Industry,August 2020,Sencer Ecer,Rodrigo Montes,David Weiskopf,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Reverse payment settlements are agreements between branded drug manufacturers, which are typically patent-holding monopolists, and potential generic entrants to settle patent infringement litigation or the threat of such litigation.Footnote 1 A reverse payment settlement usually involves an agreed-upon generic entry date and one or more transfers of value among the settling parties, including for example, cash payments or an agreement by the branded company not to launch an authorized generic for a specified period of time in certain circumstances. Settlements of this nature could potentially harm consumers by delaying the entry of generic products that would compete against the brand (Edlin et al. 2013). A common approach for evaluating the potential harm to consumers is estimating the extent of delay that was caused by the reverse payment settlement. In other words, if the parties agree to an entry date with reverse payments, the alleged harm is a function of how much earlier the entry date would have been absent those payments (this implicitly assumes that a “no-payment” settlement could have been reached instead of the actual settlement). As part of the process of estimating the purported damages, it is natural to consider and perhaps attempt to model the negotiation process among the parties that ultimately led to the observed reverse payment settlement. The Nash bargaining solution (Nash 1950) is an alternative that can be used to model the outcome of the parties’ negotiations in reverse payment cases. The Nash bargaining solution is the most widely used axiomatic bargaining solution in economics. In general, an axiomatic bargaining problem has two elements: (1) a set of possible utility pairs that the parties can obtain through an agreement (“the bargaining set”) and (2) a specific point that captures the level of utility the parties would obtain if they fail to reach an agreement(“the disagreement point”) (Muthoo 1999).Footnote 2 Given these two elements, the Nash bargaining solution selects an outcome by satisfying a set of axioms that aim to represent the preferences of an “arbitrator who tries to distribute the gains from cooperation in a manner that reflects ‘fairly’ the bargaining strength of the different agents"" (Mas-Colell et al. 1995, p. 838).Footnote 3 The Nash bargaining solution may yield asymmetric utilities for parties due to the asymmetry of the bargaining set or the asymmetry in the utilities from the disagreement point. In the generalized Nash bargaining solution, however, there is an additional parameter that represents the bargaining power of the bargaining parties originating from any remaining sources such as the case of “longer waiting time after one party's offer than after the other's offer and the case of different beliefs concerning the probability of breakdown in the risk model” (Binmore et al. 1986, p. 179). It is this latter exogenous parameter that we call the bargaining power or strength of the bargaining parties.Footnote 4 The generalized Nash bargaining framework can therefore be considered as a way to better understand the bargaining process in reverse payment settlements. A standard allegation in litigation in this context is that a cash payment from the incumbent pharmaceutical company to a potential entrant was made in exchange for the generic firm not entering the market or delaying entry. In general, monopoly profits are greater than the sum of duopoly profits. As a result, a settlement with reverse payments may be more profitable for both parties because there is a larger “pie” of profits to be split if the monopoly is indeed prolonged. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initially sought to strongly deter reverse payment settlements (FTC 2002). Indeed, even an appellate court held that these agreements were per se illegal.Footnote 5 The FTC’s position was consistent with some of the early literature showing their potential for adverse effects on competition (Leffler and Leffler 2004; Ecer and Higgins 2004). However, since 2005 the appellate courts started to uphold these agreements.Footnote 6 The FTC continued to express deep concerns, especially when the purported payments exceed expected litigation costs (FTC 2010). Another strand in the literature shows that reverse payments higher than expected litigation costs may be justified based on risk aversion or asymmetric information (Shapiro 2003), risk of under-compensation of the patent holder (Langenfeld and Li 2003), ability to achieve welfare enhancing settlements (Willig and Bigelow 2004), and increasing the incentives to develop new generic drugs and investment in patent challenges by generic manufacturers (Dickey and Rubinfeld 2012). The thrust of this and related literature cautions against treating reverse payment patent settlements as per se illegal (Dickey et al. 2010; Meunier and Padilla 2015). Nonetheless, other papers propose a modified per se rule (Elhauge and Krueger 2012). The legal treatment of reverse payments from an antitrust perspective was addressed by the Supreme Court in 2013, which concluded that rule of reason treatment should be the legal standard (the Actavis decision).Footnote 7 In the wake of the Actavis decision, several papers have been written discussing the implementation and practical implications of the decision (see, e.g., Edlin et al. 2013; Harris et al. 2014). In a recent statement, the FTC noted that after Actavis, the number of settlements with reverse payments or with no-authorized generic commitments declined “precipitously,” even though pharmaceutical settlements increased in 2016 by more than 35% compared to 2015.Footnote 8 In this paper, we contribute to the use of bargaining models and related concepts in estimating the entry date of the generic firm in the absence of reverse payments (see, e.g., Ghili and Schmitt 2017 or Elhauge and Krueger 2012). In reverse payments matters, we typically observe the generic entry date in the actual world, but we do not observe the generic entry date in the absence of the reverse payment (that is, in the “but-for” world). In the textbook anticompetitive case, a delayed entry date brings lower expected profits to the entrant, and reverse payments are typically treated as a way to compensate the entrant for the lower profits. When the delay in entry is considered an antitrust concern, the modeling of an entry date in the absence of reverse payments may include a prohibition on reverse cash payments. In such a but-for world, the bargaining analysis is less straightforward because the parties are explicitly prohibited from giving or receiving monetary transfers. Consider a scenario where the monetary value of a reverse payment and the agreed upon entry date are both known to the antitrust authority. These two data points (in addition to profit data from the parties under monopoly and competition) allow the practitioner in charge of the investigation to calculate how the surplus was split according to the agreement. In such a case, the standard Nash bargaining framework allows the practitioner to estimate the bargaining power of the entrant and incumbent pharmaceutical company from the observed split of the surplus. Once the bargaining power is estimated by the antitrust authority, the generic entry date in a counterfactual settlement without the reverse payment can be estimated using the same data, under the condition that the split of the surplus in the but-for world is the same as when reverse payments were used by the parties. The logic of this approach appears to rest on the assumption that the bargaining skills or other firm-specific characteristics do not change when reverse payments cannot be used, and therefore the split of the surplus should remain the same. However, as we show below, this logic is flawed because bargaining power alone is no longer enough to characterize the split of the surplus when the incumbent and entrant bargain only over the generic entry date, even if it were true that the bargaining skills or the specific characteristics of the firms have not changed. In this paper, we discuss an approach to formulate the estimates of the patent holder’s and the entrant’s bargaining power in estimating the but-for entry date in reverse payment cases. We find that eliminating the possibility of cash payments in settlements disproportionately affects the shape of the bargaining set as the set is tilted in favor of the patent holder. This is because the entrant cannot access monopoly profits via transfers and must settle for lower competition profits. For the same reason, total profits are lower without reverse payments. Then, we show that if one applies the estimated bargaining power parameter from a settlement derived from the actual shares of the surplus with reverse payments to the but-for scenario where reverse payments are not allowed in the settlement, the estimated delay from the reverse payments would be overstated leading to higher damages for the entrant. The following section presents the basic model. Sections 3 and 4 study the case where reverse payments are permitted and where such payments are not permitted, respectively. Section 5 briefly concludes.",2

This statement is if anything even more apposite for transition economies, which may struggle in particular to enforce black letter rules through the court channel (Pistor et al. 2000). The existing survey-based evidence (see, e.g. World Bank 2018, CEPEJ 2018) together with the selected state court data approach (Murrell 2001; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. 2012, 2016) suggests that post-Communist countries have yet to succeed in establishing an efficient judiciary. This is a red flag indicator for trade and commerce, as the available literature shows a clear link between an inefficient judiciary and adverse effects for the national economy. Jappelli et al. (2005) presented evidence showing that it is significantly easier for a private business to obtain a loan in the regions in Italy where courts operate effectively. In addition, other studies (e.g. García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti 2015; Giacomelli and Menon 2013; Rajan et al. 2001) show that efficient courts have a positive impact on average firm size in a country, as they reduce transactional costs which in turn may be perceived as a barrier to corporate growth. The evident negative social consequences of an ineffective judiciary as well as the scarce rigorous court data literature prompted us to delve into this topic with regard to Poland. Research on the determinants of court performance has a long history. A key moment came in the 1950s with a groundbreaking study on the economic causes of backlog in the New York court system (Zeisel et al. 1959). Since then, economic analyses have developed markedly. In the late 1970s/early 1980s simple, one-dimensional techniques (focusing on single variables such as average length of court proceedings) were supplemented by multidimensional approaches that analysed the impact of various factors affecting court efficiency. These methods take a frontier or an average approach. The former can be divided into non-parametric and parametric methods. Nevertheless, it was undoubtedly the nonparametric models that forged ahead, inclining the economic literature toward parametric single- and multi-equation models. Our contribution to the existing literature is threefold. Firstly, we concentrate our research on one post-Communist country (Poland) which went through a successful transition from central planning to the market economy (Balcerowicz 2005). The Polish court system, in contrast, is perceived as slow and inefficient by the public (Kociołowicz-Wiśniewska and Pilitowski 2017), a view which is confirmed by comparative studies (CEPEJ 2018; European Commission 2018). Moreover, there is a general paucity of research on the efficiency—or otherwise—of the post-Communist judiciary in comparison to advanced economies (e.g. Priest 1989; Kittelsen and Førsund 1992; Pedraja-Chaparro and Salinas-Jimenez 1996; Buscaglia and Ulen 1997; Rosales-López 2008; Lindquist et al. 2007; Mitsopoulos and Pelagidis 2007; DiVita 2012; Christensen and Szmer 2012; Santos and Amado 2014; Castro and Guccio 2014; Falavigna et al. 2015; Espasa and Esteller-Moré 2015). Secondly, we simultaneously apply two different econometric methods: standard panel data models as well as one frontier model, namely stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The latter appears to be the scarcest in the literature (Castro 2009; Antonucci et al. 2014; Espasa and Esteller-Moré 2015). Thirdly, contrary to previous research (Beenstock and Haitovsky 2004; Dimitrova-Grajzl et al. 2012, 2016) we notice that judges do matter for court performance in some selected kind of cases. This finding relates in our opinion to the degree of aggregation of data on cases, since it appears essential to distinguish between different kinds of cases if we wish to make a proper assessment of the role judges play in determining court output. To the best of our knowledge it is one of the very few pieces of research which differentiates between cases in this vein and the first to estimate the production function for distinct case types. It is important with regard to the Polish judiciary at least, whereas specialised or auxiliary court staff can resolve non-trial cases within the court system, they can only provide support in trial cases, which must be resolved by a judge. The paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we provide a brief overview of literature covering determinants of court performance and court efficiency. In Sect. 3 we discuss in detail available data as well as the commercial court system in Poland. Section 4 presents our empirical data and results. We conclude in Sect. 5.",10

Big Data obviously transform the economic institutions of capitalism as we knew it into a sort of digital capitalism, changing the way in which information is produced and exchanged in the market. In a data driven economy, access to relevant information is dramatically decreased and so the dimension of transaction costs traditionally arising under various forms of asymmetric information, known as agency problems or post-contractual opportunism in incomplete contracts. Reduced transaction costs for accessing information are in turn expected to have an impact on the overall efficiency, reasonably positive, and to expand the aggregate dimension of market transactions relative to hierarchical transactions within institutions alternative to the market (such us vertically integrated firms, according to Coase’s (1981) and Williamson’s lesson on the role of the dimension of transactions costs in affecting decisions on “make versus buy”). On the other hand, reduced transaction costs on gathering relevant information in the market (and on monitoring economic transactions and behaviors) also affect contracting costs over the bundle of uses embedded in private property rights. Many algorithmic solutions to rent a car or a house show as it has become easier and cheaper to coordinate actions and bargaining over access to each use included in the bundle of rights in a way that minimizes rival uses. One feature of the so-called ‘sharing economy’ precisely entails such characteristic of property rights divisibility for the uses bundled in a property right (Demsetz 1967): once non-separable, several uses bundled in a property right may now be allocated by data driven algorithmic decisions and by artificial intelligence, in new space and time dimensions, so as to increase joint-uses and thus to enhance the value of property rights. All in all, in the big data economy, reduced transaction costs of accessing information are increasing the potential for improved efficiency, in terms of increased room for market transactions. This process implies that we should expect decentralized transactions to grow, i.e. more market, less hierarchy. At the same time, and somewhat for the same reasons, we would expect a growing size of algorithmic mediated transaction also for decisions in the public or juridical sphere: an example is the use of big data, artificial intelligence and algorithmic profiling in courts, as well as the adoption of blockchain technology to perform duties previously delegated to judges or public officials (notaries, lawyers and so on) (Ashley 2017; Medvedeva et al. 2020; Katz et al. 2017). However, the actual pattern in the global data driven economy is much more complex than one would expect. Indeed, the potential for ‘decentralization’ (in terms of the expected increase in the dimension of market transactions relative to hierarchical ‘vertical’ control) is actually coupled with a strong tendency toward market concentration, with the emergence of new global players acting as ‘platform intermediaries’, in multi-sided markets, precisely thanks to their ability in extracting and managing big data, through successful algorithmic processes. It seems as if the positive externalities generated by the reduction of transaction costs are actually appropriated by these big intermediaries rather than being released to the market as a public good. This dilemma between ‘decentralization’ on the one side and ‘concentration’ on the other is the main puzzle that the emergence of a big data driven economy is actually offering to law and economics scholars and to policy makers. The efficiency of platforms increases due to network effects and the value of data collected—which in turns improves the efficiency of algorithms and consumers’ welfare (in terms of reducing transaction costs). Thus, for a platform to be efficient, the expansion of the service’s scope and the extension of the markets served will be a natural evolutionary process, aimed at capturing a consumers’ attention and time under the promise of satisfying all their needs, through the platform’s gatekeeper role. As a consequence—under business as usual, i.e. absent any focused regulatory action—the spontaneous evolution of market forces will lead soon to structural changes in the traditional (and often locally based) vertical industry dynamics, inducing competition among (few) platforms for (many) global markets. This ongoing process has already raised many policy questions, sometimes driven by partisan attitudes pro or anti-platforms such as among others: do we care about this paradigmatic shift from traditional to digital (platform based) capitalism? Shall we apply traditional antitrust criteria and regulatory approaches to digital platforms, and their dominance over well-defined relevant product markets? Shall we instead change our perspective, given the benefits to consumers, who often pay lower (or even zero) prices for products and services implicitly exchanged for “attention”? Shall we consider big data a new entry barrier for many digital markets?Footnote 1 Shall we consider privacy-based inalienability rules for personal data or shall we build (and stimulate) a competitive market for data, even by defining clear property rights on our own data (“propertisation”)?Footnote 2 The debate is open and only at the begininnigs. Answers are complex as they entail many interdisciplinary dimensions at the intersection among antitrust, privacy, basic rights, free choice and communications regulation. One of the main points behind the debate concerns the relationships among platforms, big data and algorithms, as the value and impact of big data could not be properly assessed without taking into account the business model of the main digital platforms (and the apps downloaded by internet users), which, in turn, is based on the value and impact of algorithms. Machine learning processes require a large amount of data to improve their performance. This is the main reason why efficient global platforms need a large amount of big data to improve their predictive ability and implicitly exchange (zero priced) services for users’ data. Moreover, the efficiency of algorithms improves the matchmaking performance of the platforms over multisided markets, offering users “what they want”, but also helping programmatic advertisers to properly reach a segmented and profiled audience. What is more since prefrences are sometime malleable and psychological issues may affect consumer’s choice, as a long-lasting tradition has discussed in law and economics, they may also perturbe the freedom of choice.Footnote 3 The economic challenge here is how to provide good and efficient governance of the transition between the old and the new world. The laissez faire approach to platforms simply suggests that the evolution of digital capitalism should be governed by new (very light) rules (Evans and Schmalensee 2016). This means abandoning old paradigms (such as notions of dominance, market power, relevant market, monopolisation and so on) that would otherwise affect platforms at their core, as they would treat as “behaviour” what is, after all, just a business model performing both allocative and distributive efficiency—as consumers’ obtain a larger amount of services (included many traditional services offered by non-platform providers) at lower costs. On the opposite side, a prudential approach, based on the precautionary principle, contrasts the “new nirvana” of platform-based capitalism, on the basis of the social hidden costs in terms of monopolisation and “monopsonisation” of affected markets (included the job market), generated by these new global intermediaries, thanks to their ability to gather, control and exclusively use personal data (Stucke and Grunes 2016; Becker 2019).",20

Personalised pricing in online markets as exploitative abuse of dominance,December 2020,Marco Botta,Klaus Wiedemann,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The past decade has witnessed the rapid proliferation of new business models that mainly rely on the processing of large amounts of users’ data, commonly known as “big data”. Besides traditional personal data, such as gender, age and level of education, other information is essential for online platforms. In particular, past online purchases, geo-location, the list of web sites previously visited, as well as search queries are part of the data daily collected by online platforms. Such information is collected either directly from the users (i.e. when the latter log into the platform), or via cookies or purchased from data traders (Miller 2014, 43). Nowadays, algorithms can process millions of pieces of data, building personal profiles of individual consumers (OECD 2015, 26). In particular, via data mining, online platforms can “connect” different pieces of information in order to elaborate as detailed users’ profiles as possible and thus predict the consumers online behaviour. The platform can use this knowledge either to advertise a specific product to the consumer (i.e. targeting advertising), or to adjust the price to demand fluctuations in real-time (i.e. dynamic pricing) (Miller 2014, 46). Finally, the platform can rely on the collected data to persuade the consumer to buy a certain product by offering a special discount or purchase conditions (e.g. exemption from the payment of the delivery costs of the product); a “special” price not necessarily offered to other customers. “Personalised pricing” is, therefore, a logical consequence of the large amount of personal data collected by online retailers and of the new possibilities algorithms and data mining offer (Shiller 2014). While personalised pricing is considered a new business practice in digital markets, this conduct brings up a number of questions under EU competition law. In particular, Art. 102(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) sanctions dominant companies which “apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage”. “To discriminate or not to discriminate” is thus the Hamletic dilemma that several online platforms are currently facing, divided between new business opportunities offered by big data analytics and the possible sanctions under EU competition law. The paper discusses this dilemma by looking at three interrelated research questions: first of all, the paper analyses the impact of personalised pricing on the consumers’ welfare by looking at recent economic theories in this field. Secondly, the paper discusses the enforcement challenges that a National Competition Authority (NCA)/the European Commission would face in investigating a case of personalised pricing under Art. 102(c) TFEU. In Sect. 4, the paper analyses the recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in MEO (Case C-525/16), in order to understand the impact of this ruling on the assessment of personalised pricing under Art. 102(c) TFEU. Finally, the paper compares antitrust remedies to the solutions provided by EU data protection and consumer law to tackle the issues related to personalised pricing in digital markets. In particular, the paper discusses the hypothesis that an NCA/the European Commission might be well advised to look at data protection law principles when designing behavioural remedies: limits on profiling and the obligation to share customers’ data with competitors, for instance, would reduce the risks involved in personalised pricing. Similarly, in line with EU consumer law acquis, transparency requirements and opt-out rights concerning personalised pricing could represent suitable remedies to limit the negative effects of personalised pricing on consumers’ welfare. Economists traditionally differentiate between forms of price discrimination that harm a rival (“primary line injury”) and those that harm a direct customer of the firm (“secondary line injury”). In this paper, we look exclusively at the “exploitative” dimension of personalised pricing by dominant online retailers vis-à-vis final consumers—i.e. secondary line of injury. Finally, in this paper we only assess personalised pricing as a possible “abuse” of dominance. On the other hand, we do not look at the issue of relevant market definition, which has extensively been discussed in the literature on multi-sided markets (e.g. Graef 2015; Filistrucchi et al. 2013; Rochet and Tirole 2006). Similarly, we do not analyse the market power of online platforms, since a number of authors have already discussed whether the accumulation of large amounts of data (i.e. big data) may represent an entry barrier, and thus a source of market power for online platforms (e.g. Rubinfeld and Gal 2017; Schepp and Wambach 2016; Lianos and Motchenkova 2013). The paper contributes to the on-going discussion about the implications of personalised pricing for competition policy (e.g. OECD 2015, 2018, White House 2015). In particular, it contributes to this debate by putting forward (in Sect. 5) a number of ideas on possible behavioural remedies that a competition agency could adopt in order to minimize the negative effects of personalised pricing. Finally, the paper is relevant in view of the provisions contained in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR Reg. 2016/679), applicable since 25 May 2018. This contribution thus raises a number of questions regarding the interaction of EU competition, consumer and data protection law.",15

In such cases, the firm’s (or, seller’s) bankruptcy proceedings begin before they make the delivery, thus hindering the delivery despite the customer having already paid the agreed-upon price while the seller was still solvent. In this situation, the legislators must determine the party that takes priority over the undelivered item—the seller’s creditor(s) or the customer. The legal variant of this problem has been debated among lawyers within different jurisdictions. Under the contract principle (also called the consensus principle), the buyer is given priority over the seller’s other creditors.Footnote 1 Since there is a valid contract, and provided the item is specified, the bankruptcy estate must give the buyer priority for the item. In this case, the item is not considered part of the bankruptcy estate. Conversely, under the ‘traditio’ principle (also called the delivery principle) the buyer is protected only if the delivery has already happened.Footnote 2 If the delivery has not been made, the estate will most likely fulfil the contract since the estate usually prefers to get the full price in exchange.Footnote 3 In cases where the delivery has not been made but the buyer has already paid (all or part of the price), the bankruptcy estate may refuse to deliver the item, and rather re-sell it. In this situation, it is possible for the original buyer to re-purchase the item, but she would have to pay once again. This is because the bankruptcy estate does not have to repay the prepayment since the recovery claim for the prepayment is treated as any other credit claim. Since the buyer is not among the prioritised creditors, she (or he) will, at most, receive a dividend of her (first) payment. This study is framing the problem described above as a problem of competing claims for priority. The main question raised in this study queries whether policymakers should favour the principle that prioritises buyers with valid contracts for the undelivered items or the principle that treats such buyers as equal to other unsecured creditors. These two principles have been adopted differently in various jurisdictions; see Sect. 2, and lawyers and policymakers require that the answer to the question of which principle should be favoured be based on economic reasons.Footnote 4 An advanced purchase (a forward transaction), where the price at which the product will be sold is an outcome of a bargaining process between the buyer and the seller, requires prior agreement between these parties. Such transactions are common among solvent businesses. However, if a company becomes insolvent after such a contract is made but before the product is delivered, bankruptcy laws take effect and claims to the undelivered product become an issue. Our model focuses on the ex ante decision-making behaviour of creditors, buyers, and investors in such an occurrence. We adhere to the creditor’s bargaining theory (Jackson 1982; Baird and Jackson 1984; Baird 2017; Casey 2019) and demonstrate how a fictive change in an ex post legal principle will be priced and affect the ex ante bargaining of the different actors with competing claims (Bebchcuk and Fried 1996). We consider that the actors with stronger claims under the bankruptcy will be charged ex-ante fees by other claimholders. There are numerous empirical observations of such ‘adjusting’ creditors. For instance, a new priority law was introduced in Finland in 1993, through which, secured creditors who, before the law changed had a floating charge that gave them 100% priority on their collateral, now enjoyed partial priority. The reduced secured creditor’s priority was not found to lead to an increase in the post-bankruptcy value to be distributed among the creditors; neither did it reduce the cost of bankruptcy [Bergström et al. (2004), compare with Cerqueiro et al. (2016), for the later Swedish example.] Another example is the study by Kale and Shahrur (2007), which shows a significant negative relationship between a firm’s debt level and its relationship-specific investments by customers and suppliers. A low debt level acts as a commitment mechanism that induces suppliers and customers to adjust and undertake relationship investments. Similarly, studying the auctions of used cars, Hortacsu et al. (2013) find that customers discounted the price of the cars sold by distressed firms and the future expected loss of valued ‘amenities’ reduced the consumer´s willingness to pay. These examples show that it is not only professional creditors like banks that adjust to how insolvent company assets will be distributed; even so-called non-adjusting, or involuntary creditors (Baird and Jackson 1984; Bebchcuk and Fried 1996), change their a priori valuations. We differ from the vast economic literature on value distribution and bankruptcy in that they mainly focus on how well different bankruptcy systems facilitate the transfer of assets to their most productive uses (e.g. Hotchkiss 1995; Maksimovics and Phillips 1998; Hotchkiss et al. 2007; Bernstein et al. 2018). These empirical economic studies that compare different legal regimes tend to be limited to comparisons between US Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 experiences. For example, Pulvino (1998) shows that the financial conditions of an airline determine the price the airline receives when selling aircrafts, and this reflects the risk that, during bankruptcy procedures, the airline’s assets may end up at low-value buyers (e.g. Schleifer and Vishny 1992). Similar to the literature on adjusting creditors, Pulvino suggests that his results may have effects on financial leverage and the cost of capital. In a later study, Pulvino (1999) finds that transaction prices are the same in Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcies. A related measurement issue that arises from this relates to how the costs of financial distress are measured. Following Altman (1984, 1993), the practice is to measure financial distress as the difference between the pre-distress market value of a firm minus its post-bankruptcy value minus the gross value recovered by the claimholder (see also Franks and Torous 1994; Branch 2002; Bris et al. 2006). Here, we highlight the importance of interpreting the performance of a legal system correctly (see Sect. 2.3). For instance, if one looks at the advance prices paid in the two systems and finds that the contract regime prices for the advance purchases are higher than those in the traditio regime, it would be erroneous to conclude that the contract regime is economically more profitable to the seller using a proper measure. We show that the higher advance price in the contract regime is compensated for by the reduced pre-bankruptcy risk and, hence, a reduced cost of credit. Looking at only one or the other would be misleading. The more relevant matter is how the priority regime (contract or traditio) affects the decision to invest, the generation of total economic surplus, and its distribution. When it comes to earlier legal research on which principle should be favoured, we refer to Sect. 2 of this paper. Within the issue of legal systematics, there are legal studies on which principle is the better choice. In the joint research project for the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR, edited by von Bar and Clive 2010), the Study Group on a European Civil Code had such an ambitionFootnote 5 and chose the traditio regime.Footnote 6 Interestingly, part of their method was to vote among some of the researchers.Footnote 7 This is not entirely remarkable since the issue was also about a central feature of the entire system of the regulation. Some lawyers consider the systematic aspect of the issue to be the most important aspect.Footnote 8 In another legal and economic study concerning a jurisdiction that uses the traditio principle, it was found that the economic efficiency of traditio could be questioned, although the researcher found no suitable way to empirically measure the effects (Henriksson 2009, compare Henriksson 2015). For the same jurisdiction, numerous legal studies on which principle is superior also exist.Footnote 9 Our results show that if the priority regimes are known a priori, then the market will price each regime differently and in a way that makes the players indifferent about the regimes. Thus, even though the price of credits may differ between the two regimes, the ex-ante expected surplus would be the same. The pricing differences that occur balance the additional surplus that one gets from a favourable post-bankruptcy priority regime, by reducing the surplus that would have been obtained had a bankruptcy not occurred. The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the legal context and intrigue of the problem under study from a lawyer’s perspective. Section 3 develops the study’s basic economic model and the resolution thereof for each of the two priority regimes. Section 4 discusses the economic implications of each regime for variables like interest rate and the advance price, and Sect. 5 concludes the study.",

Without music there would be no aria. Nevertheless, composers’ compensation is, in most cases, only a small part of the budget for an opera production. However, the composer, in contrast with performers, has an advantage in the ability to reap such tiny income from simultaneous performances in several theatres. Moreover, there will be revenues for all future performances during the composers’ lifetime and, presently, for 70 years in the future for their heirs. The sum of miniscule performing right revenues may be considerable. Much has been written about the ‘small right’ form of performing right, especially from around a decade ago when the debate on copyright piracy peaked (for instance: Liebowitz 2005, 2008, 2010; Zentner 2006; Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf 2007; Andersen and Frenz 2010; Albinsson 2013a). However, opera royalties are excluded from the ‘small right’ as the latter only applies to ‘nondramatic performances’ (which is the term used, for instance, in U.S. Code Title 17. Copyrights). For dramatic performing rights, the term ‘grand right’ (GR) is used. It is this kind of per performance royalty that is the focus of this study. The author has found only one previous—and very recent—article concerned with the GR specifically: Cuntz’s ‘Grand rights and opera reuse today’ (2020). Cuntz finds ‘that changes in copyright status increase the total number of performances that individual works receive on stage once copyright expires’. Furthermore, he provides ‘preliminary evidence on chilling, long-term effects of status around premiering operas and revivals at the beginning of the copyright term’. This is, however, a comment regarding the present situation in opera house programming. As we shall see, the Paris Opera programming was the exact opposite during the nineteenth century. The author finds it slightly surprising that GR is more or less unaccounted for in Agid and Tarondeau’s (2006) book on the Paris Opera and in their multi-opera comparative study (2011). The former mentions, in passing, the 1713 règlements with a clause on the remuneration of authors (including composers), but nothing else regarding this topic. The details of the 1713 règlements will be discussed below. Annunziata and Colombo’s (2018) Law and Opera compilation contains 25 chapters contributed by many different authors. None even slightly deals with GR. The recent article by Giorcelli and Moser (2019) about the effects of French copyright on operatic creativity in the parts of Italy under Napoleonic rule does not include GR, although it is the intellectual property rights method peculiar to the opera stage. They find ‘first, … that the adoption of copyrights led to a significant increase in the number of newly created operas. Second, copyrights raised the quality of new operas, measured both by their immediate success and by their longevity. Third, there were no benefits from copyright extensions beyond the life of the original creator.’ It could be argued that these conclusions regarding some Italian provinces are relevant to Paris during the studied period as well. Presented below are details regarding performing rights royalties—the kind of information that Giorcelli and Moser’s paper lacks. A paper by Cancellieri and Turrini (2016) presents nine hypotheses regarding the way in which economics and policies affect the programming strategies of opera houses—none of which deals with GR. Sudhanva Deshpande (2009) claims that ‘experience suggests that copyright is designed to protect corporate profits rather than artists’ creativity. It is imperative for artists and theatre people to work out alternatives to copyright ….’ This seems to be a futile wish as copyright, the performing rights in music in particular, provides an ever-increasing number of jobs and massive tax revenues from commercial mass culture companies and their employees. Hence, this study takes GR as a given legal condition. This was certainly the case during the studied period. As this study provides information on a little-researched field, it seems that it is ‘a first’. The information that it provides is detailed but limited to one particular domain, that of the GR system in the Paris Opera in the nineteenth century. Before GR, composers could receive an income on their operas from: employment by a royal or aristocratic household or a theatrical entrepreneur lump sum: public and private ex-ante grant, commission fee, or ‘Gegenverehrung’, that is, a reciprocal veneration – a token of gratitude for a dedication in a score (Pohlmann 1962, 137). the net box office takings for one or more, in rare cases, ‘benefit concerts’ ex-post awards or ‘blue-sky-prizes’ for operas found to be of high enough quality to be performed (Scotchmer 2004. ch. 2.3 and 2.5). Sometimes composers were given bonuses after a sufficiently large number of performances publication fees from publishers of printed scores and parts The lump sums received by composers may have depended on the number of planned performances. Yet, the compensation was still not based on an actual performing right system. The Paris Opera seems to have been the first to remunerate composers for each performance on a tariff basis. It is the presentation of the unique tariff system applied by the Paris Opera that is the new contribution of this study. The presentation is based on the collection of a multitude of primary, historical data. After the introduction of performing rights, composers could reap income from concerts and opera productions. Furthermore, copyright regulations have been expanded by every new technological innovation (Albinsson 2013b): performing right—grand right royalty. This can be included in the commission fee, if any, but can, alternatively, be negotiated separately. The GR is negotiated for every single opera production by the composer or a publisher. performing right—small right royalty. Applies when the whole or parts of the opera is performed non-dramatically, i.e. in concerts, or broadcasted or streamed. The small performing right is licensed through the ‘blanket’ use of all music covered by a royalty collecting association. In most countries, there is a single such collector—SACEM in France. Mechanical rights—apply to the sale of recorded tangible items, mainly vinyl, CD or DVD. The study of GR is hampered by the fact that most music theatre companies are private entities and so little has been archived; however, the affairs of opera companies run within the realm of state budgets have fared better. In some cases, their archives are extensive. The aim of this paper is to investigate the financial effects of the tariff-based GR used by the Paris Opera, now the Opéra national de Paris, in the nineteenth century. Although the GR is the paper’s main focus, other kinds of income are mentioned as historical examples. The absolute worth over time (rather than the relative worth) from Rodney Edvinsson’s on-line historical currency converter is used for present-day comparisons in this study.Footnote 1 More precisely, Edvinsson has estimated the quantity of consumer goods and services that x French francs in year y could buy in Sweden, his home country, in 2015. How much could the prescribed royalties buy when they were paid? A baguette and a bottle of wine are essential and historical ingredients on French household menus. In 1855, a kilogram of white bread cost 0.40 francs and a litre of wine cost 0.55 francs (Sabot 2012, 34). Costs for specific items directly related to composers in this study have not been found with the exception of Meyerbeer’s rent for the flat on Rue neuve St. Augustin, 49, which in 1842 was 270 francs per month (Becker and Becker 1975, 410).",

This is why most legal regimes in history have had implicit or explicit forms of incentives for whistleblowers. However, explicit and structured financial incentives for whistleblowers, while increasingly popular in the US, are viewed with skepticism in Europe (see Nyreröd & Spagnolo, 2021).Footnote 1 Disagreement in the policy debate touches many aspects, but one argument frequently put forward by opponents of such schemes is that they are rendered ineffective by the many false reports that a prospect of a reward will prompt.Footnote 2 This, however, does not seem to have been a major issue in the US, where the agencies administering some of these schemes argue that they are game-changers that dramatically increase detection rates.Footnote 3 Indeed, the long and successful US experience with the False Claim Act demonstrates that the potential problems engendered by the risk of false reports can be addressed. The risk that high-powered incentives lead to many fabricated accusations can be controlled directly through more severe sanctions against defamation, perjury and information fabrication.Footnote 4 It could also be controlled by the adoption of a stricter standard of proof by courts that evaluates information coming from witnesses who stand to gain from a conviction, an effect that may offset the reward-driven incentive to forge information, at the cost of a lower conviction rate.Footnote 5 Alternatively, it could be controlled by lowering or capping the rewards for whistleblowers. Moreover, the accuracy of the legal system is likely to play an important role. The interesting question is how to combine these tools to design an effective program. In this paper we tackle this question. We develop a model that focuses on the interaction between financial rewards for whistleblowers, sanctions for reporting false/fabricated information (perjury, defamation), judicial errors, and standards of proof in two court cases: one based on a whistleblower’s allegations and a potentially consequent one against a whistleblower accused of fraudulent reporting false/fabricated information. We use the model first to shed light on the trade-offs involved and to characterize an effective whistleblower program, i.e. a program that minimizes the occurrence of illegal behavior. Our results show that to design an effective reward program it is crucial to find an appropriate balance between the reward offered to successful whistleblowers and the sanctions against those convicted for knowingly reporting false information. Given other parameters, a balanced ratio between these two parameters is the crucial tool that can lead to an effective program, suggesting that sufficiently severe sanctions against whistleblowers convicted of forging information are necessary in order to compensate for large rewards. When taking into account retaliation from employers and the fact that protection from retaliation is necessarily incomplete (not all forms of retaliation can be observed by a court), we show that there is a minimum size of the reward, below which whistleblowing will not take place at all, independent of the ratio mentioned above. In these cases, the reward must substantially exceed the sanction imposed on a mendacious whistleblower the more so the larger the risk that a firm will retaliate and the weaker the whistleblower protection. The choice of the standard of proof is also crucial. Given the level of accuracy, an overly strict standard of proof, with very few false positives and therefore many false negatives, induces potential whistleblowers to never report and the firm to always commit wrongdoing. Similarly, when the standard of proof is too low, the many false positives induce potential whistleblowers to always blow the whistle, whether or not the firm is guilty, again leading to more illegal acts. The standard of proof must therefore be chosen with due care to avoid turning these schemes into failures. Improving courts’ accuracy—which reduces both types of error—is the only policy with unambiguously positive effects in terms of relaxing the constraints for a whistleblower reward scheme to be effective. From a short-run perspective (in which the level of accuracy of the judiciary cannot be modified), our results imply that whistleblowing reward schemes are useful instruments only when the court system is sufficiently precise, and that they are not likely to perform as one would hope in environments with weak institution, where court precision is low. The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the related literature. Section 3 presents the baseline model and Sect. 4 the related results. Section 5 considers two separate and potentially different trials: one where the firm is judged for illegal behavior, and another where the employee is judged for filing a false case. Section 6 briefly concludes.",3

Evidence from two Italian prisons,August 2021,Lucia Dalla Pellegrina,Margherita Saraceno,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Prison organisation and life conditions of inmates are relevant for the design of effective policies able to deter crime and recidivism, while favouring prisoners’ rehabilitation and social (re)inclusion.Footnote 1 Although usually associated with some (marginal and questionable) increase in deterrence,Footnote 2 poor prison conditions may represent violations of civil and human rights of the inmates,Footnote 3 and even imply costs outweighing benefits (Hagan & Dinovitzer, 1999). In particular, scholars point towards poor prison conditions being criminogenic, favouring both recidivism (Andersen, 2015; Drago et al. 2011; Mastrobuoni & Terlizzese, 2014; Nillson, 2003), and radicalisation (Mulcahy et al. 2013). Besides deterrence and incapacitation (Chalfin & McCrary, 2017), imprisonment causes marginality and social exclusion among inmates, ex-inmates, and their families.Footnote 4 Imprisonment in itself, and especially in poor conditions, is a gateway to homelessness (Dyb, 2009); insurgence/deterioration of substance abuse, mental problems, and chronic diseases (Jakobi, 2005); disruption/deterioration of romantic relationships and family connections (Apel, 2016; Christian et al. 2006); and social exclusion of relatives (Besemer & Dennison, 2019; Lee et al., 2016). There is evidence that imprisonment significantly reduces both after-release employment and activity rates and incomes of ex-prisoners (Aaltonen et al., 2017; Bäckman et al., 2018). Furthermore, incarceration seems to be a driver for reinforcing inequalities in the labour market, education, health, families, and even for the intergenerational transmission of inequality (Wakefield & Uggen, 2010). Conversely, the literature on procedural justice suggests that granting a just and decent treatment during imprisonment to the inmates can result in reduced recidivism (Beijersbergen & Dirkzwager, 2016). In this framework, surprisingly, very little attention has been paid to a specific adverse effect of imprisonment: the reduced—or even nullified—capability of prison inmates to manage their legal needs.Footnote 5 Inmates are in a paradoxical position of being within the (criminal) justice system while experiencing systematic obstacles to access justice for issues other than their criminal case.Footnote 6 Because of restrictions on freedom, they face relevant limitations in their actual legal capability and difficulties in managing their legal needs.Footnote 7 This represents a serious problem of fairness and equity, but also frustrates the rehabilitation purposes of punishment, finally increasing the social costs of imprisonment.Footnote 8 This study is a first attempt to fill this gap. It provides evidence emerging from a survey aimed at mapping both the legal problems and resolution attitude of inmates in two Italian correctional facilities located in Milan: San Vittore and Bollate. The survey was carried out in 2014 within a peer setting operational framework where some selected interviewer-inmates administered the questionnaires to their prison mates. The resulting original dataset collects micro-data from about just under 900 inmates. We use for the first time this survey dataset to empirically investigate how both institutional/organisational features of the hosting facility and inmates’ individual features affect the likelihood of solving legal problems they had at the moment of incarceration. In particular, we exploit the introduction of the open-cell regime to identify the effects of fewer restrictions in the everyday life in prison on the inmates’ effectiveness in managing and resolving legal issues. According to this regime generally applied in Italy starting from 2014, prisoners are free to move within the prison for a relatively long time during the day, thereby accessing internal infrastructures, undertaking social relations, and—most importantly—accessing prison facilities. Descriptive statistics suggest that imprisonment in itself represents an obstacle to the access to justice to fundamental rights and citizenship; it also strongly limits the possibility of managing and resolving legal issues that typically emerge in the areas of family law, private law, and administrative procedures. We performed logit regressions to estimate whether the introduction of the open-cell regime is associated with changes in the solution rate of inmates’ existing problems at the time of incarceration. We use backward stepwise techniques to select the most relevant problems faced by the inmates, those that are more easily solved since the introduction of the open-cell system, and the relevant individual characteristics affecting problem resolution. Results suggest that the establishment of the open-cell regime is likely to increase the rate of problem resolution, specifically of issues that require more ‘standardised’ resolution procedures, such as divorce, child custody, and problems with the public administration. However, more complicated and ‘individual-specific’ disputes, such as those related to legacy and contract liability, do not benefit from inmates’ greater freedom. We will discuss relevant policy implications in favour of a wider and more effective implementation of the open-cell regime. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.

They provide both news content and a forum for political discussion. Citizens are enabled to participate in the political discourse, which potentially enhances the quality of their political decisions (Siebert et al., 2000). The political news media thus also contribute to the political education of its readers, viewers or listeners. The political news media also serve a watchdog function by helping control the political system. Empirically, it has been shown that free media contribute to the achievement of several social desiderata, such as economic development (Leeson & Coyne, 2007), social capital (Dutta & Roy, 2013), government effectiveness (García-Sánchez et al., 2016), voter turnout and the number of candidates running for office Schulhofer-Wohl and Garrido (2012). A crucial factor for the effective fulfillment of the democratic tasks of the political press is an adequate level of journalistic quality, which is defined via objective criteria in the relevant literature. Crudely summarized, these criteria relate to good and diverse information: truth and correctness, relevance, neutrality, impartiality, immediacy, and diversity (Westerdahl, 1983). Because such criteria are difficult to measure, empirical research dealing with quality of newspapers often refers to size of the newsroom or the average number of news pages as proxies to measure quality (see for instance Pattabhiramaiah et al., 2018, 102). For the sake of clarity, note that this definition of journalistic quality is silent regarding political positioning of the media outlet. Both liberal or conservative media can provide high levels of journalistic quality.Footnote 1 Accordingly, while media bias and reduced journalistic quality may often go hand in hand empirically, they are not necessarily related. The framework I employ in the following abstracts from different dimensions of quality such as media bias, slanting or fake news by design, and assumes that journalistic quality can be aggregated to a specific level, similar to an index.Footnote 2 Assuring an environment in which firms or other players providing society with political news and background of high journalistic quality is of social importance. Such an environment most importantly includes an adequate legal and regulatory framework on which the actors can rely. Many societies, above all Western societies, tend to rely on the market as allocation mechanism. The uninterfered working of supply and demand should guarantee the provision of journalistic quality. This perspective leads to media firms being restricted by competition law, for instance in many EU countries or the USA.Footnote 3 Regulation under competition law should help prevent anti-competitive deeds and market concentration (Garcia-Pires, 2017). In practice, this for instance implies that mergers among media firms have to be cleared by the authorities, who have to estimate the effects of these mergers on the competitive environment. Typically, if the market power of the merging firms would become too large (however defined by the authorities), mergers would be prohibited. Similarly, cooperation by media firms may be restricted if the firms involved share significant market power.Footnote 4 Against this background, a recent German legislation appears as a crack in the prevailing dogma. With the ninth reform to the competition act, some forms of cooperation by media publishers were explicitly excluded from competition law. The new legislation allows press companies to market their titles jointly or coordinate prices. Further, the threshold of joint revenues beyond which mergers have to be approved by the Federal Cartel Office was more than doubled for broadcasters, from 25 million EUR to 62.5 million EUR. The extent of the exemption is admittedly rather restricted. Nevertheless, its introduction implies that the German legislature recognizes the press to provide a special market which calls for different treatment. This raises the question what exactly might be special about the market for political news media as compared to other industries. The relatively little empirical evidence on the effect of market power on journalistic quality is less clear than it might appear. For instance, analyzing the US newspaper market in the years 1993, 1999 and 2004, George (2007) found that the number of topics covered per geographic region and the differentiation among papers has increased with ownership concentration. In the terms introduced above, this contributed to journalistic quality by offering more diversity. In contrast, Fan (2013) simulated negative effects on quality of a hypothetical merger between two newspapers in Minneapolis, which was actually blocked by the authorities. The simulation was based on data in the US market for daily newspapers between 1997 and 2005, which included a variety of information on newspaper characteristics. In this paper, I offer a structural argument to address the question whether market power in the market for political news may have positive consequences for the media’s provision of journalistic quality, as specified above. By design, the argument aims to understand how changes in market power may affect quality. In other words, it is silent regarding absolute values of journalistic quality. I suggest an answer based on the understanding that not all consumers share a preference for more journalistic quality.Footnote 5 More specifically, based on the finding that demand for specific outlets correlates with educational attainment and political knowledge,Footnote 6 I argue that demand for quality is characterised by what might be termed consumption capital in a wide sense. While consumption capital in the original sense, as introduced by Becker and Stigler (1977), describes cases where the utility deriving from consumption of a good increases when the same good has been consumed previously, the increase in utility in the case of political news media derives from an increase in knowledge of the wider environment of consumtion in the case of political news. Based on this understanding, I construct a demand function characterized by different tastes for journalistic quality.Footnote 7 On the supply side, I assume the market for political news media is characterised by monopolistic competition. The major finding of this exercise is that, if consumers sufficiently value high quality, market power may be positively associated with the provision of journalistic quality. Hence, an increase in market power could raise the level of journalistic quality of each media firm. The logic underlying this result is the following: Consumers who have a sufficiently high willingness to pay for quality will not be deterred by price increases. Thus, an increase in market power gives firms a larger feasible price range. By increasing the level of quality, they may attract consumers with a large preference for quality and simultaneously increase their prices (beyond the cost increase induced by the change in quality), thereby increasing their profits. To avoid misunderstandings, it appears helpful to clarify the terminology employed before proceeding. The term political news media is used synonymous for any firm offering political news to customers. While this understanding transcends several different markets, e.g. the market for newspapers, online media or TV stations, I implicitly consider these markets to be separate. Hence, my focus lies on the markets for (separate) media, not the market for information. Hence, while substitutes are admittedly relevant for the consumers’ choice of a specific news outlet, e.g. online platforms or newspapers, the present argument starts from the assumption that consumers have chosen to read newspapers. It should further be stressed that the results do not imply that monopolies or market power per se are beneficial regarding their provision of journalistic quality. All that is shown is that, given a number of differentiated newspapers, an increase in market power may lead to an increase of quality. Whether the initial level of quality is high or low, a fact which might be explained by overly powerful firms, is not addressed.Footnote 8 In the following Sect. 2, I support the hypothesis that the demand for political press is characterized by systematic differences in readership before formally modeling the market for political press in Sect. 3. A concluding discussion closes the paper.",1

The original article has been corrected. The correct abstract is given below: After a long period of economic and legal transition, new institutions emerged in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Firms facing financial difficulties must cope with the quality of those institutions. This study investigates the association between the institutional environment and a firm’s recovery from financial distress. Our analysis relies on a sample of 823 CEE listed firms subject to financial difficulties over the period from 2004 to 2017. After controlling for the endogeneity of institutional quality and financial features, dynamic panel estimates confirm that increased anticorruption efforts contributed to restoring the financial health of CEE firms. By reducing costs resulting from bribes and bureaucracy, efficient anticorruption mechanisms can facilitate firm efforts to overcome financial distress. In addition, several CEE countries created anticorruption agencies, mainly prior to the financial crisis or at the beginning of the postcrisis period. This may partially explain why anticorruption institutions were able to produce positive externalities. The development and independence of such agencies should be highly encouraged in CEE, as financially distressed firms may benefit from anticorruption policies.",

Wulf,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper we present a theoretical and empirical analysis of different consumer protection rules in the European Union in case of the premature repayment of a mortgage credit. We focus on how a right to prematurely repay a long-term fixed interest consumer credit without paying any or only a capped damage compensation to the creditor  affects consumer welfare. Our contribution is twofold. Our analysis of the effects of consumers' right to early repayment on European mortgage markets and mortgage interest rates is novel and points to adverse effects. If this consumer protection allows debtors to repay their long-term fixed interest rate credit after interest rates fall but before the contract ends, the debtor can take out a new loan at a lower interest rate and makes a windfall profit as a consequence of the protection. For risk averse debtors this can lead to less consumer welfare compared with the consumer welfare under the traditional contract law rule of expectation damages for breach of contract. We show, that this adverse effect can outweigh the benevolent insurance function of this right. This insurance function of the right exists, if after contract conclusion but before the contract ends the real estate is not needed anymore for consumption and goes on sale, because the consumer or somebody in her household dies, gets a divorce, moves to another city or in general if the real estate is not any longer beneficial to the consumer, because a personal risk of live materializes. To avoid high damage compensation in such a case the consumer is typically willing to pay the necessary mark up on the interest rate, which must be higher than under a rule of expectation damages for breach of contract. The typical consumer has however no willingness to pay for the costs of a mandatory rule, which entitles her to replace an old high interest rate credit by a new low interest rate credit. Second, we analyze in an empirical cross-country study on European mortgage markets with data for 23 EU Member States from 2005 to 2017 how the different national consumer protection laws affect mortgage interest lending rates, and interest rate spreads. The starting point for our empirical study is a comprehensive comparative law research on the different levels of protection for early repayments in the EU Member States (see Sect. 4). Based on this data we construct a consumer protection index for early repayments in different EU Member States (see Table 4). The index classifies all Member States in three categories according to the kind of compensation, if any, that consumers must pay to their lenders if they decide to repay their mortgages before the contractual due date. The level of consumer protection is not uniform under EU Law. The Mortgage Credit Directive (European Parliament & Council, 2014) is on this dimension a skeleton law, which gives discretion to Member States to legally entitle their national banks to either negotiate a price for the premature ending of the credit contract, or charge full expectation damages, or to allow early repayment without any damage compensation, or to cap the damage award. The latter includes legal regimes, in which the bank can only charge additional administrative expenses incurred by early repayments. Among others, Italy, France and Spain have a high level of consumer protection, Germany and (before Brexit) the UK had a low level with an expectation damages rule. We show that a rule of no compensation has adverse effects, which can reduce consumer welfare in comparison with the rule of expectation damages, provided consumers are risk averse. In line with our theoretical findings, our empirical results indicate that the expected costs of consumer protection are passed on to consumers via the interest rate spread, that is the difference between the lending and the refinancing interest rate of mortgage banks. They tentatively support our view that interest rate spreads increase more than proportionately with rising market interests if compensation of expectation damages for early repayments is either abolished or severely capped. In such cases the expected costs of mandatory consumer protection, which the bank passes on to the consumer, can be higher than the consumers’ willingness to pay for her protection. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the relevance of our findings for the general design of consumer protection legislation. We try to give a tentative explanation of why a consumer protection law, which aims at increasing consumer welfare, might achieve the contrary. We conjecture that this is probably not an unintended consequence of a well-meaning law, but might follow a political dynamic along Mancur Olson’s “Logic of Collective Action” (1965). The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we review the literature on cases where ill-designed increases in consumer protection had adverse effects for consumers. Section 3 then introduces a formal model that helps to understand whether and under what conditions a right of early repayments without damage compensation leads to an increase or decrease in consumer welfare. In Sect. 4 we present the legal regimes for premature repayments of mortgage loans in EU Member States and show how they changed over the period between 2006 and 2016. We then explain how we code the various protection levels of the EU’s Member States in a quantitative comparative law approach. In Sect. 5 we introduce our dataset and descriptive statistics. The strategy we employed to arrive at our estimations and the results of our empirical investigation are presented in Sects. 6 and 7. We conclude in Sect. 8 with a summary of how our research contributes to a better understanding and the design of consumer protection legislation.",

Seminal theoretic contributions by the “father” of Constitutional Economics—Buchanan (e.g. Buchanan & Tullock, 1962), as well as numerous empirical works (see e.g. Persson and Tabellini, 2003; or a survey by Voigt, 2011), view the constitution as a mechanism allowing to counteract time-inconsistency problems connected with drafting and implementing economic policy. Containing rules that impose constraints on activity of state authorities (e.g. separation of powers, bills of rights, an independent constitutional judiciary, constitutional budgetary limits), the constitution enables turning promises made by representatives of state power into credible commitments. A new strand of empirical literature has recently been developing in this area, focusing on the problem of constitutional enforcement. A number of empirical studies have indicated the relevance of de facto constitutional rules, i.e. the way constitutional constraints actually function (dependent on compliance and enforcement) and not necessarily de jure rules which have been formalized in constitution texts, for economic outcomes (e.g. Blume et al., 2009—with regard to direct democracy mechanisms, Voigt et al., 2015—concerning judicial independence; Bjoernskov, 2015 on property rights; Spruk, 2016 on political institutions; Lewczuk, 2019 on human rights protection). More and more literature aiming to identify the factors explaining both types of rules has also emerged, including studies interested in finding whether the text of constitutions matters for de facto operation of constitutional rules (e.g. Elkins et al., 2013; Melton, 2013; Melton & Ginsburg, 2014; Metelska-Szaniawska and Lewkowicz, 2021). The de jure–de facto gap, its potential effects and determinants, have also recently received some attention (e.g. Voigt, 2021), in particular in studies concentrating on the so-called constitutional underperformance, i.e. the failure to respect de jure constitutional rights and freedoms (e.g. Chilton & Versteeg, 2016; Law & Versteeg, 2013). In this paper we aim to study a related phenomenon, which has gone to a great extent unnoticed by the literature, namely “constitutional overperformance”, i.e. the situation when certain constitutional rights and/or freedoms are factually enjoyed by citizens in a given country although they are not included in this country’s de jure constitution. Law and Versteeg (2013) make a first attempt to trace this phenomenon around the globe based on a measure of constitutional performance which they construct for a selection of 15 constitutional rights and freedoms. They observe constitutional overperformance in some countries with relatively old constitutions (and, therefore, containing less de jure rights), such as the United States or Norway, as well as in some democracies that have historically lacked a bill of rights, e.g. Australia or United Kingdom. We follow Law and Versteeg’s (2013) approach in operationalizing constitutional overperformance based on protection of constitutional rights but broaden the search for its potential determinants beyond the lack of de jure institutionalization problem. Based on suggestions from cross-disciplinary and economics literature on the protection/violation of rights, we ask whether there exist any systematic patterns of characteristics of countries that overperform at the constitutional level. We group the suspects into 3 categories. Firstly, we focus on aspects connected directly with constitutions as legal acts and the lack of de jure institutionalization, i.e. the constitution’s comprehensiveness (how many rights it includes) and its age. Secondly, we examine countries’ institutional and socio-economic characteristics that may provide favorable conditions for protecting/enjoying rights even when the latter lack de jure codification in the constitution. These are factors affecting the costs and/or benefits of rights protection relating, e.g., to the country’s democratization level (and various features thereof), the role of judges and their discretion in the interpretation of the constitution (primarily at the constitutional court), the economic development of a country, presence of political conflicts, as well as adoption of international covenants imposing the protection of rights under the threat of costly sanctions. Finally, we ask whether spatial effects are identifiable, i.e. does it matter for constitutional performance in one country, even when no de jure rights of a given kind exist in its constitution text, that citizens in the neighboring countries de facto enjoy these rights (and, if so, via which channels this diffusion of overperformance takes place). The spatial analysis approach is not only a way to answer the above questions about spatial interdependence and a relatively novel tool in constitutional economics studies but also comes with an advantage of tackling part of the potentially involved endogeneity problem. The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the phenomenon of constitutional overperformance, its definition, measurement and distribution around the globe. Section 3 discusses our conceptual framework for the study of potential determinants of constitutional overperformance, building on the existing literature on the protection of rights and constitutional enforcement and combining this framework with aspects of institutional and policy diffusion. In Sect. 4 we verify the significance of these determinants of constitutional overperformance in an empirical study for a global sample. We employ both ordinary panel data regression techniques, as well as broaden the empirical approach to include spatial effects and provide an additional robustness check. The paper finishes with conclusions.",2

In 2019, among the ten biggest companies worldwide, seven were operating in digital markets (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Facebook, Alibaba, and Tencent Holdings), mostly as online intermediaries. In Europe, recent statistics indicate that 7 out of 10 consumers ordered online goods in 2019, sustaining a steady increase in the number of online transactions.Footnote 1 Such numbers are likely to increase in the next years, following the COVID-19 outbreak which spurred, even more, the use of online services for basic needs. Similarly, the share of individuals using hosting platforms such as social networks reached more than 56% in the European Union in 2018.Footnote 2 As some of the firms’ and consumers’ fundamental activities have moved online (such as shopping, socialization, and content consumption), online misconduct has proliferated too, taking different forms. For example, in e-commerce platforms, some merchants may sell counterfeit goods which violate intellectual property (IP) and harm right holders. Due to the market reach of some big platforms, it is not surprising that OECD (2018) referred to e-commerce platforms as “ideal storefronts for counterfeits”. In hosting, messaging, and video-sharing platforms, online misconduct occurs via the presence of illegal material, such as terrorist propaganda or the illegal distribution of copyrighted content. The presence of this material in social media platforms is further exacerbated by the large-scale production and diffusion of user-generated content that features hate speech and questionable material and might create societal externalities. The tragic events in Capitol Hill in January 2021, for instance, were mostly organized on social media sites, Gab and Parler, with no moderation of content.Footnote 3 Yet, preventing online misconduct can be challenging in practice, and requires substantial resources, including a combination of state-of-the-art technology for machine detection and human moderators. Moreover, striking the right balance with fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of speech is a difficult task (see e.g., the First Amendment in the US). This study aims to investigate the incentives of online platforms to mitigate or stop online misconduct in a laissez-faire regime, and how changes in liability rules might alter these incentives and affect platforms’ key strategic variables. This is relevant as the current liability regimes—for example, Sect. 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US and the e-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC) in the European Union—have been considered outdated and proposals were recently made. In December 2020, the European Commission has unveiled its proposal for the Digital Services Act, which continues to ensure conditional liability exemption to online intermediaries but introduces a differential system with some additional procedural obligations for “very large” platforms.Footnote 4 In the UK, the Government proposed the Online Safety Bill imposing a duty of care on digital services providers.Footnote 5 More stringent rules have been proposed in the California Assembly in February 2021 for intermediaries selling defective products.Footnote 6 The current liability regimes, which were designed in 1996 in the U.S. and 2000 in the EU, were established to help “information society services” to grow and protect them from endless litigation that might discourage investment. However, in the last twenty years, the platform economy has changed substantially. Due to the global reach of many intermediation services, it has become difficult, if not impossible, for a victim to claim damage for harm that occurred online, which increases the risk that a large number of victims would remain uncompensated for any damage they suffer. Similarly, harmful content can become easily viral thanks to groups, algorithms, and recommender systems. On top of these aspects, some platforms have become very large, have deep pockets, and are in the technological position to withhold support to users (or sellers) involved in online misconduct. Turning again on the events of Capitol Hill in 2021, coordinated action of Google, Apple, and Amazon withheld support to Parler in their app stores and hosting environment, respectively. Against this background, this paper provides a novel analysis of the incentives of online platforms to engage in self-regulatory conduct and the economic effects of introducing more stringent platform liability. More specifically, we discuss some of the intended and unintended effects that changes in liability rules might generate and the social desirability of such changes. This is critical as most platforms follow a multi-sided business model, employ different pricing and non-pricing strategies, and generate value facilitating (or exploiting) interactions between different groups of agents. We restrict attention to the following types of online misconduct: (i) the presence of counterfeits on e-commerce websites and the related violation of intellectual property rights, (ii) copyright infringement on hosting platforms, (iii) hate speech and other unlawful materials (which may depend on specific national legislations) hosted on online intermediaries. To this end, we focus on e-commerce platforms, social networks, and hosting platforms and on the peculiarities of the business models that these platforms adopt. Our analysis raises awareness of the importance of considering that platforms might react to a change in the liability regime by re-optimizing its strategy. Specifically, we suggest that a change in the liability system is likely to affect inter alia the pricing strategies of the platforms, the level of participation in their activities, their business models, their terms & conditions, and their investments. Therefore, understanding these effects is necessary to design appropriate liability rules and possible exemptions as well as to neutralize some unintended negative effects that may potentially arise. Our paper is related to the law and economics literature on liability. This literature has mostly focused on the liability regime that applies to producers of a given good,Footnote 7 and has analyzed, among others, the advantages and shortcomings of so-called “strictly liability” and “negligence-based liability”.Footnote 8 Notable exceptions are recent works by Buiten et al. (2020), De Chiara et al. (2021), Hua and Spier (2021), and Jeon et al. (2021) that study the economic effects of holding platforms liable. The paper by Buiten et al. (2020) is the most related in spirit to ours. These authors examine liability rules for online hosting services from an economic and legal perspective and provide policy recommendations for a liability regime in the European Union. They identify several problems in the current liability framework for online intermediaries in the European Union. Above all, they consider that the absence of the so-called “Good Samaritan” protection in the EU e-Commerce Directive is highly problematic. The “Good Samaritan” clause grants liability exemption from any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable material. Such a clause is explicitly mentioned in the US Sect. 230(c)(2) of the Communications Decency Act. Yet, its absence in the current EU liability framework creates perverse incentives for platforms not to monitor online activity, thus undermining self-regulation. Buiten et al. (2020) also argue that responsibility should be shared among all the parties involved in the diffusion of illegal online material and that the liability rule applying to online platforms should be principles-based and supplemented by co-regulation or self-regulation. Our paper complements theirs by identifying novel channels through which the introduction of a more stringent liability might alter platform incentives in the short, medium, and long run. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly discuss the relevant literature on liability in “traditional” markets, i.e., markets in which no intermediation takes place. In Sect. 3, we discuss the incentives of a platform to adopt self-regulation regardless of the imposition of a liability rule. In Sect. 4, we provide an economic analysis of liability for online platforms and investigate the impact of a more stringent liability regime on several key economic variables. In Sect. 5, we analyze the implications of specific aspects of liability rules. Among these, we discuss upgrades of the current liability system which are conditional to a series of procedural obligations, such as those that increase transparency on platform activities regarding the removal of unlawful content or the design and implementation of review schemes. Similarly, as a one-size-fits-all liability regime might consolidate the market dominance of large platforms, we discuss some additional clauses that could apply solely to “very large” platforms (e.g., those platforms with a large volume of sales or with a critical number of users). Finally, in Sect. 6, we summarize the main takeaways of our analysis.",2

Legal acts of this kind are referred to as public enforcement. As an additional instrument, there is also private enforcement with the threat of litigation by private parties. The present paper deals with private enforcement. Even within the European Union, competition law is national law. But the Directive 2014/104/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, henceforth referred to as the Directive, sets out certain rules to ensure that everyone who has suffered harm caused by an infringement of competition law can effectively exercise the right to claim full compensation. Member states had to adapt national law to this Directive.Footnote 1 Article 3 (2) of the Directive explicitly requires that compensation shall place a person who has suffered harm in the position in which that person would have been had the infringement of competition law not been committed. Legal practice has to decide what exactly is meant by this compensation requirement for cases that end up in court. The present paper, in contrast, confronts the compensation requirement with game-theoretic models of market interaction. It investigates how requirements to compensate victims from infringements in line with Article 3 (2) affect the market outcome and the welfare resulting from it. At first glance, the approach seems reminiscent of what the economic analysis of tort law has been doing for decades. In tort law, liability rules are seen as a vehicle to fully internalize external effects within all kinds of accident models and models of harm. Full internalization means that the Nash equilibrium of the game induced by a liability rule is efficient in the sense of maximizing welfare. Many versions of negligence rules have been shown to be efficient provided that the negligence standards themselves are set at their efficient levels. However, there exist substantial differences, the most significant being that damages rules of competition law are not meant to fully internalize external effects. They merely require infringers of competition law to compensate victims for harm caused by such infringements. Instead of the efficient outcome, it is the outcome free of infringements that serves as reference point for quantifying harm caused by a deviation from it. Only under perfect competition, the outcome free of infringements and, hence, the reference outcome would be efficient. But perfect competition governs market interaction (if at all) only rarely. In any case, competition law tolerates less than perfect competition where the outcome free of infringements does not maximize welfare, i.e., the reference outcome will typically be inefficient. For illustration, consider market interaction of the Cournot type. Firms choose independently of each other the quantity of a homogenous product that is then sold at the market clearing price. The Cournot equilibrium is inefficient for at least two reasons. First, the total quantity sold is less than what would be supplied under perfect competition and, second, firms may survive under Cournot competition that would be wiped out under perfect competition for their use of an inferior technology. Nonetheless, if quantity choice is the underlying market interaction then the Cournot equilibrium would qualify as being free of infringements and, for that reason, serves as reference point for quantifying damages. The prime example of an infringement of competition law is when some of the firms form a cartel to coordinate their actions.Footnote 2 If such a cartel reduces supply to raise prices then the non-colluding firms also benefit from it. This is known as the umbrella effect. Customers, however, will suffer from higher prices. To put them in the same position as in the situation free of infringements, they must be entitled to recover the difference of the customers’ hypothetical surplus in Cournot equilibrium and their actual surplus given the infringement of competition law committed by the cartel. As will be shown, such a damages rule need not necessarily deter firms from forming a cartel. But customers will not be worse off as they recover harm caused by the cartel’s coordinated choice of actions. Due to the umbrella effect, non-colluding firms will also not be worse off. Therefore, if it is worth for the colluding firms to coordinate their actions in spite of the claims faced by the members of the cartel, it must be due to efficiency gains from reducing the output of those members that operate with an inferior technology. In other words, if the coordination of the quantity choice by the members of the cartel is worth even net of damages claims then welfare of the outcome will not be lower than in the Cournot equilibrium, i.e., in the absence of the infringement. Far beyond quantity choice in the sense of Cournot, this result is shown to hold for all kinds of market interaction. A damages rule is called compensatory if customers recover harm caused by deviations from the outcome free of infringements and if at least those firms who stick to the action they would have taken in the absence of infringements also recover any possible harm caused to them by the deviation of other firms.Footnote 3 Suppose a damages rule is in place that is compensatory in this sense. Then the compensation principle established by the present paper shows that rational firms will either be deterred to form a cartel or, if they are not, none of the other market participants will be worse off (after damages). In this latter case, the cartel’s coordinated action choice will enhance welfare. Implementing damages rules that are compensatory in the above sense may not be the ultimate goal of current legal practice. But we will argue why such rules would not contradict the wording of the Directive. Given their desirable properties in terms of welfare, this provides economic support of an interpretation of competition law that enforces the compensation requirements behind the compensation principle as strictly as possible. To recover harm successfully, claimants must present sufficient evidence to the courts. The Directive, in fact, provides disclosure rules (Articles 5–8 of the Directive) to support claimants in this task.Footnote 4 Nonetheless, courts may have to handle damages claims under less than full information. The present paper also briefly touches upon the implementability of compensatory damages rules under limited information. As long as courts remain only uncertain about the true level of harm but are still able to observe the actions taken by the firms, then compensatory damages rules can easily be implemented. This is true because, ex ante, i.e., when actions are chosen, damages only matter in expected terms and so damages rules must only be compensatory from the ex ante perspective for the compensation principle to apply. Such rules can be implemented as long as only the exact level of harm is hidden information but the action choice remains observable. If, however, the actions of the firms can no longer be directly observed then it may no longer be feasible to implement compensatory damages rules. Difficulties arise at evidence where none of the firms can be ruled out for sure as having kept to the action free of infringements. Under such circumstances, courts can only determine the range of the customers’ conceivable harm (or benefit) given such evidence. In the case of firms, the range of harm or benefit must be determined that would be conceivable given the evidence but only under the non-refutable presumption that these firms had chosen their action free of infringements. If such benefits are sufficient to cover harm for any combination of values from these conceivable ranges then a compensatory damages rule can be implemented even if the true actions remain hidden. Yet, to operate such a damages rule, it may be necessary to tolerate overcompensation. The Directive prohibits overcompensation quite generally and, for that reason, may prevent the use of compensatory damages rules even when courts have sufficient information to implement them. The present paper investigates how the specification of damages for infringements of competition law affects the market outcome. The L&E-literature does not seem to be rich on contributions that directly address the subject of the present paper. In particular, I am not aware of any game-theoretic literature dealing with welfare effects from damages rules that are compensatory relative to an inefficient benchmark. In fact, the literature on private enforcement of competition law maintains the first-best solution as benchmark. Breit and Elzinga (1985), e.g., whose focus is on private treble damages actions, argue that the economic approach introduces the notion of efficient offenses. The Directive certainly does not. Segal and Whinston (2007), in their survey on public versus private enforcement, posit explicitly that the system’s primary objective is to maximize total social welfare. They refer to the EU Green Paper ’Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules’, which appeared in 2005. While the Directive has grown out of this Green paper, this is a different proposal compared to the Directive. In any case, damages for infringements of competition law are not meant to eliminate distortions due to imperfect competition in a way that would lead to the efficient (first-best) outcome unless the underlying market structure itself happens to be perfect competition. Only in this case, damages for infringements that put victims in the same position as in the first-best outcome would be in line with the compensation requirement of the Directive. Yet, even for this special case, I am not aware of any literature that examines welfare properties of the market outcome induced by such damages rules. This is in contrast to the economic analysis of tort law where there exists an extensive literature on games induced by damages rules. From a legal perspective, tort law and competition law may be far apart. From an analytical perspective, however, there are similarities. In fact, if the underlying market structure is perfect competition then the benchmark against which to specify damages is the efficient outcome. If negligence rules of tort law are at stake, it is the efficient outcome that usually serves as negligence standard. But even from a purely formal perspective, there are differences. First, while formal models of torts explicitly specify the accident probability of an accident and the victim’s loss in case of an accident or even directly the victim’s harm as a function of the precautions chosen by the involved parties, models of market interaction specify profits of firms and the customers’ surplus as functions of the chosen actions by the market participants. Harm is not a primitive element of such models. For tort law, Grady (1983) distinguishes two regimes: (i) the negligent party is liable for the total loss or (ii) the negligent party is only liable for the loss caused by negligence. While the game-theoretic literature reflects mostly (i), legal systems that apply a negligence standard may go for option (ii). In any case, for models of market interaction, there is no counterpart to option (i) because such models do not specify harm as a primitive concept. The Directive rather explicitly requires to put victims in the same position as in the absence of the infringement, which corresponds to option (ii). A second difference is interdependence of payoff functions. In a setting with multiple injurers, Kornhauser and Revesz (1989) have shown that negligence rules fully internalize the external effects provided that negligence standards are set at their efficient levels. They assume that precaution costs of injurers (before damages) depend exclusively on the own precaution choice. Profit functions of firms interacting on markets, in contrast, are highly interdependent. For illustration, think of quantity choice in a Cournot model. The market clearing price and, hence, the profit of each single firm depends on the aggregate quantity that, in turn, depends on both the own quantity choice as well as that by all other firms. The efficiency claim of Kornhauser and Revesz rests on precaution costs that are independent. Interdependence, in fact, changes things substantially as Dharmapala and Hoffmann (2006) have shown. With interdependent precaution costs, negligence rules perform less well. While these authors propose other rules that, in principle, would restore efficiency, according to their view, such rules hardly comply with legal practice. Damages rules, however, would generate efficient incentives quite generally provided that at least those parties who have chosen their efficient action are compensated for deviations by others. This follows as a by-product from the analysis of the present paper. Another difference has already been mentioned. Competition law tolerates less than perfect competition and the benchmark for specifying damages rather is how the market would have evolved had there been no infringement. Damages rules that are compensatory relative to this benchmark still provide sufficient incentives so that the resulting market outcome comes with a welfare level not below the one in the absence of infringements. This result is referred to as the compensation principle. The present paper adapts the compensation principle derived by Schweizer (2020) for a two-party tort relationship to the multi-party market interaction introduced in Sect. 3 below and when some of the firms consider to form a cartel. Segal and Whinston (2007), finally, are pointing out that, in practice, private antitrust suits often follow public proceedings but they assign a role for follow-on proceedings only if they reveal additional private information of the parties that is used in quantifying damages. McAfee et al. (2005) present a game-theoretic analysis of private versus public antitrust enforcement. They assume right away that a private party has a better signal of the violation than the public agency. The present paper sees room for investigating private enforcement on its own. Section 2 provides numerical examples generated within a Cournot model to illustrate some of the main findings and to support intuition. Section 3 introduces a general model of market interaction that contains Cournot as a special case. Moreover, it establishes the compensation principle that provides a link between compensation requirements and the resulting incentive and welfare effects. Section 4 revisits the introductory examples of Sect. 2 to illustrate the compensation principle. Section 5 deals with perfect competition as a special case of the underlying market structure. Section 6 shows how compensatory damages rules can be implemented when the firms’ actions are observable but the true levels of harm are not. Section 7 provides a sufficient condition, under which a compensatory damages rule can be implemented even when the firms’ actions are not directly observable. Section 8 concludes.",

Sitoe,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"With its more than 375 million global cases (as of end-January 2022), COVID-19, the disease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, continues to pressure governments to take difficult measures of infection containment that are unprecedented in recent history. The main form that these measures have taken throughout the world is lockdown—a government-mandated shelter-in-place policy. Notwithstanding the quick advent and approval of multiple vaccines, vaccinations that continue to take place, and even dosing of third jabs in some countries, lockdowns still occur (e.g., Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Vietnam). While it is undeniable that medical findings have advanced along many dimensions (e.g., clinical, epidemiological, etiological, preventative) since the COVID-19 outbreak, significant uncertainty (in Knight’s well-known sense) is still afoot.Footnote 1 In this situation where epidemiological uncertainty has translated into socioeconomic uncertainty, the recurrent Scylla and Charybdis of policy seems to boil down to a choice between saving lives versus saving output. Put differently, the policymaking trade-off is about rights to healthFootnote 2 and rights to liberty, which include rights to livelihood.Footnote 3 The purpose of what follows is to explore the top-down redistribution of these rights when the policy choice, especially as carried out by executive decree or fiat, tilts in favor of a full lockdown.Footnote 4 The exploration is of particular importance for democracies given the liberty sacrifice required.Footnote 5 One often reads about the doubts surrounding the genuine health-safety necessity and democratic validity of a mass quarantine, such as a lockdown, especially in terms of benefits offsetting costs. McCloskey has gone so far as to call the policy “medieval.” At the same time, she admits that government coercion can be justified in the case of merit goods and emergencies. Both are involved and intertwined in the COVID-19 case—health and pandemic (McCloskey, 2020). Moreover, doubts have increased since it has become common knowledge that a mass quarantine does not eradicate an epidemic, but rather limits exponential growth in contagion.Footnote 6 In effect, it appears that what a lockdown aims to achieve is the protection of the weakest individuals of society: a pandemic does not negatively impact everyone equally, but something like COVID-19 mostly negatively impacts the feeblest (above all the elderly and those with serious comorbidity—diabetes, immunodepression, tumor, etc.).Footnote 7 To put it in the starkest possible terms: a lockdown normatively seems to value the benefit from trying to save the life with the highest chance to be taken away above any cost to society. (From now on, we will refer to the elderly and feeble or weak categories simply as elderly and those in the least affected categories as young.) The question then becomes one of unearthing the principle or set of principles that a lockdown is based on—even if perhaps implicitly. What cost–benefit calculus leads to such drastic policy? Why is it that less refined normative criteria are preferred to more refined ones? Why do some countries continue to opt for a lockdown? More generally: is there a logical-theoretical apparatus that can explain the normative lockdown choice, particularly by decree, from a positive vantage point? The conventional criterion hitherto considered in connection with lockdown policy is utilitarianism (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2021; Alvarez et al., 2021; Eichenbaum et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2021). Utilitarianism assumes that each individual, in pursuit of personal interest, balances the benefits and costs of their actions, in terms of utility, both in the present and in the future. To do so, an individual maximizes well-being (or personal welfare) through setting marginal benefits and marginal costs equal. The utilitarian extension of this criterion from the individual to society is straightforward: it is the summation of each individual’s well-being into an additive welfare function. In doing so, the sum of individuals’ marginal benefits will correspondingly equal the sum of individuals’ marginal costs. Hence, as a society is the sum of the individuals that compose it and the summed marginal benefits equal the summed marginal costs, the utilitarian condition for social welfare maximization is achieved. This approach does not consider explicitly that individuals are distinct, that there is a separateness of persons—for instance, healthy and ill, teenagers and grandparents, skilled and unskilled are all treated the same way and not differently. Phrased in terms of the public health response to COVID-19, under utilitarianism one would value the well-being of all individuals in the same relative way: one intervenes until the marginal benefits from the addition of one type of rights are equal to the marginal costs from the subtraction of the competing type of rights irrespective of the individual characteristics of who gains or loses more rights. Utilitarianism, therefore, does not take cognizance that a disease like COVID-19 affects the elderly more severely than others. Rather than the utilitarian, additive social welfare function, our impression is that the rationale of lockdown policy is closer in nature to Rawlsian prescriptions (Rawls, 1971, 1999). More precisely, the policy brings to mind the “maximin criterion” (Rawls, 1974), which sees more redistribution from the application of what might be called absolute equity; that is, an optimal allocation occurs through redistributing benefits to (raising the utility of) the worst-off individual (or, for Rawls, group) in society. In this type of rights reshuffling, individual characteristics matter. The criterion emanates from not being able to know about where each individual stands in society with respect to potential socioeconomic opportunities, or, in the case of a pandemic, a particular vulnerability to a virus (the so-called veil of ignorance). In doubt, the preference falls on the welfare policy that avoids the most undesirable outcome for the worst-off, where, as just recalled, any individual can be under Rawlsian assumptions. In 2020 and 2021, this welfare policy has been lockdown in most countries. For this reason, it seems valid to consider how, in practice, a lockdown can be seen as trading off rights to liberty for rights to health.Footnote 8 Moreover, understanding the tipping of the policy balance toward a lockdown in some countries is relevant because the more we learn from the current situation, the more informed will be future policy decisions about similar emergencies. Our argument connects to two strands of literature. The first, and more general connection is with the growing literature on COVID-19 and pandemics. Prior to 2020, there is a notable vacuum in the political economy literature about public health, especially as it relates to contagious diseases (e.g., Leeson & Thompson, 2021).Footnote 9 However, with the emergence of COVID-19, the situation changed. Studies have been grappling with issues relating specifically to this pandemic as well as seeing what lessons past pandemics can offer (e.g., Geloso et al., 2021).Footnote 10 In addition, as countries (democratic and not) around the world implemented lockdowns, attention also extended to the economics exploration of the nature of this unfamiliar policy (e.g., Boettke & Powell, 2021; Coyne et al., 2021; Rachel, 2020; Scheall & Crutchfield, 2021).Footnote 11 Others point out that the private sector has a higher-than-expected potential to internalize the negative externalities from the pandemic, inferring that a lockdown is not as necessary as governments have argued (e.g., Goolsbee & Syverson, 2021; Leeson & Rouanet, 2021). There are two differences between our work and this first strand of literature that are worth underscoring. The first lies in our attempt to more explicitly explore the drive to engage in lockdown by fiat when most (democratic) countries initially ruled out the policy as impractical, too costly, and illiberal. The second is to try to draw concrete considerations from this drive to determine the conditions under which a country is likely to trade off liberty for health. In essence, we focus more on the process of lockdown (the possible constraints leading to the policy) than on lockdown itself (the policy). These differences bring us to the other—and most closely related—strand of literature: contractarianism (Buchanan, 2000[1975]; Buchanan & Lomasky, 1984; Buchanan & Tullock, 1962; Rawls, 1971, 1999, 2001). Though relating in some ways also to Hayek (2013[1979]; see also, e.g., Lister, 2013 and Tomasi, 2011), our more direct link to contractarianism is through the Kantian (non-Benthamite utilitarian) nexus that exists between Rawls and Buchanan (e.g., Brennan & Kliemt, 2019; Buchanan, 1965, 1976; Kliemt, 2011).Footnote 12 For reasons of social justice, Rawls follows the more idealistic Kant about the moral precondition of the distinction among individuals, namely in the ethical primacy of the separateness of persons. Buchanan instead follows the more pragmatic Kant who defends the priority of protecting individual spheres of autonomy with an eye to facilitating freedom of choice and natural division of labor, rendering morality an emergent property of liberty from the spontaneous interactions among diverse purposive individuals.Footnote 13 Our stance is pragmatic as well: our concern lies in trying to explain, from a positive viewpoint, the choice of lockdown policy, not to seek or establish a normative explanation about lockdown justness (or fairness). Moreover, our stance is less static than Rawls’: similarly to Buchanan, we believe that we must do our best to be aware of the feasible normative options that we face, with the understanding that, under contractarianism, there can be social legitimacy in the choice of these options even when there is not unanimous consensus (e.g., Cowen, 2021a; Munger, 2018). These considerations allow us to interpret more broadly Rawls’ basic intuition about the separateness of persons to more explicitly include those who differ not just in employment condition and opportunity (workers) but also, among others, in endowments, life experience, luck, and, as we shall see, even health. However, our interpretation does not rest on Rawlsian group reasoning. Moreover, it does not rest on Rawlsian redistribution by reciprocity that is owed to those who contribute effort to the total economic pie despite commanding fewer resources, namely workers. Rather, it rests on idiosyncratic individual needs. This interpretation of the separateness of persons still precludes a purely utilitarian calculation (Nozick, 1999[1974]; Schmidtz, 2011). At the same time, our stance is also not identical to Buchanan’s. Politicians might anticipate that their constituents will blame them for allowing procedurally unpalatable events to happen (a self-interested motivation), even if the cost of preventing those outcomes is ultimately larger than the loss of life as measured by standard cost–benefit analyses. But they might themselves be innately Rawlsian in the sense of naturally believing in the political will to tackle an emergency, such as a pandemic. Individuals in an original position (such as those behind the Rawlsian veil or behind a Buchanan-Tullock constitutional stage) might agree, anticipating a situation—i.e., a policy post original position—where they (or a loved one) are denied a right to health on a utilitarian basis. The denial would seem disrespectful and require a kind of cruelty that plausibly goes against liberal democratic principles (even if the denial was genuinely the relatively better option for society from a welfare standpoint). The point to be stressed is that whatever the reason for the presence of such political will, it may not translate sufficiently quickly into a social choice (Cepaluni et al., 2021). For example, as Rawls would moreover emphasize, individuals may underestimate the risks to themselves, to wider society or to their electoral base and actually not cooperate or, at least, not immediately cooperate. Situations of urgency and necessity require a faster policy response than that usually obtained from standard democratic decision making (even under less than unanimous agreement requirements). In these cases, an immediate, albeit coarser, response (e.g., Bolton & Farrell, 1990; Bookstaber & Langsam, 1985; Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009; Kollman et al., 2000)—such as a central, one-size-fits-all policy—substitutes political compromise from longer, more pondered reasoning about the comparatively more refined policy. It is especially in these time-pressed cases that, holding all else constant, one would expect the protection of the elderly to trump the protection of the young by means of a “forced exchange” (Epstein, 2005) of rights to liberty for rights to health. Yet, as we also point out, a fiat lockdown response need not be expected to be necessary in the absence of other constraints (e.g., hospital capacity) and if previous experience on similar crises has coalesced into the institutional fabric, whether formal (e.g., legislation establishing standardized emergency responses to infection testing) or informal (e.g., a norm of behavior, such as voluntarily wearing protective masks in the presence of airborne diseases).",3

This number – spread over a period of 30 years - appears almost dwarfish compared to the current wave, which occurred in less than four months. As virtually all countries were affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus at approximately the same time, governments were all fighting the virus, and their responses can be easily compared. This is akin to a natural experiment and constitutes a very rare setting enabling us to compare the determinants of declaring an SOE across virtually all countries in the world. Alluding to both particular crises as well as governments’ responses to them, Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) entitled their book on centuries of financial crisis management This Time Is Different. Although during most crises, it is claimed that this time is really different, they showed that things weren’t so different after the financial crisis of 2008/9 and that history does seem to repeat itself. In this study, we ask a similar question: If hundreds of thousands are going to die and millions to lose their jobs, shouldn’t one assume that governments call an SOE because they want to save lives? Although emergency provisions have been misused time and again in the past, shouldn’t one expect that this time really is different? Calling a state of emergency typically implies a shift in the balance of powers toward the executive to the detriment of the other government branches, but also to the detriment of citizens who enjoy fewer civil liberties. Sometimes, elections are postponed, parliaments are shut down, and if the courts are prevented from hearing cases, a judicial review of emergency measures applied by government is often close to impossible. There are already plenty of examples for the misuse of emergency provisions during the current pandemic. Casual observation seems to indicate that we have no reason to worry less this time around: Parliaments have been unable to meet in a number of countries due to the pandemic. The government of Mauritius, e.g., suspended its national assembly (Budoo, 2020), and the Thai government turned down the request of its parliament for an extraordinary session (Tonsakulrungruang & Leelapatana, 2020). Four days before declaring a state of emergency, the Serbian government prohibited gatherings of more than 100 people. Based on that decision, it argued that the parliament could not meet – with the consequence that the state of emergency was not confirmed by the Serbian parliament, which it is required to according to the Serbian constitution (Cavdarevic, 2020). Not to be controlled by parliament seems to be a desirable state of affairs for many governments. Court operations were suspended in many countries. Without doubt, this was often done to protect both parties involved in court cases as well as judges and court personnel. Yet, there are also cases in which the closing of courts simply means that government policies could not be challenged in court anymore. This has been the case in Bangladesh (Hoque, 2020) and Nigeria (Abdulrauf, 2020), among others. In Egypt, an amendment was passed that allows military courts to investigate any case discovered by a military officer. In other words: civilians can be tried in front of military courts again (Ellaboudy, 2020). In a number of countries, the military was brought in to enforce government measures. This was, e.g., the case in the theocracy of Iran (Alasti, 2020) as well as in democratic Malaysia and Denmark (Andersen & Bjørnager, 2020; Balasubramaniam, 2020). Domestic operations of the military always entail the danger that the military will remain an important player even after the state of emergency has been ended. Journalists have not only been targeted in repressive societies such as Belarus, where authorities on May 6 removed the official accreditation of Russia’s Channel One that had reported on the spread of the corona virus in the country (CPJ, 2020). In the United Kingdom, police threatened the journalist James Delingpole with fines if he reported on a protest against the government’s corona lockdown in London’s Hyde Park. The event was recorded by several people and went viral on Twitter. Similarly, the South African government has since mid-March prevented epidemiologists and other health experts from commenting on Covid-19 without coordinating with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. In the Philippines, President Duterte refused to renew the license of the most popular Philippino television channel ABS-CBN (BBC, 2020).Footnote 2 These are casual observations, and many more could be offered. Making judgments on a limited number of examples can be misleading – and even dangerous. This is why we are aiming at a more systematic analysis here. In this paper, we first inquire into the factors that provoked governments to declare an SOE. If declarations were clearly driven by the desire to save lives, things would be different. If, on the other hand, emergency declarations were motivated by political economy factors, things would not be so different after all. And indeed, we find that things are not so different. We then ask how governments have used the extra powers that they enjoy after declaring a state of emergency. It may still be premature to make a definite judgment regarding the effectiveness of lockdowns including restrictions to open shops or restaurants, to travel, to participate in religious ceremonies, to demonstrate or even to attend school or university and so on.Footnote 3 Yet, one policy measure lends itself to judgment, namely how governments have behaved towards the media. This is why we ask to what degree media freedom has been upheld even after an SOE has been declared. We find that the protection of journalists – and free expression more generally – does not seem to be high on the agenda of many governments. Very little is known about the factors determining the use of executive decrees in general. We hypothesize that some governments use them as an alternative to calling an SOE. We find that this is, indeed, the case with regard to reactions to SARS-CoV-2. We are not aware of any other studies having analyzed the relationship between SOEs and executive decrees. This constitutes, hence, another value-added of our study. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we briefly review the evidence on both the determinants of calling an SOE, as well as their effects. Section 3 spells out a number of hypotheses regarding the current pandemic as a possible cause for declaring an SOE. In Sect. 4, we describe our data and the estimation approach, and Sect. 5 contains the estimates. Section 6 concludes.",14

On the one hand, there are obvious factors that should drive down crime during a pandemic. For instance, the enforcement of governmental restrictions (e.g. lockdowns and quarantines), typically requires increased police presence in the streets, thereby discouraging individuals from committing crimes such as burglaries. On the other hand, other conspicuous factors may drive up criminal behavior. For instance, if restrictions hinder the ability to earn a lawful income, individuals might turn to crime as the only viable alternative. In order to approach this topic analytically, one must rely on a structured framework that isolates the determinants of crime into different components and examines what happens to each component when a pandemic erupts. Luckily, such a framework is readily available in the economic analysis of crime. The economic analysis of crime assumes that individuals are rational and therefore decide whether or not to commit crimes using a cost-benefit analysis, comparing (at least) two options: committing the crime (i.e. choosing to be “guilty”) and abstaining from crime (i.e. choosing to be “innocent”). In the simplest version of this analysis, which builds on the canonical model by Becker (1968), individuals mainly consider three elements: the benefit from crime (“b”), the probability of being apprehended and punished (“p”), and the severity of the punishment (“s”). Individuals commit the crime if and only if the benefit from doing so exceeds the expected sanction (i.e. if \(b>p*s\)).Footnote 1 Over time, this simple framework has been generalized to encompass a more elaborate set of choices. In particular, scholars have recognized that either option faced by individuals (crime or innocence) can entail both a cost and a benefit (see, e.g., Polinsky & Shavell 2000, 2007; Rizzolli & Stanca, 2012; Sarel 2018). Each of these may relate to elements that are either monetary (e.g. value of property stolen or a monetary fine) or non-monetary (e.g. subjective utility from hurting others or disutility from prison). Breaking down these elements is a first logical step for assessing how crime deterrence might be influenced by a pandemic. A second step can be taken by looking into the vast knowledge accumulated in the empirical (and experimental) research on crime deterrence. The empirical literature confirms some, but not all, of the theoretical predictions of models à la Becker (1968), and also adds further insights closely related to pandemics. Among others, the literature highlights the tradeoff between p and s; the relevance of factors such as uncertainty, risk, time preferences, judicial errors, and behavioral influences (e.g. loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting); and the existence of long-term effects. This paper takes such a two-step approach and considers both purely-theoretical and empirically-informed predictions, thereby constructing a detailed thought exercise on how crime might be affected by pandemics. The lion’s share focuses on Covid-19, but the insights are general in nature. The main insight arising from the analysis is that multiple countervailing effects may all play a part simultaneously during a pandemic, so that increases and decreases in crime are both plausible outcomes. Consequently, one must proceed with caution and avoid the temptation to declare an all-encompassing conclusion on how crime will change. Instead, the strength of the effects in play must be given proper attention. The goal of this paper is thus to provide a list of possible channels through which a pandemic might affect crime. Such a list should be useful for both researchers and policymakers: for researcher, the effects laid out in the paper can help inspire theoretical predictions for specific cases of interest, which can then be tested using empirical research. In other words, the theoretical framework in the paper can help in generating new hypotheses. For policymakers, the paper can assist in the process of spotting different countervailing influences, which might otherwise be neglected. For instance, policymakers may find it easy to spot the more salient effects of the pandemic, such as the increase in unemployment (leading to a lower opportunity cost of crime) or in police presence in the streets during lockdowns (leading to higher probability of apprehension), but then neglect less conspicuous effects, such as the influence of loss aversion (e.g. when stealing is perceived as a recovery from monetary losses that are incurred due to the pandemic). Although the effects considered in the paper are numerous, their size is likely to be unequal and may well depend on factors such as the crime type, location, and market conditions. Hence, policymakers should keep in mind that in order to determine which of the effects described herein is economically important, one still needs to conduct an empirical analysis based on evidence that allows to capture and contrast the relevant factors. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it lays out a framework for analyzing how crime deterrence might be affected by a pandemic, based on insights from theoretical and behavioral law and economics. This seems particularly useful for understanding the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic on (different types of) crime. In particular, while there is already some emerging empirical literature on the effects of Covid-19 on crime in specific areas (e.g. Abrams, 2021; Gerell et al., 2020; Calderon-Anyosa and Kaufman, 2020), as well as some theoretical discussions on compliance to Covid-19 mitigation strategies (e.g. Niavis et al., 2021; Elm & Sarel, 2021) and some other preliminary aspects of Covid-19 and crime (see, e.g., Skolnik, 2020; Miller & Blumstein, 2020), this paper provides a more comprehensive and generalized analysis by mapping various effects that may occur during a pandemic into the framework of crime-deterrence models. Second, my analysis of how loss aversion may affect crime during a pandemic contributes to the emerging literature on the behavioral economics of crime (see, e.g., Van Winden & Ash, 2012). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Part 2 reviews commonalities shared by pandemics that relate to crime deterrence. Part 3 considers separately how each component in the cost-benefit analysis of crime might be affected by a pandemic, adopting a simple Becker-style model of deterrence. Part 4 extends the discussion by considering additional effects identified in the empirical and behavioral literature. Part 5 concludes.",2

Zolna,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The “Facebook” decision of the German Federal Cartel Office in February 2019 was the first decision by a competition authority in which the protection of privacy was explicitly taken into account in a competition law decision.Footnote 1 The Federal Cartel Office (FCO) argued that forcing users, via its terms of service, to give consent to the merging of personal data that Facebook collects inside and outside of its social media platform is an exploitative abusive behaviour by a dominant firm. This decision has triggered a very intense and controversial international discussion about the unclarified relationship between competition law and data protection (or privacy) law under the new conditions of digital platform markets. Due to the key role of personal data for the market (and gatekeeper) power of large digital platform firms, this discussion is also very relevant for the current competition policy discussion about digital platforms,Footnote 2 and the recent proposal of the Digital Markets Act in the EU.Footnote 3 The objective of this article is to analyse the question of whether the negative effects of the data-collecting behaviour and privacy terms of large digital platform firms on competition and privacy can be considered in competition law, or whether—as the critics of the Facebook decision by the FCO claim—privacy concerns should be exclusively dealt with through data protection law (or consumer law). This so far widely supported position is based upon the concept of a strict separation between competition law, which should focus on competition problems, and data protection law, which has the task of protecting privacy, particularly with respect to market failures through information and behavioural problems of consumers. In this article, we argue that in situations such as the Facebook case, in which we simultaneously have both two market failures in digital markets, such a simple separation into two policies does not work anymore. Due to manifold interaction effects between the two market failures and between the two policies on competition and privacy, competition law and data protection law are becoming deeply intertwined, leading to a complex relationship between the two policies.Footnote 4 Based on a market failure-based theoretical framework, we analyse, in a step-by-step approach, why only competition law (and not data protection law) can deal with the negative effects of competition problems on privacy, but also why competition law, with its remedies, can only insufficiently solve these problems, which are caused by the combination of both market failures. This analysis leads to the conclusion that a more collaborative and integrative policy approach for dealing with the complex interplay between competition and data protection law might be necessary. Our article is structured as follows. Chapter 2 offers a brief overview of the discussion on the Facebook case and its implications for the relationship between competition and data protection law. Chapter 3 presents, from an economic perspective, a theoretical framework about the two market failures, two policies, and their interaction effects, applied to the effects of data-collection behaviour and privacy terms on competition and privacy. Chapter 4 shows why competition law can consider privacy effects and why, vice versa, data protection law is not capable of protecting consumers against negative effects on privacy through competition problems. Chapter 5 discusses, in close connection with the Facebook case, how privacy concerns can be assessed in the control of abusive behaviour of dominant firms, and analyses, in this regard, the different approaches of the German FCO, the German Federal Court of Justice, and Art. 5(a) in the Digital Markets Act proposal, which would introduce the remedy in the German Facebook case as a general obligation for gatekeepers. Chapter 6 concludes by underlining the need for a more collaborative, integrative policy approach.",2

Ramello,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent decades, local food has attracted ever greater interest as a cultural expression and heritage of different societies. UNESCO includes foods in its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage and Register of Good Safeguarding Practices which is expanding every year.Footnote 1 Other movements such as Slow Food have also flourished, promoting approaches that recognize a new role of food, linking it to a cultural or political orientation rooted in sustainability, preservation of local traditions and much more.Footnote 2 Reflecting this interest, in the international food market, consumers are seeking out new taste experiences and have significantly enlarged their diets—and their budgets—to embrace different national cuisines. As a result, national food industries are exporting their domestic foods globally, and more and more foreign-cuisine restaurants are opening in countries around the world. The legal side of this story is that food ‘intellectual property rights’ have flourished—often in the form of geographical indications (GIs)—and become a central tool for identifying national foods and reaping benefits from their sale. However, there is no comparable control as far as national restaurants are concerned.Footnote 3 Regarding the production and trade of food products, GI protection is often very strong, sometimes leading to trade disputes to prevent nations from free-riding on the tradition of others (Josling 2006). As an example, the word « Champagne» refers to a French region as well as to the well-known sparkling wine that is produced there, using a particular method and specific inputs. Since many people around the world use the term ‘Champagne’ for generic white sparkling wine, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin du Champagne (CIVC), an association gathering actors of Champagne production and trade, devotes a substantial part of its resources to safeguarding the proper use of designation of origins and forbidding their misleading uses, even if the consumer is unable to distinguish between the quality of an original Champagne and a non-original sparkling wine produced in a different country (Schiessl, 2018). Many national food-related products have similar stories. However, and quite amazingly, while these protections apply to products on the retailing channels, no such rules apply to what is served by restaurants. Hence, a customer entering a French restaurant in a country different from France can be easily cheated (or misinformed) about the real connection of the cuisine and its ingredients to the French ones—as if cheating in this case were not relevant for customers and producers. Yet, as we shall argue further on, such cheating is indeed relevant from an economic point of view, because market exchanges are based upon voluntariness and free choice. Hence a lack of information—or better an asymmetric information problem—simply nullifies the role of the market as an institution. It becomes meaningless if the consumer is unable to choose, or if their choice is irrelevant. The lack of regulation for restaurants is surprising if we consider how some national cuisines—analogously to the Champagne example—are a distillate of cultural traditions and require specific ingredients or procedures. They contribute to give consumers that feeling of the country—France, Italy, Japan and so on—which may then orient them towards other products from that same country. One such example is Washoku, a traditional Japanese cuisine designed to appeal to all five senses at once (and so seriously concerned with the many characteristics of food and its ingredients), which in 2013 was granted UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage protection (Mekata, 2016). In this paper we focus on the case study of Japanese food, which has grown increasingly popular all around the world, becoming a relevant driver of an entire industry. Japanese food exports have risen steadily over the years. In 2014 they amounted to 611.7 billion yens after an 11.1% increase from the previous year. Just 12 months later, in 2015, exports had risen a further 21.8% to 745.2 billion yens.Footnote 4 It has been extensively shown that success in the food trade is based equally upon stringent control measures to assure consumer product safety, and upon quality (Charlier, 2019; Fagotto, 2014; Henson & Caswell, 1999); especially in developing countries (Lamuka, 2014). This issue is particularly important in the Asian countries neighboring Japan, where the popularity of Japanese food can clash with weaker food controls and lower consumer income. This typically provides the grounds upon which restaurants may decide to acquire non-original Japanese ingredients to serve their customers thanks to a double asymmetric information problem. We specifically examine trade in non-original Japanese food in a sample of three Southeast Asian countries—Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia—and seek to identify the main factors prompting Japanese restaurants to use non-original ingredients, considering restaurants’ twofold role: as buyers from upstream wholesale suppliers and as sellers to downstream consumers. Making use of field research, the extant economic literature, and a theoretical model, we sketch out a framework under which the use of non-original ingredients might happen. By means of questionnaires and interviews of staff working at Japanese restaurants, we then try to test the formulated hypothesis and understand in-vivo the reasons why non-original ingredients are—despite customers’ expectations—used in certain circumstances, and to identify the main economic reasons explaining this apparently widespread phenomenon. What emerges is that the popularity of Japanese food is creating a paradox: while popularity boosts Japanese exports, it also fosters the activity of many suppliers of non-original ingredients. This might in turn, over the long run, impair the perception of original Japanese products and their quality; although consumers in our sample seemed unable to distinguish food prepared with original ingredients from food produced with non-original ingredients. Such a situation is problematic because many restaurants essentially feel themselves de facto entitled to misinform—or to not at all inform—their customers about food content, with potentially severe consequences on trust within the market. Accordingly, Japanese authorities are considering how to solve this problem in order to promote the export and use of original Japanese food and ingredients. Against this backdrop, data for this study was gathered between November 2013 and March 2015, by visiting local Japanese restaurants, marketplaces, customs offices at borders, and authorities in Southeast Asia.Footnote 5 Overall, the results provide an interesting glimpse into the economic rationale underlying the enounced paradox. We found that a large share of restaurants does in fact rely upon non-original ingredients, and that there are many explanations for this. The first and simplest one is economic: when the customer is unable to distinguish the food’s quality by simply looking for the proper flavor and the restaurant has the means to mimic the flavor at a lower price, it is rational to expect non-original ingredients. Second, and more interesting for its compelling policy implications, the use of non-original ingredients seems to also result from the hurdles that restaurants encounter when trying to acquire genuine Japanese ingredients. Interviewed restaurants were asked to list the problems that make it harder for them to successfully import original Japanese goods. Among the various complications listed, cumbersome import procedures and, most importantly, the risk of being tricked by importers with regard to the quality of goods, leap out as statistically significant key factors. These points suggest that restaurants face a problem when buying genuine imported Japanese goods, which overall increases their likelihood of using non-original ingredients. In particular, our empirical analysis shows two covariates to be strongly significant: the expectation that most of the ingredients sold by retailers and suppliers will be non-original anyway and, in the case of local ingredients produced by Japanese brands, that their production did not follow proper procedures. On the whole, given the risk of being deceived by wholesalers and retailers of ingredients, and consumers’ inability to distinguish the origin of the ingredients on the basis of flavor (as further shown by the empirical analysis), plus a robust savings in terms of input costs, restaurants’ decision to use non-original goods may rationally serve as a double-sided solution to increase profits while maintaining better control over ingredients’ quality. This solution is of course the outcome of adverse selection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the different kinds of food fraud while Sect. 3 gives a detailed description of the industrial sector in the countries studied, while also providing a simple interpretative model. In Sect. 4, we statistically analyze survey data in detail and show a difficulty in obtaining ingredients for Japanese restaurants. In Sect. 5, we comment on further extension of this work. Finally, in Sect. 6, we conclude our analysis.",

The case of Swedish district courts,December 2022,Jonas Månsson,Christian Andersson,Fredrik Bonander,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Efficiency and productivity in the public sector are major concerns for most parliaments and governments. In Sweden, for example, it is explicitly stated in the Budget Act (SFS 2011:203, 2011) that all state services should be provided with a high level of efficiency. However, what is meant by efficiency is far from unambiguous since the efficiency concept can relate to different aspects of production. Studies of technical efficiency for district courts have been carried out in several countries; however, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated cost efficiency. This study targets the cost efficiency of Swedish district courts.Footnote 1 When studying technical efficiency, efficiency is expressed in real terms (i.e., minimising input use at a constant level of production or maximising production at a given level of resources). Cost efficiency expands this concept and requires more conditions to be fulfilled. These conditions are using the minimum amount of inputs (technical efficiency), paying the correct (lowest) prices, and having an optimal mix of inputs (allocative efficiency). Even though a number of studies have applied the concept of cost efficiency to other entities and investigated district courts in terms of technical efficiency, the novelty of using cost efficiency in this study is that it provides new insights compared with previous research. Further, technical efficiency is included as one component. There are regulations and policy concerns surrounding the Swedish courts that make an analysis of cost efficiency interesting. First, district courts are often located close to the city centre. According to the Swedish National Court Administration (SNCA), this decision is mainly based on public access to district court services. However, central locations also come with higher prices for office space. The second feature is that district courts are geographically distributed to ensure fair proximity to district courts for all citizens. This means that some district courts are located in areas where the demand for their services is lower than would be justifiable from a production point of view. The third feature is that the minimum staff requirement is regulated, so there will always be a minimum number of judges, law clerks, and support staff in a district court. All these policy concerns are summarised in the cost-efficiency measure. Studying cost efficiency thus makes it possible to estimate a monetary value of these other policy concerns and regulations. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the legal system in Sweden and the role of the district courts. Section 3 provides an overview of previous research, and Sect. 4 presents the theoretical framework. Our point of departure is Farrell (1957), who showed that cost efficiency can be decomposed into two components: allocative and technical efficiency. Section 5 presents the data, data limitations, and empirical considerations. In Sect. 6, our results are presented, and, finally, conclusions and concluding remarks are provided in Sect. 7.",3

While liberal democracies provide legal guarantees of a great deal of freedom, not least through the rule of law and civil rights, other forms of government, especially authoritarian ones, are less prone to offer it.Footnote 1 One way to try to justify this kind of legally provided freedom—in arguments for its continued protection in liberal democracies and for its implementation in other forms of government—is to consider its ability to make people satisfied with the freedom to choose what to do in life.Footnote 2 While it may be unwise to opt for “happiness maximization” as a political goal, for reasons outlined by Frey and Stutzer (2000, 2012), it is still conceivable that the legal rules of society can be devised such that people are able to fulfill most of their ambitions in life and become satisfied. This is in fact shown to be the case in over 100 studies relating political, economic and legal institutions to life satisfaction (see Berggren & Bjørnskov, 2020, for an overview).Footnote 3 On that basis, we study how a set of indicators of legal freedom relate to the extent to which people in different countries are satisfied with freedom when it comes to choosing what to do with their lives. The research question is: Does legal freedom suffice to generate such satisfaction, or is something else needed (such as a certain culture, a certain level of national income or a certain political system)? The seven indicators of legal freedom are part of the Human Freedom Index (Vásquez & McMahon, 2020) and capture the rule of law; security and safety; freedom of movement; freedom of religion; freedom of association, assembly and civil society; freedom of expression and information; and freedom of identity and relationships.Footnote 4 The outcome variable is the share of people in different countries who reply that they are satisfied when asked the question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” (Gallup, 2020).Footnote 5 We explore this in a panel-data analysis of up to 133 countries over the period 2008–2018. Our baseline results show that few indicators of legal freedom are related to satisfaction with freedom in a statistically significant way, and those that are turn out not to be robustly related to the outcome variable, when taking outliers and variations in the model specification into account. However, when performing interaction analysis with social trust, we find that the rule of law positively affects satisfaction with freedom, and the more strongly the more social trust there is, above a threshold.Footnote 6 When interacting our indicators of legal freedom with national income, the relationship between freedom of association, assembly and civil society and satisfaction with freedom is stronger the higher the income, again above a threshold. Lastly, an interaction analysis with democracy reveals that freedom of association, assembly and civil society generates higher satisfaction with freedom in democracies than in non-democracies. In other words, for two indicators of legal freedom to really provide satisfaction with freedom of choice, social trust, national income and democracy help. This implies a complementarity between formal institutions and culture, positive freedom and political freedom in generating satisfaction with freedom. This research is inspired by Frey’s (2020, p. 9) assessment of the happiness literature, in which “… much is still unknown, for instance, the importance on happiness of the rule of law, of basic human rights or of types of bureaucracy.” Taking that statement seriously, the contributions of this study are: to bring legal freedom to the forefront of the empirical analysis, including a decomposed study of seven different indicators; to use a new outcome variable, satisfaction with freedom (which is particularly apt for analyzing whether formal institutions encapsulating freedom are able to generate satisfaction with the freedom they create); to undertake an interaction analysis showing under which further conditions legal freedom might generate satisfaction with freedom; and to provide an up-to-date analysis, with data for recent years, covering a large number of countries.",1

Hit-and-run accidents, darkness and probability of punishment",February 2023,Stefano Castriota,Mirco Tonin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Beginning with Becker’s (1968) seminal paper, which first applied an expected utility model to criminal behavior, economists have extensively analyzed incentives to violate the law, both theoretically and – particularly in more recent times – empirically. Becker’s theoretical framework, with its focus on weighing the expected benefit of committing a crime against the expected cost, is particularly well suited to the study of premeditated crimes, spanning from insider trading to pickpocketing. The empirical literature testing the economic theory of crime has deeply studied the deterrent and incapacitation effects of prison (Drago et al., 2009; Buonanno and Raphael, 2013; Barbarino and Mastrobuoni, 2014) as well as the impact of the probability of detection (Kleven et al., 2011; Doleac and Sanders, 2015; Mastrobuoni and Rivers, 2019).Footnote 1 These studies have typically focused on general crime or on specific premeditated felonies, e.g., bank robberies or tax evasion. These examples of criminal activity do not, however, include spontaneous, unplanned crimes. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether the predictions of the economic model of crime hold in these circumstances. While some types of crime encompass both planned and unplanned cases (e.g., in the case of homicides, murders vs. involuntary manslaughter), in other instances criminal activity is characteristically unplanned. Such is the case for the crime analyzed in this paper, namely hit-and-run road accidents with injured or dead victims. This crime is by its nature unplanned, as it follows an unforeseen event, a car accident involving the death or injury of another person, and the decision is adopted under strict time constraints and dramatic psychological conditions which could compromise the agent’s judgment (Hammond, 2000). Therefore, we contribute to a better understanding of behavior in extreme and high-pressure situations (see, for instance, Frey et al., 2011; Elinder and Erixson, 2012), when planning is not feasible. Under these conditions, the agent should be less likely to have a rational response to incentives. Another peculiarity of hit-and-run is that, compared to other types of crimes like burglaries, it is more likely to be committed by citizens without criminal records.Footnote 2 Therefore, the evidence we provide is representative to a broader population and not only individuals that are willing to commit a crime. Ordinary citizens have a higher discount factor (Åkerlund et al., 2016; Mastrobuoni and Rivers, 2016) and higher risk aversion (Block and Gerety, 1995) compared to criminals. Economic theory predicts that agents with such a psychological profile should react more acutely to the threat of penalties (Becker, 1968; Chalfin and McCrary, 2017). Therefore, if a rational response to incentives does exist, it should be easier to detect. Here, we study the likelihood of hit-and-run using Italian data. Figure 1 reports the scatterplot of the daily share of hit-and-run accidents from January 1996 to December 2016, together with a time trend obtained through a smooth local linear polynomial. What emerges is a sharp increase over the last fifteen years, from the minimum of 0.4% in the early 2000s to almost 1% in 2016, an increase of around 150% in relative terms. Even if Italy has lower percentages compared with other developed countries, the problem is becoming more serious over time, a general trend observed also in the US. Daily share of hit-and-runs in Italy, 1996–2016. Note: The figure reports the scatterplot of the daily percent share of hit-and-runs from 1996 to 2016 and the local linear time trend with the 95% confidence intervals We show that fleeing increases with darkness and argue that this is related to a decrease in the probability of punishment. In particular, we use data on the universe of Italian road accidents with injured or dead people from 1996 to 2016. Building on a recently developed methodology (Doleac and Sanders, 2015; Taulbee, 2017; Domìnguez and Asahi, 2017; Chalfin et al., 2019) and on evidence that the likelihood of apprehension in hit-and-run accidents increases with daylight (MacLeod et al., 2012), we use variation in daylight, both when switching between daylight saving time and winter time and across seasons, to argue that the likelihood of hit-and-run conditional on an accident taking place increases when the probability of being identified decreases. Through an extensive series of tests, we show the robustness of this result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper using this identification strategy to study hit-and-run accidents. In terms of the decision problem faced by a driver, if after an accident the driver does not flee, he or she may get a punishment because of having caused an accident. If instead the driver flees but does not get caught, there is no punishment. If he or she flees and gets caught, the punishment is at the highest, including also the additional penalty for running away. Increasing the probability of detection for hit-and-run would imply, other things being equal, a lower likelihood of fleeing. In the institutional setting we study, Italy, according to the best available source the overall probability to be identified after a hit-and-run is rather high, at over 50%, in line with what reported for the US (MacLeod et al., 2012). This probability is even higher, at 70%, in case of fatal accidents.Footnote 3 While for some types of crimes like tax evasion for incomes without information reporting, the probability of getting caught is so low that the literature sometimes wonders why people comply at all (Andreoni, Erard, Feinstein, 1998), this is not the case for hit-and-run. Fleeing after causing an accident implies a very concrete prospect of getting caught and being punished. Beyond these aspects related to the economics of crime literature, hit-and-run road accidents with injured or dead people are a very serious crime worthy of investigation per se. In fact, around 35% of victims die within 1–2 h of the accident; therefore, a delay in emergency response dramatically reduces survival rates (Tay et al., 2009). Hit-and-run is also very common around the world. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, in the US more than one hit-and-run crash – with or without serious consequences – happens every minute, while in 2015 these types of accident were responsible for 1819 fatalities (5.1% of total in road accidents) and 138,500 serious injuries (5.9%), with a steady increase in recent years in both absolute and relative terms.Footnote 4 In selected EU countries, the share of fatal accidents involving hit-and-run over the period 2009–2014 ranged between 1 and 6%, while that of injuries between 2 and 14%, with the United Kingdom presenting the highest incidence in both cases.Footnote 5 This paper contributes to the economics literature on crime by studying a felony, thus far neglected, of interest both for its dire societal consequences as well as for its unplanned nature. One further advantage of studying hit-and-run road accidents is the absence of the issue of crime displacement which typically hinder the identification of the effects of an increased probability of detection (see, for instance, Pricks, 2015). Having a serious road accident and fleeing the scene are undesired and unplanned events; therefore, a policy successful in decreasing the share of hit-and-run accidents would not cause a spatial displacement or a parallel increase in other offences, which could potentially leave the overall number of victims unchanged. In other words, while it is possible that a higher probability of detection for bank robberies could increase security van robberies, for instance, this consequence is unlikely to be a concern for hit-and-run. In addition to the economics of crime literature, this paper is also related to the literature studying driving behavior. For instance, De Paola et al. (2013) and Abay (2018) investigate the effect on accidents of the penalty point system, while De Angelo and Hansen (2014) focus on the effect of policing, and Traxler et al. (2018) look at the impact of penalties on speeding. The focus of our study, however, is not driving behavior or car accidents per se, but rather the decision whether to stay or flee after the accident has already occurred. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the identification strategy. Section 3 describes the dataset and reports descriptive statistics. Section 4 analyzes the impact of daylight on hit-and-run, while Sect. 5 performs a number of robustness checks. The final section discusses the policy implications of the empirical estimates and offers a brief conclusion.",

An empirical analysis,April 2023,Justus Haucap,Radivoje Nedic,Talha Şimşek,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The appropriate regulation of gambling markets is not an uncontroversial topic and it is still being intensively discussed in the literature (Coryn et al., 2007; Carran, 2018; Bühringer, 2018). While parts of the gambling market have long been organized in a legal, regulated framework, other parts of gambling take place in black markets. The reasons for regulation and also partial prohibition include not only various market failures triggered by information asymmetries and external effects, but also by boundedly rational or even the pathological behavior of some gamblers (Coryn et al., 2007). Partly, gambling also has a negative reputation (see, e.g., Yani-de Soriano et al. 2012). From a regional economic perspective, casinos have positive and also negative effects (Coryn et al., 2007; Walker & Barnett, 1999). Some of the positive effects a casino has on the region include the jobs associated with a casino, the local income generated, possibly also tax revenues, and tourist attraction. On the negative side are possible external effects such as noise, the negative image already mentioned, an increase of gambling addiction, property crimes, and money laundering (Coryn et al., 2007). As Dümmler et al. (2001) explain, the macroeconomic benefit of casinos has a “mercantilistic background”: As little as possible should be imported and as much as possible should be exported, so that the largest part of the value creation remains in the domestic market. The bigger the share of labor, investors, and suppliers originating from the region of the casino location, the higher the benefit of a casino for the region. In contrast, the negative effect of the gaming business is ideally exported (i.e., consumed by persons from outside the region in which the casino is located) (Dümmler et al., 2001). Accordingly, casinos have a certain similarity to so-called NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) goods. In the case of NIMBY goods, significant social costs of production are incurred locally (such as aircraft noise), while the benefits (from an airport) also arise elsewhere, so that, while many welcome the existence (of airports) in principle, they do not welcome it in their neighborhood (Frey et al., 1996; van der Horst, 2007). For casinos, the effects may be somewhat different, but related. From the point of view of a casino location, the social costs (e.g., from gambling addiction) should be exported as much as possible, while the benefits (e.g., from jobs and tax revenues) should remain as local as possible. This can also be viewed as a type of beggar-thy-neighbor policy. In this context, it is surprising that the locations of casinos has not yet been systematically analyzed from the beggar-thy-neighbor policy perspective. A very good case study for this purpose is Germany since it has the most neighboring states in Europe. In addition, Germany has a federal state system and the individual federal states bear the advantages and disadvantages of a casino location more or less independently. Hence, both state and federal borders should be relevant for the location of casinos. Especially since the responsibility for the location decision rests with the federal state and is, therefore, a public policy decision-making process. In this paper, we want to analyze whether German casinos are located at borders and in tourist areas to export any potentially negative effects of consumption. The analysis of the location of casinos is important in order to analyze whether current locations are in line with the regulatory objectives of the State Treaty on Gaming (GlüStV) or whether they are more motivated by fiscal objectives. The GlüStV is Germany’s regulatory framework with an objective to provide legal gambling opportunities for the German population so as to steer the ""natural gambling instinct"" of the population into orderly and supervised channels by offering a limited range of games of chance as a suitable alternative to unauthorized gambling, and to counteract the development and spread of unauthorized gambling in black markets. We use cross-sectional county-level data to analyze whether current casino locations are consistent with official policy objectives.Footnote 1 Due to the mercantilistic background of casinos, we conjecture that casinos are more likely to be found at borders and in tourist areas in order to raise revenues from gambling taxes and create jobs, though working all the while to “externalize” the negative effects of gambling. The State Treaty on Gambling, in contrast, has the main objective to provide legal gambling opportunities so that the population abstains from illegal offerings. For that purpose, legal gambling locations should be close to the respective population. Our paper is structured as follows: First, we present an overview of the gambling regulation in Germany and a literature review. After the data and model section, we report the results. Finally, we discuss model limitations and summarize the findings in the conclusion.",
55.0,2.0,European Journal of Law and Economics,09 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10657-022-09760-7,Evolving market boundaries and competition policy enforcement in the pharmaceutical industry,April 2023,Georges Siotis,Carmine Ornaghi,Micael Castanheira,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Maintaining competition in the pharmaceutical industry has long been a challenge for regulators and competition authorities. The entry of an increasing number of generics should have “naturally” led to more competition and shrunk profit margins. Generic penetration is indeed high: the generics’ share of market volume has increased substantially, reaching 85% of drug prescriptions in 2016 (Bosworth et al., 2018). However, in terms of value, they commanded a market share of 19% in the US, 26% in the UK, 21% in Germany, and below 20% in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, with similar figures in other countries (Statista, 2020).Footnote 1 Before any potentially anti-competitive behaviour can be assessed, “a” relevant market must first be defined. Doing so can identify economically significant competitive constraints on a specific firm (or set of firms). Firms’ exercise of market power is constrained by demand- and supply-side substitution, as well as by potential entry. Assuming an initially competitive context, market definition involves identifying which of these constraints ought to be countered (e.g., through exclusion or a merger) for the firm (or the set of merging firms) to exercise significant market power. In this paper, we gauge whether competitive constraints evolve as a consequence of the “genericization” of a particular molecule in a therapeutic market. We show that traditional (often implicit) assumptions about the shape of the relevant market must be re-assessed in the case of the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, we find that the entry of a generic alters market boundaries, decreasing the relevance of analyses based on pre-entry data for anticipating ex-post market power, and vice versa. For instance, a Hypothetical Monopolist with control of all generic versions of a single molecule (but not of the originator) would be able, on average, to bring about a Small but Significant Non-transitory Increase in Price (SSNIP) of at least 5%-10%, despite the presence of substitutes. That is, the market for generics of a given originator drug represents a relevant economic market (or relevant market for short) on its own. Concomitantly, we observe a (post entry) drop in the elasticity of substitution between the drugs that had been competing with each other prior to the entry of a generic. In other words, generic entry produces a softening of intermolecular competition. Our analysis is, in part, inspired by a number of recent competition enforcement decisions where market definition was pivotal. While market definition is often a fairly routine exercise, in a number of cases it turned out to be central: Servier/PerindoprilFootnote 2 (EU), GSK/Paroxetine (UK),Footnote 3 and Vyera/Daraprim and Boehringer Ingelheim/Aggrenox (US), all reviewed in Sect. 4. In the Servier case,Footnote 4 the EU’s General Court concluded that the EU Commission had “made a series of errors in defining the relevant market.”Footnote 5 At the time of writing, the appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) brought by the Commission is pending resolution. In GSK/Paroxetine, the UK’s Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT)Footnote 6 upheld the Competition and Markets Authority’s finding of abuse, but adopted a different line of reasoning to delineate the relevant market. In Daraprim, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) observed that a sustained price hike was direct evidence pointing to a narrow market. Meanwhile, in the Aggrenox case, the Connecticut District CourtFootnote 7 reasoned that the post-generic entry price drop was direct evidence that the relevant market only included Aggrenox and its generic versions.Footnote 8 The econometric evidence reported below is consistent with the cogent economic reasoning of the CAT, FTC, and Connecticut District Court, while the ECJ has not yet pronounced itself. To identify relevant markets in the pharmaceutical industry, we estimate residual demand functions under different market structures (Baker & Bresnahan, 1985; Scheffman & Spiller, 1987). Our empirical exercise is (conceptually) inspired by the logic of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test (HMT). While this approach rests on solid conceptual foundations, operationalizing the HMT is challenging.Footnote 9 In practice, competition authorities have had to approximate the HMT by exploiting historical data (customers’ reactions to a significant price change), estimates of diversion ratios (e.g., inferred from customer surveys) or simulations, to name a few. In some rare instances, authorities have relied upon econometric estimations of demand elasticities.Footnote 10 Although the residual demand approach and the HMT have their differences,Footnote 11 both focus on the ability to raise prices above some competitive benchmark. In line with most panel econometrics approaches, we rely on the concept of an economic market (in the sense of Marshall 1920).Footnote 12,Footnote 13 More precisely, we approach market delineation by estimating residual demands that factor in competitors’ reactions. The estimation of own and cross-price elasticities allows for the identification of the source and strength of the competitive constraints faced by firms (Davis and Garcés 2010). This is in line with the European Commission’s emphasis on (demand) substitution to delineate markets.Footnote 14 Baker and Bresnahan (1985) and Scheffman and Spiller (1987) pioneered the implementation of the residual demand function approach in order to delineate antitrust markets for enforcement purposes. Markets for prescription drugs are well suited to the residual demand approach. First, extremely rich product-level data are available. The dataset at our disposal comprises individual prices, quantities and promotional efforts for 125 molecules sold in the US over forty quarters.
 Second, markets are exposed to frequent competitive shocks in the form of generic entry, which can be precisely identified and timed. Generic entry (GE) occurs frequently, and its timing is essentially exogenous to initial market conditions: most often, the trigger is the expiration of patents that were filed several decades earlier. In our sample, 64 molecules in 31 different candidate markets lost exclusivity during the period of analysis. We exploit GE episodes as a competition shock that can be used to measure the initial level and the change in competitive pressure faced by originators that still benefit from exclusivity. A defining feature of our procedure is the identification of the set of drugs that exercise competitive pressure on one another. More precisely, we begin our analysis by estimating cross-price elasticities, distinguishing between generic and branded competitors. Our results suggest that, on average, intermolecular competition is vibrant prior to GE, pointing to broad relevant markets comprised of various drugs. We also find that GE generates market-wide shockwaves that reshape the nature and strength of competitive constraints. On average, the entry of generic competitors for one drug shrinks the initial relevant market: the genericized drug “drops out” in that it no longer constrains the pricing power of the drugs that still enjoy exclusivity. In other words, the intensification of intramolecular rivalry resulting from GE softens intermolecular competition.Footnote 15 This occurs because a previously significant competitive constraint fades into economic insignificance. We use this preliminary analysis as a guide for identifying potentially relevant markets. Given the implication of the above, namely that market boundaries may be very narrow, we focus on generic producers of a given molecule—the narrowest possible market we can possibly identify with our data. Unsurprisingly, we find that own- and cross-price elasticities among generics are high, meaning they have essentially no market power and face very strong competition from other generic producers of the same molecule. With such estimates, we can proceed to more formal hypothetical monopoly tests (HMT), which we describe in Sect. 3. Taken together, our empirical findings point to the existence of multiple candidate markets that are relevant for enforcement purposes.Footnote 16 Our empirical results, which identify the “average effects” on an “average product” in a large market, indicate that intermolecular competition is vibrant prior to GE, largely driven by non-price instruments. Post-GE, the molecule becomes a relevant market where price competition is rife. Indeed, the relevant market post-GE may be even narrower: generic versions (i.e., excluding the originator) may constitute an antitrust market. This serves to highlight that there is no “natural” or “unique” definition of the antitrust market: the delineation of the relevant market cannot be dissociated from the nature of the competitive concern, i.e., the theory of harm. The consubstantial nature of market definition with the theory of harm can be illustrated with simple examples inspired by the results of Sect. 3. Imagine a market composed of three originator drugs, A, B, and C. C is the market leader with a 70% market share, while A and B each command a 15% share. These drugs initially benefit from exclusivity and hence significantly constrain each other, such that a firm controlling all three would be in a position to profitably and sustainably increase prices by 5–10% (or more). Thus, if the concern is coordinated behaviour, the candidate market should consist of A, B, and C. In the context of generic foreclosure, the exercise involves evaluating the competitive constraints the infringing firm faces in both factual and counterfactual (i.e., absent the behaviour that is a source of concern) terms. For instance, in the case of generic foreclosure by B, the relevant competitive constraint is exercised by the generic version of B, and the relevant antitrust may well be molecular, even though the molecular market has yet to emerge, and despite the molecule’s comparatively low initial market share. The reason is that, following generic entry, a hypothetical monopolist limited to molecule B may be able to achieve a significant and profitable price increase over and above the competitive benchmark price. With respect to mergers, our analysis indicates that, for a given theory of harm, market delineation may change in the event of generic entry. This is because vigorous intermolecular competition may vanish quickly if the drugs competing with those of the merged entities experience GE. A merger between A and B may be cleared under the assumption that the merged entity would face significant constraints from C. Our analysis indicates that if C is close to expiry, and if there are no product launches in the near future, the merger between A and B would create an entity that could rapidly gain significant market power. The reason underpinning C’s competitive constraint fading into irrelevance is the dramatic drop in promotional spending that follows GE (Castanheira et al., 2019; Lakdawalla & Philipson, 2012).Footnote 17 Such a situation would represent an instance of Type II error (an anticompetitive merger being waved through). The suggestion that the relevant market should be made contingent on the infringement (actual or potential) has been discussed for some time (Salop, 2000, Rey et al. 2005, and Glasner & Sullivan, 2020 for an in-depth exposition and analysis), but enforcers and courts have so far been reluctant to endorse the approach, at least in the European Union. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dynamics of competition in the pharmaceutical industry before and after patent expiration. In Sect. 3, we describe the data, implement our empirical analysis, and gauge how competitive constraints evolve over time. We also assess pricing power under different market structures. Section 4 discusses the potential implications of our results in light of past and ongoing cases. Section 5 concludes.",

For almost two decades, this question has been at the centre of one of the most protracted controversies in the history of modern telecommunications: the network neutrality debate. While the origins of the debate can be traced back to the late 1990s and discussions about open access, it was law scholar Tim Wu (2002, 2003) who coined the term ‘network neutrality’ and the underlying narrative that the codification of non-discrimination principles is necessary to safeguard an open Internet. While there has never been a generally accepted definition of what network neutrality entails (e.g., Krämer et al., 2013), a continuum of interpretations and a variety of regulations have emerged over time. Proponents of network neutrality regulations argue that the introduction of such rules is imperative in order to prevent gatekeeping broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) from selectively discriminating against (unaffiliated) content providers (CPs) by means of unreasonable network management and/or pricing, safeguard consumer choice, and maintain the public Internet as an open platform that facilitates permissionless innovation; opponents contend that such harmful behaviour cannot be expected. Rather, they argue, such regulations would unduly restrict the entrepreneurial freedom and lead to distorted investment decisions and innovation incentives. By 2015, after almost a decade of back-and-forth, both the EU and the U.S. had imposed strict forms of network neutrality regulations. Beyond imposing transparency rules, these regulations codified rules to prevent discriminatory behaviour and thus unreasonable network management. While some developed countries, like New Zealand and Australia, never implemented network neutrality regulations in the first place,Footnote 1 the U.S. reversed their regulations in 2017, thus returning to a less strict regime based mainly on transparency obligations. The EU, however, has maintained its course and recently published the second version of its net neutrality implementation guidelines (BEREC, 2020). In contrast to the strong visions embedded in strict network neutrality regulations in the EU and some other OECD countries, clear evidence of the impact of net neutrality regulation on firm decisions does not exist thus far. This is remarkable, as net neutrality regulations represent a major market intervention with ambiguous welfare effects for key economic stakeholders in the Internet ecosystem (CPs, ISPs, and users). Numerous theoretical contributions have examined various trade-offs related to net neutrality regulation, in particular, its effects on network investments, content innovation, and social welfare (Easley et al., 2018; Greenstein et al., 2016). However, there still do not exist studies empirically assessing the welfare effect of net neutrality regulations, while only a very few (and mostly U.S.-based) studies provide evidence on its impact on ISPs’ network investment using rather broad measures of investment. This paper aims to contribute to this stream of analyses by providing first empirical results on the causal impact of net neutrality regulations on ISP platforms’ investment using a comprehensive and recent OECD panel data set for 32 countries for the years from 2000 to 2021 which covers the entire fiber deployment period. Our main dependent variable measures investment activities by ISPs in terms of newly installed fiber-based broadband connections. To obtain our main variable of interest, i.e., net neutrality regulations implemented in a particular OECD country, we reviewed past regulatory decisions and constructed indicator variables measuring the year of implementation of net neutrality regulations as well as the year of the first official announcement of intended measures in proposals or other official draft documents. In order to identify causal effects, we employ panel data estimation techniques, including instrumental variables. We first explore a scenario in which we assume that decisions to implement or withdraw net neutrality regulations have been made by politicians who do not observe on a day-to-day basis relevant market outcome variables, but rather decide according to ideological and partisan views and in light of bureaucratic goals. We then relax the assumption that net neutrality regulations are uncorrelated with idiosyncratic error terms and re-estimate our empirical specification using two-stage least square estimation. Since net neutrality regulations have been implemented on the basis of political decisions, political economy variables should have strong predictive power. Accordingly, we employ measures of political orientation, government intervention, and the international state of net neutrality regulations as exogenous sources of variation. In view of the core arguments of net neutrality proponents and opponents, as well as the main trade-offs identified in the relevant economics literature, we aim to investigate the following research question: Do net neutrality regulations lower the incentives of ISPs to invest in new fiber-based network infrastructure (as suggested by net neutrality opponents)? We find that net neutrality exerts a negative impact on fiber investment. This empirical result indicates that strict network neutrality regulations slow down investment in fiber-based broadband connections and thus also indirectly on related subscriptions of consumers. Though we cannot provide an overall assessment on the effect of net neutrality regulations on social welfare, which would also have to take into account the impact on content provision and prices consumers have to pay for high-speed broadband connections, our main result indicates that net neutrality regulations seriously impact the deployment of general-purpose broadband infrastructures which generate considerable externalities across a wide range of sectors of the economy (Akerman et al., 2015; Briglauer & Gugler, 2019; Czernich et al., 2011; Lobo et al., 2020). The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the related theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 discusses the relevant institutional background and provides a description of net neutrality regulations and historical developments, with a special focus on the EU and U.S. Section 4 then outlines our empirical specification and identification strategy. Section 5 characterizes our OECD panel data set. Section 6 discusses our main estimation results, while the final section concludes with a review of our main findings and most relevant policy implications for the ongoing debate.",3
