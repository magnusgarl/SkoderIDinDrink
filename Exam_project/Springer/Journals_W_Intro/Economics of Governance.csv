These studies often find far-reaching effects with regard to a number of variables, including fiscal policy, the quality of governance, and total factor productivity. Blume et al. (2009a) is the first broad cross-country study inquiring into the effects of direct democracy.Footnote 1 It only partially confirms the results of the intra-country studies: mandatory referendums are correlated with lower total spending as well as with less spending on welfare, which is in line with previous studies, but it also finds that countries with national initiatives spend more rather than less and tend to be characterized by more rent-seeking activity. Some of these results definitely merit further research, and to that end, in this paper we shed more light on the effects of direct democratic institutions by, first, looking at more countries and, second, taking into account more institutional detail. The results largely confirm our previous findings: mandatory referendums lead to lower government expenditure and increase government efficiency, whereas initiatives have the opposite effects. These results are noteworthy because the coding of direct democratic institutions underlying this study somewhat diverges from the coding used in the previous one. Inclusion of additional institutional detail has surprisingly little impact. We find that higher government expenditure connected with initiatives is primarily driven by citizen initiatives and not by agenda initiatives. Further, if referendums can be held both on constitutional and post-constitutional issues, the overall deficit tends to be higher than if this is not the case. The possibility of a recall, the binding nature of referendums and initiatives, and the existence of referendums at the subnational level do not display any significant effects on the dependent variables analyzed here. This paper adds to the literature on the economic effects of constitutions. Persson and Tabellini (2003) inquire into the effects of electoral systems and the form of government; it is plausible to assume that other constitutional institutions also display important economic effects, direct democratic institutions being one example. To make our results comparable with those of Persson and Tabellini, we use their approach as a template. They are interested in three groups of dependent variables: (1) fiscal policies, (2) government efficiency, and (3) economic productivity. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the relevant theory. Section 3 presents the new dataset and our estimation approach. Section 4 contains the actual estimates and some possible interpretations of them. Section 5 concludes. An extensive literature review and a more thoroughly developed theoretical section can be found in Blume et al. (2009a).",17

For instance, in the 1980s, after a spell of dictatorships, a number of South American countries re-democratised (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Peru). However, shortly after these processes of political liberalisation had taken place, higher inflation and even severe bursts of hyperinflation happened in those countries. Macroeconomic stabilisation took some time to take root in the region. In fact, in the spirit of Alesina and Drazen (1991), stabilisation came only after a considerable nine-year delay in the 1990s. No less important to mention at this early stage is the fact that, in the vein of Przeworski and Limongi (1997), the above-mentioned countries, even with all the economic and political instability seen in the 1980s and early 1990s, have not reversed to less democratic regimes, and this is presumably because those countries are more developed now (at least in terms of income per capita) than in the previous democratic transitions that they experienced in the more distant past and which did not survive for long. Hence, with data for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Peru from 1970 to 2007, periods of political dictatorship, re-democratisation, high inflation, hyperinflation, and then finally macroeconomic stabilisation are captured. We are therefore able to test for the populist view of inflation in South America, which predicts that in countries with high economic inequality that re-democratise (the Gini coefficient in 2008 in the region ranged from .51 in Argentina to .60 in Bolivia), the coalition coming into power will attempt to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Or to put it another way, as suggested by Acemoglu et al. (2011), particular coalitions coming into power (in this case after right-wing dictatorships), even if not with a left-wing flavour (e.g., Alfonsín in Argentina and Sarney in Brazil, the first civilian presidents after re-democratisation, were not representatives of any left-wing coalition), will attempt to signal to the median voter that they are not right wingers with the implementation of particular (populist) redistributive policies. The above populist pattern becomes feasible because new democracies sometimes still lack particular institutions (e.g., mature political parties in congress, fiscal responsibility laws and central bank independence, indeed the South American case at the time) and also particularly problematic because this redistribution is usually done through higher and unfunded public spending, or artificial wage and salary increases, and other public transfers, which in turn tend to generate higher inflation and possibly even hyperinflation, and this is known to be detrimental to the welfare of the poor in the first placeFootnote 1. With the above (eventful) background in mind, and taking advantage of panel time-series analysis, which allows us to empirically model such thin panels of countries, we attempt to further our knowledge on the determinants of macroeconomic performance in the recent history of South America. Essentially, the political and economic characteristics of those countries (inequality, democratic transition, hyperinflation and lack of particular institutions at the point of re-democratisation), combined with the rather novel panel time-series analysis, provides the perfect environment for us to better capture the presence, or not, of the populist view of inflation in the region. The results show that during the period of political dictatorship inflation was lower, which indicates that the implementation of democracy seen in the 1980s was, in fact, detrimental to macroeconomic performance in the region. It is worth mentioning that, although inflation was lower during the dictatorial period, we are by no means saying that those military regimes achieved stable macroeconomic performance. Nevertheless, in relative terms, the evidence allows us to suggest that the then recently elected governments in those countries indeed pursued populist, or all sorts of unfunded redistributive policies, that eventually lead to poor macroeconomic performance through higher rates of inflation and even severe hyperinflationary bursts. The contribution of this paper to the literature is that, firstly, we focus on understanding the hyperinflationary episodes taking place in South American countries shortly after re-democratisation. This entails a disaggregation of the data to pinpoint more accurately the impact of young democracies on inflation, so that a better historical understanding of the region is achieved and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to shed some light on those traumatic experiences taking place in South America. Secondly, we construct a composite political index based on principal component analysis, which extracts the unobserved common factors of different political regime variables, and that reduces model uncertainty and therefore gives a proxy for political regime characteristics with more explanatory power. Thirdly, we make use of panel time-series analysis that deals with relatively thin panels and that tackles interesting empirical issues such as non-stationarity, heterogeneity bias, and between-country dependence in long panels. These empirical issues were (understandably) not always covered by the previous studies which took advantage of large panel data sets and analysis. Consequently, as informative as these previous studies proved to be, they did not explicitly study the South American case. Therefore, such methodological disaggregation allows us to deepen our knowledge of the region. Hence, in the vein of Sargent et al. (2009), who specifically study the hyperinflationary and stabilisation processes in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Peru—and who suggest that the change, in one way or another, in the fiscal fundamentals not only generated the hyperinflationary bursts, but also played a role in stabilisation—we are able to study and better understand the South American case, with all its idiosyncrasies, instead of treating the region either as a dummy or as an outlier to be removed from the sample, which is usually done in large cross-sectional and panel studiesFootnote 2. Or to put it differently, we are able to avoid generalisations about democratisation processes taking place in unequal societies that are not always warranted. All in all, we can loosely suggest that, although recently the region has had leaders like Lula (the former Brazilian president), Morales in Bolivia and the Kirchners in Argentina—presidents who would fit the bill as the perfect archtype of a South American populist—the region so far has not seen any episode of poor macroeconomic performance like the ones in the 1980s and early 1990s. This is suggestive of the fact that the region nowadays has by far better political and economic institutions, like houses of representatives with less and better consolidated political parties, more independent central banks and fiscal responsibility laws, than at the point of re-democratisation and that those institutions are playing a role in keeping the continent (or the prospective populists more constrained) economically more stable than in the past. The remainder of this paper is as follows: the next subsection briefly reviews and inserts this paper within the previous literature. Section 2 describes the data and the empirical strategy used, and then reports and discusses the results. Section 3 concludes; it summarises the work, and suggests some policy implications and also future work. The literature on the political determinants of macroeconomic performance has consistently attracted the attention of the profession for some time, and Paldam (1987) presents early descriptive evidence—with a sample of eight Latin American countries covering the period 1946–1984 and that includes the likes of Argentina, Brazil and Peru—and which given the date it was published, does not take into account the hyperinflationary bursts of the 1990s, that suggests that civilian governments tend to generate higher inflation than military ones in Latin America. In similar vein, Sachs (1989), and Dornbusch and Edwards (1990) descriptively highlight the issue of recently elected governments pursuing redistributive populist policies in Latin America particularly in the 1980s wave of democratisation. In addition, Alesina and Drazen (1991) theoretically suggest that in more “polarised” societies, or in societies with higher income inequality, stabilisations are delayed (stabilisations come only after some “political consolidation” takes place, or after an agreement on which group pays for the stabilisation is reached). This is particularly important for the South American case, not only because it presents high income inequality, but also because, roughly speaking, stabilisation came only after a nine-year delay following the implementation of democracy. In similar vein, Veiga (2000) provides evidence—for the period 1957–1996 and with a sample of ten countries that includes Argentina, Brazil and Peru—that in more fragmented societies, or societies with a large number of political parties in congress, stabilisations tend to be delayed. The latter is also related to the South American experience right after re-democratisation in which the number of political parties was by far higher than 10 years after re-democratisation, which suggests that a process of political consolidation with less, but more structured political coalitions, has been taking place in the region. Moreover, Beetsma and Van Der Ploeg (1996) argue—theoretically and empirically (they run cross-country regressions of inflation against inequality for the period 1960–1985)—that in unequal societies, and South America fits the bill again, the government tries to please the median voter, or the poor in this case, via redistribution; and, although not dealing specifically with South America, Desai et al. (2003), use a large panel data set and OLS and Fixed Effects estimators, to suggest that it all depends on how unequal a country is (democratisation taking place in unequal countries lead to populist policies and hence high inflation, a factor that can, again, be related to the South American case)Footnote 3. Furthermore, Acemoglu et al. (2003) suggest that distortionary macroeconomic policies, which include inflation volatility, that retard economic growth are symptoms of “weak institutions”, or not properly constrained executives; and Acemoglu et al. (2008) estimate panel regressions to suggest that policy reforms, like the implementation of central bank independence, are only successful when the “political context” is right (e.g., Zimbabwe implemented central bank independence in 1995, however it has been plagued with hyperinflation since 2000 when the constraints on the executive were severely curtailed). Finally, Acemoglu et al. (2011) construct a theoretical model which predicts that even if the democratic coalition coming into power is not necessarily from the left, it will nevertheless attempt to signal to the median voter, via particular redistributive policies, that it is not from the right either. This is also related to the South American experience in the sense that Alfonsín and Sarney were not representatives of any left-wing coalition, however populist policies were pursued during their presidential terms, which lead to higher inflation rates. Essentially, the literature suggests that the implementation of democracy in developing and unequal countries should be accompanied not only by the right political context, or well-constrained executives, but also by the right economic institutions (e.g., a responsible and independent treasury and central bank respectively), so that the likelihood of economic crisis and delayed stabilisations in young democracies could be minimised. The above fits rather well with the South American experience, a re-democratisation process in an unequal region without much political maturity (e.g., Dornbusch and Edwards 1990), at least in terms of number of political parties in congress (presumably an overlooked factor that works as a constraint on the executive) during and right after democratisation (Veiga 2000), and also without the necessary economic institutions in place—fiscal rules and central-bank independence came only towards the end of the 1990s (Acemoglu et al. 2008)—resulted in a long spell of populist policies and consequently poor macroeconomic performance in the region, with all its costs to economic welfare. A counterexample in this case is the fact that the continent has recently seen a renewed wave of what one would argue to be examples of populist politicians (e.g., Lula, Morales and the Kirchners), however so far those countries have not experienced episodes of high rates of inflation, which is an indication of the role of the political consolidation and of the better economic institutions that are now in place in the continent in keeping the region economically stable. All in all, the theoretical literature provides us with concepts like inequality, democratisation, delayed stabilisations and institutions, concepts which we borrow freely and adapt to the South American case, and which allows us to provide interesting interpretations of the results. Moreover, we build on the empirical literature (which has made use mostly of cross-sectional and large panel analyses) and make use of the relatively novel panel time-series analysis which—without having to rely on large aggregations, nor interaction terms, nor dummy variables—allows us to have a more in-depth view of the continent.",13

Eterovic,Nicolás A. Eterovic,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Defining democracy is a major task. Yet, an even greater challenge is trying to understand the impact of democracy on economic outcomes. Nevertheless, researchers in economics and political science have not been discouraged: much research both theoretical and empirical has been done in recent years analyzing the role of political institutions as the drivers of public policy and economic development (e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Boix 2003; Persson and Tabellini 2003; Dahl 1971). Democracy comprises a number of complex components. Two of the most noted ingredients in modern day democracy are electoral participation and political competition. By political competition we understand the extent to which political power is freely contested by political parties, pressure groups or other organized factions within a defined political structure. Electoral participation, on the other hand, is related to the rights of individual citizens to participate in the selection of their government through elections and referenda and the extent to which they exercise this right. The distinction between electoral participation and political competition is implicitly or explicitly embodied in many definitions of democracy (e.g., Powell 1982; Przeworski et al. 2000). However, most empirical work focus on only one aspect of democracy, studying the impact of political competition or electoral participation on policy outcomes in isolation or using an aggregate definition of democracy and therefore neglecting its multidimensional characteristics.Footnote 1 We try to fill the gap in the literature by exploring simultaneously the individual effects of political competition and electoral participation on policy outcomes. Many studies suggest the existence of a negative relationship between political competition and the size of government (Rogers and Rogers 2000; Skilling and Zeckhauser 2002; Ferris et al. 2008; Aidt and Jensen 2009a; Aidt et al. 2006). However, there are some studies that disagree. For example, Holbrook and Van Dunk (1993) show that political competition increases the size of US state government, through an increase in Medicare generosity and in disability protection. Similarly, the literature on electoral participation and the size of government although more uniformly supportive of the existence of a positive relationship, also remains inconclusive. The extension of the voting franchise (with implies a major increase in voting participation) seems to lead to substantial increases in social spending and more modest increases in total government spending (Husted and Kenny 1997). Using a panel of US states for the period 1860–1940, Lott and Kenny (1999) show that granting women the right to vote ended in an expansion of government spending. Lindert (1994) and Aidt and Dallal (2008) find that the enfranchisement of women expanded social expending. Aidt and Eterovic (2011) find that reforms that removed literacy restrictions from the voting franchise had a positive effect on government spending in twentieth century Latin America. Higher electoral participation is associated with larger governments (Mueller and Stratmann 2003; Boix 2003, chapter 5). Using a world sample, Boix (2001) finds that higher electoral turnout has a positive impact on the size of government and that this effect increases with the level of economic development. Lindert (1996) finds that voting turnout had little impact on total government spending in OECD countries during the period 1960–1980, although it did contribute to increasing social spending. Also for OECD countries, Iversen and Cusack (2000) argue that each percentage increase in the electoral participation raises government consumption by about 0.15 %. However, there exists evidence that points in the opposite direction. Aidt et al. (2008) did not find evidence that the extension of the electoral franchise had any impact on the size of government in western Europe before the World War II. Furthermore, Aidt and Jensen (2009b), found that franchise reforms reduced the likelihood of income taxation. In this paper, we build on research done by Aidt and Eterovic (2011) who show that electoral participation and political competition have different implications on the size of government in 18 Latin American countries. We expand their work in at least two ways. First, we test the hypothesis that political competition and electoral participation affect government expenditure differently in a much larger world sample, covering more than 100 countries. Second, we show the stability of our findings across regions and econometric specifications. Finally, as in Aidt and Eterovic (2011) we contribute to the existing empirical literature, which isolates the effects of either political competition or electoral participation, by studying the two dimensions jointly. In our study, we first estimate the impact of political competition and electoral participation on (central) fiscal expenditure around the world. We then explore how robust are our results by running a battery of tests which include controlling for compulsory voting regimes, including fiscal lags and using instrumental variables technique, specifically a System-GMM estimation. Our analysis is based on a panel data set with information on fiscal expenditure (for central governments) in 104 countries for the period 1960–2000. To measure political competition we use the Polity IV index (Marshall and Jaggers 2007), and to measure electoral participation we use turnout in elections and referenda (Vanhanen 2000, 2003a). These variables are available for long periods of time and a broad set of countries which allow us to exploit the often substantial variation in electoral participation and political competition within the countries. In most studies, the Polity IV index is interpreted as a measure of democracy, but, as we shall detail in Sect. 2, a careful reading of the Polity IV manual suggests that it is more accurate to interpret it as a measure of political competition. Many studies, e.g., (Boix (2003), chapter 5), Mulligan et al. (2004), Persson and Tabellini (2006), and Kenny and Winer (2006) use a “world” sample that includes as many countries as possible to study the link between fiscal structures and political institutions. The advantage of this approach is that the variation in institutional differences is maximized, but at the same time, countries included in a world sample represent very different economic, geographical, social and cultural experiences. In our estimations we use a large set of control variables to try to control for country and region heterogeneity. We also estimate separate regressions for each main geographical areas which are more likely to fulfill the homogeneity conditions to use a panel. However, we acknowledge the importance of peculiar, local specificities in the histories of the countries we study. The main conclusion we draw from our analysis is that our estimations strongly support the hypothesis that electoral participation and political competition have opposite effects on the size of government. Higher levels of political competition tend to be associated to smaller governments. On the other hand, countries with higher levels of electoral participation tend to be associated to larger governments. This result is remarkably robust across geographical areas and econometric specifications. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the distinction between political competition and electoral participation, deriving testable implications from the public choice literature and discussing how we obtain operational measures of political competition and electoral participation. We also present our econometric specification. In Sect. 3, we present our main results, discuss how these add to the current research and run a battery of robustness test. In Sect. 4, we provide concluding remarks and discuss the issue of causality in detail. Appendix contains a detailed discussion of data and sources.",9

Austin et al. (2006) suggest that this is frequently the result of the inability of people to pay for needed services. The entrepreneur satisfies the necessities by offering subsidized goods or services as complements to the market supply. Examples are manifold: Soup kitchens distribute balanced food, homeless shelters offer nighttime residence, charity shops sell donated second-hand goods, and micro-insurance schemes provide basic health security. However, the availability of third-party funds to finance those businesses might be insufficient to meet the entire demand. In coping with the arising problems of excess demand and rationing, the social entrepreneur is confronted with two general decisions: Which and how many needy people will be served? The provision of eligible customers must then be ensured through an adequate mix of rationing instruments. According to Steinberg and Weisbrod (1998), such instruments are diverse forms of user fees, eligibility criteria, queues, waiting lists, quality dilution, product bundling, and so on. In Germany, for example, food pantries typically allocate their products by applying a mix of user fees and poverty criteria. Rohrmann (2009) reports that the fraction of pantries that formulate eligibility requirements varied between 76.2 percent (2002) and 96 percent (2007). User fees were charged by 65 percent (2002) and 89 percent (2007) of the organizations, and differed between 0.50 and 2.00 Euro per food ration. Theoretically, these differences in rationing practices cause different allocations of food, i.e., quantities and compositions of recipients. For example, pantries that do not charge user fees but demand a proof of income can be expected to serve a smaller and poorer group of recipients on average than organizations that do not apply eligibility requirements but charge a fee. In this paper we propose a positive model of the social entrepreneur’s pricing decision in the light of other exogenously given third-party funds.Footnote 1 We examine two effects of charging uniform user fees on the composition and number of recipients. On the one hand, charging a fee excludes the lowest-income individuals, who are typically considered to be the most needy. On the other hand, the entrepreneur’s budget is enlarged, thus enabling her to serve more needy individuals. Given that excess demand is not completely eliminated by the user fee, we assume that the entrepreneur has a non-price-rationing instrument at hand to achieve a utility-maximizing allocation. Although similar allocation decisions have been analyzed in the literature, the underlying objectives of nonprofit institutions are highly controversial. The variety of objectives ranges from the maximization of service, budget, and usage to the maximization of the number of users (Steinberg 1986; Brooks 2005; Ansari et al. 1996). All of these approaches describe a social entrepreneur who extends the project size by charging recipients a fee until all applying individuals are served. However, they do not explain why many organizations charge no user fee but, at the same time, face excess demand. We overcome this problem by assuming that the entrepreneurial objective function accounts for the individuals’ payment abilities. Specifically, the entrepreneur places a value on each individual’s consumption of the good or service, which reflects her attitude toward poverty and, thus, is negatively correlated with the individual’s income. The entrepreneur’s objective is to maximize the total amount of these values over all individuals served. This assumption is in line with Nichols et al. (1971), who claim that the willingness of the public to assist an individual is higher the poorer the individual is. Therefore, we refer to the entrepreneurial attitude as “poverty aversion.” We show how this motive provides a clear understanding of how nonprofit organizations trade-off the number and the composition of recipients with regard to their income. Moreover, we explain the empirical observations concerning different applications of user fees and non-price-rationing instruments, as in the case of the German food pantries. Most closely related to our approach is the model of Steinberg and Weisbrod (2005), who characterize pricing and rationing decisions of nonprofit organizations that seek to maximize the weighted sum of the consumers’ surpluses. Their model allows for price discrimination, and they analyze equilibrium prices in comparison to marginal costs and reservation prices. A similarly defined utility function can be found in Feldstein (1972). Our model differs primarily in two ways. First, our objective function is a modification of the maximand given in Steinberg and Weisbrod (2005). Specifically, the entrepreneur values individuals with respect to their reservation price but does not consider the weighted consumer surplus. This allows for an explanation of why nonprofits serve individuals who cannot afford to bid for the good or service, for free, although their reservation price and, thus, their consumer surplus equals zero. Second, we do not consider price discrimination, thereby accounting for the large portion of nonprofits that charge uniform prices. The organization and results of the paper second as follows. In the second section we introduce a model of the entrepreneur’s decision, which accounts for the level of poverty aversion, the structure of the market, and the applicable rationing mechanisms. In Sect. 3 we provide optimality conditions and formally prove the existence of corner solutions and interior utility maxima that imply positive user fees. Section 4 analyzes a variation in third-party funds. We find three entrepreneurial reactions. First, there is a particular level of poverty aversion at which the user-fee revenues are reduced by exactly the same amount by which third-party funds are increased; hence, the project volume remains unchanged. In contrast, entrepreneurs with a higher poverty aversion react with a reduction in the project volume, whereas entrepreneurs with a lower aversion widen the scope of their service. We conclude in Sect. 5 with a discussion of these results.",3
14.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,30 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-012-0118-6,Financial integration in autocracies: Greasing the wheel or more to steal?,February 2013,Ramin Dadasov,Philipp Harms,Oliver Lorz,Male,Male,Male,Male,"For more than three decades now, we have been observing substantial increases in cross-border capital flows. Between 1970 and 2004 the ratio of total foreign assets and liabilities to GDP increased in the industrial countries by a factor of six, and in the emerging and developing nations by a factor of three (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 2007). This process accelerated in the 1990s, when international organizations, in particular the IMF, began promoting liberalization of the financial accounts in developing countries (Rodrik and Subramanian 2009).Footnote 1
 Against this background, it is not surprising that a broad literature deals with the impact of financial integration on economic performance. Several authors point out that capital mobility may not only have direct economic effects—due to a more efficient international allocation of capital—but that it may also bring further indirect, “collateral” benefits. These indirect channels may work through improving the institutional quality and governance in the host countries, the development of domestic financial markets, or the maintenance of macroeconomic discipline (see Kose et al. 2009a; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2008; Obstfeld 2009). A closer look at the data, however, suggests that one should not be too optimistic with regard to the benefits of financial integration in this respect. In many countries, financial integration has gone along with a deterioration of the institutional quality. Figure 1 illustrates this for a sample of 82 emerging markets and developing economies. It depicts the change in the International Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG) measure of the absence of corruption between 1998 and 2005 against the volume of capital inflows per capita in the same time span.Footnote 2 The results of running a simple regression based on these data are displayed in Table 1. Both the scatterplot and the regression results indicate that larger capital inflows were correlated with a perceived increase in corruption. As column 2 of Table 1 demonstrates, this result does not change if we remove what might be an extreme data point in terms of capital outflows (Gabon). And it is also supported by a probit regression in which we regress the likelihood of seeing perceived corruption increase on average capital inflows per capita between 1998 and 2005 (column 3). Of course, the low \(R^2\) of these regressions indicate that many other factors may also drive the change in corruption. Still, our observations caution against an overly optimistic view on the relationship between financial globalization and institutional quality. Average financial account balance per capita (in US dollars) and change in the ICRG’s measure of corruption between 1998 and 2005. Note that a higher value of the ICRG measure reflects a lower extent of corruption In this paper we develop a theoretical framework that can be used to explain the above observations. Considering countries which are ruled by non-democratic regimes, we argue that financial integration gives the ruling elite additional incentives to implement inefficient expropriatory policies, which we interpret as a worsening of economic institutions. This outcome holds even though financial integration may have a positive long run impact on the de facto political power of the general population. Our understanding of the determinants of institutional quality is based on ideas by Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2006) and Acemoglu et al. (2005), who consider the interplay between political and economic institutions.Footnote 3 Formally, our framework builds on Acemoglu (2006a, b), who develops a closed economy model in which the ruling elite extracts rents from the general population and is, at the same time, concerned with securing its political power. We consider a capital-importing country with a political system that can be described as a dictatorship by the elite. The general population consists of entrepreneurs and workers while the ruling elite is economically passive. In every period, the elite decides on the rate at which it expropriates the general population. In addition to economic costs, expropriation is associated with political costs for the elite, which result from the general population’s ability to oppose the elite’s rent extraction. The size of these political costs can be interpreted as a measure of the general population’s de facto political power. Using this framework, we analyze the consequences of financial integration for both the rate of expropriation and the political power of the non-elite. Financial integration—interpreted as an improved access to foreign capital—works like a positive technology shock and raises profits of entrepreneurs who borrow abroad to finance the capital used in production.Footnote 4 For a given political power of the general population this creates an incentive for the elite to raise the rate of expropriation. To analyze the dynamic effects of capital market integration, we first assume that the elite behaves myopically. Whereas the “rate of expropriation” still increases as a result of financial integration, the long run effects are now weaker, because the political power of the general population grows over time. Hence, the rate of expropriation initially overshoots above its new long-run equilibrium level. A forward-looking elite additionally takes into account the influence of the current income on the future political power of the general population, and therefore expropriates more aggressively than a myopic elite. The expropriation effect of financial liberalization may dominate the decline in the capital costs in this case, such that the political influence of the general population may decrease after financial integration. Our paper is related to a growing literature on the institutional effects of financial globalization. In Acemoglu and Robinson (2006), capital imports may reduce income inequality between workers and capital owners, making the rise of a democratic society more likely. Moreover, since capital as a tax base can react more elastically, redistributive taxes are lower in an open economy. According to Bourguignon and Verdier (2005), international financial integration reduces the incentives for ruling capitalists to subsidize education, which results in a decline in the political power of the poor. Gourinchas and Jeanne (2005) distinguish two types of equilibria with capital mobility: A “good” equilibrium with capital inflows and productivity-enhancing political reforms and an equilibrium in which bad institutions are in place and capital stays away from the country. Rajan and Zingales (2003) focus on the interest group influence of industrial incumbents on the development of financial institutions. They argue that these incumbents view financial development more favorably if countries open up for both trade and capital flows.Footnote 5
 Furthermore, the basic mechanism of our model, through which financial integration may cause more expropriation, can be applied to a broader context in which income gains result in more distortionary policies in an environment with weak institutions. In particular, there is a strong link of our framework to the literature on the “political resource curse”. Comparable to the access to foreign capital, a better endowment with natural resources may create an incentive for the ruling elite to increase the rate of expropriation.Footnote 6 In our paper, financial integration differs from a resource boom insofar as the improved access to foreign capital also changes the political costs of expropriation by directly influencing the income of the non-elite. Finally, our paper is related to several political-economical studies on the behavior of dictatorships. For example Olson and McGuire (1996) provide a theoretical model, in which the autocratic ruler faces a general trade-off between inefficient rent extraction and productivity-enhancing policies.Footnote 7 As in our framework, a rational ruler raises the distortive tax rate as a result of an exogenous productivity gain in the private sector. In contrast to Olson and McGuire (1996), we additionally analyze the determinants and dynamics of the political costs of inefficient policies. The remainder of our paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the economic framework and derives comparative static results on the effects of financial liberalization in a static environment. In Sect. 3 we analyze the dynamics of political power with a myopic elite, and in Sect. 4 we extend our framework to consider a forward-looking elite. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.",2

14.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,11 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-012-0120-z,Political selection of public servants and parliamentary oversight,February 2013,Thomas Braendle,Alois Stutzer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The oversight of the government and the subordinate public service is one of the constitutional core duties of the members of parliament in a democracy. It is a key aspect of the checks and balances in a system adhering to the principle of the separation of powers. Parliamentary oversight is instituted to restrict the abuse of government authority and to maintain incentives to efficiently provide public goods and services. For its constitutional mandate, the parliament has access to various instruments, such as the power to pass the budget, the installation of committees of inquiriy and the submission of parliamentary interpellations. Even though economists and political scientists alike emphasize the importance of legislative oversight to hold governments accountable, it is more often than not abstracted from the actual parliamentary control process in scientific work.Footnote 1
 In this paper, we intend to contribute to a better understanding of the parliamentary oversight process in three directions. First, we explicitly study the use of parliamentary control instruments. Second, we consider parliamentary control as the result of political selection and of the institutional structure determining political competition. Third, with regard to political selection, we focus on the role of public servants as legislators in parliamentary control.Footnote 2 We understand political selection as the process and the result of any systematic effect of institutions on the composition of political bodies. As to parliamentary control, political selection affects the composition of the legislature in terms of its members’ individual control costs and individual motivation. The two aspects are difficult to separate though. The cost of control efforts can be lower due to skills, knowledge, an information advantage or a specific motivation to control (e.g., due to public service motivation or civic duty, etc.). We argue that the selection of public servants into legislatures is of particular interest for understanding how political selection affects parliamentary oversight. First, parliaments across the world differ widely in the fraction of (former) public servants in their compositional structure. In the United States or the United Kingdom, there are relatively few former public servants in the national parliament as they are ineligible to run for a seat. In contrast, in the legislatures of Denmark, Austria or Germany, for example, the share of public servants has often reached more than 40 % since World War II. Second, public servants might systematically differ in terms of their individual cost and motivation for parliamentary control. On the one hand, the selection of public servants to the legislature can serve as a check. If the information asymmetry between the public service and the legislature is severe (as, e.g., pointed out by Niskanen 1971), electing insiders to parliament who become accountable to the electorate might help to align interests between principals and agents. Public servants in parliament who dispose of an information advantage with respect to public service issues and who face lower control costs enhance the monitoring competence of the elected assemblies. On the other hand, public servants in parliament compromise the principle of the (personal) separation of powers and thus face a conflict of interests. This is due to their double role as agents in public service and as principals that supervise the public service in parliament. In sum, it is an open question whether the specific motivation and individual control costs of public servants in parliament lead to more or less parliamentary oversight for a given level of political competition. The focus of our analysis refers to this latter question. In addition, we lay out a general framework of parliamentary oversight based on the dispersed literature on this issue. This provides a theoretical rationale for a set of further determinants taken into account in the empirical analysis. While we mainly treat them as control variables, we consider them interesting as such. We empirically study parliamentary oversight for the institutional context of Germany and its sixteen Laender (as the federal states are called). We do this for mainly two reasons: First, parliamentary control of the government and its subordinate public service is a main task of the members of parliament in the German Laender. Most new law is enacted on the federal level while the Laender have to implement and administer it. Second, members of parliament with a public sector background are a striking feature of politics in Germany. For instance in 1988, no less than 61.6 % of the seats in parliament in Baden-Württemberg were held by public servants. With respect to the instruments of parliamentary control, we focus on the most widespread instruments; i.e., major and minor interpellations and oral inquiries.Footnote 3 By asking for detailed information and evaluations with regard to the efficient use of public funds, interpellations critically control government behavior. Information about the use of these control instruments is publicly available, subject to media attention, and individually attributable. As an illustration, we refer to the air fare scandal (Düsseldorfer Flugaffäre) of the government of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1998–2000. In February, 1998, a minor interpellation with the title “Do members of the government of North Rhine-Westphalia use company jets of the bank WestLB” was submitted and aimed at gaining information on why, when, where to and at whose expense, members of the government (ab-)used the company jets. The unsatisfactory government reply contributed to further political and media attention and led to the appointment of a committee of inquiry investigating the issue in more detail in 1999–2000. Johannes Rau (President of North Rhine-Westphalia at this time and former President of Germany) admitted errors regarding the conduct in office and Heinz Schleusser (Finance Minister) resigned due to serious accusation.Footnote 4 This example shows how interpellations are relevant for the political process and for constituents’ evaluations of a politician’s performance. We take the use of these instruments to be positively related to the strictness of parliamentary oversight. For the empirical analysis, a unique time-series cross-sectional data set has been compiled covering three different quantitative measures of parliamentary control, spanning the period from 1946 to 2009. Additionally, we gathered data on the fraction of public servants elected to parliament and collected information on the electoral system, the form of government, alternations in (coalition) government, the ideology of government, the margin of victory in electoral races, the number of parties, the seat share of the Social Democrats, and the length of legislative periods. We find a positive correlation between the political selection variable; i.e., the fraction of public servants in parliament, and the number of parliamentary inquiries submitted. This holds in particular for minor interpellations; i.e., the main individual control instrument for efficiency control. The result is confirmed if we apply an instrumental variable approach instrumenting the fraction of public servants in parliament with its institutional determinants. The effect of public servants on the use of minor interpellations seems thereby driven by variation at the beginning of our observation period and to attenuate in later years. Consistent with our aggregate findings is qualitative evidence from in-depth analyses of individual-level behavior of public servants during parliamentary debates by Schrode (1977). He reports that public servants are more active and more critical regarding government behavior in the parliamentary process than members from other sectors. This is especially the case in public service matters. In addition, we find a generally positive level effect of a mixed-member electoral system on the number of parliamentary inquiries. This effect is, however, identified based on institutional reforms in only three Laender. In mixed-member electoral systems a fraction of the legislature is elected through a majoritarian procedure (rather than through a proportional procedure). A majoritarian procedure is understood to increase political competition as individual candidates can be held accountable by the electorate. This study contributes to the research on political selection and on the comparative institutional analysis of parliamentary control. With regard to the former aspect, related recent empirical and theoretical work has been conducted by researchers such as Besley (2005), Braendle and Stutzer (2011), Caselli and Morelli (2004), Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004), Gagliarducci et al. (2010), Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2012), Galasso and Nannicini (2011), and van Aaken and Voigt (2011). As to parliamentary oversight, this is related to the (often US-specific) analysis of oversight relationships and bargaining processes between the bureaucracy and the legislator (Banks and Weingast 1992; Calvert et al. 1989; Moe 1989; Niskanen 1971; Niskanen 1975; Ogul and Rockman 1990; Rosenthal 1981; Weingast and Moran 1983), the (legislative) design of administrative procedures and ex ante control (Bawn 1995, 1997; McCubbins et al. 1987), and the separation of powers (Persson et al. 1997; Grossman and Helpman 2008). Our analysis also contributes to the limited body of research on the effectiveness of legislators (Grant and Kelly 2008; Padro i Miquel and Snyder 2006; Shiller 1995), and the German political science literature dealing with state legislatures and governmental-parliamentary relationships (Holtmann and Patzelt 2004; Patzelt 2005). Section 2 presents the main theoretical arguments about the incentives for parliamentary control with a focus on public servants elected to parliament. Section 3 deals with the German institutional background. In Sect. 4, the data sets and the econometric analysis are presented. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",10
14.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,08 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-012-0121-y,The efficacy and efforts of interest groups in post elections policy formation,February 2013,Gil S. Epstein,Yosef Mealem,Shmuel Nitzan,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the post-elections political game, the selected policy hinges on the complex interaction between political parties, interest groups and the legislature. The outcome of this game takes into account the political and economic constraints that determine the feasible policy space, the political power and ideology of the parties, the objectives and actions of the interest groups and the mechanism selecting the policy outcome in the legislature. The current study proposes a political economy model of policy formation in the legislature involving interest groups (lobbies) and political parties, whereby the interaction between lobbies is modeled as a contest in which the winner obtains the implementation of his most preferred ‘target policy’. Political parties have a given ideological predisposition toward target policies and are not strategic players in the game. Their power within the legislature is also exogenously given. Within this set-up, our first objective is to present a new stylized model that sheds light on the conditions that ensure the effectiveness of an interest group. That is, the conditions for the success of an interest group to influence the policy outcome in its favor by engaging in the lobbying contest that determines the final outcome in the legislature. Our second objective is to study the relationship between the nature of the existing political parties (their power and ideological predisposition) and the intensity of the contest between the interest groups as measured by their exerted efforts. The empirical significance of the proposed model is illustrated by describing a few examples and stylized facts it can explain. Suppose that the feasible policy set includes the target policies of two interest groups. In the post-elections phase on which we focus, the policy outcome is selected by the legislature (the elected representatives who are members of two or more political parties), taking into account the already given ideological predispositions and power of the existing parties and the lobbying activity of the interest groups. Our majoritarian setting is general because it includes both a two-party system and a multi-party proportional representation electoral system. The legislature consists of two blocks of parties: the ruling coalition that has an absolute majority and the opposition. Note that the ruling coalition and the opposition may consist of a single party. In case of a two-party system, the coalition and the opposition consist of a single party. To facilitate the reading, henceforth the term ‘party’ refers to a single ruling (majority) party or a single opposition (minority) party as well as to blocks of parties, viz., the coalition or opposition that, in general, include more than one party. Likewise, the term ‘parties’ will refer to the case of two (majority and minority) parties as well as to the coalition and opposition blocks of parties. The ideological predisposition of the existing parties or their degree of ideological homogeneity is defined in terms of the weights assigned to the target policies of the interest groups. These weights can be interpreted as the proportion of elected party representatives, henceforth ‘party representatives’, supporting the two target policies of the interest groups. Typically party representatives have similar views regarding primary ideological dimensions. We interpret the policy issue in question as a secondary issue, which is not necessarily related to the ideological dimension that distinguishes between the existing parties (e.g. the attitude regarding the desirable size of the public sector), but to issues such as the desirable degree of regulating CO\(_{2}\) emissions or of regulating the financial system. In other words, we allow two interest groups to lobby the members of two parties, given that there are only two policy options that do not relate to the parties’ platform choices. This interpretation justifies our assumption regarding the possible existence of pragmatic parties whose representatives at the legislature support the two secondary policy positions. The second characteristic of the parties is their power—the proportion of seats in the legislature controlled by the party via its elected representatives. Applying the above components of the political environment, it is assumed that without any intervention of the interest groups, given the feasible policy space, the policy outcome in the legislature is determined probabilistically on the basis of the ideological predispositions of the parties and their power. The randomness in the legislature’s decision making reflects the effect of the probabilistic nature of the party representatives’ voting both under the assumption that party discipline is not enforced or enforced. Members of the legislature may not participate in the vote because of absence or vote in a volatile manner in contrast to their declared ideological disposition. The assumed particular dependence of the policy outcome on the party characteristics reflects the democratic nature of the legislature; the application of (simple) majority rule under un-enforced party discipline. Alternatively, in a multi-party proportional representation electoral system with enforced party discipline, the outcome in the legislature hinges just on the random voting of the representatives who are members of the ruling coalition that has an absolute majority. The activity of the interest groups is induced by their ability and desire to affect the final policy outcome in the legislature. In our model of policy formation, the interest groups put efforts and engage in a lobbying contest that affects the choice probability of their target policy. To examine the effect of the interest groups on the final policy outcome in the legislature, we assume that the policy outcome in the legislature depends on the resources directed by the interest groups to the party representatives and that the effectiveness of these resources hinges on the support of the party representatives in the target policies of the interest groups weighted by the power of the parties. Under this type of contests, we clarify the relationship between the already determined exogenous party characteristics and the intensity of the contest (the resources expended by the players in the contest game, viz., by the competing interest groups). Since it is naturally recognized that institutions and interest groups, in particular, matter, we will examine the effectiveness of interest groups by examining whether their simultaneous involvement in a contest changes the selected policy in their favor. Without their contest activity, the random policy outcome hinges just on the power and ideological predisposition of the existing parties. When the interest groups take part in the contest, the policy outcome also depends on their efforts, namely, the resources they direct to the party members. Our first objective is to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the efficacy of an interest group. These conditions can be used to determine the relationship between the initial and final (before and after the contest takes place) advantage of a target policy of an interest group. In particular, we clarify whether an initial advantage of a policy (a prior probability of selection higher than 0.5) is necessarily preserved, or whether such an initial advantage can be overturned. These conditions are determined, first, assuming un-enforced party discipline. In this case, the interest groups direct their lobbying efforts to members of all the parties because their potential supporters are usually members of both the coalition and opposition parties. And, since party discipline is not enforced, the potential support is effective when the legislature makes its decision regarding the final policy outcome. We then study the condition for the efficacy of an interest group, assuming enforced party discipline. In this case, lobbying efforts are directed just to the members of the ruling coalition (party) before the party line is decided.Footnote 1 Given the conditions for the efficacy of an interest group under un-enforced and enforced party discipline, we can compare the desirability of enforced and unenforced party discipline from the viewpoint of the interest groups as well as from the social point of view. In the former case, the probability of becoming effective is used as the criterion applied by an interest group. In the latter case, we apply the aggregate efforts incurred by the interest groups as the social welfare criterion. The second objective of the paper is to examine the relationship between the already shaped party characteristics (their power and ideological heterogeneity) and the intensity of the contest between the interest groups as measured by their aggregate efforts. In particular, we focus on parties with extreme characteristics that are often obtained as equilibrium outcomes in models of electoral equilibrium, i.e. symmetric parties with converging ideological predispositions and polarized parties with extreme different ideological predispositions. More generally, for any pattern of party characteristics, we examine the effect of changes in the parameters of our model (the degree of ideological heterogeneity of a party, the power distribution of the parties and the stakes of the interest groups) on the contestants’ efforts (intensity of the contest). We also compare the lobbying efforts of the interest groups under un-enforced and enforced party discipline. Political parties and special interest groups are basic characteristics of democracies. The party ideologies, internal composition and political power influence the policy chosen by the legislature. Such policy is also affected by the activities of interest groups, typically various forms of direct lobbying, informational lobbying and campaign contributions. The influence activities of interest groups are directed both to politicians competing for power before the elections who are the prospective rulers or to elected politicians and already functioning government officials. The literature on party modeling focuses on endogenous party formation. Likewise, in the electoral-competition literature, the emphasis is on the determination of the party platforms or pre-elections preferred policies and on the secured support of voters in the competing parties. In our model the parties are already shaped and we take their ideological inclination or degree of heterogeneity as well as their political power as given. In the special interest-group literature, attention is directed to the formation of the groups, to the relationship between interest groups and political parties or to the relationship between interest groups and the ruling politicians or bureaucrats (van Winden 1999; Wittman 2009). In one still growing part of this literature, the methodology of political contests is used to study the effect of lobbying and influence activities by interest groups on the decisions of the ruling politicians or government officials (Konrad 2009). For various attempts to examine public policy determination in contests see Epstein and Nitzan (2007). In our model, the contest methodology is applied to examine whether the resources expended by the already formed interest groups (resources that are directed to the elected party representatives) are effective, namely, whether they are able to change the policy outcome in their favor. Notice that the parties are assumed to be effective via their representatives in determining the decision of the legislature regarding the final policy outcome. Our study combines the effect of the interest groups to that of the parties in order to examine the policy outcome of the legislature. In contrast to the approach of Grossman and Helpman (2001), as well as Epstein and Nitzan (2007), we focus on the strategic interaction between the interest groups, disregarding the strategic interaction between interest groups and policy makers and the strategic interaction between the parties or between their representatives. The effect of the interest groups on the final policy outcome is determined through their effect on the party representatives, given the assumed relationship between the ideological predispositions and power of the parties, the efforts of the interest groups and the decision of the legislature. The literature on campaign contributions proposes two motives of interest groups: an electoral motive and influence motive. The former motive does not apply in our setting because the platforms and the power of the parties are already determined. The latter motive applies in our setting, not because interest groups influence politicians’ positions, but because they influence the abilities of the party representatives to affect the final policy outcome in the legislature. Given our focus on the post elections phase, our modeling is distinctive in its enabling the clarification of the role of party characteristics (power and heterogeneity) on the intensity of the contest between the interest groups (the aggregate resources directed to the parties by the contestants).Footnote 2
 Finally, our interest groups do not offer contingent contributions as in Becker (1983) or Grossman and Helpman (2001). Their efforts are unconditional because they directly affect their effectiveness in the legislature. While our model has antecedents in the probabilistic voting literature, rather than viewing the decisions of the voters or their preferences as probabilistic (Austen-Smith 1987; Coughlin and Nitzan 1981; Intriligator 1973) we assume that the decisions of the legislature are probabilistic. The proposed model of interest groups’ influence on post-elections politics relates to interesting phenomenon in many political-economic environments and it should be tested empirically. But concepts such as ideological inclination of parties and stakes of interest groups are rather complex concepts and their measurement may pose a severe challenge. Nevertheless, to illustrate the empirical relevance of the model let us focus on the problem of “extremism”; religious, economic, political or cultural extremism of political parties or of interest groups. Since the end of the Second World War, increased or reduced ideological polarization between political parties and interest groups can be observed in many societies. For example, ideological polarization has apparently been reduced regarding issues such as environmental policy, reducing the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the need of government intervention in the regulation of the economy and, in particular, the financial sector. However, ideological polarization has increased regarding various religious issues, the desirable immigration or anti-terror policy and, certainly, regarding economic policy related to income or wealth redistribution. In these contexts two interesting questions arise. First, what makes an interest group successful in enhancing its target policy? Second, what makes interest groups more active (exert more efforts on lobbying)? The results obtained in our tractable model shed light on these issues and the relevance of our findings is illustrated in the discussion following each of the main theorems. Empirical testing of these results is a worthwhile challenging task.",1

Hopland,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"To which extent federations should decentralize fiscal decision making has been widely debated among politicians as well as economists over the last decades. There are several arguments in favor of decentralized solutions. Tiebout (1956) argues that local governments will have strong incentives to provide efficient public goods, in order to attract tax paying residents. Moreover, decentralization offers the possibility to match local policies to local preferences (Oates 1972). There is, however, a different side to the story. If local politicians focus exclusively on pleasing local voters and expect to be bailed out in the case of a fiscal emergency, we may get inefficient outcomes. A typical prediction is that local tax collection will be too low and local spending to high. Following the seminal work of Kornai (1979) this is referred to as the soft budget constraint problem. In a recent study of Swedish local governments, Pettersson-Lidbom (2010) studies soft budgets based on a dynamic commitment problem. His findings suggest that the predicted effect by going from a hard to a soft budget constraint is an increase in debt by more than 20 %. Such costs provide a likely explanation as to why many countries in recent years have imposed stricter surveillance of the fiscal policy in their respective local and regional governments. The book edited by Rodden et al. (2003) contains several examples of increasing central government monitoring of local governments’ fiscal dispositions in a wide array of federations. Examples are found in the full range from highly developed countries like the US (Inman 2003) and Canada (Bird and Tassonyi 2003), via economies in transition like Hungary (Wetzel and Papp 2003) to less developed countries as Argentina (Webb 2003) and India (McCarten 2003). However, even though the central government wants to monitor the local governments and impose balanced budget regulations (BBRs), it may not be able to effectively do so, as illustrated by Goodspeed (2002). He considers a Stackelberg game where the local governments’ spending on public consumption is financed by local taxes, borrowing and grants from the central government. The local governments decide simultaneously public spending, how much to collect in taxes and how much to borrow. The central government then has to decide how to respond to borrowing in the local governments. If the central government increases grants to a local government that borrows, this lowers the opportunity cost of borrowing and leads to excessive borrowing. The outcome is that a vote-maximizing central government has incentives to bail out local governments that borrow too much, even though it knows that a no-bailout policy will be socially optimal. Other studies find, however, that increasing expenditures is not an effective tool for incumbents seeking re-election. Drazen and Eslava (2010) study Colombian local governments and propose that the composition of spending may work just as well as the level of spending as a strategic tool. Peltzman (1992) finds that US voters are less likely to support local officials who increase overall expenditures. Brender (2003) concludes that when Israeli voters are able to monitor the fiscal choices of local officials effectively, incurring in large deficits prior to elections will actually harm the incumbent’s chance of being re-elected. Brender and Drazen (2008) study a large panel of countries and find that deficits in the election year or over the term reduce the incumbents chance of re-election in developed countries and established democracies. Further, studies of US states in general conclude that restrictions may be a helpful tool in order to secure fiscal discipline, but that the efficiency of the restrictions vary with their design and institutional surroundings. Some key contributions are Holtz-Eakin (1988), Alt and Lowry (1994), Poterba (1994) and Bohn and Inman (1996). Interestingly, Bohn and Inman find that the most important feature of a BBR is whether it is imposed ex ante or ex post, i.e. whether deficits are allowed to be carried to the next year or not. They conclude that ex ante rules, seem to be ineffective. This paper studies fiscal adjustment in Norwegian local governments. These are subject to an ex ante BBR, allowing them to carry deficits to the next year. In order to battle persistent deficits, however, the central government has introduced a ‘punishment’ for those that are unable to cover their deficits within 2 years after the initial deficit, the Register for State Review and Approval of Financial Obligations (Robek). Robek lists local governments that violate the BBR, most often by having persistent deficits over a period of 3 years or more. The consequence of being in the register is that the budget and resolutions to raise new loans must be approved by the county governor, the central government’s representative in the county. Local governments in the register are subject to stronger central government control and must tighten their budgetary policy in order to be removed from the register. The aim of the register is to stimulate fiscal discipline, and I will investigate how local governments respond to inclusion in the register. The findings in the paper clearly suggest that the register has the desired effect of stronger operational surplus in the local governments. Importantly, further investigations indicate that the results are not driven by bailouts, but rather that the operating surplus is improved through reductions in operational expenditures. Hence, the register seems to serve its purpose of stimulating fiscal discipline in the local governments. This is probably due to a combination of both ‘formal’ and ‘informal’ disciplining mechanisms, as well as the introduction of ex post features to the ex ante BBR. First, the formal mechanism is, as outlined above, that local governments in Robek are subject to closer central government monitoring and are forced to be more realistic in their budgeting. Second, an informal mechanism arises through that inclusion in Robek gives negative attention in local media. Thus it can be considered as a ‘list of shame’ for local politicians. Third, local governments that enter Robek because of persistent deficits, must cover these ex post in order to exit the register. Even though this is not a strict ex post rule, since the local governments are not forced to cover their deficits (can in principle stay in Robek forever), this involves the introduction of some ex post features. The finding that Robek is an effective tool is thus consistent with Bohn and Inman’s argument that ex post rules are the most effective. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 presents the institutional framework, while the outcome variables are presented in Sect. 3. The empirical strategy is discussed in Sect. 4. The main results are presented in Sect. 5, while Sect. 6 discusses what drives the effect on the net operating surplus. Section 7 presents some specifications tests with different variants of the Robek variable. Finally, some concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 8.",14

Numerous instruments and approaches have been proposed to improve politician’s incentives and eliminate the deficit bias (e.g., Debrun et al. 2009). In addition, commitment or third-party enforcement can also play an important role. This study investigates the effect of fiscal advisors in maintaining the government’s fiscal discipline when the external advisors’ appointment is determined endogenously. We first formulate a mechanism by which external advisors act as a commitment device for politicians seeking re-election. Next, we empirically test our hypothesis by using Japanese panel datasets on prefectural (local) governments. In our empirical analysis, central bureaucrats on loan to local governments are considered external advisors. Numerous studies have examined the political economy of budget deficits a la Buchanan (e.g., Alesina et al. 1998; Woo 2003) and identified many potential sources of deficit bias such as myopic voting (Nordhaus 1975), signaling an incumbent’s competence (Rogoff 1990), and the common pool problem (Hagen and Harden 1995; Doi and Ihori 2002). The common pool problem is supported by empirical studies focusing on the “weakness” or fragmentation of the government (Roubini and Sachs 1989; Volkerink and Haan 2001; Hallerberg et al. 2007; Falcó-Gimeno and Jurado 2011).Footnote 1 Possible instruments for fiscal discipline include financial market sanctions (Bayoumi et al. 1995) and fiscal restrictions (Eichengreen and Bayoumi 1994; Hallerberg et al. 2007; Falcó-Gimeno and Jurado 2011; Lavigne 2011).Footnote 2 However, neither of these instruments is necessarily effective because market sanctions are often weak and quite nonlinear (Hagen et al. 2011) and fiscal restrictions can be ignored or avoided (Hagen 1991; Milesi-Ferretti 2004). In fact, Japan’s Fiscal Structural Reform Law, which was enacted in 1997, has been suspended since 1998 because of the country’s poor macroeconomic situation. In addition, delegation of certain policy aspects to an independent agency, which has been discussed intensively in the context of monetary policy (Barro and Gordon 1983; Rogoff 1985; Waller 1989; Fratianni et al. 1997; Lippi 1998), can be a solution for fiscal discipline (see Debrun et al. (2009) and Calmfors and Wren-Lewis (2011) for surveys). Two types of delegation to fiscal institutions are proposed:Footnote 3 delegation of actual fiscal policy decisions and that of forecasting,Footnote 4 analysis, and advising. Almost all existing independent fiscal institutions can be categorized as the latter, “fiscal watchdog” type, also called “fiscal councils.” On the other hand, we can select Japanese central bureaucrats on loan to local governments as an example of the former type of external agent because they are expected to implement policy changes in the local government (Inatsugu 2000). Japan has a personnel interchange system across different government levels (Muramatsu et al. 2001). Central bureaucrats on loan occupy certain senior positions in local governments. Although fiscal decentralization has been in vogue in Japan since the late 1980s, several local governments accept central bureaucrats as vice-governors or directors of their departments on a temporary basis. Both fiscal councils and Japanese central bureaucrats on loan are considered outsiders by local governments and are expected to discipline the governments. However, two differences between them are pointed out. The first is regarding their task. The task of a fiscal council is to act as a “fiscal watchdog” or provide information disclosure, as mentioned previously. Therefore, members of fiscal councils frequently include academic researchers and analysts in the financial sector. In contrast, Japanese central bureaucrats on loan are expected to be active in creating budgets because they are public finance experts with knowledge of government budgeting and accounting. The second difference is in their official status. Fiscal councils are official and permanent organizations, while Japanese central bureaucrats on loan do not have permanent positions in local governments and the governor can replace them with local officials promoted internally. We believe that the Japanese system is of interest because central bureaucrats on loan, despite being outsiders, are engaged in fiscal policy-making in local governments, while fiscal councils in most countries serve only as fiscal watchdogs. In other words, Japanese central bureaucrats on loan can be viewed as an example of the first type of fiscal delegation, i.e., delegation of actual fiscal policy decisions. Contributions of this study are twofold. First, it theoretically shows how inviting an external advisor works as a commitment device for fiscal discipline. Second, it examines how Japanese central bureaucrats on loan affect the local fiscal situation. Our theoretical model follows Rogoff (1990) in describing how an incumbent politician’s concerns about upcoming electoral outcomes affect his policy choice when a voter cannot discern his type. We introduce a new aspect to the model: the politician’s voluntary appointment of a fiscal advisor to whom setting a fiscal constraint is delegated.Footnote 5 If a citizen votes for the incumbent politician on the basis of his assessment of the politician’s competence (i.e., type), the incumbent politician may spend a lot to buy the vote. Even if he has promised an appropriate spending level before being aware of his type, reputational concerns may make him deviate from his promise after the type becomes known to him. Thus, the promise for suppressing spending suffers from a time-inconsistency problem. Subsequently, a politician may discipline himself by ex ante delegating the authority to choose a policy to an external advisor. The external advisor, who is unaware of the politician’s true type and has no interest in the politician’s re-election, attempts to minimize the efficiency loss arising from asymmetric information by imposing a fiscal restraint. If the incumbent politician can commit to the fiscal discipline set by this external advisor, then his choice of the expenditure level is controlled.Footnote 6 Unlike those in the studies by Swank (2000), Swank and Dur (2001), Dur and Swank (2005), and Wrasai and Swank (2007), the external advisor in our study is not assumed to have different or more detailed information on the state of the economy than what the politician has.Thus, the politician cannot update his information set even if he appoints an external advisor. This means that our model does not include a “fiscal watchdog” type of advisor. Rather, in our model the external advisor is supposed to act as a commitment device because he is not elected by voters. We believe that this is the case of the Japanese central bureaucrats on loan to local governments or of the U.S. consulting firm, Klein–Saks, which proposed a stabilization program in Chile during 1955–1958 (Edwards 2007).Footnote 7
Bendor et al. (2001) and Bendor and Meirowitz (2004) examine how delegating to better informed and ideologically closer agents can reduce risk facing the principal. Our model focuses on the role of an advisor who is uninformed and has different preferences to reduce risk. Although Swank and Dur (2001) argue that the advisory system jeopardizes democratic control, here we look at the advisor’s status as an outsider. Our empirical analysis supports our hypothesis in that local governments with directors coming from the central government spend less than they would otherwise. The possible benefits for the host local governments include effective communication with the central government, promising projects allocated through that communication and relationship, and skills and knowledge of the bureaucrats (e.g., Inoki (2001). If the main purpose of such personnel interchange is to communicate local needs to the central government, the local governments that invite central bureaucrats should spend more than those without the bureaucrats, ceteris paribus. However, our empirical results do not support such a theory and instead demonstrate that inviting central bureaucrats reduces spending.In addition, they also show that local governments with central bureaucrats reduce investment in infrastructure to scale down total expenditure without decreasing personnel expenses or subsidies and grants. Section 2 of this paper provides a brief explanation of the institutional background. Section 3 presents a theoretical model that clarifies the reasons for and results of inviting a fiscal advisor. Section 4 discusses empirical tests of our hypothesis that an advisor can help improve a local government’s fiscal situation, by using Japanese panel data on prefectural governments. Section 5 presents the conclusions.",1
14.0,3.0,Economics of Governance,31 March 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-013-0125-2,Public sector corruption and the probability of technological disasters,August 2013,Eiji Yamamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As shown in various historical records, the occurrence of disasters appears to inevitably influence social and economic conditions. In the field of social science, an increasing number of works have investigated the effect of natural disasters and associated outcomes. Recently, institution has been found to be associated with the outcome of disasters (Kahn 2005). For instance, damage caused by natural disasters depends in part on public sector corruption (Escaleras et al. 2007).Footnote 1 The impact of disasters can be described as the probability that a disaster will occur and the degree of damage caused by a disaster. The expected impact of a disaster is small when the probability of a disaster is sufficiently low even if the damage is large. With respect to natural disasters, the probability of a natural disaster is not related to the degree of corruption within a government. To put it another way, corruption does not affect the probability of a natural disaster occurring because such a probability depends on natural conditions.Footnote 2 In contrast, where the magnitudes of disasters are equal, the economic outcome will vary according to institutional quality. Hence, corruption is important when we analyze how, and to what extent, to mitigate the damage caused by natural disasters. However, corruption is not relevant when we analyze how to prevent natural disasters. When it comes to manmade technological disasters, institutional quality such as corruption seems to affect not only the level of damage caused by a disaster, but also the probability of disaster occurrence. With regard to the interactions between politics and economics, investigations (Anbarci et al. 2006) have shown that corruption increases the rate of fatal traffic accidents, suggesting that corruption is thought to have a sizable effect on the occurrence and outcome of accidents by human error. Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of corruption on manmade disasters when considering a political economy mechanism. However, little is known about the effect of corruption on the probability of technological disasters; thus, it is a topic worth investigating. Corruption is considered to affect the probability of accidents and manmade disasters via various channels; a brief explanation follows. First, a key reason for market failure is information asymmetry between market demand and supply. An anticipated and necessary role of government is to attenuate this failure. In various industries, firms and individuals are obliged to obtain a license to commence a business to ensure a quality service is supplied. Public officials have the right to grant these firms and individuals such licenses. For instance, pilots are required by law to obtain a pilot license. Airplane companies are obliged by public officials to employ only pilots with such a license. For the purpose of reducing information asymmetry between airplane companies and customers, it is anticipated that public officials play an industry-regulating role to ensure flight safety. In reality, however, public officials have an incentive to pursue their own self-interest: these public officials may accept bribes from firms and individuals to ignore various regulations.Footnote 3
 Assuming that the qualifying standards for obtaining a license are effective in determining the techniques, skills, and quality of pilots, these will deteriorate when pilots illegitimately receive their pilot license.Footnote 4 Individuals make a decision regarding how to obtain the license by considering whether the cost of illegitimately purchasing the license is lower than the cost of obtaining license legitimately. The corruption of public officials results in the “price of a license” in the illegitimate market to fall below the cost of passing a legitimate qualifying standard for licensing. Accordingly, individuals will purchase the license illegitimately. Consequently, the safety of airplanes declines, and in turn the probability of airplane accidents increases. Evidence regarding the relationship between corruption and traffic accidents (Anbarci et al. 2006) supports this inference. The more corrupt a public official is, the cheaper the cost of purchasing a license and the lower the quality and skill of drivers (Bertland et al. 2007). Corruption reduces the incentive to train for positions in which technological devices are employed. Inevitably, accidents are more likely to occur. As with airplane pilots and car drivers, this inference holds true, in general, within any industries where licenses are required. The second reason for market failure is that corruption weakens existing infrastructure (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997; Tanzi 2002; Tanzi and Davoodi 2002). The rate of return of projects, as calculated using cost–benefit analysis, is a criterion for project selection. In reality, however, corruption motivates bureaucrats to direct public expenditure via channels that make it easier to collect bribes. Thus, the productivity of the project is not taken into account when the investment project is selected, leading to the distortion of resource allocation. This causes a bias towards large-scale construction projects rather than maintenance expenditure. Thus, corruption reduces the public spending that is required to keep the existing physical infrastructure in a good and safe condition. A previous study (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997) found, using regression analysis, that corruption reduced the percentage of total paved roads in good condition, and increased the percentage of electricity power system losses over total power output. Based on those results, the authors concluded that corruption reduces expenditure on maintenance and operations, resulting in low-quality infrastructure (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997; Tanzi 2002; Tanzi and Davoodi 2002). In addition, corruption hampers economic growth (Mauro 1995) and therefore reduces per capital income, and as a result consumers purchase inferior products.Footnote 5 It seems plausible that the deterioration of physical infrastructure increases the likelihood of transport or industrial accidents. Corruption inevitably increases the probability of accidents, resulting in manmade disasters. These inferences lead me to propose the hypothesis that a corrupt public sector raises the probability of technological accidents and therefore disasters. This paper uses panel data from 98 countries to explore the influence of corruption on technological disasters. The key finding is that a technological disaster is more likely to occur in a country with greater levels of corruption in the public sector. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 proposes the hypothesis to be tested; data and methods used are explained in Sect. 3; Sect. 4 discusses the results of the estimations; and the final section offers concluding observations.",9

Atsu Amegashie,Bazoumana Ouattara,Eric Strobl,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"An extensive literature examines the appropriateness of using in-kind or restricted transfers versus unrestricted transfers to ensure that these transfers reach their intended recipients or are used for their intended purpose; see the recent survey by Currie and Gahvari (2008).Footnote 1 By and large the general conclusion has been that while in-kind or restricted cash transfers may dominate unrestricted transfers by leading to better targeting, reducing moral hazard behaviour, and relaxing self selection constraints (adverse selection), they may also be associated with deadweight losses since the donor may have incomplete information about the preferences of the recipient or may narrow the recipient’s consumption set relative to the case of cash transfers.Footnote 2 However, two important issues have not received sufficient attention. First, the issue of the optimal mix of transfers has focussed on examining within-country transfers but not transfers across countries. Second, in many cases a donor is unlikely to be limited to choosing between in-kind or restricted transfers and unrestricted transfers, but may instead be able to choose a mix of the two. In the present paper, we address these shortcomings by analysing a donor’s choice of the composition of restricted and unrestricted transfers in the context of transfers across borders from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. Our analysis is undertaken within the context of foreign aid and rests on distinguishing between project aid and program aid where the former type of aid can be viewed as more restricted than the latter type. Specifically, project aid is typically used to finance specific projects, which often involve direct participation by the donor in their design and implementation. In contrast, according to a recent OECD/DAC publication, program aid is restricted to ‘financial contributions not linked to specific activities’ (OECD 2005, p. 34). Budget support, which is a component of program aid, provides funds to boost aggregate revenue and overall spending. In this regard, a study commissioned by the Overseas Development Council, van de Walle and Johnston (1996, p. 8) noted that “\(\ldots \) [Program aid] is not likely to promote development in the absence of sound economic policies. In such situations, donors should \(\ldots \) limit aid flows and direct them to project assistance \(\ldots \) When sound economic policies have been put in place, donors should expand program aid \(\ldots \)” Similarly, the World Bank (1998, p. 80) recognizes this point when it recommends that “[i]n a country with sound public expenditure management, a larger portion of aid can be in the form of general budget support.”Footnote 3 The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), established in 2004 to bolster U.S. development aid, gives significant development assistance to countries that pursue good governance, invest in health and education, and adopt sound economic policies. We use a canonical political agency model of a signaling game between a possibly corrupt politician in the recipient country and an altruistic donor. The model is designed to strike a balance between the deadweight loss of project aid and its superior ability, relative to program aid, in controlling a recipient’s moral hazard behavior. We show that, under certain conditions, the donor reduces the proportion of project aid in total aid as governance in the recipient country improves. As noted above, several theoretical works such as Bruce and Waldman (1991), Coate (1995) and Andolfatto (2002) show that in-kind or restricted transfers may be welfare-improving and effective in controlling moral hazard behavior.Footnote 4 They do not however, examine how the composition of transfers changes in response to changes in the moral hazard behavior of recipients Moreover, their models are complete-information models, so the moral hazard actions of recipients are perfectly observable to the donors. However, the inefficiency of unrestricted transfers stems from the donor’s inability to credibly refuse to bail out recipients from the adverse effects of their moral hazard behavior (i.e., the Samaritan’s dilemma). In contrast, the donor can commit to punishing moral hazard behavior in our model, but due to incomplete information cannot necessarily observe such behavior. To test the key prediction of our theoretical model, we construct a cross-country panel data of foreign aid composition, expenditure on a number of public goods, level of corruption, income and other determinants, and conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the composition of foreign aid. We use the level of corruption or expenditure on health or education in a recipient country as alternative measures of governance. Our estimates generally support the predictions of the theory. Specifically, we find that there is typically an inverse relationship between the proportion of project aid and a recipient country’s quality of governance. There is a relatively wide literature on the determinants of the size of foreign aid. These tend to show that factors such as past colonial ties, political alliances, good governance, income, membership in the UN security council, and population size, amongst many others, play important roles.Footnote 5 Similarly, there are empirical studies that study how the size of transfers like welfare payments including in-kind transfers like food stamps affect incentives to save, look for work, labor supply decisions, etc and/or how the size of such payments is adjusted in response to the behavior of recipients (e.g., Fraker and Moffitt 1988; and the surveys by Danzinger et al. 1981; Moffitt 1992; Dobkin and Puller 2007). Our study focuses on changes in the composition of transfers in response to changes in moral hazard behavior when the donor has incomplete information.Footnote 6 The few studies that have looked at the composition of transfers were based on complete information, so that there are no moral hazard or self-selection issues as in our framework; see, for example, Moffitt (1990) and Marton and Wildasin (2007).Footnote 7
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section develops a simple theoretical model of a donor’s optimal choice of project and program aid. Section 3 describes the data and presents the empirical analysis. We conclude the paper in Sect. 4.",4
14.0,4.0,Economics of Governance,10 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-013-0129-y,The expert problem: a survey,November 2013,Irene Valsecchi,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The use of experts is pervasive. Experts are consulted in many disparate situations, that range from technical reports for managers to meteorological forecasts for tourists. The use of experts is taxing too. Anyone who is not an expert must first assess the reliability of professional advice in order to take any advantage of it. On one side, people need to communicate more and more because knowledge has become very specialized and information is widely distributed; on the other side, just because knowledge is limited and information is disseminated, people can be either unable to grasp the opinion of experts, or reluctant to trust experts, especially in the case of conflicting interests. Consequently, learning from experts can be subtle and demanding. In the last three decades a steady flow of contributions has come to tackle different issues related to the problem of information transmission from experts. In general, in the economic literature expertise refers to the case in which one party observes an informative signal about an uncertain state of nature and can send messages to another, less informed party. The sender of messages is called expert. The receiver of messages is interested in learning from the expert. The decoding of messages and the posterior uncertainty of the receiver are the essential issues that go under the heading of information revelation. The present survey is focused on both the typical problems in information transmission from expertsFootnote 1 and the factors that can affect information disclosure. In this perspective, the contributions to the study of the expert problem are reviewed according to the following double criterion. On one side, models can be distinguished according to the preferences of the experts and the role played by the agents who are not experts. On the other side, models are characterized by the extent to which the messages sent by the experts can be verified. In a first class of models, the non-experts are decision-makers, who take an action that is payoff-relevant for the expert. The expert is a partisan expert in that he has preferences over the actions chosen by the non-expert. In a second class of models, instead, the agent who is not an expert is an evaluator of the performance of the expert as a predictor, because experts can have different forecasting abilities. In that case, experts are mainly concerned with some measure of their reputation as high-ability forecasters, while they can be indifferent to the direct use of the recommendations they make. The literature on strategic communication has developed from two extreme and independent approaches to the type of messages that the experts can send. In one approach communication is cheap talk, made of completely unverifiable announcements, while in the other approach messages consist of hard and truthful information that the experts can freely choose to divulge. Between the two extreme cases communication can be somehow different from pure cheap talk, that implies unmediated, non-binding and payoff-irrelevant conversation, besides unverifiable messages.Footnote 2
 While the models with partisan experts focus on the welfare yielded by the implemented actions, the models with reputational concerns on the expert’s side focus on the precision that can characterize the identification of the different abilities of the experts. In cheap talk games the emphasis is on the reliability that the decision-maker can associate to the received messages in his posterior beliefs, while in persuasion games attention is paid to the extent to which experts can withhold unfavorable information. The survey starts with the case of partisan experts in cheap talk games with reference to the seminal papers by Crawford and Sobel (1982) and Green and Stockey (2007)Footnote 3 in Sect. 2. Some coarsening of information is proved to be unavoidable in equilibrium in case of conflict of interest between the expert and the decision-maker. Moreover, the existence of multiple equilibria, characterized by different and rankable informative properties, raises the issue of criteria for the selection of the equilibria. Section 3 is concerned with conditions and mechanisms that can improve the quality of strategic information transmission, by adding uncertainty on the side of the expert with respect to the relationship between messages and actions. In particular, the cases of two-sided information, noise in communication and the design of multiple communication rounds are considered. In Sect. 4 the informative content of strategic communication is analyzed when the possibility of meaningful communication in some preexisting language is introduced by way of non-strategic types of agents in perturbed games. Moreover, credibility in communication will be affected directly by lying costs suffered by the experts, and indirectly by the benefits that an expert can derive from his reputation for truthfulness in future periods when his interaction with the decision-maker is repeated. Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to elicitation mechanisms that the decision-maker can choose when either he can commit to fixed decision rules leading to delegation, or he can consult many experts. In all the sections from 3 to 6, improvements in the precision of the information revealed by the experts are often obtained by introducing conditions under which communication can be organized differently from direct conversation, or it can be subject to binding rules and have direct payoff-relevant effects. Section 7 is concerned with persuasion games with verifiable messages, initiated by Grossman (1981) and Milgrom (1981). The level of information disclosure in equilibrium is mainly related to the conditions under which the decision-maker can detect any withholding of information. Particular attention is paid to the role of competition among experts with opposed interests. Situations in which the decision-maker can verify only a subset of the messages, or the agents have a difference of opinion, or hard and soft information coexist are also considered. Finally, Sect. 8 surveys models in which the experts are directly concerned with their reputation as high-ability forecasters, mostly in cheap talk games. The extent of misreporting in equilibrium is related to the possibility of repeated forecasting, the use of many experts and the design of optimal contracts in order to separate the different types of experts. Finally, intrinsic reputational concerns are shown to affect the use of corporate resources when the experts are managers taking decisions in firms. In Sect. 9 I conclude with some of the still unresolved issues in the literature on communication. In general, the microeconomic literature takes a game-theoretic approach to the analysis of the use of experts. In that approach all the agents, experts and non-experts, share the same ex ante view of the world, i.e. they agree upon the space of the states of nature and the space of the realizations that some privately observable variables can take. Overall, they agree upon the correspondence between states and observations in terms of likelihood functions, one for each observation when a particular state of nature is true. The expert usually is the only agent who makes private observations. The precision of the information revealed by the expert is the outcome of joint strategic considerations of both experts and non-experts. Within that framework, the expert problem is treated as a special case of asymmetric information, usually under the assumption that experts and non-experts have dissimilar preferences. When communication from the experts is treated as a problem of asymmetric information, the receivers of messages are usually assumed to be quite sophisticated in that they are aware of the informative properties of the signals that the experts can observe. Given the rich variety of the ways in which the relationship between experts and non-experts is framed in the different contributions, a summary of general results could easily be misleading, as Sobel (2013) underlines. In general communication does not lead to full revelation of information and multiple equilibria tend to prevail. So information transmission from experts to non-experts can fail also when the acquisition of information and the communication of messages imply no costs. In the interaction between experts and non-experts the equilibrium outcomes tend to be very sensitive to the specific assumptions of the models. In particular, the critical assumptions concern the different types of agents, their commitment ability, their temporal horizon of interaction, and the characteristics of communication, especially in terms of verifiable announcements, costs of information and rules that can discipline the rounds of conversations. In general, the precision of the information disclosed by the experts is positively related to the availability of instruments that can “organize” the conversation between experts and non-experts. Loosely speaking, the organization of conversations can depend on a wide range of different elements, such as the literal meaning of messages in a preexisting language, the capacity to commit to decision-rules or to impose specific protocols of communication, the observability of some measure of performance through time, and the intervention of many experts, who can be selected for their type of preferences or who can transmit their reports according to specifically designed modes.",2

Extractive industry FDI and corruption,November 2013,Ivar Kolstad,Arne Wiig,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Are foreign investors attracted or deterred by host country corruption? In theory, the effect could go either way. A number of studies have argued that corruption acts as a tax, making investment in corrupt countries less profitable (e.g. Wei 2000). On the other hand, not all corruption is extortion; there are also benefits to be had from illicitly colluding with public officials, to secure contracts or licences, access to information or other sources of economic rents. On balance, it is therefore possible that foreign investors prefer to invest in more corrupt countries. This is a particularly relevant possibility in the extractive industries, such as mining and petroleum, where the rents to be gained from securing access to resources are potentially huge. The seminal study by Guidolin and La Ferrara (2007) showed that diamond companies in Angola suffered a loss from the end of the civil war, suggesting that the end of the war provided less opportunity for companies to benefit from corrupt deals. Wiig and Kolstad (2010) similarly suggest that dysfunctional host country institutions that permit corruption may be beneficial to multinational oil companies, as they facilitate sharing of the resource rents with the political elite, while keeping the host country population out of the equation. If the potential corporate benefits from corruption are so large in the extractive sector, does this mean that foreign direct investment in this sector is attracted to corrupt countries? To address this question, this article performs an econometric analysis of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the extractive industries, using panel data from 81 countries for the period 1996–2009. The aim is to assess the effect of changes in host country corruption on the inflows of foreign investment in these sectors. To attempt to identify the effect of corruption, we use fixed effects estimation to control for any unobserved, time-invariant country characteristics. This is to our knowledge the first study to analyze the effect of corruption on FDI in this particular sector. Several previous studies have looked at corruption and FDI in total or in other industries or flowing from specific investor home countries, with mixed results. Wei (2000) finds a negative effect of corruption on total FDI inflows, whereas Kolstad and Wiig (2011, 2012) find a positive effect for Chinese outward FDI, which to a large extent is linked to resource access. There are also a number of studies of the effect of governance and institutions more generally on FDI. Given the current emphasis in the international community on improving governance in resource rich countries, through such initiatives as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a study of corruption and extractive industry FDI is timely. The results indicate that an increase in host country corruption is associated with an increase in extractive industry FDI inflows, but at a diminishing rate. In other words, larger increases in corruption bring a less than proportionate increase in FDI compared to smaller increases in corruption. This suggests that multinational corporations may benefit from host country corruption, but less and less so as the host country experiences larger changes in corruption prevalence. The results can to some extent illuminate the interests of multinational companies in supporting or undermining the effectiveness of governance initiatives in host countries. The article is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses theoretical arguments and summarizes previous empirical studies of corruption and FDI. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy. In Sect. 4, we discuss the data used in the analysis. The main results are presented in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes.",29

Beyond financial incentives, several behavioral factors have been shown to be influential (trust, reciprocity, fairness, signaling).Footnote 1 In particular, several lab and field experiments have recently shown that framing economically equivalent employment contracts as penalties rather than bonuses can increase workers’ effort level.Footnote 2 This result is typically attributed to “loss aversion,” whereby workers perform better under a penalty contract because the losses from being penalized exceed the benefits from receiving the bonus. To the best of our knowledge, incentive framing has been analyzed only with regard to its impact on the provision of effort by workers. The employer-employee relationship, however, cannot be reduced to a single dimension. In particular, beyond shirking, workers can engage in several activities detrimental to the employer such as theft, sabotage, sexual harassment or corruption (see e.g. Vardi and Wiener 1996; Everton et al. 2007; Charness et al. 2012). The object of this paper is to investigate whether incentive framing affects one such dimension: the propensity for workers to engage in corruption. To address this issue, we conduct what Harrison and List (2004) characterize as a “framed field experiment,” that is, a lab experiment conducted with participants from the market of interest, which incorporates the key features of a naturally occurring environment (i.e. realistic task, stakes, information). Following a practice in Burkina Faso where part-timers are often hired to grade exams, we recruited graders to perform in the lab a comparable grading task for a similar remuneration. In contrast with pure lab and pure field experiments, this intermediate approach allows us to control the experimental environment while providing the subjects with non-artificial tasks and stakes. The real effort experiment reproduces a corruption scenario in which a candidate offers a bribe to a grader in order to obtain a better grade. In short, subjects were asked to grade a set of 20 exam papers. The 11th paper came with a money offer and a message stating: “Please, find few mistakes in my exam paper.” Three treatments with monitoring were conducted by framing economically equivalent contracts as a menu of either bonuses, penalties, or a combination of bonuses and penalties. In Armantier and Boly (2013), we compared the three treatments with respect to the subjects’ grading performance across the first 10 exam papers. We found that, consistent with a prospect theory model combining loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity, subjects performed better when economically equivalent incentives are framed as pure penalties rather than pure bonuses, but they perform best when facing a combination of bonuses and penalties. In the present paper, we study the impact of incentive framing on attitudes toward corruption. To do so, we compare the three treatments with respect to i) the graders’ propensity to accept the bribe offered with the 11th paper and ii) the number of mistakes reported by the bribe accepters for paper 11. Under standard economic theory, agents respond only to monetary payoffs. As a result, they should be indifferent to the way economically equivalent incentives are presented to them. Therefore, the graders’ behavior should be the same in all three treatments. Likewise, loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity should not affect bribe taking across treatments. Indeed, under prospect theory, the bribe may be described as an unexpected bonus which should be accepted at the same rate in all treatments regardless of initial income expectations. In contrast, a behavioral theory that may influence attitudes toward corruption in our experiment is labor fairness and reciprocity (Akerlof 1982). Under this theory, if the worker feels he is treated fairly by the employer, then he is more likely to reciprocate by taking actions favorable to the employer. In contrast, if the employer’s attitude is perceived as hostile or unfair, then the employee may retaliate. The experimental literature, although not unanimous, generally provides some support for positive and negative reciprocity (Frey 1993; Fehr et al. 1993, 1997; Frey and Jegen 2001; Fehr and Gächter 2002; Fehr and Rockenbach 2003). Moreover, as further discussed in Sect. 3.3, there is experimental evidence that workers overwhelmingly prefer and consider fairer contracts framed as bonuses rather than economically equivalent contracts framed as penalties (e.g. Luft 1994; Hannan et al. 2005; Fehr and Schmidt 2007). Thus, the “labor reciprocity” hypothesis predicts that, when workers are offered contracts framed with higher bonuses, they reciprocate by refraining from engaging in corruption. The results from the experiment provide evidence against both hypotheses. In contrast to the “labor reciprocity” hypothesis, we find no significant difference in attitudes toward corruption when employment contracts are framed as a menu of bonuses or as a menu of penalties. Further, in contrast with standard economic theory, we find that graders facing a combination of bonuses and penalties are more likely to breach their duty by accepting the bribe and reporting fewer mistakes for the bribe paper. Taken together with our previous study on effort provision, these results suggest that incentive framing is not effective at aligning perfectly the objectives of the employers with those of his employees. Indeed, while we found in Armantier and Boly (2013) that a contract mixing bonuses and penalties yields the highest effort provision, the present study suggests that it does not promote loyalty toward the employer. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We review the experimental literature on corruption in Sect. 2. The design of the experiment and the experimental hypotheses are presented in Sect. 3. The experimental results are analyzed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",6
15.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,30 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-013-0131-4,Fiscal decentralization and public sector efficiency: evidence from OECD countries,February 2014,Antonis Adam,Manthos D. Delis,Pantelis Kammas,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"It has long been recognized that governments differ significantly in the efficiency of delivering public services (ref. Tanzi and Schuknecht 1998; Afonso et al. 2005). Some are extremely wasteful and ineffective in performing even basic activities, whereas others achieve their objectives systematically and comprehensively. The efforts to increase government productive efficiency, otherwise termed public sector efficiency (hereafter referred to as PSE), has spawned an output of vital theoretical literature on channels that may affect it. One of the most prominent channels is the design of fiscal relations across the various levels of government. The theoretical literature on fiscal federalism identifies two benchmark channels through which fiscal decentralization is expected to affect PSE positively, namely (i) increased electoral control and (ii) yardstick competition among local governments that results from decentralization.Footnote 1 According to the electoral control mechanism, decentralization reduces the inclinations of officials to divert rents, and increases the probability of “bad” incumbents to be voted out of office, thus positively affecting the overall government efficiency (Hindriks and Lockwood 2009). Moreover, Seabright (1996) shows that rent-seeking politicians, when contesting in decentralized elections, use incentives to lure the voters in each (local) constituency. In contrast, to get re-elected in the national elections politicians would seek to please the voters only in a majority of the localities. Similar results are obtained by Hindriks and Lockwood (2009) and Myerson (2006). According to the theory of yardstick competition (see e.g., Shleifer 1985; Besley and Case 1995), citizens are at an advantage when they are able to evaluate the performance of their policy makers by comparing the policy choices of their own political representatives with the corresponding choices of the neighboring regions’ policy makers. Therefore, fiscal decentralization may increase PSE, as it offers citizens an opportunity to compare public services and taxes across jurisdictions and helps them to assess whether their government wastes resources through low human capital capacity or rent-seeking (Besley and Smart 2007). However, fiscal decentralization may also exert a negative impact on government efficiency. This impact can be attributed to a number of potential advantages gained by the provision of public goods by central governments. First, in the presence of economies of scale, higher decentralization might lead to a higher average cost of production for the public good (Stein 1997). Second, national government bureaucracies are more likely to offer talented people better careers and promotion opportunities, which in turn attract higher quality individuals (Prud’homme 1995). Finally, other scholars emphasize the potential danger that local politicians and bureaucrats are likely to face, particularly an increase in pressure from local interest groups, with these groups being more influential when the size of the jurisdiction is small (Bardhan and Mookerjee 2000; Prud’homme 1995). As the discussion above indicates, the theoretical literature is inconclusive about the relationship between fiscal decentralization and PSE. If the above considerations were to be consolidated, it becomes logical to argue that fiscal decentralization involves both negative and positive forces on PSE. Therefore, such arguments could also indicate a potential non-linearity. Particularly, in relatively centralized systems, an increase in the degree of fiscal decentralization can induce some costs due to diseconomies of scale in the provision of the public good, therefore reducing PSE; however, it will also create large gains from an increased electoral accountability. Interestingly, in highly decentralized jurisdictions, further increases in decentralization imply that diseconomies of scale would prevail over the positive effects of electoral accountability, consequently lowering PSE. In the theoretical section of this paper, we develop a simple theoretical model that formalizes the arguments of the relevant literature and illustrates an inverted U-shaped relationship between fiscal decentralization and PSE. Over the recent years, a small, albeit growing, body of empirical work on the quality of governance-fiscal decentralization nexus (Fisman and Gatti 2002a; Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya 2007) has been observed. Most of these studies measure the quality of governance by some internationally comparable outcome of government policy, such as infant mortality, the literacy ratio, immunization of population, etc. Also, the key explanatory variable is fiscal decentralization, measured as the ratio of sub-national government expenditures (resp. tax revenues) to total public spending (resp. tax revenues). Although these studies offer contradicting evidence concerning the relationship between the outcomes of government policy and fiscal decentralization, the relationship identified (positive or negative) is always linear.Footnote 2 However, the theoretical hypotheses postulated above are probably not comprehensively addressed by employing socioeconomic indicators as measures of “good governance”. This is because such measures do not encompass the size of government spending and thus fail to reflect the level of efficiency in delivering government services. Barankay and Lockwood (2007) state, “[...] these regressions do not estimate government “production functions” because they do not control for the inputs to the output that is the dependent variable. [...] In the absence of controls for these inputs, these regressions cannot tell us much about the efficiency of government, as any observed correlation between decentralization and government output can be due to omitted variable bias.” To cope with this problem, in the empirical section of the paper, we develop direct measures of PSE by employing data envelopment analysis (DEA) on a panel of 21 OECD countries, between 1970 and 2000. The PSE measures are constructed using information on the “inputs” and “outputs” of the public sector. Within this framework, we implicitly assume that these indicators are derived from an underlying government production relationship. We focus on public education and health and construct two alternative PSE indices reflecting government efficiency in delivering services in these two sectors. Subsequently, we use the PSE indices to identify the potential public sector efficiency-fiscal decentralization nexus. We find that PSE increases with the degree of fiscal decentralization up to a certain degree of decentralization and thereafter decreases, i.e. revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship. This result appears to be robust across a number of different specifications and estimation methods that account, inter alia, for the potential reverse causality between fiscal decentralization and PSE. Notably, this is the first study to identify such a non-linear pattern, a finding consistent with both contradicting stands of the theoretical literature. Also, we are able to calculate the particular level of decentralization at which the relationship at hand turns negative and relate this value to certain countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a theoretical framework that illustrates the effects of fiscal decentralization on public sector efficiency and derives the main testable hypotheses. Section 3 describes the empirical model and data used in the empirical analysis. Section 4 illustrates the various econometric methodologies employed and discusses the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.",59

Johnson,William Ruger,Steven Yamarik,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Corruption, commonly defined as the abuse of public power for private gain, is an endemic feature of political life around the globe. It exists even in countries that enjoy relatively good governance. Corrupt practices are widely condemned and a consistent target of laws and investigations, even in regions where such behavior is common (Noonan 1984; Klitgaard 1988). Much of this public outrage and frustration is driven by the belief that corruption has detrimental effects on the economy. In this paper we investigate whether this belief is always true. In particular, we show that corruption in US states with more costly regulatory regimes is, on average, less costly than in states with less regulation. The impact of corruption on economic growth is the subject of a large social science literature. Much early research claimed that corruption might have a positive impact in places with dysfunctional political institutions (Leff 1964; Leys 1965). It could do so by effectively “greasing the wheels” of commerce in the face of significant political obstacles. The opposite view, which has been called the “sanding the wheels” position, argues that corruption is detrimental to economic growth (Aidt 2009). According to one recent review, this last position has “achieved the status of received wisdom” (Haggard et al. 2008, 212).Footnote 1 Others hold to the position that costly rules and regulations may create incentives for individuals to evade those strictures, possibly resulting in increases in efficiency (Djankov et al. 2002).Footnote 2 Thus, there is a need for an empirical test of whether corruption’s effect on growth is conditional on the extent of regulation (Heckelman and Powell 2010; Dreher and Gassebner 2011). The majority of the papers on the macroeconomic cost of corruption use cross-country data. As such these studies potentially suffer from biases generated by the heterogeneity of their samples. Unobserved factors, such as geography or culture, could easily affect both the incidence of corruption and economic development through separate channels (Aghion et al. 2010). Additionally, the effect of corruption on growth might depend on country-specific factors such as the composition of the economy or political institutions. In this paper we use data on US states to test whether the grease-the-wheels or the sand-the-wheels position is correct. Studying the United States has the advantage of providing fifty jurisdictions with significant autonomy over regulatory policy. Further, our analysis is a “tough test” of our hypotheses since, compared to developing countries, the US has low levels of corruption and regulation.Footnote 3 Furthermore, conditional on finding evidence for the grease-the-wheels position, we will be able to distinguish between the “strong form” of this hypothesis in which corruption is good for growth, and the “weak form” in which corruption is simply less costly in heavily regulated economies (Méon and Weill 2010). If corruption has no effect on growth in more heavily regulated US jurisdictions, a fortiori this relationship should hold in developing countries as well. We find significant support for the grease-the-wheels hypothesis. Under our preferred specification, the effect of a one standard deviation increase in corruption convictions in one of our least heavily regulated states (e.g. South Dakota, New Hampshire, or Colorado) is associated with half a standard deviation decrease in GSP growth between 1975 and 2007. By contrast, in the most heavily regulated states (e.g. New York, Arkansas, or Hawaii), we estimate an insignificant effect of corruption on growth. We interpret this as support for the weak form of the grease-the-wheels hypothesis. Our estimates are robust to the inclusion of numerous demographic and economic covariates as well as controlling for a state’s geographic region. We further control for potential sources of bias by instrumenting corruption using political variables with a deep historical legacy. While we accept the dominant point of the “sand-the-wheels” theorists that corruption is generally bad for economic growth, this paper makes a useful contribution to the debate by showing that, on the margin, the cost of corruption decreases as regulation becomes more invasive. The intuition is that bureaucrats and businesses will make illegal bargains if regulations are particularly burdensome. In the next section, we summarize the key findings and arguments in the literature on corruption, regulation, and growth. The following section introduces our data and identification strategy. Section four presents and discusses the econometric results. The final section concludes with theoretical implications.",25
15.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,23 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-013-0134-1,Trust in government and its effect on preferences for income redistribution and perceived tax burden,February 2014,Eiji Yamamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Researchers have paid significant attention to the influence of shared societal values on individual’s perceptions regarding redistribution and the welfare state (e.g., Gordon 1989; Wenzel 2004, 2005a, b; Klor and Shayo 2010; Feld and Frey 2002, 2007; Luttens and Valfort 2012). For instance, the degree of trust is found to play a key role when tax systems are considered. The greater the level of generalized trust in others, the more likely it is that people will pay tax (Scholz and Lubell 1998). Trust in institutional conditions such as government and politics substantially helps establish tax morale and deter tax evasion (Scholz and Pinney 1995; Torgler 2003; Hammar and Jagers 2009). Trust and confidence in such institutions lead people to prefer the welfare state (Algan et al. 2011) and pay tax (Oh and Hong 2012). Consequently, the size of the welfare state is determined partly by the level of social trust (Bergh and Bjørnskov 2011).Footnote 1 Recently, the seminal work of Algan et al. (2011) showed that there is a “non-monotonous relationship between trust and the generosity of the welfare sates in OECD countries” (Algan et al. 2011, p. 1). That is, countries with low trust in government can have a high public expenditure rate (e.g., France, Belgium, and Italy), as do countries with high trust in their government (e.g., Scandinavian countries). In contrast, countries with medium levels of trust have low public expenditure rates. Algan et al. (2011) considered Anglo-Saxon countries and Japan to have a medium level of trust, resulting in limited welfare states. Within a country, there is a wide variation of income, education level, and age. Hence, there is the possibility that the effect of trust on preference for a welfare state varies according to individuals’ demographic groups. Concerning the findings of Algan et al. (2011), a question naturally arises: does a medium level of trust lead people to prefer a smaller welfare state in Anglo-Saxon countries and Japan? As suggested by Alesina et al. (2004), in the United States inequality decreased high-income earners’ levels of happiness while inequality did not decrease low-income earners’ happiness. Hence, perceptions regarding redistribution and welfare states appear to differ between high- and low-income earners in countries with medium levels of trust. Based on data from Japan, Yamamura (2012b) presented evidence that community participation differently influences preferences for redistribution between people with above average income and people with below average income. Therefore, in Anglo-Saxon countries and Japan, the different effects of trust between high- and low-income earners are possibly neutralized. To determine any policy implications, analyzing the role of trust in government rather than generalized trust is a more concrete and suggestive method.Footnote 2 Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the effect of trust in government on the generosity of the welfare state in countries with medium levels of trust. A large number of researchers have explored how and why people prefer income redistribution (e.g., Ravallion and Lokshin 2000; Corneo and Grüner 2002; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005; Rainer and Siedler 2008; Alesina and Giuliano 2009; Klor and Shayo 2010). Recently, based on data from Sweden, Dahlberg et al. (2012) found significant negative effects of increased immigration to support redistribution. Furthermore, they found that the effect was especially pronounced among high-income people. However, no studies have attempted to compare the effect of trust in government on the preference for redistribution between different income groups.Footnote 3
 In addition to preference for redistribution, researchers have attempted to assess the determinants of perceptions regarding taxes (e.g., Cuccia and Carnes 2001; Gemmell et al. 2003, 2004; Feld and Larsen 2012).Footnote 4 Both preference for redistribution and perceptions regarding taxes are thought to be key factors in producing effective tax policy and efficient welfare states. However, subjective analysis is thought to be biased by various factors, including questionnaire construction and respondents’ misunderstandings regarding questions about their subjective views. Therefore, it is important to re-examine findings about subjective views using other approaches (Algan et al. 2011). To show how and the extent to which estimation results for preference for redistribution are reliable, it is worthwhile to assess whether estimations of perceptions about tax are consistent with those for preference for redistribution. By jointly analyzing the role of trust on both preference for redistribution and perceived tax burden, I can provide evidence showing how trust systematically influences individuals’ perceptions regarding policy on welfare state. For this purpose, the present paper used data from the Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS), which included more than 10,000 observations. Most existing papers are based on cross-country data or on data from countries with heterogeneous populations. Hence, identifying the effect of perceptions, for example perceptions of trust, is difficult. Japan is considered a more racially and culturally homogenous society than Western countries. Hence, the use of the JGSS allows me to naturally control for heterogeneity and therefore identify the effect of trust in government. The key findings of this paper via various specifications estimated by a bivariate ordered probit model are as follows: (1) people are more likely to express preferences for income redistribution in areas where neighbors tend to trust government; (2) people are more likely to perceive their tax burden as low in areas where neighbors tend to trust the government; and (3) when the sample is divided into people with above average income and those with below average income, the first two results are only observed for those with above average income. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, testable hypotheses are discussed. Section 3 explains data and the empirical method used. Section 4 presents the estimation results and their interpretation. The final section offers some conclusions.",24

Although the results have been decidedly mixed (see, for example, Persson and Tabellini 2006), a reasonable amount of evidence suggests that, even if democracies may not grow more quickly than non-democracies, they at least have more stable growth (Mobarak 2005). The purpose of this paper is to examine what it is about democracies that may lead to this relative stability. Specifically, it will be argued here that it is the greater level of political and economic transparency that accompanies democracies that is the key transmission mechanism at work. Using two existing measures of political and economic transparency, I show that, across a broad range of specifications, and controlling for an extensive range of plausible alternative explanations, transparency is a consistently important determinant of growth stability. Moreover, this strong effect continues even with the introduction of other institutional-type variables, which suggests that the lower volatility arising from greater transparency does not occur just because the greater transparency is associated with the better institutional framework of the country. Rather, it suggests that it is the informational advantages of greater transparency that help reduce volatility. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the existing political economy literature on growth volatility. Section 3 discusses the measures of transparency used in the empirical examination in Sect. 4. Section 5 offers some concluding comments.",2
15.0,2.0,Economics of Governance,08 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-013-0137-y,Institutions and public investment: an empirical analysis,May 2014,Francesco Grigoli,Zachary Mills,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Public investment has received much attention in recent years for several reasons. Many governments employed unprecedented fiscal stimulus packages aimed at sustaining employment and spurring economic growth during the global financial crisis. The ability to select appropriate public investment projects and implement them quickly, however, varied significantly, and concerns about the efficiency of capital spending arose in the aftermath of the crisis. At the same time, advanced and emerging economies with large current account surpluses are often called to accelerate the global rebalancing by shifting demand from foreign to domestic markets and public investment can be instrumental to narrow imbalances. Beyond these growth enhancing and stabilization functions, the role of public investment in satisfying the massive infrastructure needs in many developing and emerging economies has been widely acknowledged. For example, the United Nations Millennium Project (2005) called for a “big push” in key infrastructure investment to help countries meet the Millennium Development Goals. Institutions play a critical role in determining whether public investment spending will generate productive assets, or be inefficient and wasteful. For example, institutional mechanisms dictate whether projects undergo a rigorous cost-benefit analysis to evaluate their social and economic value, whether they are implemented on time, whether there are legitimate procurement practices, whether they adhere to their projected costs, and whether they are adequately maintained. Thus, in settings with weak institutions, there is a higher risk that public investment will be used to serve the interests of the ruling elite, resulting in the construction of low quality infrastructure. Moreover, if politicians seek as many rents as are compatible with remaining in power, the amount of rent seeking could vary in presence of partisan and electoral shocks (see Persson and Tabellini 2000). The latter are likely to be more frequent in countries with weak institutions, thereby increasing the volatility of capital spending. This paper expands upon Keefer and Knack’s (2007) cross-country analysis of the effect of institutional quality on public investment levels by using a more recent and longer time period (1984–2008), and a broader sample within a panel framework. Additionally, it investigates how the volatility of capital spending and the quality of infrastructure are affected by institutional quality. It also explores whether the availability of aid and natural resources frees up financial space for increasing public investment and makes it more volatile. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between public investment levels and institutional quality. At the same time, aid and natural resources increase capital spending, although there are no additional effects in resource-rich countries with weak governance. These results suggest that governments use public investment spending as a vehicle for rent seeking, and corruption and low bureaucracy quality seems to be the most relevant channels. We also find that countries with a lower quality of governance, receiving more aid, and abundant of natural resources, have more volatile capital spending. Finally, we provide some tentative evidence of a positive effect from the quality of governance on the quality of infrastructure, mainly through law and order and the quality of the bureaucracy. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the empirical literature. Section 3 describes our panel dataset, the estimation strategy and the empirical results. Section 4 presents the policy implications and concludes the paper.",31

\(^{,}\)
Footnote 2 Previous studies have pointed out several ways in which corruption worsens economic performance.Footnote 3 First, corruption causes inefficiency in the public sector when corrupt public officials choose private contractors who are willing to pay generous bribes instead of those who achieve the highest efficiency. Such officials may also allocate public expenditure to sectors where they expect to receive the largest bribes, for instance, the military and large-scale construction projects (see, e.g., Tanzi and Davoodi 1997, 2002a, b; Gupta et al. 2001).Footnote 4 In addition, public officials may slow the bureaucratic process in order to elicit bribes as “speed money” (e.g., Dreher and Herzfeld 2005; Kaufmann 1997). Second, corruption distorts the process of choosing an occupation for workers. If corruption provides public officials with lucrative opportunities for higher earnings, competent people may choose to become public officials rather than engage in a business that creates value (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny 1993; Acemoglu and Verdier 1998, 2000). Third, corruption pushes business into unofficial sectors, where transactions are more costly and uncertain, which can reduce efficiency (Johnson et al. 1997, 1998).Footnote 5 Fourth, corruption lowers the performance of the corporate sector as it may reduce efforts and investments by entrepreneurs in productivity-enhancing technology and physical/human capital as a result of raising the costs necessary for doing business and inducing uncertainty with respect to future returns from investments (Brunetti and Weder 1998; Brunetti et al. 1998; Brunetti and Weder 1998; Campos et al. 1999; Wei 2000).Footnote 6
\(^{,}\)
Footnote 7
 This study empirically tests this fourth effect, namely the adverse effect of corruption on the performance of the corporate sector.Footnote 8 The literature has consistently shown that corruption lowers investment rates (e.g., Mauro 1995; Brunetti et al. 1998; Campos et al. 1999; Gymiah-Brempong 2002). Other scholars have shown that economic growth rates are adversely affected by corruption, although these studies have been less conclusive (e.g., Ehlrich and Lui 1999; Kaufmann et al. 1999; Welsch 2004). A few studies have investigated the relation of corruption to GDP per capita. Among others, Hall and Jones (1999) show in a cross-national analysis that a lower measure of social infrastructure, which they construct while taking corruption into account,Footnote 9 corresponds to lower log output per worker. Kaufmann et al. (1999) constructed indices of governance of countries which were later developed into World Governance Indicators and presented evidence that as their measure of corruption worsens, log GDP per capita declines.Footnote 10 Output per worker or GDP per capita, however, could also influence the level of corruption of a country, and the endogeneity problem should thus be addressed by a method such as instrumental variable estimation. Hall and Jones (1999) and Kaufmann et al. (1999) both employ the fraction of the population speaking English and the fraction of the population speaking a major European language (English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish) as instrumental variables. However, some scholars have cast doubt on the validity of these instrumental variables (e.g., Lambsdorff 2006).Footnote 11 Instrumental variables must be correlated with the extent of corruption, but not with GDP per capita, and the fraction of the population speaking a major European language may affect GDP per capita through factors other than corruption, such as political instability, inequality, unsecure property rights, human capital, and social capital. Because of the difficulty of obtaining appropriate instruments, studies concerning the impact of corruption on productivity measures such as GDP per capita or gross value added per worker are relatively scarce. However, these variables are closely related to the materialistic well-being of the people and to social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality (Ray 1998), and it is thus worthwhile to investigate the effects of corruption on such productivity measures. The present study focuses on gross value added per worker and its decomposed factors (capital-labor ratio and total factor productivity), and employs the conviction rates of corruption-related cases as an instrument. Conviction rates have not been used to date as an instrument for corruption. The conviction rate in corruption-related cases may influence the level of corruption by affecting the expected returns from corruption for public officials, but conviction rates do not seem to affect the performance of three-digit manufacturing industries through factors other than corruption. Furthermore, the performance of three-digit manufacturing industries is presumed not to affect the conviction rate of corruption-related cases. Another issue in the literature is the validity of the variables for capturing corruption. Recently, several studies have criticized perception-based corruption indices as seriously biased (Mocan 2004; Abramo 2005; Andvig 2005; Svensson 2005; Razafindrakoto and Routboud 2006). For example, critics say that respondents evaluate the extent of corruption based on their own past experiences, and hence their assessment changes slowly and does not reflect the present extent of corruption. Moreover, a respondent who has read reports concerning the serious corruption of the country in the past may be affected by that information thereafter. Olken (2009) shows that a gap exists between the perception of corruption and the actual extent of corruption in Indonesian villages. The assessments may also suffer from subjectivity problems because of differences in respondents’ personal characters or backgrounds. Moreover, it has been shown that vulnerability to corruption differs between industries, and the extent of corruption differs between regions in a country. Therefore, evaluations by individuals who have knowledge limited to specific industries and regions may be biased with respect to the extent of corruption for the whole country.Footnote 12
 To complement the previous cross-country studies, which used a perception-based corruption index, we will measure the extent of corruption by the official number of cases related to violations of anti-corruption laws. The use of data on such corruption-related cases has some advantages. First, the number does not depend on subjective individual assessments. Second, we can obtain reasonable instrumental variables for the number of corruption-related crime cases. Third, by using this variable, we can more easily conduct panel data estimation than was possible in previous cross-country studies using a perception-based corruption index. For instance, the corruption-monitoring organization Transparency International utilizes different sources to construct the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) due to the differing availability of data across years and countries. For instance, the CPI for India from 2004 is based on data from 15 separate surveys, while the CPI from 2010 is based on only 10. Thus, time-series analysis based on the CPI is difficult to justify. For this reason, many previous studies using the CPI have conducted cross-national analyses. However, cross-national studies can produce biased results because they do not properly control for unobserved time-invariant country characteristics, which can be controlled for in panel data analysis.Footnote 13 In this regard, the data on the incidence of corruption-related cases provide useful cardinal measures of corruption to capture the time-series effects of corruption. An obvious and serious disadvantage of such official corruption data is inaccuracy in the reporting of crimes. This is the main reason that official corruption data has rarely been used in the literature. Criminologist Marenin (1997) expresses concern about the reliability of cross-country comparisons of crime data because the reliability of reporting and recordkeeping varies among countries. The International Crime Victimization Surveys (1996/97) show the differences among some developing countries in the propensity to report corruption. Table 33 in this publication (p. 92) shows that in Paraguay the rate of reporting is 8.9 %, while in Argentina it is only 0.7 %. India is located above the median with a reporting rate of 6.3 %. In this study, we address the underreporting problem by employing a method similar to that proposed by Soares (2004). Soares uses the International Crime Victimization Surveys (ICVSs) and presents a regression of the reporting rates of various crimes on several relevant variables. He then applies the estimation results to official crime data to obtain predicted true crime rates. We adopt a similar approach and address the problem of underreporting in the official data on corruption. There are several articles that use corruption-related crime data. For instance, Goel and Rich (1989) use data on the number of public officials convicted of bribery, and Goel and Nelson (1998) use data on the number of public officials convicted of abuse of public office in order to identify determinants of corruption. Glaeser and Saks (2006) utilize the number of public officials convicted of a corruption-related crime in each state in order to find determinants of state corruption level and present evidence of the negative effects of corruption on gross state product and median household income.Footnote 14 These articles, however, do not carefully address the underreporting problem. By addressing the problem of underreporting, our study complements these studies using official corruption data. The definition of corruption is not uniform across different countries, cultures, laws, and business practices (see, e.g., Philip 1997; Gardiner 2002). However, we can expect that the interpretation of the meaning of “corruption” is less variable between regions of one country than across countries. It is therefore worthwhile to examine the effects of corruption by comparing regions within one country, in this study, India.Footnote 15 The main reason for choosing India for our study is the deregulation that has occurred since the middle of the 1980s, including industry delicensing and trade liberalization, which are considered to have deterrent effects on corruption (see, e.g., Ades and Di Tella 1997). Thus, it is meaningful to choose a sample period from the late 1980s to the 1990s to examine the effects of corruption. A theoretical analysis of corruption has shown that detrimental effects of corruption may be more serious when the organization of a corruption network is decentralized than when it is centralized (Shleifer and Vishny 1993). India has been considered to have a decentralized corruption network, and is reported to be burdened with a high amount of corruption (see, e.g., Transparency International 2002; Transparency International India 2005, 2008; Bertrand et al. 2007). Among six World Governance Indicators compiled by Kaufmann et al. (2008), the position of India with respect to control of corruption on a standard normal distribution is \(-\)0.39, below the mean zero, which indicates that India has widespread corruption. Moreover, the “Doing Business” project, conducted by the World Bank, provides indicators in 10 categories related to the business environment, among which the indicators on starting a business and dealing with licenses are closely related to corruption. Among 178 countries covered in Doing Business 2008, India ranks 111th in the indicator of starting a business and 134th in the indicator of dealing with licenses, even after the sequence of delicensing since the 1980s. There seems to be no doubt that corporate actors in India are affected by corruption, and it is thus meaningful to study the effects of corruption on productivity in India. Finally, we note the importance of regional diversity in the extent of corruption within a country. Previous cross-national analyses have related the extent of corruption at the national level to national economic performance. However, if there is a wide range of regional corruption levels within a country, entrepreneurs could avoid corrupt regions and locate themselves in less corrupt regions, and thus the effects of corruption on the corporate sector should be more sharply observed across regions in a country.Footnote 16 Across Indian states, a large diversity has been reported with respect to business climate, including corruption. The Firm Analysis and Competitiveness Survey (FACS) conducted by the World Bank investigates inter-state differences in business climate in India.Footnote 17 Some of the results are explained by Veeramani and Goldar (2005), who show in their Table 1 (p. 2414) that investment climates differ substantially between states. Another study by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies (Debroy and Bhandari 2005) constructed several indices related to the extent of freedom in each Indian state. Among these indices, the regulation of credit, labor, and business indicator is the one most directly related to corruption since the authors considered corruption when constructing this indicator. The table for this indicator in their report (p. 21) shows the diversity of the index across Indian states. From these studies, we can see that there is diversity in terms of the extent of corruption among Indian states. We will examine the effects of such differences.Footnote 18
 We investigate the effects of corruption on economic performance variables of three-digit manufacturing industries at the Indian state level in this study. Our estimation results show that corruption reduces gross value added per worker and total factor productivity, but not the capital-labor ratio. We also extend our basic empirical formulation to two groups of industries classified by average firm size, as measured by capital stock per factory. We presume that large firms have an advantage in dealing with corrupt public officials. For instance, large firms may offer large bribes to powerful politicians or officials to create favorable business conditions. On the other hand, small firms are likely to fall victim to lower-class public officials demanding bribes just to receive normal public services. We show that the deleterious effects of corruption are limited to industries of smaller average firm size, indicating that large firms are more likely to avoid the adverse effects of corruption. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Our empirical formulation is explained in Sect. 2, followed by the results of instrumental variable estimation in Sect. 3. Section 4 investigates the effects of corruption in different groups as classified by average firm size. Section 5 concludes the article.",10

Why do some rulers protect property and human rights, even when costly? The answers to these questions are especially important since recent studies show positive relationships of quality of institutions and/or protection of rights with economic development (Acemoglu et al. 2005; Rodrik et al. 2004; Blume and Voigt 2007). Analysing a ruler’s incentive to establishing institutions and protecting rights is key to understanding a crucial mechanism of economic development. This paper focuses on the lack of commitment resulting from political power, which the literature on transaction-cost politics highlights as an obstacle to economic development (North 1990; Dixit 1996; Acemoglu 2003). Even if a ruler promises to protect private property rights, he can abuse his political power and renege on his promise ex post. Since citizens anticipate the ruler’s violation of his promise, they have little incentive to investment. This lack of commitment to property rights protection, therefore, hampers economic development. Various studies argue that the development of institutions offers a possible solution to the commitment problem. In a seminal paper, North and Weingast (1989) argue that the government under the Stuarts’ reign in 17th-century England could not borrow sufficient money to cover war costs due to its inability to honour contractual agreements. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the development of institutions, which served as advanced roles of the Parliament and independent judiciary, improved credibility to the government’s ability to meet its commitments. In contemporary history, the Asian authoritarian regimes, the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan and the People’s Action Party in Singapore, established high-quality courts. The judiciaries in these countries have enhanced the regimes’ credibility and therefore have attracted foreign investment, which are crucial factors assisting such small states’ survival (Root and May 2008; Silverstein 2008). Checks and balances by an independent judiciary can protect private property rights from a state’s expropriation. Judicial independence (JI) plays a vital role in upholding the rule of law and limiting a ruler’s political power. Judges with the security of tenure can decide cases according to the rule of law and independent from the other branches of government. Furthermore, courts with authority can undertake constitutional review and declare the unconstitutionality of a law.Footnote 1
 An independent judiciary is necessary for a ruler’s credible commitment to property rights protection, but is not sufficient for it. Indeed, establishing JI causes a different commitment problem: Can the ruler commit to keeping the judiciary independent? A government strong enough to create institutions is also strong enough to abolish them. Thus, after abolishing the judiciary, the ruler can renege on its promise of property rights protection. Therefore, the independent judiciary must be self-enforcing for it to become the fundamental solution to the commitment problem regarding property rights protection. Another important issue for a ruler’s successful commitment to property rights protection is that citizens need to observe a judiciary’s effectiveness.Footnote 2 Without observing the judiciary’s quality, citizens cannot trust the ruler’s announcement. Although not presenting a theoretical model, Farber (2002) argues that guaranteeing human rights allows the ruler to signal citizens that he will limit his power to confiscate private property. To elucidate the mechanisms of successful commitment, I develop a political commitment game between a self-interested ruler and citizens. The game allows an independent judiciary as an endogenous commitment device associated with endogenous reneging costs. In the game, the ruler creates an endogenous level of JI with establishment costs and announces a tax rate. After citizens involve costly effort for production, the ruler has the opportunity to renege on the announced tax rate and set a new rate. If the ruler resets the tax rate, he must pay reneging costs that are directly proportional to the JI level. The finally implemented tax rate is regarded as a degree of the ruler’s violation of property rights protection. I assume that the JI level is imperfectly observed such that, with some probability, citizens have perfect information on JI and, with the remaining probability, they exist in a state of ignorance. This paper has two main contributions. I show that in cases where citizens are able to observe a judiciary’s effectiveness with some positive probability, the ruler creates an independent judiciary and can commit to an announced tax rate. The equilibrium tax rate, however, is on the inefficient side of the Laffer curve. This inefficiently high tax shows the cost of honouring property rights. After promoting private production by announcing a low tax rate, the ruler has a strong incentive to turn around and expropriate the production. Thus, to prove commitment to a low tax rate, the ruler needs to absorb the costs of a highly independent judiciary. Second, I conduct a theoretical analysis which argues the positive role of human rights as a signal of JI. Even though citizens have no chance to observe the judiciary’s effectiveness, they notice the current status of human rights and believe that the ruler abides by his announcement. This result assumes that a high JI level makes it less costly to guarantee human rights (the single crossing property). In this equilibrium, however, in addition to the inefficient tax, a further source of inefficiency arises. Since the ruler needs to reduce the cost of human rights protection, he establishes an inefficiently high JI level, in the sense that he does not entirely use JI for lowering tax rates. Despite these two types of inefficiency, the creation of an independent judiciary achieves a Pareto improvement compared with the case of lack of commitment, since citizens enjoy property rights protection and produce outputs and the ruler can collect taxes. As a solution to a commitment problem concerning property rights protection, the literature suggests cooperative equilibria in a repeated setting (Greif et al. 1994; Grossman and Noh 1994; Acemoglu 2003, 2006). The cooperative equilibria assume coordination amongst citizens to punish a ruler who deviates from such cooperation. The literature argues that courts play a coordination role in a repeated play. Myerson (2008) shows that courts work as a communication tool improving citizens’ ability to punish a ruler who reneges on announcements. Stephenson (2003) and Carrubba (2005) argue that courts’ judgements become a public signal that helps political parties to punish rivals who deviate from mutual restraint so as to pursue a moderate policy. Instead of examining such judiciaries’ coordination role in repeated games, I study a one-period game with rulers’ implementation costs of subverting judiciaries and show a judiciary’s deterrent role for a ruler’s credible commitment. For successful commitment, a ruler must respect judicial decisions, and hence the independent judiciary must be self-enforcing. This approach does not substitute for judiciaries’ coordination role, but complements it. I demonstrate conditions such that the ruler sustains the independent judiciary that is also able to serve a coordination role amongst citizens. The literature proposes various explanations for why incumbent rulers found independent judiciaries. Moustafa (2007) discusses five functions of courts in authoritarian regimes. Rulers use courts to (1) exercise social control, (2) obtain legitimacy of the government, (3) control administrative agents, (4) make a credible commitment to a market economy and (5) delegate controversial reforms to the judiciary.Footnote 3 A noteworthy explanation centres on the strategic relationship with the future government. An independent judiciary constrains the action of the future government who would like to alter current policies. Thus, if the current government anticipates regime change and has a different policy preference from the future government, the current government relies on the judiciary for making present policies durable (Landes and Posner 1975; Hanssen 2004). In contrast, I focus on a judiciary’s commitment technology and study not only its benefit but also the cost of establishing an independent judiciary from a ruler’s perspective. Thus, I provide a theoretical explanation of the de facto degree of JI for credible commitment. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes a simple game of a commitment problem and argues a positive role of a judiciary. Section 3 analyses human rights as a signal. Section 4 discusses this model’s theoretical implications and their empirical validity. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix.",1

The focus of the paper is on health services, which in Italy are mainly the responsibility of the regions. The efficiency of their provision at the regional level is measured in two ways, either by data envelopment analysis, or by stochastic frontier analysis. The paper takes advantage of a process of decentralisation in Italy that began after the financial and political crises of the early 1990s, which deeply reformed the structure of regional governments. In 1995, new regional elections were held under a new electoral law that replaced the previous proportional system by a new system based on majority rule and which also favoured the establishment of a presidential regime in regional governments. Secondly, while health care expenditures, along with part of the decision-making powers, had been delegated to the regional level since the establishment of the regions, revenues have been characterised by a decentralisation process only during the 1990s. The most important reform occurred in 1998 when two new regional taxes replaced a large amount of the intergovernmental grants that were earmarked for the health care sector. The main intention of both reforms was to stimulate the accountability of the regional public authorities in order to increase the efficiency of local governments. The main question that this paper will attempt to answer is whether the 1995 reform of political institutions and the process of fiscal decentralisation produced any effect on the efficiency of the health care sector. The empirical strategy is to treat the 1995 change in the regional political institutions and the process of fiscal decentralisation as exogenous policy variations. Unlike previous empirical literature (Barankay and Lockwood 2007; Adam et al. 2014), the impact of the two policy changes is evaluated by estimating a frontier production function by both a parametric (stochastic frontier models) and non parametric approach (data envelopment analysis) thereby testing the robustness of the results with respect to the two approaches. Both methodologies are applied using a longitudinal data-set that includes financial and health care data disaggregated at the regional level for the 15 year period of 1991–2005. The output of the health care sector will be measured in terms of mortality rates (neonatal and infant), that from many aspects can be considered the best available measure of output; the current public health care expenditures will be used as the main measure of the inputs; finally, regional tax revenues earmarked for the health care sector will be used as a measure of the fiscal decentralisation process. The analysis is focussed mainly on the role played by the 1995 electoral reform because the relationship between the new electoral system and the efficiency of regional governments is estimated in a quasi-experimental setting that allows a causal interpretation of this relationship. In particular the fifteen regions with normal statute have been used as the treated group, and the six regions with special statute, that were not affected by the reform, function as the control group. Then the treatment effect is evaluated by a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator which allows of addressing the counterfactual question of what would have been the efficiency path after 1995 in the group of regions affected by the reform if the new electoral system had not been introduced. Although the same quasi-experimental setting can not be used to evaluate the impact of the fiscal decentralisation process, it is very important to take also this second reform into account because a proper evaluation of the 1995 electoral reform can not be done regardless of the massive changes that the funding system of the health care sector underwent during those same years. Moreover, the lack of empirical studies makes the analysis of the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and government efficiency very important in itself, especially in the actual Italian political context where the central government is going to embark on a second process of fiscal decentralisation. The results of the empirical models are very robust with respect to the different methodologies and different mortality rates. In particular the estimates show that the electoral reform unambiguously increased the efficiency of the regional governments by around 3 %, a significant number considering that we are studying the health sector of a developed country and we are controlling for the impact of technical change and other environmental factors. As far as the impact of fiscal decentralisation is concerned, the empirical evidence suggests a general positive correlation between regional tax revenues and efficiency.Footnote 1 Subsequently, the effect of the 1998 tax reform on efficiency has been estimated between zero and 0.007 % in relation to a 1 % increase in regional tax revenues. Therefore, the total increase of efficiency due to the fiscal decentralisation reform has been evaluated roughly between zero and 12 % since real per capita regional tax revenues have risen on average from 33 to 630 euros after the reform. However, it is important to note that the weak robustness of this last result supports the idea that the effectiveness of the 1998 tax reform might have been seriously undermined by the influence wielded by the central government that hindered regional government from setting an independent tax policy. These findings are consistent with the theoretical literature that identifies several channels by which increased fiscal decentralisation and electoral accountability can increase the efficiency of service delivery (Besley and Case 1995; Bordignon et al. 2004; Besley and Smart 2007; Hindriks and Lockwood 2009). Moreover the positive impact of the 1995 electoral reform is in line with the theoretical models that predict higher government efficiency in case of majoritarian electoral systems and presidential regimes (Persson and Tabellini 2000). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes briefly the changes that affected regional political institutions in 1995 and the main aspects of the fiscal decentralisation process that reformed the regional health care funding system.

Reviewing the long-runs data on the prices of three important African crops—cotton, coffee and cocoa—Deaton (1999, p. 27) made the very wise observation that: “what commodity prices lack in trend, they make up for in variance.” Deaton’s observation applies equally to the price of oil, the most widely tracked commodity price in the world. It is also observed that even though boom-and-bust periods last longer, the fiscal policy of resource-rich nations tends to be procyclical. The present study attempts to understand how price volatility affects the political economy of a resource-rich nation. Our model is applicable to nations that are economically dependent upon revenues from selling natural resources in the international market where the price of natural resources is subject to significant swings. Two states reflect price volatility: ‘high prices’ and ‘low prices’. We consider two types of resources: point-source and diffused. To explore point-source resources, capital-intensive advanced technology is required. In contrast, diffused resources are explored by labor-intensive techniques. In our framework, there are two groups: the rich (minority) and the poor (majority). The rich possess more of the diffused resources than the poor majority. The point-source resource is owned by the group that is in power. When the rich minority holds the power, the country is under autocracy and when the poor dominate, the country is under democracy. Redistribution takes place via a transfer of revenue earned from selling the point-source resource and imposing tax on the diffused resource. The group in power redistributes in their own favor. Either group has the ability to force a switch to a regime in their favor. In Acemoglu and Robinson (2009), the risk of revolution against autocrats (or the risk of coup against democracies) is highest in transitory economic downturns. This is because the opportunity cost of staging a revolution (or a coup) is lowest in these downturns. This theory found evidence, for example, in Brückner and Ciccone (2011). In contrast, we argue that the result above depends critically on the kind of goods a country produces.Footnote 1 When the main economic activity in a country is extraction of point resources such as oil, the opportunity cost does not alter if the price of the resource changes while the benefit from becoming the incumbent is more lucrative. Therefore, there is a strong risk of a revolution or coup when the price of the point-source commodity is high. If the main economic activity in a country is the production of diffused resources (which are labor intensive, and thus hard to expropriate, such as coffee), then Acemoglu and Robinson’s result holds: opportunity cost of a revolution or coup is lowest when the price of the commodity is lowest. This is the main finding of our paper. Our other results can be summarized as follows. In the case of point-source resources such as oil and natural gas: 
What causes procyclical fiscal policy? Fiscal procyclicality (commonly dubbed the boom–bust cycle) is defined as the ramping up of sometimes inefficient spending after positive revenue shocks, and abrupt expenditure reductions after adverse shocks (Ghura and Pattillo et al. 2012). More concretely, in boom years, the commodity export price is above the 75th percentile; in bust years, it is below the 25th percentile (see Kaminsky et al. 2005). We argue that when the price of lumpy resources such as oil is high, the incumbent government faces strong (political) pressure to redistribute wealth. As a result, spending increases. When the price of the commodity is low, such pressure is less intense and hence the spending does not have to match the previous high levels. 
Does price volatility lead to political instability? An increase in price volatility implies even higher prices during boom periods and an equally low price during bust periods. This fluctuation allows the incumbent group to redistribute the resource wealth to the non-incumbent group when the political pressure is most intense. This allows the incumbent to avert potential political crises. Therefore, political instability is avoided when the regime is under threat. In the case of diffused resources such as coffee and cocoa, we ask:  
When is the existing regime most vulnerable? Unlike point-source resources, natural resources that are diffused, such as agricultural commodities (which are labor-intensive), may pose a challenge during a low-price state, as the opportunity cost of rebellion is low. Therefore, both rebellions and coups are more probable when the price is low. 
Does price volatility lead to political instability? Increased price volatility decreases the opportunity cost of a revolution during recessions in the case of diffused resources. Therefore, both coups and revolutions become more probable events and political instability is enhanced. This, however, presupposes that regimes are under threat when prices are low. If regimes are under threat when prices are high, the reverse occurs where political instability is reduced, due to more fluctuations in prices. In the context of political economy, political instability has been linked to price shocks (Alesina et al. 1996; Blattman and Miguel 2010). Two opposing views exist. The first view considers the rise in price as an increase in resource rents that induces the political non-incumbent to challenge the existing regime. The second view considers the impact of price shocks on the incentive of individuals to rebel. A decline in commodity prices lowers the opportunity cost and hence conflict becomes more probable. Employing new and comprehensive price shock data, Bazzi and Blattman (2011) found that commodity price shocks have no discernible effect on the onset of new conflicts, but have some effect on ongoing conflict. Their results support the findings of Dube and Vargas (2013), who showed that price shocks affect conflict in opposite directions depending on the factor intensity of the commodity. Using a unique violence related data-set from Columbia, Dube and Vargas (2013) found that a fall in the price of coffee (which is labor-intensive) increases violence disproportionately in municipalities growing more coffee. However, a rise in the price of oil (which is capital-intensive) intensifies attacks disproportionately in municipalities that produce more oil. Our paper does not focus upon the impact of a resource boom on an ongoing civil war but discusses whether or not a boom can cause political transition. We illustrate that a boom in point-source resources causes regime instability, while the increased price volatility can stabilise the regime through more redistribution when the political pressure is as its most intense. In the case of diffused resources, a boom in natural resources leads to more democratization, while increased price volatility leads to more political instability. This is because lower prices during recessions cause lower opportunity costs and more incentives for the rich to mount a coup and the poor to rebel. The nature of fiscal policy during business cycles differs across nations. This behavior was first documented in the seminal work of Gavin and Perotti (1997). Numerous studies document how the cyclical nature of fiscal policy differs across countries belonging to different income brackets. For instance, in Kaminsky et al. (2005), the cyclical correlation between a country’s government spending and gross domestic product (GDP) over the 1960–2003 period ranged from –1 for Finland (denoting a strongly countercyclical policy) to +1 for Oman (denoting a strongly procyclical policy). In their analysis, the majority of the commodity-exporting countries exhibited procyclical spending, compared with advanced countries. This finding is corroborated by Akitoby et al. (2004), Alesina and Tabellini (2005), Talvi and Végh (2005), and Ilzetzki and Végh (2008), who found evidence of fiscal procyclicality in a large sample of developing countries. In general, industrial countries with established democracies tend to pursue countercyclical policies, whereas developing countries with less consolidated political regimes (defined in the next section) pursue procyclical policies. For nations rich in point-source resources, in boom years, it is difficult for a government to resist the temptation (or avoid the political pressure) to spend proportionally, resulting in a large fiscal budget encompassing higher subsidies, more public sector employment, higher public sector wages and lucrative government contracts to local businesses.Footnote 2 However, once the world prices for exported commodity goods drop, most governments find it difficult to reverse their current expenditure (e.g., subsidies and wages) and rely more on cutting capital expenditure. In a panel study of 32 oil-producing countries over the 1992–2009 period, Arezki and Ismail (2012) found that current government spending increases in boom times, but is downward-sticky. Furthermore, the volatility of total spending is over 60 percent higher in resource-rich countries than in their non-resource counterparts (Ghura and Pattillo et al. 2012). What is the underlying motive for pursuing procyclical fiscal policies in developing nations in general? The two most convincing explanations are: Imperfections in credit markets (Gavin and Perotti 1997; Riascos and Végh 2003): Less access to credit markets during recessions forces the governments to cut expenditure during bad times when it is most needed. Distorted political incentives (Tornell and Lane 1999; Talvi and Végh 2005): An increase in government receipts from taxes or mineral royalties during booms raises the political pressure to spend more. The present study belongs to this second group. In theory, commodity-exporting nations in particular have several ways to deal with the volatility of natural resource revenue. Frankel (2012), for example, offers a menu of choices which encompass risk diversification such as hedging export proceeds on option markets (as implemented by Mexico), countercyclical macroeconomic policies (such as the Chilean-style fiscal rules) and good governance institutions (like Botswana’s “Pula Fund”, which is not subject to political influence). However, in practice, fiscal policy tends to be procyclical in the majority of the commodity-exporting developing countries. Though the concepts are related, expansionary or contractionary fiscal policies should be differentiated from policies that redistribute wealth from the incumbent group to the non-incumbent—the primary focus of our paper. Fiscal policies also include projects that transfer wealth within the incumbent group. Two nations may have expansionary fiscal policies to the same degree but a distinction can exist with regards to the identity of the beneficiary. According to our paper, when a nation possesses a significant amount of point-source resources, the incumbent regime is under pressure during boom periods. Therefore, incumbents need to transfer wealth to the rest during these periods. Sometimes, the maximum possible transfer may not ensure the continuation of the regime and this will lead to a change in regimes. In the case of diffused resources, the regimes are under pressure when the price is low. The combination of democracy and diffused resources will lead to similar procyclical redistribution policies, as the poor can freely tax the rich. In contrast, autocracy and diffused resources will lead to a countercyclical policy with regards to redistribution. Therefore, more interesting variations are observed. With commodity prices being the leading indicator of economic well-being in many resource-rich economies, the impact of commodity price volatility on economic growth has also been studied by economists at length. Although, in general, a negative link between commodity price volatility and growth performance has been observed, the actual extent of this relationship varies greatly from country to country. Differences among countries in terms of their level of financial development, their absorption capacity and the quality of their institutions, among others, play important roles in safeguarding the economy against volatility. These hypotheses are supported by recent empirical studies involving cross-country examination of commodity-exporting countries. For instance, van der Ploeg and Poelhekke (2009) observed that the direct positive effect of resources on growth is negated by the indirect negative effect of volatility. In an extensive survey of the literature,van der Ploeg (2011) gathered econometric evidence supporting the notion that the volatility of resource windfalls is the quintessence of the resource curse, as well as the hypothesis that the negative effect on growth is lower in countries with well-developed financial systems. We do not focus upon economic development in this paper. However, we show that political instability can occur due to resource booms, which thwarts the development process. Aside from price volatility, the dynamic nature of a political contest between rival factions competing for natural resource rents and the attendant commitment problems have been studied extensively in theory. For our present endeavor, the most relevant works are Acemoglu and Robinson (2009), and Dunning (2009). The framework built in Acemoglu and Robinson (2009) is equipped to analyze the stability of political regimes under volatility. Dunning (2009, ch. 3), using the same framework, derived conditions that allow one to investigate how the political equilibria vary as a function of changing levels of the resource rents, when the private (non-resource) economy is more non-egalitarian. According to Dunning (2009), when there is a deep division between rich and poor in a society, the existence of a resource ushers in a new source of redistribution, leading towards a democratic outcome. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a simple theoretical framework for understanding how the price volatility of natural resources affects political outcomes. Sections 3 and 4 present the main results and comparative statics for point-source and diffused resources, respectively. Section 5 discusses the empirical implications of our results. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1

In particular, studies have shown that women prioritise health more than men do (e.g. Shapiro and Mahajan 1986; Funk and Gathmann 2008).Footnote 1 These differences in policy preferences of women and men may translate into changes in health policy if women’s representation in public policy-making roles increases.Footnote 2 Due to their superior understanding of women’s preferences, women policy-makers may contribute to an increase of policy responsiveness to women’s preferences. In addition, female policy-makers’ own preferences may affect policy decisions (e.g. Besley and Case 2003; Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004). This intuition is supported by recent studies that document a positive relationship between women’s representation in legislative power and allocation of public resources to health (Rehavi 2007; Chen 2010).Footnote 3
 While there is an extensive literature on women’s representation in legislative power, comparative analysis of women in executive branches of governments is rather limited (Siaroff 2000). Little is known about the consequences for policy of women’s representation in cabinets worldwide, even though they are among the most powerful political positions (Studlar and Moncrief 1999). Public spending is ultimately a result of the cabinet’s decision making in the budget process, which is approved by the legislature. Cabinets across countries therefore have a significant influence over health policy initiation and construction. Furthermore, since cabinet ministers, unlike parliamentarians, are normally appointed positions they may have weaker disincentives to act according to their own interests. As a result, the identity, including the gender, of cabinet members may potentially be of greater importance for policy than that of legislatures. To demonstrate the significant role of women in cabinet, Atchison and Down (2009) document their effect on female-friendly social policies across countries. This study contributes to this strand of literature by studying the effect of women’s cabinet representation on public health spending. Reliable estimation of the effect of women’s representation in policy-making roles is challenging for several reasons. Policy environment, and public health spending in particular, may have broad effects on women’s participation in socio-economic life. In addition to this reverse causality problem, countries that differ for various unobserved reasons may differ both with regards to women’s political representation and policy outcomes. Some of the micro-level studies on female elected representatives have exploited electoral outcomes (e.g. Clots-Figueras 2007; Rehavi 2007) and reservation policies (e.g. Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004) to identify their effect on various policies. Macro-level studies examining the impact of women’s political representation in a range of contexts across countries have often neglected the problem of endogeneity (e.g. Dollar et al. 2001; Swamy et al. 2001). In a study of the impact of women’s representation in legislative power on policy outcomes including health spending, Chen (2010) used gender quotas on representation of female legislators as an instrument for the proportion of female legislators across countries. However, the exogeneity of gender quotas in parliaments is questionable given that their introduction is likely to be a consequence of the state of women’s representation. This paper utilises a novel identification strategy by instrumenting women’s representation in cabinet with the share of daughters that a national leader parents.Footnote 4 First, national leaders have important mandates over the recruitment of cabinet members (e.g. Amorim Neto and Strom 2006; Kang 2009). Second, having daughters may make parents more sensitive to gender equity issues due to a resulting attitudinal shift (e.g. Warner 1991; Warner and Steel 1999) or through the realisation of their effect on their daughters’ well-being (Doepke and Tertilt 2009). In support of this intuition, it has been shown that parenting daughters increases legislators’ propensity to vote liberally on women’s issues bills (Washington 2008). Based on these premises, it is hypothesized that national leaders who parent daughters may be more likely to appoint and work together with women in cabinet. Using this instrumental variable approach, women’s representation in cabinet is found to cause an increase in public health spending across a large sample of countries in the year 2000. Furthermore, the results suggest that women’s representation in cabinet will contribute to closing the gender gap in life expectancies. The first stage results indicate that women’s representation in cabinet is significantly higher in countries whose leaders parent a higher proportion of daughters. The exclusion restriction implied by the instrumental variable approach is that the share of daughters that a national leader parents has no effect on public health spending, other than through its effect on women’s representation in cabinet. One concern with this exclusion restriction is that the instrumental variables estimates may be capturing the effect of parenting daughters on public health spending, however working through other channels than assumed. In particular, having more daughters may shape preferences of national leaders in a more general way, leading to alternative organisational features that would affect public spending. Oswald and Powdthavee (2010) demonstrate that having daughters leads people to be more sympathetic to left-wing parties. The national leader parenting daughters may then form more left-wing cabinets, which in turn may increase public health spending. To address this concern, measures of political orientation of the national leader’s party are included as controls. This does not overturn the results. Another concern for exclusion restriction is that national leaders parenting daughters may directly affect public health spending, if it benefits women more. In this case, the instrumental variables estimates may be assigning the effect of parenting daughters to women in cabinet. However, this is unlikely to be the case. Agreement on budgetary parameters is normally reached through negotiations in the cabinet budgeting process (von Hagen and Harden 1995; Hallerberg and von Hagen 1999). Therefore, it is an outcome of combined preferences of cabinet members who need to agree on the parameters. The identity of a leader is related to the preferences of the electorate, at least in a democracy. Therefore, an electorate that prefers spending on health may elect a national leader with preferences for spending on health—a possibility posing a further concern for exclusion restriction. The empirical literature on issue voting, however, does not provide consistent support for the role of issues on voting decisions in elections, particularly with regard to noneconomic policy issues. For example, based on a review of multiple studies, Kinder (1998) suggests that issues have rarely been pivotal in presidential elections. That the instrument is not correlated with the error term is also supported by the results of an overidentification test. The following section outlines the methodology. Section 3 presents the results, and Sect. 4 concludes.",33
15.0,4.0,Economics of Governance,30 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-014-0146-5,Information and energy policy preferences: a survey experiment on public opinion about electricity pricing reform in rural India,November 2014,Michaël Aklin,Patrick Bayer,Johannes Urpelainen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"For decades, India has suffered from an inefficient power sector that frequently fails to generate the electricity that the country needs for economic growth and wellbeing. The situation is especially dire in rural areas. Not only are electrification rates low, but the electricity grid frequently fails to provide a reliable supply of power when people need it. The latest census data indicate that every third Indian remains without access to electricity even for basic household services (Government of India 2011a), and in some major states such as Bihar the situation is much worse. Why has India failed to improve reliable rural electricity supply? One widespread hypothesis for India’s failure to reform the power sector is popular opposition to increased electricity tariffs (i.e. pricing), especially among influential segments such as farmers who own electrified water pumps (Lal 2006; Santhakumar 2008). In this telling, large segments of the Indian population oppose higher electricity tariffs. Even if they are interested in the improved reliability of power supply, they may worry that the state’s promise that reform improves service is not credible. As Lal (2006: 24) puts it, the state “has failed to carry credible assurances” that the reform will actually improve customer service. A related issue is the lack of capital investment by the private sector (Singh 2006; Szakonyi and Urpelainen 2013). While the lack of cash flow from consumers due to low prices is a central problem, it might be reduced if private companies invested in the power sector and offered better service. While private utilities may also wish to increase tariffs, they could plausibly improve quality because their profits depend on the provision of a good service. Is there any hope for change? Could new information about the potential benefits of reform sway the Indian public to support a financially sustainable power sector? If so, under which conditions? The provision of information is often assumed to be a key determinant of public opinion (Barabas and Jerit 2010; Jerit and Barabas 2006; Prior and Lupia 2008; Alvarez and Brehm 2002), but we know little about its role in individual preferences over energy issues and development policies more generally. We hypothesize that an argument emphasizing the direct effect of higher electricity tariffs on the reliability of supply will be powerful in India. Higher electricity tariffs improve the financial situation of the electricity suppliers, thus releasing funds for capacity investment. Improved capacity, in turn, allows a more reliable supply to customers. This goes against the conventional wisdom that people prefer low prices and reforms can only succeed “by stealth” (Jenkins 1999; Varshney 1998). In answering this question, it is important to recall that pricing reform is not the same as privatization. In principle, public power generation companies can increase their electricity tariffs and invest the revenue in improved capacity and distribution. Since power sector privatization is politically controversial in India (Lal 2006; Santhakumar 2008), we distinguish between privatization and increased electricity tariffs. Even if privatization fails to garner public support, a pricing reform may prove popular. We separately investigate the effect of pro-reform information on support for pricing reform versus privatization. To test the argument, we report empirical results from a survey experiment in rural Uttar Pradesh on building public support for higher electricity tariffs in India. The experiment was conducted on a convenience sample of 593 subjects in the Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh in the spring of 2013. This location of the experiment is interesting for several reasons. First, Uttar Pradesh has one of the lowest electrification rates in the country, with only 37 % of households relying on grid electricity for lighting (Government of India 2011a). Second, the quality of electricity supply is poor. On average, a household in Uttar Pradesh has about 9 h of electricity per day; this number drops to 7 h for households located in rural regions (Desai et al. 2007). Finally, the villages where the survey was conducted were electrified only a few months before the survey. Therefore, electricity is a salient topic and we have a relatively even split of electrified and unelectrified households in the sample. The findings testify to the power of new information. Since the villagers consider power supply to be the government’s responsibility, a clear majority of the sample opposes privatization of power generation, and our arguments have little effects on our respondents. However, once the positive relationship between higher electricity tariffs and improved service quality is explained, respondents strongly favor a price increase. Specifically, the information treatment significantly increases support for higher prices by 0.45 points, on average, on a 0–4 response scale. Given that the treatment is a simple script with information, this treatment effect in the order of 10 % is substantively important. Not only do people seem to understand and believe that higher prices encourage capacity investment, but this information was sufficiently powerful to create public support for price increases. This is all the more remarkable, given that 70 % of our respondents already had an electricity connection and would have to pay higher prices. Since the experiment was conducted on a convenience sample, it is important to conduct further analysis on the generalizability of the findings. To this end, we analyzed public opinion data on power sector reform supplied by Santhakumar (2008) in a national survey of India conducted in 2004–2005. This survey reflects public opinion about electricity privatization in 13 major Indian states, with Orissa excluded because privatization had already been implemented in 1996. We show that the patterns which our theory predicts can also be found in this data set. While opposition to privatization is strong, people who experienced increases in prices tended to be more favorable to further price increases, suggesting that they witnessed the improvement of electricity quality obtained by their contribution. Additionally, more educated individuals, who presumably are better informed about the benefits of cost recovery in pricing, are willing to pay higher tariffs. The article offers a dual contribution to the social sciences. First, we add to the body of literature on economic reform by showing that new information about the benefits of higher prices can have notable effects on public opinion. This complements the finding in Baker (2003) that people do support economic reforms if it is in their direct self-interest. We show that the lack of support for efficient economic reforms could simply reflect the public’s lack of awareness of the benefits of the reform, as opposed to insistence on low prices and generous subsidies. Moreover, our finding on the importance of distinguishing between price increases and privatization suggests that conflating popular and unpopular elements of economic reform in public communication can dilute the effectiveness of new information. Second, the findings have important implications for the politics of power sector reform in India. The role of popular opposition to electricity reform remains debated in the literature (Lal 2006; Santhakumar 2008). Our findings support Lal’s (2006) view that while people do appreciate the benefits of enhanced power generation, they worry that the reforms may not deliver. This interpretation is warranted because the argument we tested does not require a complex implementation strategy by the state. Enhanced revenue allows increased capacity investment by the power sector, and this results in improved supply. Our argument goes against Jenkins’s (1999) general argument that reforms in India often progress “by stealth.” Our findings suggest that policymakers can build popular support for higher electricity tariffs and, in so doing, overcome entrenched interests. A reform strategy that emphasizes these benefits, while downplaying privatization, could be effective, provided the challenges of regulatory reform are not forgotten (Dubash and Rao 2008). This recommendation is in line with findings from a volume edited by Victor and Heller (2007) on power sector reforms in developing countries. The studies in that volume show that full privatization is rare outside the traditional industrialized countries, and most governments have opted for a “hybrid” solution of independent regulation without full privatization. Our findings suggest that this strategy could garner popular support among rural Indians. The relevance of this argument, of course, depends on the role that the mass public plays in the politics of reform. In some cases, it could be that the mass public ultimately plays a relatively small role in determining reform. Some India experts have argued, for example, that the most influential opponents of power sector reform are interest groups such as utility employees and large farmers who own electric pumpsets (Lal 2006). As Dubash and Rajan (2001: 3369) put it, “even though the constituents who stand most to gain from the supply of free electricity may be in the minority, they have appeared thus far to be those who maintain just enough swing power to capture the attention of most political parties.” According to Jenkins (1999), governments can also avoid dealing with public opinion by implementing reforms “by stealth.” More generally, the importance of public opinion for reforms may vary across countries, issue areas, and time (Varshney 1998). Our findings indicate that governments may be able to generate public support among the mass public through information provision, but it remains to be seen if this can, in contexts like India, result in the kind of mass mobilization that would allow power sector reform to move forward.",12
15.0,4.0,Economics of Governance,29 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-014-0147-4,Cooperative choice and its framing effect under threshold uncertainty in a provision point mechanism,November 2014,Koji Kotani,Kenta Tanaka,Shunsuke Managi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Many public goods (bads) are only provided (prevented) if the contributions (i.e., the degree of cooperation) meet or exceed some threshold. Throughout this paper, we call this collective decision setup a “provision point mechanism (PPM)” following Davis and Holt (1992). A simple example of a public goods provision is the decision to provide a public project based on a majority voting rule, whereas an example of public bads prevention is open-access fishery management with a threshold level of fishing efforts that leads to the exhaustion of fish stock, or “bifurcation” (see Clark 1990, page 19 for bifurcation). Reflecting the increasing importance of this subject, several studies have examined both the theoretical and empirical aspects of cooperative behaviors in this setting (see, e.g., Bagnoli and Lipman 1989; Marks and Croson 1998, 1999; Cadsby and Maynes 1999; Rondeau et al. 2005; McBride 2006).Footnote 1
 An effect of threshold uncertainty on cooperative behaviors has been studied in the literature of the PPM (Suleiman 1997; Nitzan and Romano 1990; McBride 2006). Agents are often uncertain about a threshold level of public provision for two main reasons (see, e.g., Wit and Wilke 1998). The first reason is “social uncertainty.” This could be represented by a situation in which it is unknown in advance how many other people in a group will cooperate. Therefore, the source of uncertainty comes from the behaviors of other people in a group. The second reason is “scientific uncertainty.” This is the case, for example, when there is uncertainty about how much cooperative effort will be needed to provide (prevent) a public good (bad). The source of uncertainty is the lack of scientific knowledge. In this paper, scientific uncertainty is our main interest.Footnote 2 Therefore, we consistently use threshold uncertainty to refer to the type of scientific uncertainty, and we manipulate its degree in a series of economic experiments, holding social uncertainty fixed as much as possible. The existence of such threshold uncertainty is theoretically shown to have profound effects on cooperative choices. Bagnoli and Lipman (1989) demonstrate that the PPM without threshold uncertainty has important and efficient properties that can lead to the first best outcome of cooperation. However, once threshold uncertainty is introduced, more complex theoretical results arise such as the possibility of inefficient cooperation in Nash equilibria. For instance, Nitzan and Romano (1990) confirm that an efficient property collapses in the presence of threshold uncertainty. The recent work by McBride (2006) finds that equilibrium cooperation could become higher (lower) under increased threshold uncertainty when the public good’s value is sufficiently high (low). This is because increases in uncertainty raise individual’s probability of being pivotal in providing a public good. Although theoretical works have examined cooperative behaviors under threshold uncertainty, empirical research has been scarce. To the best of our knowledge, Suleiman et al. (2001) is the first empirical study to examine the effect of threshold uncertainty and to demonstrate that cooperation increases in higher threshold means and decreases with the threshold uncertainty. Furthermore, these authors argue that higher threshold means can moderate the adverse effect of threshold uncertainty on cooperation as an interaction effect. Another important empirical work is provided by McBride (2010). His study seeks to test a set of theoretical predictions derived from McBride (2006), that is, equilibrium cooperation could become higher (lower) under increased threshold uncertainty when the public good’s value is sufficiently high (low). The work finds that the experimental results weakly support the theory. Given this empirical evidence, several important questions remain unsolved in the PPM. A first open question is “How does cooperative behavior change with the degree of threshold uncertainty?” Throughout this paper, the degree of threshold uncertainty refers to the variation or the variance of threshold distributions. This is motivated by the fact that resource and environmental problems accompany threshold uncertainty, and its degree depends on scientific uncertainty (see, e.g., Naevdal and Oppenheimer 2007). However, only a few empirical analyses had addressed this question despite its importance in the real world (Suleiman et al. 2001; McBride 2010). For instance, the extent to which the degree of threshold uncertainty should be mitigated through scientific research is becoming highly controversial, as evidenced in the discussion of global warming problems. A series of reports notes that the degree of scientific uncertainty about global warming significantly affects cooperative attitudes of people toward this issue (see, e.g., Oppenheimer 1998; Cookson 2009). A second open question is “How does the difference in the framing affect cooperative behaviors in the presence of threshold uncertainty?” We are interested in this question because a collective decision, such as a decision regarding environmental and resource problems, can be either framed as the prevention of public bads or the provision of public goods. These are referred to as “negative” or “positive” frames, respectively. Although several studies have established the existence of framing effects in a standard voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) (see Andreoni 1995; Willinger and Ziegelmeyer 1999; Park 2000), empirical evidence of framing effects on the PPM has not reached consensus. Sonnemans et al. (1998) is the only previous work that empirically analyzes the existence of framing effects in the PPM, but it does so in the absence of threshold uncertainty. That study shows that a positive frame yields higher cooperation in the PPM. However, Park (2000) notes that their experimental results are confounded by strategic effects and a change in social uncertainty due to their experimental setup, which includes partner designs and a series of subjective questions on other players’ behaviors in a group. Therefore, our study employs a stranger design and does not ask any type of subjective questions in the middle of experiments. A third open question is “Is there any heterogeneous response of cooperative behaviors to uncertainty or to framing depending on the type of person?” Although several studies have identified responses to framing depending on different types of people (Sonnemans et al. 1998; Park 2000), no works have analyzed the heterogeneous response to both framing and uncertainty in a systematic way under PPM. As mentioned earlier, Sonnemans et al. (1998) and Park (2000) identify the responses to framing in the VCM and PPM, respectively, but these studies do not analyze the response to uncertainty by focusing on types of people. In this sense, the answer to this question is unresolved, especially in the PPM, and should provide some policy implications for environmental problems as well as disaster management, especially in terms of changes in cooperation depending on the type of society (or people) as well as the degree of uncertainty (Gifford and Comeau 2011). To answer these questions, we first implement a value orientation test to identify the type of person, such as “individualistic,” and then experimentally analyze how threshold uncertainty affects cooperative behaviors by varying the degree.Footnote 3 Our focus is on the effect of the degree of threshold uncertainty on cooperation rather than the threshold mean levels or the value of public goods. By fixing threshold means as well as the value of public goods (bads) around some level in the experiments, we systematically manipulate threshold uncertainty to focus only on the effect of the degree of threshold uncertainty on cooperative behaviors. In our experimental setup, the cooperation levels predicted by the Nash equilibrium increase and then decrease with the degree of threshold uncertainty (i.e., a single peak or inverted U-shape over the degree), and we seek to confirm whether the experimental results qualitatively follow this theoretical prediction.Footnote 4 Second, we examine an existence of framing effects in the PPM. For these purposes, our experiment controls strategic effects and social uncertainty with random rematching of group members, following Park (2000) and Andreoni (1995). These features distinguish this study from previous studies. We obtain two novel results in this experimental research. First, aggregate framing effects are negligible, although there is an opposite response to the frame depending on the type of social preference in each subject. “Cooperative” subjects cooperate less, whereas “individualistic” subjects cooperate more in a public goods setting than in a public bads setting. This implies that the insignificance of the aggregate framing effect arises from behavioral asymmetry. Second, the percentage of cooperative choices non-monotonically changes as the degree of threshold uncertainty increases, irrespective of framing and the type of value orientation. More specifically, we find that the degree of cooperation is highest at the intermediate level of threshold uncertainty, and it drops sharply as threshold uncertainty becomes sufficiently large. We suggest that the observed changes of cooperative behaviors in response to the degree of threshold uncertainty are qualitatively consistent with, and could be considered to corroborate the predictions derived in McBride (2006).Footnote 5
 The results have several policy implications. Concerning the framing effects, employing a PPM to induce more cooperation may be more effective than the VCM under a negative frame. This is because our results show the insignificance of aggregate framing effects in the PPM. However, this result should be understood with caution. That is, the composition of the population with respect to social preferences may determine whether or not aggregate framing effects are present due to asymmetric responses to the framing. The experimental results also suggest that reducing threshold uncertainty may enhance cooperation, whereas the degree of threshold uncertainty does not need to be reduced to nil. This suggestion gives rise to an optimal strategy of scientific research on threshold uncertainty in a real world problem. That is, scientific research to reduce the uncertainty with respect to the location of the threshold deserves some attention. However, an attempt to pinpoint this location might not make sense if we consider the cost of the research as well as its negligible impact on cooperation. The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental designs and procedures. In Sect. 3, we present the experimental results with some statistical analysis of the hypotheses. The final section offers discussion and concluding remarks.",8

Voluntary consolidation of municipalities has also occurred in Japan, where the number of municipalities dropped dramatically from 3,232 to 1,719 between March 31, 1999 and January 1, 2012. It is stated in the literature that consolidation likely improves administrative and financial efficiencies through economies of scale in the production of local public services. Unfortunately, however, consolidation may increase costs for preference heterogeneity under a framework of Tiebout sorting (e.g., Alesina and Spolaore 2003). Most theoretical studies concerning jurisdictional consolidation have focused on the trade-off between the efficiency of large jurisdictions, such as internalization of externalities and scale economies, and the loss arising from unitary provision of local public goods under consolidation (e.g., Alesina and Spolaore 1997; Bolton and Roland 1997).Footnote 1 More recent studies have developed an explicit model of governmental behavior to overcome the problem of uniform provision under centralization (e.g., Besley and Coate 2003; Lockwood 2002). Besides, Ellingsen (1998) formalized the trade-off between the benefits from internalization of interjurisdictional externalities and the costs to ignore minority preference, showing that regardless of the distribution of taste, small regions are less likely to integrate with large regions, to avoid losing a chance to free ride. Dur and Staal (2008) also used a typical median voter model to show the importance of size effects and transfers from the central government in the choice of integration or separation. These theoretical predictions have been tested by empirical studies. Some empirical works found a positive relationship between heterogeneity of residents’ preferences and number of jurisdictions using U.S. local government data (e.g., Alesina et al. 2004; Nelson 1990).Footnote 2 These empirics have examined fragmentation and annexation of local governments without considering each government’s decision on consolidation. On the other hand, more recent studies have tested the consolidation decisions of individual local governments using a bivariate discrete choice model developed by Poirier (1980), where a binary choice depended on the joint decision of both local governments. Austin (1999) estimated a bivariate logit of economic and political choice using the data for U.S. cities in the 1950s. He showed that cities respond to economic factors other than the additional tax base and that racial, rather than political, effects motivate cities to annex suburbs. Brasington (1999) stated that the consolidation of 298 pairings of school districts in Ohio was more likely between districts of different sizes. Brasington (2003a, b) explored the impact of a greater variety of socioeconomic and demographic factors on the consolidation of school districts, and he concluded that large districts and districts with similar income and race characteristics are more likely to merge. Related to these analyses, Gordon and Knight (2009) developed an econometric model of spatial merger estimation focusing on the features of political integration: two-sided decision making, multiple potential merger partners, and spatial interdependence. They found that state financial incentives and economies of scale play an important role in driving mergers, while heterogeneity of preference is less important for consolidation decisions. These empirical studies employed discrete choice models in which the dependent variable is a dummy that takes 1 for merging jurisdictions and 0 if at least one of two or more jurisdictions chooses separation. In such models, however, it is difficult to know which jurisdictions prefer separation if the dummy takes 0. To avoid the drawbacks associated with this difficulty, a bivariate discrete choice model and a simulation-based estimator derived from a calculation of the probability of a merger in matching games were developed (Austin 1999; Brasington 1999, 2003a, b; Gordon and Knight 2009). Nevertheless, the less informative nature of the binary data on individual preferences continues to make the estimation of local government behavior difficult. For example, Meng and Schmidt (1985) elicit the costs of the partial observability model, such as a bivariate probit, to be high. Thus, this study uses Japanese voting data from local referenda to identify the preferences of specific individual municipalities. The data used herein are the proportions of affirmative voters for consolidation, which are more informative about residents’ preferences for consolidation than bivariate merger variables. The unique voting data on local referenda render this work different from the existing empirical literature. In light of a simulation-based estimation, because consolidation with more than two municipalities is allowed in Japan, an estimation based on a one-sided matching game, such as that proposed by Gordon and Knight (2009), cannot be applied to Japanese cases. In contrast, the referenda data this work employs allow for distinguishing preferences of distinct municipalities and conducting an empirical analysis without using such a sophisticated estimation approach.Footnote 3 Besides, the data could be utilized in an elaborate investigation of the predictions from the theoretical literature. The theory studies a median voter model of consolidation decision in jurisdictions where consolidation requires the consent of a decisive voter in all of the merging jurisdictions. The data set used here includes information on the share of voters in favor of consolidation in each municipality, thus allowing a richer examination of the associations between the strength of preference and factors concerning consolidation decisions, such as scale economies, population size, and taxable income. The findings of this paper could shed light on the role of key features in municipal consolidation decisions. First, municipalities that could enjoy large scale economies in costs through consolidation prefer consolidation. A municipality is likely to consolidate when disparity of per capita costs between the merging and merged municipalities is large, that is, a large financial benefit from consolidation is expected. The estimation result is consistent with the theoretical prediction and the existing empirics (e.g., Alesina et al. 2004; Brasington 1999, 2003a; Gordon and Knight 2009; Sorensen 2006). Second, large and small municipalities (with regard to population) are more likely to consolidate. As predicted by the theory, large municipalities have a tendency to consolidate as they could be the decisive voter in a post-merger municipality, for they could provide public goods according to their preference. On the other hand, the findings concerned with small municipalities would relate to the Japanese government’s policy to promote consolidation of small municipalities and the anticipated financial difficulties they will face due to the advent of declining birthrate and aging population. This result is, however, consistent with that of Brasington (1999) and Ferris and Graddy (1988), who presented evidence that local governments with large and small populations are likely to provide public services jointly with other local governments. Third, municipalities receiving larger unconditional grants are less likely to consolidate. Regarding unconditional grants as lump sum intergovernmental transfers,Footnote 4 the larger unconditional grants a municipality receives, the less likely it is to consolidate, as anticipated from a theoretical analysis.Footnote 5 Fourth, unlike the theoretical prediction, tax base effects, heterogeneity of preferences, and other financial factors are not associated with the voting behavior of residents. However, the result on heterogeneity of preference is partly consistent with some recent empirical works that mention that scale economies and tax base effects affect consolidation decisions more strongly than heterogeneity (Brasington 2003b; Gordon and Knight 2009). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents background information regarding the Japanese local government system and boundary reform. Section 3 develops the theoretical model. Sections 4 and 5 discuss the empirical model and data, respectively. The main results are outlined in Sects. 6, and 7 presents the conclusions.",22
16.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,24 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-014-0149-2,Public education and social security: a political economy approach,February 2015,Tetsuo Ono,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With increasing life expectancy, many developed countries have experienced a shift towards a progressively older population over the past several decades. This demographic change has induced an increase in the political power of the elderly, and social security expenditure for them is expected to increase (Casey et al. 2003). This may imply a reduction in spending on the young (e.g., public education) because of government budgetary constraints (Poterba 1997, 1998; Fernandez and Rogerson 2001; Harris et al. 2001). Such predictions are not always possible when altruistic concern for one’s offspring is considered (Cattaneo and Wolter 2009). Greater longevity means that parents can enjoy the human capital of their children longer in later life, making public and private investment in education more attractive for the working population. In addition, the effects of the increased political power of the elderly on social security expenditure is not straightforward. A greater social security burden on the working population discourages them from investing in education, which may result in a smaller tax base and a lower level of social security benefits in the long run. Furthermore, all these effects interact with each other. The following question arises: how does a conflict of interest between generations affect political decision-making on social security and public education (and hence, human capital accumulation) in the long run? This study aims to answer this question from a political economy viewpoint. For analysis, this paper presents an overlapping-generations model with uncertain lifetimes and altruism towards children. In each generation, there are identical individuals who live for at most three periods: young, middle, and old. An individual produces one offspring during the middle period and dies at the end of the middle period with some probability. A middle-age individual is endowed with a stock of human capital that also defines his/her labor capacity. He/she sets the allocation of disposable income between his/her personal consumption and investment in furthering the child’s education. An individual who lives throughout old age can receive and consume social security benefits. The level of an offspring’s human capital is determined by public education and the parents’ human capital and private investment. Social security and public education are financed using taxation on the middle. Within this framework, we consider a probabilistic voting (à la Lindbeck and Weibull 1987) in which in each period, the middle and the old participate in voting. Here, the government in power maximizes a political objective function of the weighted sum of the utilities of the middle and the old (see, e.g., Grossman and Helpman 1998; Hassler et al. 2005; Song et al. 2012 for applications for the overlapping generations models). In particular, this paper restricts its attention to Markov-perfect equilibria, where voters condition their strategies on payoff-relevant state variables (i.e., human capital in the present model). This concept of equilibrium captures the forward-looking behavior of the middle, who expect the benefit of social security when they reach old age. The present model demonstrates two types of political equilibria: the presence of private investment in education and the absence of public education, and vice versa. In both equilibria, social security is provided to old individuals. It is shown that the former equilibrium is realized if the efficiency of public education is relatively low compared to that of private education; otherwise, the latter equilibrium is observed. Voters’ preferences are affected by longevity. In particular, longevity has effects on the political determination of social security through the following three factors: (i) the weight on the utility of old-age social security that benefits the old; (ii) the tax burden of the middle to finance the current old-age social security payments; and (iii) the sum of the weights on the utilities of the offspring’s human capital and old-age social security that are expected to benefit the current middle in their old age. The first factor works to increase old-age social security, whereas the second factor works to reduce it. The effect created by the first factor is offset by that created by the second factor. Therefore, there remains an effect created by the third factor, which includes the forward-looking behavior of agents. The third factor implies a negative effect of longevity on old-age social security. This somewhat counterintuitive result arises as follows. Greater longevity implies a larger weight on the utility of old-age social security that the middle receive in their old age. To maintain a certain level of future social security, the middle must sustain the human-capital level of their offspring and thus invest privately and/or publicly in education. Then, the middle have an incentive to reduce the tax burden for old-age social security payments today and instead increase private and/or public investment in education. Therefore, greater longevity results in a lower level of old-age social security. Longevity also affects public education, but its effect is non-monotone. In a political equilibrium with public education, greater longevity results in a higher level of public education spending. However, a further increase in longevity induces voters to prefer old-age social security to public education and thus to leave educational investment to the private sector. In other words, a further increase in longevity puts the economy into a state with no public education. Overall, greater longevity produces a non-monotone effect on public education spending. This non-monotone effect is peculiar to the present model that includes two alternatives for educational investments. This study employs a Markov-perfect equilibrium to demonstrate the forward-looking behavior of voters. In order to examine the role of this equilibrium concept, we investigate an alternative concept of equilibrium, that is, myopic voting, which is often employed in the literature (see, e.g., Holtz-Eakin et al. 2004; Tosun 2008; Gradstein and Kaganovich 2004; Boldrin 2005). In this voting scheme, voters take future policy as given. Under this alternative concept, we find that the model fails to demonstrate a political equilibrium with the presence of public education. In other words, the model shows only a political equilibrium with the absence of public education, which is empirically an implausible scenario. The result suggests that the Markov-perfect equilibrium is key to demonstrating the two types of political equilibria with empirically relevant properties. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first present a literature review. Thereafter, Sect. 2 presents the model. Section 3 demonstrates individual decision-making on education and then characterizes an economic equilibrium. Section 4 demonstrates a period-\(t\) political equilibrium. Section 5 investigates how longevity affects education and social security policies. Section 6 shows the existence and stability of a steady-state political equilibrium. Section 7 undertakes the analysis using an alternative assumption of myopic voting. Section 8 concludes. The present work can be seen as integrating two bodies of literature. The first is concerned with public education as a means of redistribution and its possible effects on human capital accumulation in political economy models of public education. These models, however, do not include private educational investment as a choice for individuals (Glomm and Ravikumar 1995, 2001; Glomm 2004; Gradstein and Kaganovich 2004; Boldrin 2005; Palivos and Varvarigos 2013). Several studies overcome this issue by comparing an economy with public education to one with private education (Glomm and Ravikumar 1992; Saint-Paul and Verdier 1993; Gradstein and Justman 1997; de la Croix and Doepke 2004) or by considering parents’ choice of public and/or private education to maximize their altruistic utility (Stiglitz 1974; Epple and Romano 1996; Gradstein and Justman 1996; Hoyt and Lee 1998; Glomm and Ravikumar 1998; Cardak 2004; Bearse et al. 2005; de la Croix and Doepke 2009; Kunze 2014). Most of these studies capture public education as public expenditure on children financed by taxation on adults. In other words, they focus on a forward intergenerational transfer from parents to their children. However, in the real world, there is another intergenerational transfer that works in the opposite direction: income transfer from the young to the elderly, such as social security. The present study focuses on this alternative public spending and investigates how an intergenerational conflict over these two policy issues affects human capital accumulation and the allocation of government spending on public education and social security through individual decision-making regarding education. In particular, the paper sheds light on the role of longevity on political decision-making. The second body of literature focuses on two-issue voting in the presence of intergenerational conflict, such as two types of income redistribution. Examples include redistribution within a generation and between different generations (Conde-Ruiz and Galasso 2005; Bassetto 2008; Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt 2008); public goods provision and social security (Creedy and Moslehi 2009; Creedy et al. 2011); public capital and social security (Konrad 1995; Bellettini and Berti Ceroni 1999); and medicare services and social security (Bethencourt and Galasso 2008). In particular, the present paper is concerned with works on public education that benefits the young and social security that benefits the elderly (Bearse et al. 2001; Soares 2006; Iturbe-Ormaetxe and Valera 2012; Kaganovich and Meier 2012; Kaganovich and Zilcha 2012; Naito 2012). However, these studies assume either a vote over public education for a given social security benefit or over the allocation of tax revenue for a given tax rate. In other words, the two-dimensional voting aspect is reduced to one dimension. Therefore, these studies do not indicate how the size of the government (i.e., the tax rate) and the allocation of government spending between different generations are jointly determined through voting in the presence of an intergenerational conflict. The present study, therefore, attempts to integrate both literatures in an analytical framework. Some recent works that share these concerns are Kemnitz (2000), Rangel (2003), Levy (2005), Poutvaara (2006), Bernasconi and Profeta (2012), Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt (2012) and Lancia and Russo (2013). However, these differ from the present study in that (1) there is no private education as an alternative choice (Kemnitz 2000; Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt 2012; Lancia and Russo 2013) or no human capital accumulation (Rangel 2003; Levy 2005), (2) there is a focus on the intragenerational conflict rather than the intergenerational one (Bernasconi and Profeta 2012), and (3) there is no analysis on the effect of increasing longevity on the allocation of government spending (Poutvaara 2006). By contrast, this paper demonstrates how an intergenerational conflict over two policy issues (i.e., public education and social security) affects human capital accumulation and the allocation of government spending in the presence of private education as an alternative to public education. The paper then shows that private education as an alternative to public education and forward-looking behavior of voters are key to demonstrating the two types of political equilibria.",5

An empirical note on populism and economic institutions,February 2015,Martin Rode,Julio Revuelta,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The (re-) appearance of populism over the past two decades has fuelled extensive debates about this phenomenon by both, the media and the academic world. This is especially obvious in Europe and Latin America, where new political actors have divided constituents over the admissible degree of populist rhetoric in policy making. Still, it is not clear what someone really means, when he labels a politician as populist. The term has been applied to such a broad spectrum of actors that we can find politicians as different as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former president of Iran, Silvio Berlusconi, former prime minister of Italy, Hugo Chávez, late president of Venezuela, or George W. Bush, former president of the United States, among them. It is not clear what similarities exist among these ideologically very different chief executives that would justify a joint categorization as populists. Obviously, the concept lacks clarity and difficulties in defining it have led some observers to dismiss populism as a valuable approach altogether. As a consequence, few scholars have tried to express populism in quantitative terms, which has complicated any empirical investigation on its outcomes. On the other hand, populist executives clearly have important implications for national policies and institutions, as the examples of Venezuela and Italy show. Both countries have recently experienced episodes of political populism, during which their institutional structures were altered considerably. To what degree these examples can be generalized, is an open question though. For this same reason, researchers such as Hawkins (2009) or Rooduijn and Pauwels (2011) agree that the most interesting and relevant questions on populism are empirical in nature. A case in point is the analysis of populist economic policy, where authors such as Sachs (1989), Dornbusch and Edwards (1991) or Bittencourt (2012) find that different populist governments with a center-left ideology have followed strikingly similar policy cycles throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. These tend to be overly expansive in monetary and fiscal terms, leading to a balance of payment crisis, falling real wages, capital flight, and inflation. All these studies put redistributive objectives at the heart of their populism definition though, and others have therefore criticized that findings cannot be attributed to populist governments in general, as any economic consequences of right wing populists are completely neglected (cf. Weyland 2001). Similarly, Mudde (2007) and De la Torre (2007) highlight that all populist movements, be they right or left wing, European or Latin American, strongly emphasize the defense of “the peoples’ interest” against those of a privileged elite. If policies are implemented that are in accordance with this type of rhetoric, the economic consequences of any populist government are potentially severe, disregarding their ideology. A similar issue arises, if we consider the time periods covered by studies on economic populism: Sachs (1989) and Dornbusch and Edwards (1991) analyze populist regimes from the 1970s and 1980s. Do their conclusions still apply to more recent populist leaders, such as Hugo Chávez, who had to take into account a much more globalized economy? The recent contributions by Bittencourt (2012) and Edwards (2010) suggest that Latin American neo-populist executives present similarly dismal records than their predecessors, with the important difference that, so far, none has driven his respective country into a total economic collapse. Still, this might happen in the future, and it is important to study this issue empirically. To put it in a simple way, there currently exists a gap in the scientific analysis of populism, which is due to the absence of a clear definition and reliable indicators, but contrasts with an identifiable need to empirically investigate its economic consequences. Our study addresses this important vacuum in the literature. Using panel data estimation, we outline the effect of populist governments on countries’ economic institutions and policies with a measure compiled by Hawkins (2009). This populism index builds on a discursive definition of the concept, which identifies populism as something that is grounded in communication. The Economic Freedom of the World index (Gwartney et al. 2014) is used to measure changes in economic institutions and policies. Results indicate that all populist governments actively reduce economic freedom. At the economic policy level, they tend to erode legal security, reduce freedom to trade, and tighten economic regulation. Interestingly, left wing populists only seem to be marginally more inclined to increase the size of government, while the overall economic policy approach seems to be quite similar. This raises the important question of why some definitions of populism are so centered on ideology, even though ideological orientation doesn’t seem to matter a great deal for policy outcomes. In addition, we find that the popular majority received in the last elections has no clear effect on populist policy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses earlier work on the economic consequences of populism and revises different definitions, focusing especially on the concept that forms the basis for the populism index. Section 3 describes the data and methodology for estimation. Section 4 presents the results and discusses them, while Sect. 5 concludes.",52

Contrary to earlier Statistics Finland estimates, where the size of the shadow economy was estimated at about 1.5 % of GDP (see Nurminen 2010), the parliamentary investigation found it to be much higher, some 6.9 % of GDP (12.7 billion euro).Footnote 1 In 2011, the government declared the anti grey economy policies to be as its priority and gave a substantial amount of resources to implement these polices. On the other hand, the new government’s plan for closing the deficit was partly based on anticipated additional revenues from the grey economy (250 m annually).Footnote 2
 Even though the 6.9 % figure is far from the lofty estimates of 15–25 % based on the “money method” (Schneider 2000, 2005), it is still economically important.Footnote 3 By eliminating the shadow economy, most European economies could eliminate their current deficits without tax increases or expenditure cuts. Not surprisingly, many politicians have adopted the shadow economy agenda as their main political program. Instead of promising “blood, sweat and tears” they are able to propose an easy way out of the current fiscal distress. If the above-mentioned € 12.7 bn is the true figure, one could obtain € 5 bn of additional tax revenues in Finland and by and large eliminate the current deficit. Although there surely are elements of shadow economy in Finland it would be useful to consider the economics of this “easy way out”. Can the shadow economy be eliminated and additional tax revenues collected by administrative actions (without adjusting tax rates and/or changing the general tax morality or other determinants of the shadow economy)? This question appears relevant as we think how complicated issue tax compliance is (see e.g. Andreoni et al. 1998; Kleven 2014) This study attempts to provide some Finnish evidence on the efficacy of tax inspections and the judicial system for generating additional revenues for the state. Although we are not able to provide solid econometric evidence, we may be able to get some idea of the sensitivity of government revenues with respect to administrative actions along the lines of e.g. Alm et al. (1996). In the subsequent discussion, we use the term “shadow economy” without attempting to give a precise meaning of it.Footnote 4 We note that the above-mentioned parliamentary report does not provide a precise definition of the concept either, but it generally interprets the shadow economy as shadow wages (wages not been reported to the tax authority). From the national accounts perspective this is not completely satisfactory because income taxes and employers’ social security payments represent only a part of total taxes, and unreported wages may simply be disguised as dividend income, which is taxable but at a lower rate. The point is that unreported wages may not mean totally lost tax revenues but rather only partial loss of tax revenue. Of course, the story does not end here. Unreported wages are, of course, used in consumption and to pay consumption taxes, not to mention other taxes and seigniorage. From the fiscal point of view, it is not so important what is the exact nature of the shadow economy (is it underground economy, criminal economy, informal economy or statistical underground) but from the preventive policy point of view, it makes a big difference. Policies for, say, drug dealing, and tax evasion are obviously quite different (see OECD 2002 for more comprehensive treatment of this issue). Measurement is not the only problem in considering the policy implications of shadow economy studies. The implications depend crucially on the way in which the shadow economy is operating in the economy. In other words, we face the question of how to model the shadow economy. Do we assume a fully competitive economy or do we postulate some frictions (cf. Ingram et al. 1997; Amaral and Quintin 2006)? How much attention is paid to issues like corruption and crime? Perhaps too much attention is paid to the measurement of the size of the shadow economy and hence, from the point of view of policy tools, we are not able to provide much guidance. How should the shadow economy be eliminated and what would be the consequences of elimination. None of the studies that deal with the size of the shadow economy considers the consequences of complete elimination of shadow economy activities. For example, if company x is found not to pay taxes and other employer expenses properly, it does not automatically mean that in response to the tax authority or court sanctions it will start paying the full expenses. Rather, the outcome may be the opposite. There is at least casual evidence that shadow economy firms have very low profit rates, so that if they had to pay the full amount of expenses they would in many cases simply exit from the market. If not, they would probably try to increase prices and lower wages so as to survive. Obviously, the firms (or activities) could also move abroad, make use of transfer pricing or demand various subsidies as a prerequisite for continuation of activities. As shown in Fig. 1, there are always many firms that just survive. Thus, e.g. before the financial crisis in 2006, almost 10 per cent of small firms (5 % of all firms) reported negative profits. The situation varies across industries. In restaurants and cafes, which are often characterized as grey economy firms, the operating margin was only 5.3 % in 2011. Similarly, in housing construction it was only 5.7 %, while in manufacturing the margin was 7.8 %. Even small changes in costs would push a considerable portion of firms ultimately onto the road to bankruptcy. Thus, the final outcome can be quite complex, and one would need a general equilibrium analysis that takes into account all the consequences of anti-shadow-economy actions to arrive at a more comprehensive estimate of the results of anti-shadow economy policies. Distribution of firms by the profit share. The percentage number indicates the share of firms with negative profits. The data are for 2006 Here we only refer to an OECD labor market study (OECD 2006) that evaluates the consequences of changes in wage wedges (and other determinants of the state of the labor market). The study finds very high employment elasticities of tax wedges: 0.3 for prime-age men and 0.5 for prime-age women. Given these values and that the total tax wedge in Finland is around 70 %, introducing a tax wedge for “grey” firms (increasing the wedge from 0 to 70 %) would lower employment by almost 30 %. Although the true number may well be different, the magnitude of the employment effect would probably be of a similar size. Hence, a simple back-of-envelope calculation of tax returns from shadow economy could be misleading. Before our own analysis, we will scrutinize the estimation methods of the parliamentary study of the shadow economy as regards the trustworthiness of the estimates and why they deviate so much from earlier Statistics Finland estimates (Sect. 2). The main analysis in Sect. 3 focuses on the relationship between the frequency of tax audits and the resulting findings and corrections in firm’s taxes and social security payments. Finally, some brief concluding remarks will follow (Sect. 4).",1

The classical economic position was dominated by the model proposed by Allingham and Sandmo (1972). They framed the decision to evade taxes as an individual decision under uncertainty, determined by the factors income level, tax rate, probability of detection, and penalty rate (Allingham and Sandmo 1972). Based on von Neumann and Morgenstern’s axioms for behavior under uncertainty (1947), and building on the economic theory of criminal activity (Becker 1968), the rationale is that taxpayers predominantly seek to maximize their own expected utility and thus evade if they can expect to get away with it. However, taking into account the rather low probability that a taxpayer may be audited in almost any country as well as the relatively low level of fines for evasion, the assumption that solely the level of deterrence determines whether citizens evade taxes must be seriously doubted. An overview of the inconsistent empirical findings in the literature with regard to the traditional economic factors income, tax rate, audit probability, and severity of fines is reported in Kirchler et al. (2010). As a consequence, alternative factors like the perceived fairness of the tax system and social norms were identified as relevant influences concerning the tax honesty of citizens. The relevance of fairness issues regarding tax behavior was already recognized by Schmölders (1960), who postulated that unfair treatment in comparison to others or with respect to the benefits from public goods might be an important determinant of tax morale. Justice considerations are not relevant in the classical economic approach of deterrence. Nevertheless, different aspects of fairness and justice were found to be related to tax compliance, showing that perceived fairness with regard to governmental institutions and the tax system has a significant influence on tax morale (e.g., Calderwood and Webley 1992; Fjeldstad 2004; Tyler 2006; Wartick 1994). Social norms relate to the acceptance of tax evasion among a relevant reference group, and a number of studies confirmed that perceived tax evasion among friends and colleagues is correlated with hypothetical as well as self-reported tax evasion (e.g., Bergmann and Nevarez 2005; Cullis and Lewis 1997; Webley et al. 2001). However, as in the case of the traditional economic factors, findings concerning rather psychological determinants of compliance have to be considered as more or less inconclusive as well (for a review see Kirchler 2007). The “slippery slope framework” of tax compliance (Kirchler et al. 2008) offers a possibility to integrate the puzzling effects of economic and psychological factors and is widely cited in recent publications on tax behavior (e.g., Alm and McClennan 2012; Bazart and Pickhardt 2011; Durham et al. 2014). In this framework different motivations for paying taxes are differentiated: enforced and voluntary compliance. It is assumed that mainly traditional economic factors such as audit probability and fines determine perceived power of authorities to enforce compliance, whereas psychologically relevant factors such as the perception of a fair tax system and social norms affect trust in authorities resulting in voluntary cooperation. Thus, the “slippery slope framework” introduces two major dimensions which both influence the level of tax compliance: trust in authorities and power of authorities. Tax honesty can be achieved either by taking measures that increase trust or by measures to enhance power, but the resulting compliance differs in quality. The basic assumptions of the “slippery slope framework” were also formalized in an economic model (Prinz et al. 2014) and were supported by empirical research in recent years (e.g., Kogler et al. 2013; Lisi 2012; Muehlbacher et al. 2011). In the present study, the main assumptions of the “slippery slope framework”, as well as the influence of underlying variables like fairness perceptions, social norms, and deterrence are investigated applying a questionnaire within a sample of exclusively self-employed taxpayers in Austria. Since self-employed have considerably more chances to evade taxes than employees and evidentially use these opportunities (e.g., Kleven et al. 2011; Slemrod 2007), a validation of the influence of trust and power on intentions to comply within this respective group is of special importance. In a first step, by applying regression analyses, we show that (i) trust in authorities serves as a significant predictor of the motivation to comply voluntarily, (ii) perceived power of authorities serves as a significant predictor of enforced compliance, and (iii) both trust and power are significant predictors of compliance in general, regardless of its underlying motivation. Furthermore, we expect perceived fairness to fuel trust, and trust to mediate the effect of fairness on voluntary compliance. In accordance to established classifications in social psychology (e.g., Adams 1965; Thibault and Walker 1978; Tyler 1990) three types of fairness will be considered in our study: (i) procedural justice, (ii) distributive justice, and (iii) retributive justice. Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the process of resource distribution and other tax related decisions made by authorities. Essential components of procedural justice are neutrality of the procedures, trustworthiness of the tax authorities and respectful treatment (Tyler and Lind 1992; Murphy 2003). Actually, there is empirical evidence that high trust in authorities might serve as a boundary condition to the effectiveness of procedural fairness as an instrument to increase tax compliance (Van Dijke and Verboon 2010; Wahl et al. 2010a, b). Distributive justice concerns the exchange of resources with regard to benefits and costs of the tax system. Relevant comparisons are made on the individual, the group, and the societal level. If the tax burden is perceived to be heavier than that of comparable others, compliance is likely to decrease (Spicer and Lundstedt 1976; Juan et al. 1994). As procedural fairness, also distributive justice is assumed to affect perceived trustworthiness of tax authorities and should therefore entail a higher degree of voluntary compliance (Kirchler et al. 2008). Finally, retributive justice refers to the appropriateness of sanctions in case of an offence. Unreasonable, intrusive audits and unfair penalties are said to evoke negative attitudes towards taxes and the responsible authorities (Strümpel 1969; Wenzel and Thielmann 2006). In this vein, perceptions of lacking retributive justice will decrease trust in authorities and as a consequence affect voluntary cooperation. However, since perceptions of retributive justice also depend on detection and punishment of tax evaders, retributive justice is likely to be related to the power dimension of the “slippery slope framework”, too (Kirchler et al. 2008). Besides fairness, social norms are assumed to fuel trust and the effect of norms on voluntary compliance should be mediated by trust and power. Possible mediation effects concerning social norms will be investigated. With regard to the “slippery slope framework”, norms are related to both, trust and power. Social norms may de- or increase trust, and, in addition they affect tax laws and the role given to authorities, which influences their power (Kirchler et al. 2008). Referring to Wenzel (2004) the relationship between social norms and tax compliance is complex. Taxpayers are assumed to internalize the social norms and act according to their respective reference group (e.g., the group of self-employed) only if they strongly identify with this group. At last, we investigate potential mediation effects of perceived power in whether tax authorities’ deterrence strategies are effective. Deterrence corresponds to the instrumental goal of prevention of future crimes by exertion of negative sanctions. In the “slippery slope framework”, it is argued that the interpretation of fines and the target group to which fines are specifically directed matters (Kirchler et al. 2008). In an antagonistic climate, fines can be part of a “cops and robbers” game, in a synergistic climate they may be perceived as an adequate retribution for behavior that harms the community. Thus, deterrence might be connected to trust and to power. Fines that are perceived as too low could serve as an indicator that the authorities are weak and therefore undermine trust. Inappropriate high fines in case of misinterpretation of ambiguous tax laws may erode the perception of retributive justice, provoking taxpayers to try and compensate their losses by evading again.",59

The bulk of this difference (approximately 2/3) is attributable to individual taxpayer non-compliance, some of which originates from understated income hidden in “innovative” tax shelters comprising complex transactions among multiple business entities (GAO 2012; IRS 2006). Partnerships and other so-called “pass-through” entities are known to play a disproportionate role in these structures due to the relative flexibility of the tax rules governing transactions to which they are a party; in fact, the GAO estimates that at least $91 billion of the gap associated with individual non-compliance comes from this sector alone (GAO 2014). Tax shelters are marketed to high net worth individuals by promoters. Promoters include banks, accounting firms, investment boutiques, and law firms that scour the tax code looking for exploitable loopholes. They then arrange and execute a sequence of transactions designed to reduce their client’s tax liability. On the surface these transactions satisfy all relevant tax laws; on occasion, however, it becomes apparent that the transactions in question can have had no other purpose than the reduction of tax liability. SchemesFootnote 1 of this type have long been disallowed under a common law doctrine requiring that the associated transactions have “economic substance” (Robertson et al. 2010). They are now explicitly illegal under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (IRS 2011). These schemes come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Here we focus on an important subclass that rely on a mechanism called “inflated basis”. “Basis” is the set point from which gains or losses are assessed for tax purposes; usually the basis of an asset is just the cost of acquiring it. There are, however, a complex set of rules governing how basis is computed or otherwise adjusted in the course of different transactions. By arranging for a sequence of these transactions among a commonly owned network of entities it is sometimes possible to enhance the basis of certain assets and thereby create artificial losses when these assets are ultimately sold. Such losses can then be used to offset gains elsewhere in a portfolio, thus reducing overall tax liability. The sheer complexity of a typical tax shelter poses significant challenges to government enforcement efforts. Audits have traditionally been directed at single financial entities, whereas the most advanced schemes are conducted within vast networks of these entities. Teasing out the detailed transaction flow associated with a particular scheme can therefore be prohibitively expensive or difficult, especially when that scheme is a new or previously unknown variant. The growing number and prevalence of pass-through entities such as partnerships has made this problem increasingly urgent (GAO 2010). An algorithm like the one we are proposing here would go a long way towards mitigating this problem by providing auditors with exemplars of potentially suspicious patterns of activity.",14

Company insiders often have access to more information than the public at large. It is thought that such asymmetry of information can give the insiders an unfair advantage. In an attempt to make the playing field fair, the government issues rules that guide how the insiders can transact in company securities and monitors that the rules are followed. This regulation and its enforcement are of interest to both academics and policy makers and are often headline news in business media.Footnote 1 Like with any government activity, there are arguments for and against regulating insider transactions. We contribute to this debate by considering how insider regulation can affect the incentives to invest as an insider. For example, early investors such as venture capitalists and angel-investors specialize in funding startups and get access to non-public, inside information.Footnote 2 It is also possible that later they will transact in company securities. Regulation that affects the costs and benefits of becoming an insider can also affect these investors’ ex-ante investment incentives. It is policy relevant to understand how regulation can affect these incentives considering the importance of early investors for new firms. There are only a few papers that address how regulation can affect the ex-ante incentives of the insiders. Manne (1966b) argues that allowing the insiders to trade freely and benefit from inside information is a form of compensation that will induce them to innovate. If so, then regulation would be bad for the insiders’ ex-ante incentives. Ausubel (1990), in contrast, argues that regulation will increase market confidence and induce outside investors to invest more. In turn, this investment will benefit the insiders due to, for example, availability of more capital. Then, the insiders’ ex-ante investment will increase as well. In Medrano and Vives (2004) regulation can increase the ex-ante investment when information acquisition by insiders is costly, otherwise laissez-faire is better. In all these papers, the comparison is between a perfectly effective regulation and no regulation.Footnote 3 We, in contrast, consider an “effectiveness” range of regulation and show that, ex-ante, the investor may prefer tougher regulation to weaker regulation of his future insider activity. Our regulator uses two tools: monitoring and penalties. Monitoring can be imperfect, i.e. the insider has a positive probability of escaping the regulatory radar after selling on non-public information. We obtain that when regulation is tough (the regulator is unconstrained in choosing large enough parameters), there can be a positive effect of regulation on ex-ante incentives to invest as an insider. However, weaker regulation can be worse than no regulation if it does not change insider behavior or simply reduces the probability with which the insider “misbehaves”. In such cases, there can be a reduced ex-ante incentive to invest as an insider. The potentially opposite effects of tough and weak regulations can be of policy relevance. It is possible that tough regulation is not feasible due to resource or legislative constraints, or due to weak institutional environment. Implementing weaker regulations, instead, is not necessarily the next best choice. No regulation may be better. There are also other arguments for or against insider regulation.Footnote 4 A large number of papers consider the potential impact of regulation on information and market efficiency. Manne (1966a) and Carlton and Fischel (1982) argue that unregulated trading by insiders allows more rapid reflection of information in stock prices which increases market efficiency. Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Benabou and Laroque (1992), Khanna et al. (1994), in contrast, argue that regulation can have the opposite impact. As they show, unregulated insider trading can reduce market efficiency by deterring other traders from acquiring information, insiders may have reduced incentives to release information which can make stock prices less informative, or the competition between informed insiders and informed outsiders can reduce the quality of the latter’s information. While Leland (1992) agrees that unregulated trading can make information revelation faster, he also shows that the outside investors’ expected return and risk will decrease. In Bernhardt et al. (1995), the effect of regulation depends on whether investment is information elastic or inelastic. In the later case, information has little predictive power about future payoffs and insider trading regulation is preferable. More recently, Huddart et al. (2001) show that ex-post disclosure of insider trades can induce a strategy by the insiders that accelerates price discovery and lowers trading costs. Information is also important in the property rights approach to insider regulation (Bainbridge 2000). This approach argues that property rights over information should be assigned to the corporation rather than the insiders. The role of regulation is to enforce these rights which will increase the corporation’s incentive to produce valuable information. Another group of papers considers the effect of regulation on the agency problem inside the firm. In Fischer (1992), unrestricted insider trading can aggravate the existing agency problems since the insiders’ unobservable strategy space will expand and require costly alterations of contracts for shareholders. Bebchuk and Fershtman (1994) argue that regulation that bans insider trading can reduce the managers’ incentive to undertake riskier projects which otherwise would be optimal for the shareholders. Maug (2002) shows that regulation can benefit small shareholders by preventing collusion between the dominant shareholder and the managers. While most papers explain regulation by public interest, there are also arguments that regulation represents and serves special interests and is a result of lobbying. Haddock and Macey (1987) argue that powerful market professionals lobbied for and benefited from insider regulation by eliminating competition from better informed insiders. Mahoney (2001) also argues that regulation reduced competition by creating entry barriers and benefiting investment banks. There are also empirical studies that look at the effect of insider regulation. In an earlier work, Jaffe (1974) did not find any effect on the insider trades following the enactment of changes to insider regulations. In a more recent cross-country study, Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) find that the enforcement of insider trading laws reduces the cost of equity. In another cross-country study, Beny (2005) found that in countries with more prohibitive insider regulations, ownership is more diffused, stock prices are more accurate and stock markets are more liquid. Self-regulation can be an alternative to government regulation. However, Petraccia (2011) found that self-imposed restrictions by firms on insider transactions are not always followed. Similar to the papers mentioned earlier, we start with a benchmark model of no regulation. Then regulation is introduced to see how the insider’s ex-ante incentives can change compared to no regulation. At date 0 (ex-ante) the investor decides whether to invest in a project or not. At date 1 (ex-post), after the investment is made, he becomes an insider and learns whether the outcome will be good or bad. At date 1 he also learns about the availability of an alternative, more attractive project. To make this investment, he has to sell his stake in the initial project to uninformed buyers/investors who do not have access to the alternative project and do not observe it.Footnote 5 Thus, there is an ex-post informational asymmetry—the insider knows about the prospects of the initial project and the existence of the alternative one but the uninformed buyers do not have such information. Ex-ante, however, everyone has the same beliefs about the possible future events. The insider’s ex-post informational advantage can tempt him to get rid of the bad asset before the market learns the bad news. It will be difficult for the buyers to distinguish such sales from sales motivated by more legitimate reasons such as the pursuit of a new investment opportunity or diversification. Such uncertainty about insider motives can exist, for example, during Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Insiders may sell for legitimate reasons. But there are also the so-called exit strategy IPOs where the IPO is the final phase in the company’s life rather than a transitory phase.Footnote 6 These IPOs can allow the initial investors to get paid for valueless or low quality assets. The outsiders can learn about insider intentions to sell from the firm’s IPO prospectus. According to SEC regulation S-K item 403, this prospectus must disclose all selling shareholders. For example, during Facebook’s IPO it was known in advance that 58 % of shares were coming from insiders.Footnote 7 This was an unusually high insider cash out. For comparison, during Google’s IPO only 28 % came from insiders. In contrast to Google, Facebook’s post IPO share price performance was disappointing and there were accusations of insider trading.Footnote 8
 Uninformed but rational buyers will know about insider incentives to sell on bad news and will price accordingly when the insider sells his stake. Then, the stake will be undervalued when the insider sells for personal and unobservable reasons only. This would be the cost of insider status. However, if the news is bad and the insider sells, his stake will be overvalued. This would be the benefit of insider status. Ex-ante, the rational investor will take into account the expectation of these costs and benefits when deciding to invest as an insider. We introduce a regulator who, with a positive probability, can “catch” and penalize the insider if the sale is based on non-public information and the insider benefits from it. Such regulation reduces the expected benefit of insider status. But the cost can decrease as well. When the regulatory parameters are unconstrained, a high enough probability of being caught or the prospect of a severe punishment can completely eliminate the insider’s incentive to sell and benefit from non-public information. The uninformed buyers will correctly anticipate this. Then, when the insider sells for personal reasons, the stake will not be undervalued. The cost of insider status will decrease. An unconstrained regulator can always set the parameters high enough so that the ex-post undesirable behavior of selling on non-public bad news is eliminated. At the same time, the ex-ante expected cost savings will more than offset the lost benefit. The ex-ante incentive to invest as an insider will increase. Tough regulation acts as a credible commitment mechanism that ensures that the insider will not be tempted to exploit his informational advantage. However, if weaker or less effective regulation is implemented, the impact may be the opposite. We consider a case when regulation is completely ineffective in changing the ex-post insider behavior compared to the unregulated case. It turns out that such regulation, besides its administrative costs, can hurt the ex-ante incentive to invest as an insider. A way to see this is to think of a corrupt regulator. If the insider is caught selling on non-public bad news, he expects that the penalty can be avoided by bribing the regulator. This effectively reduces the severity of penalty to the extent that the insider can find it optimal to sell on the bad news and take advantage of the buyers. The buyers will anticipate this and price the insider’s stake the same way as in the unregulated case. Then the expected cost of insider status will be the same as in the unregulated case. The expected benefit, on the other hand, will decrease due to the expected bribe. An unchanged expected cost and a decreased expected benefit will decrease the ex-ante incentive to invest as an insider. Even though the ex-post behavior remains exactly the same as in the unregulated case, the ex-ante behavior can change. Thus, weak or ineffective regulation can be worse than no regulation at all. This result is similar to Bhattacharya and Daouk (2009) who argue that sometimes no regulation at all is better than regulation that is not enforced. In their model, if regulation is passed but is not enforced, some agents still follow it while others don’t. The interaction becomes similar to a Prisoners’ Dilemma where some play Cooperate and others play Defect. As a result, the cooperators are worse off than when there is no regulation and everyone plays Defect. In our model, the agents do not have pre-determined strategies. The strategy choice is based on cost-benefit calculations. We also consider an intermediate case. The regulatory parameters are such that the probability of insider selling is reduced but not eliminated. The market price of the insider’s stake goes up, which reduces the ex-ante expected cost of becoming an insider. The ex-ante benefit, however, falls. It becomes possible that regulation can reduce the occurrence of the undesirable behavior, but there may be a negative side effect of reduced ex-ante incentive to invest as an insider. The following sections provide a more detailed explanation of the model and the results. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 2.1 considers the perfect information case and Sect. 2.2 looks at the unregulated and asymmetric information case. Then, the two cases are compared. Section 3 introduces the regulator and looks at perfectly effective, completely ineffective and partially effective regulation. Each case is compared with the unregulated case. Section 4 checks the sensitivity of results by allowing a partial sale of the insider’s stake. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are in the Appendices.",

The rationale this paper offers is intuitive. Criminals differ in ability, and neither the courts nor criminals themselves can perfectly determine ability ex-ante. Courts also cannot directly observe the total number of past crimes a criminal has committed. Thus, it is possible that the first time a criminal appears before a court, it is the result of his first crime. In such a situation, the criminal may conclude that he is likely unsuited for crime. If so, he can be deterred with less costly penalties. However, it is unlikely that a criminal with five convictions has committed only five crimes without having determined he is a low-ability criminal. This paper shows that criminals with multiple convictions are likely to be high-ability criminals who have committed significantly more crimes than they have convictions. Therefore, criminals with more convictions are likely to believe (based on past experience) that they have greater ability. Thus, higher penalties are necessary to deter them from committing crimes. Our model assumes criminals have two levels of ability. High-ability criminals are less likely to be caught than low-ability criminals. Neither criminals nor courts can directly observe a criminal’s ability type. Initially, criminals assume the likelihood that they are high-ability is equal to the proportion of high-ability criminals in the criminal population. They will begin committing crimes if this probability makes crime profitable. They then use Bayes’ rule to update the probability they are high-ability criminals based on their success rate. If the probability declines to the point where crimes are no longer expected to be profitable, they stop committing crimes. A standard result found in the literature is that if it were possible to set penalties high enough, all crime would be deterred. In practice, such penalties are rare. Thus, we assume that there is a maximum feasible penalty that can be imposed. For criminals who receive high benefits from criminal acts, we assume this penalty is not high enough to act as a deterrent, given the probability they place on being high-ability before they commit their first crime.Footnote 2
 If only these high-benefit criminals are present, this would imply that there is no value in imposing costly penalties for first convictions. We briefly discuss cases where legal systems impose zero penalties. Nonetheless, legal systems often impose a positive penalty for even a first conviction. We explain this by assuming low-benefit potential criminals exist who can be deterred from even committing a first offense with a feasible penalty. However, any penalty which is greater than the smallest one needed to deter these agents is inefficient, as it imposes a greater than necessary cost on society without an increase in deterrence. We also show that it is necessary for subsequent penalties to never decrease. Otherwise, some criminals may be willing to incur an expected loss on their first conviction in the expectation of offsetting that loss with expected gains on subsequent crimes.Footnote 3
 Some criminals who commit a first offense will be convicted of it and as a result will reduce the probability they place on being high-ability criminals. If so, it is possible that they can eventually be deterred by a penalty that is feasible but higher than the penalty for a first conviction. Nonetheless, this higher penalty should not be higher than needed to deter these criminals, as an even higher penalty would increase costs without increasing deterrence. Criminals who are successful on their first crime place a higher probability on being high-ability criminals. However, some will subsequently experience enough failures to later lower the probability they place on being high-ability to a point where deterrence is feasible. Again, it will only be efficient to impose a penalty just high enough to deter these individuals. The process of deterrence continues, with increasing penalties for greater numbers of convictions, as long as the maximum feasible penalty is not exceeded. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in efficient penalty structures for repeat offenders. Several papers present reasons why the optimal penalty structure would be either constant or decreasing (Polinsky and Rubinfeld 1991; Burnovski and Safra 1994; Baik and Kim 2001; Dana 2001; Emons 2003, 2004, 2007; Motchenkova 2006, 2014). These studies highlight the importance of understanding why real-world penalty structures are escalating instead. One possible explanation is that escalating penalties are consistent with government expressing moral condemnation of legally prohibited conduct (Dana 2001). However, this literature review will highlight explanations that try to reconcile escalating penalties with deterrence. 
Polinsky and Shavell (1998) use a two-period model to show that if optimal deterrence in the first period is not possible, it may be optimal to reserve maximal punishments for the second period. This is because an individual contemplating committing an offense in the first period will know that if he is caught, not only will he bear an immediate sanction but, in addition, any sanction that he bears for an offense in the second period will be higher because of his record. Using a different framework, Rubinstein (1980) reaches a similar conclusion. 
Endres and Rundshagen (2012) use an infinite-period game to show that when the objective is cost minimization, punishment escalation is an optimal penalty scheme. Endres and Rundshagen (2012), Burnovski and Safra (1994) and Motchenkova (2006, 2014) are among a very few articles that allow for more than two periods. 
Mungan (2013) uses a behavioral economics rationale for increasing penalties. His model assumes that in the first period a potential criminal knows there is some probability that in the second period he will fail to exert self-control. Thus, an increasing penalty schedule gives the agent an additional incentive not to commit a crime in the first period. 
Mungan (2010) shows that if criminals learn through experience, increasing penalties may be optimal to counteract the learning effects. Garoupa and Jellal (2004) show that increasing penalties may be optimal when enforcers learn from experience. Several authors use errors on the part of either the legal system or defendants as explanations for treating first-time offenders more lenientlyFootnote 4 (Stigler 1970; Chu et al. 2000; Emons 2007; Posner 2010). A number of papers show that stigma may be an explanation for escalating penalties for repeat offenders (Rasmusen 1996; Dana 2001; Funk 2004; Miceli and Bucci 2005; Posner 2010). Typically, the stigma of a conviction reduces an individual’s legitimate employment prospects, which is part of the opportunity cost of future crime. Stigma effects decline with subsequent offenses. Thus, if punishment includes both stigma effects and formal punishment, total punishment may not actually be increasing with repeated offenses. Pyne’s (2010) model of juvenile crime is similar in assuming that juvenile penalties reduce the adult earning potential of those convicted. It differs, however, in assuming that the effect of juvenile incarceration operates through human capital accumulation rather than through stigma. Some researchers have assumed that criminals are heterogeneous in terms of either the benefits they receive from crime or their offense propensity (Polinsky and Rubinfeld 1991; Miceli 2010, 2013; McCannon 2009). Unlike this paper, they have not considered heterogeneity in criminal ability. Conceptually, the paper most similar to this one is Pyne (2012). Like this paper, it models repeated crimes committed by criminals with differing, unknown abilities. Unlike this paper, its focus is on explaining why a one-period increase in enforcement has a greater effect on deterrence than a one-period increase in penalties. It does not model criminal behavior according to Bayes’ rule, nor does it deal with the efficiency of penalty structures. Pyne (2012) does not address the common practice of escalating penalties, as it considers only a one-period increase in penalties, whereas the present paper looks at how the optimal penalty changes as the number of convictions increases. Section 2 presents the model and the theoretical results. Section 3 provides a numerical example. Section 4 discusses and concludes the paper.",6

Economou,Nicholas C. Kyriazis,Theodore Metaxas,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is well-known and generally accepted that democracy, in the form of direct democracy through the functioning of citizens’ assemblies, emerged in Classical Greece at the end of the sixth century BCE. Assemblies took all major decisions through voting, on issues introduced by any citizen in writing. What is less well-known but very important to early, modern and contemporary development, is that democracy was not static but evolutionary, both within city-states like Athens, and federations like the Aetolian League. The fourth century BCE Athenian democracy was institutionally different from the fifth century (Hansen 1999; Kyriazis 2009; Halkos and Kyriazis 2010). The concept of federations of free and democratic city-states that are combined and collaborate voluntarily to evolve into a specific political unit with an appropriate institutional structure was completely new in its width and depth.Footnote 1
 We have historical evidence of federations already by the mid-sixth century (before the emergence of democracy) as for example, the Boeotian, from 550 to 146 BCE (Bonner 1910; Buckler 1980) or the Thessalian, from 550 down to 323 BCE (Wade-Gery 1924; Larsen 1960). On the whole, from the period of the sixth century to 146 BCE, the year of the final conquest of Greece by the Romans, the existence of at least 18 federations in the Greek world (not just mainland Greece) is attested. The period of the greatest importance of proto-federations is the third and second centuries BCE. Caspari (1917) offers an analysis as far as monetary issues are concerned, taking into account 20 cases of political organizations that could be considered more or less as federations. A series of other scholars too have offered analyses for a variety of cases. For example, Cackwell (1981) examined the case of the Boeotian League, Mitchell (2003) the case of Cyrenaica, Sakellariou (1972) the Chalcidian League, Larsen (1952, 1975), Scholten (2000) and Rzepka (2009) the Aetolian League, Salmon (1978) and Roy (2003) the Arcadian Larsen (1972, 1975) the Achaean League. In the present paper we trace the development of regional federations in classical Greece. Next, we examine in more detail the political, institutional and economic structure of the Aetolian Federation as a particular case study. Then, we compare it to present day federations, in particular, the European Union (EU)Footnote 2 and make some suggestions as to what lessons for today’s development of the EU can be drawn from the workings of the Greek proto-federations.",18

If the regions forming a country have culturally distinct populations, and if some regions are richer than others (such as Flanders in Belgium, or Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain), a centralized redistribution policy involves implicit transfers from richer to poorer regions, and thus transfers of resources among individuals who do not share a common identity.Footnote 1 The potential wish of richer regions to decentralize redistribution suggests two things:Footnote 2 first, being richer, those regions may want to implement their own redistribution policy which could then be closer to local preferences. Second, it may also be that the inhabitants of those richer regions do not consider the implicit interregional transfers taking place under centralization as legitimate, and thus decentralizing redistribution constitutes a way of eliminating them. The presence of this two-sided heterogeneity across regions—average income and identity—thus gives rise to the following trade-off regarding the choice between centralized and decentralized redistribution from a welfare perspective: on the one hand, a centralized system allows to pool and redistribute resources at the country level, thereby reducing the extent of interregional income inequality. On the other hand, individuals may be less willing to redistribute in a culturally divided society. That is, if individuals do not share a common identity, there may be a smaller degree of solidarity in the society when redistribution is centralized. To capture this trade-off, we set up a political economy model where individuals choose a one-dimensional redistributive parameter, assuming that they are utilitarian altruists and care relatively more—if not only—about the well-being of the people in their own region (i.e., there is group loyalty). There are two culturally heterogeneous regions, and one of them is richer in the sense that it has a greater proportion of rich individuals. As a result, when redistribution is centralized, there is a net implicit transfer of resources from the rich to the poor region—this transfer being potentially undesirable from an individual perspective as a result of group loyalty. The aim of the paper is both positive and normative. First, we derive the preferred redistributive tax rates of the rich individuals under both institutional arrangements. Under decentralization, stronger group loyalty always translates into a higher willingness to redistribute, as it essentially means that individuals become more altruistic. In contrast, when redistribution is centralized, stronger group loyalty reduces the support for redistribution in the rich region, while increasing it in the poor region. Indeed, as the inhabitants of the rich region increasingly dislike the implicit transfers to the poor region as they become more group-loyal, they want to redistribute less. Conversely, as the inhabitants of the poor region increasingly value the latter transfers as group loyalty gets stronger, they want to redistribute more. This is consistent with recent empirical evidence showing that regional identification reduces support for redistribution in relatively richer regions (e.g., Amat and Donnelly 2012; Holm and Geys 2013; Balcells et al. 2015). Second, using the traditional normative approach of the fiscal federalism literature, we show that total welfare maximization is closely linked to the minimization of inequality within and between regions. In particular, as we assume away the efficiency costs from taxation, the first-best solution is such that all individuals in the country end up with the same consumption level, irrespective of the strength of group loyalty or the extent of interregional inequality. In turn, the first-best solution is only attainable when redistribution is centralized. In other words, centralization is inherently better than decentralization under the traditional approach, since it allows to redistribute income between the two regions. Third, we analyze two particular cases under direct democracy, namely the absence of interregional inequality or group loyalty, in an attempt to isolate what we call the scope effect and the pooling effect of centralized redistribution, respectively. The scope effect relates to the fact that in the absence of interregional transfers, individuals are willing to pay higher taxes when redistribution is centralized, thereby yielding a pareto-improvement with respect to a decentralized system of redistribution. That is, even when there are no regional income disparities, and provided that individuals care about the other region, a centralized system has the additional benefit of increasing the support for redistribution as a result of its scope being greater. Indeed, as centralization allows the decisive individual to implement his preferred level of redistribution everywhere in the country (i.e., the scope of redistribution is greater), he wants to redistribute more. This is consistent with Oates’ (1972) Decentralization Theorem (in the presence of cross-regional spillovers and when regions are identical), although here the superiority of centralization from a welfare perspective does not follow from the traditional “internalization of spillovers” argument. In contrast, the pooling effect relates to the fact that centralization strictly welfare-dominates decentralization whenever individuals share a common identity (i.e., there is no group loyalty), as the former enables to pool resources and homogenize redistribution at the country level, thereby reducing the extent of interregional inequality. It turns out, then, that the rationale for decentralizing redistribution in this direct democracy context only arises when both sources of cross-regional heterogeneity interact (i.e., average income and identity). Again, if individuals share a common identity, centralization welfare-dominates decentralization regardless of the extent of interregional inequality. Likewise, in the absence of regional income disparities, centralization pareto-dominates decentralization despite the fact that individuals care relatively more about the well-being of those in their own region. For the general case where interregional inequality and group loyalty overlap, we show that the latter creates excessive decentralization pressures in the rich region from a welfare perspective.Footnote 3 Indeed, the stronger group loyalty, the more likely that the rich individuals in the rich region prefer a decentralized system of redistribution, since it allows them to redistribute to the local poor while avoiding the implicit transfers to the poor region, the inhabitants of which they do not care (so much) about. In fact, if the rich region can unilaterally impose the decentralization of redistribution, and provided that group loyalty is strong enough, the political equilibrium is very likely to be inefficient. A large body of experimental evidence shows that individuals tend to behave in an altruistic manner (e.g., Fehr and Schmidt 1999; Charness and Rabin 2002). Furthermore, in-group favoritism is a well-documented fact (e.g., Bernhard et al. 2006; Efferson et al. 2008) and is likely to significantly affect preferences over redistribution (e.g., Klor and Shayo 2010). In this paper, we model redistributive preferences based on utilitarian altruism, and, following Luttmer (2001), we assume that the strength of altruism towards specific individuals is determined by group loyalty.Footnote 4 That is, individuals care mostly (if not only) about the well-being of those belonging to their own group. As we assume a common identity within regions, this means that individuals care relatively more about the well-being of the inhabitants of their own region. There is a growing literature studying the effects of fractionalization along religious, ethnic or linguistic lines on public policy. In particular, the idea that support for redistribution may be lower in culturally diverse societies has been documented extensively (e.g., Alesina et al. 1999, 2001; Luttmer 2001; Desmet et al. 2009; Dahlberg et al. 2012).Footnote 5 The underlying mechanism is that individuals may be more altruistic towards those with whom they share a common identity (the so-called “in-group bias”), and this identification-redistribution link is by now well recognized in the Economics literature (for a review, see Costa-i-Font and Cowell 2015). From a theoretical perspective, we follow the approach of Lind (2007), who stresses the fact that heterogeneity among individuals regarding identity and income might have a joint impact on support for redistribution. In particular, he shows that while inequality within groups has the usual effect of promoting redistribution, inequality between groups has the opposite effect of reducing support for redistribution. Some authors have gone one step further by modelling the interaction between individuals’ identity and redistribution choices (e.g. Shayo 2009; Lindqvist and Östling 2013; Holm and Geys 2013).Footnote 6 While we treat individuals’ identity as given, we characterize and compare individual preferences for redistribution under two alternative institutional arrangements. In that sense, our focus is not on the determinants and dynamics of social identification (i.e., group loyalty). Rather, we want to understand how it affects the choice between centralized and decentralized redistribution given that (1) the groups are geographically segmented, and (2) there are income disparities across regions (and thus across groups). The separated effects of cross-regional heterogeneity in terms of either income or identity on the choice between centralized and decentralized redistribution have been investigated from a political economy perspective. Regarding heterogeneity in income, Persson and Tabellini (1994) show that if average income differs between regions, majority rule at the federal level produces less redistribution than at the local level. In their seminal paper on the breakup of nations, Bolton and Roland (1997) focus on the effects of cross-regional heterogeneity in average and median income on secession incentives, and show that a poor region will seek secession from a richer region whenever the benefits from better preference targeting outweigh the loss of interregional transfers. While those papers consider continuous income distributions, they abstract from the possibility of cultural diversity and altruistic motives for redistribution. Regarding heterogeneity in identity, Pauly (1973) shows that if redistribution is a spatially limited public good, it can be efficiently implemented at the local level. However, he does not address the issue of interregional redistribution, which clearly calls for some centralization. In Pauly’s model, decentralizing redistribution allows to better target regional preferences, which can be seen as an application of Oates’ Decentralization Theorem. In contrast, in our model, decentralization has the advantage of increasing the degree of solidarity in the society, hence the level of redistribution. This is also the case in Bjorvatn and Cappelen (2006), where it is assumed that voters care about the poor only in their own community (i.e., there is full group loyalty). They show that the best level of government regarding redistribution is determined by a trade-off which depends on the nature of altruism. While the authors allow for tax competition under decentralization, they assume that jurisdictions are equally rich, hence they also abstract from the issue of interregional income redistribution. Our contribution is thus twofold. First, we analyze how cross-regional heterogeneity regarding average income and identity jointly affect preferences for redistribution conditional on the latter being centralized or decentralized. Then, we show how this two-sided heterogeneity between regions affects the relative desirability of the two institutional arrangements from a welfare perspective. As we argued earlier in this introduction, we believe that the coexistence of regional differences in average income and identity has important implications for the issue of (de)centralizing redistribution from both a positive and a normative point of view. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the model. In Sect. 3, we derive the preferred tax rates of the rich individuals under centralization and decentralization and examine their properties. In Sect. 4, we compare the relative attractiveness of centralized and decentralized redistribution. To do so, we start by solving the model using the normative approach of the traditional fiscal federalism literature, after which we compare the welfare properties of centralized and decentralized redistribution under direct democracy. Section 5 concludes. Proofs can be found in the Appendix.",1
16.0,4.0,Economics of Governance,24 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-015-0166-9,Intergovernmental transfers and re-election concerned politicians,November 2015,Ross Hickey,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper provides a non-partisan political rationale for intergovernmental transfers. We present a theory and evidence of the effects of electoral dynamics and term limits on intergovernmental grants. The crux of our theory is that central politicians make strategic transfers to local politicians to alter the choices of their successors. Using a political agency model we show that this action affects the re-election prospects for all politicians as voters simply vote for the candidate associated with the highest level of expected public expenditure. The central incumbent makes transfers to affect the state of the world in which she and the central challenger find themselves. Voters find the state of the world in which incumbents at both levels are re-election eligible desirable because it is associated with lower political rents. Thus, a central incumbent can reduce the likelihood of transition to this state through transfers to a local incumbent when that local incumbent is facing re-election. This sabotages the central challenger from being able to credibly make a transfer if elected. The model produces clear predictions about the timing and state of the world in which transfers take place. To test the model we use data on federal transfers to U.S. states from the period 1978–2000. Consistent with the predictions of the model we find that federal politicians are less likely to make transfers when they are election-ineligible, and that state governors are less likely to receive transfers when they are election-ineligible. We also confirm that governors are more likely to receive transfers in gubernatorial election years, and that federal politicians are less likely to make transfers in presidential election years. There are many theories of intergovernmental transfers, and transfers are used to serve many purposes.Footnote 1 Intergovernmental transfers can be used to address the equity of the distribution of resources within a federation, as in Boadway and Flatters (1982). Transfers are also used to enhance efficiency in situations where local governments cannot efficiently raise the revenue necessary for providing locally customized public goods and services or to influence the mobility of economic agents. There are also political motivations for intergovernmental transfers. Dahlberg and Johansson (2002) find that transfers to Swedish municipalities are made for tactical reasons. Also a recent literature has identified partisan matching of central and local office holders as a motive for intergovernmental transfers in both India and Spain.Footnote 2 None of these previously studied reasons for transfers are present in our model. The transfers in our model are purely political and depend on two features of the environment: a staggered electoral calendar, and term limits. The model is very similar to that of Muthoo and Shepsle (2010), who study the optimal institutional structure in a staggered term organization, and in some ways is a variant of an overlapping generations model (see Samuelson 1958). Muthoo and Shepsle (2010) focus on the rules developed in staggered term organizations, like: transparency, and the indifference of the founders of the organization to the procedural rules that are subsequently adopted within the organization. As in Muthoo and Shepsle (2010) the results obtained here require retrospective, recency biased voting.Footnote 3 Staggered elections are at the forefront of Kaiser and Taugourdeau’s (2013) study of bailouts in federations, in which they find that synchronized elections result in less fiscal discipline at the local level and lower welfare than when elections are staggered. Our model is quite similar to theirs in some respects, though here we study a Markov perfect equilibrium, allowing for a discussion of the states of the world in which transfers take place. Term limits are also a key feature of the environment studied, and are necessary for the existence of transfers in our model. A rationale for the adoption of term limits is that they increase electoral competition by decreasing the incumbency advantage (Lopez 2003). In the United States 36 states have some form of gubernatorial term limit, and several large cities have adopted term limits for both mayors and council. Term limits are also present in Europe, appearing at the municipal level in both Portugal (Castro and Martins 2013) and Italy (Bordignon et al. 2003).Footnote 4 Despite their popularity, the presence of term limits generates a lame duck effect. Politicians in their last term in office become lame ducks: the final term in office is used to collect maximal rents. In such a setting, voters concern themselves with the electoral calendar, expecting politicians to act (at least partially) in the interests of the electorate when seeking re-election and resigning themselves to be at the mercy of a lame duck when an office holder is no longer seeking re-election. Ferraz and Finan (2011) find empirical support for the lame duck hypothesis as Brazilian mayors who are seeking re-election misappropriate 27 % fewer resources than their lame duck counterparts. The main result of our paper is that transfers take place when elections are staggered and neither office holder is a lame duck. The mechanism at work in the model is as follows. Voters like transfers, and a central to local transfer helps the local politician get re-elected by improving the signal of the recipient’s competence. Helping a local politician get re-elected benefits the central incumbent because securing a lame duck at the local level sabotages the central challenger’s ability to make a central to local transfer should the challenger get elected. Since lame ducks take maximal rents, voters would never expect a transfer to or from a lame duck. Thus placing a lame duck at the local level improves the central incumbent’s re-election prospects in her subsequent election at the expense of her challenger. The intuition is similar to that found in Alesina and Tabellini (1990): an action is taken today to affect the feasible set of a successor. Much like public debt in Alesina and Tabellini (1990), office holders use intergovernmental transfers strategically to influence the choices of their successors. This is accomplished by influencing the state of the world in which the challenger would find herself if she were to be elected. The theory presented here is a complement to the literature on politically motivated intergovernmental transfers. In this paper, as in the seminal works of Barro (1973) and Ferejohn (1986), we abstract from the conflict of interest that would arise from a heterogenous population of voters and concentrate on the conflict of interest that arises between voters and politicians. This conflict of interest, often referred to as political agency, has been studied previously in a variety of papers. For a general discussion see Besley (2006). Many papers have studied political agency in the context of federalism focusing on yardstick competition: see Besley and Case (1995), Besley and Smart (2007) or Revelli and Tovmo (2007). More closely related to this paper is the study of political accountability in the context of equalization by Kotsogiannis and Schwager (2008). Kotsogiannis and Schwager (2008) show that the effect of an exogenous system of equalization transfers on accountability depends on the balance between the extent to which voters increase their intolerance for rent seeking, and the loss of accountability due to the decrease in the informational content embodied in the politician’s actions. A novel feature of our model is the incorporation of strategic behaviour by politicians at both the central and local levels. This is similar to Zudenkova (2011), who studies coattail voting where political agents are strategic at both levels of government, and voters use retrospective voting rules with simultaneous elections for the legislature and executive at one level of government. Hence we abstract from the previously established motivations for intergovernmental transfers, focusing instead on the voters’ agency problem when transfers are both endogenous, and increase the funds available for rents at the local level. There are multiple equilibria for the game that we study in the following pages, but we focus our attention on the equilibrium in which positive transfers take place.Footnote 5 We concentrate on the pure strategy transfer equilibrium because it best matches the data from a world in which transfers are made to all local governments and in all states of the world. This equilibrium is a sunspot: transfers take place because they are expected. One may wonder how this equilibrium is selected. Barro (1973) suggested that political parties arose as an informal institution to improve voter welfare in the face of political agency. Likewise the transfer equilibrium may have arisen to mitigate the negative effects of lame duck politicians. While the model makes stark predictions about if and when transfers take place, when we approach the data in a setting in which all local governments receive transfers we extend our logic to focus on when and how much. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. Section 3 provides the evidence for our theory. Section 4 provides a discussion. Finally Sect. 5 concludes.",4

Laband,Richard A. Seals Jr.,Eric J. Wilbrandt,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In 1967 the Rules Committee of the US House of Representatives unanimously agreed to permit up to a maximum of 25 co-sponsors on an introduced bill.Footnote 2 Temporally, this coincides exactly with the post-World War II peak in the total number of bills introduced each two-year cycle (Fig. 1). This also coincides exactly with the post-World-War II peak in the percentage of bills introduced each two-year congressional cycle that were duplicates of other bills introduced previously in the session by other House members (Fig. 2). Yet this extraordinary change in operating procedure in the US House of Representatives has for 45 years elicited very little attention from the scientific community. To start with, there is virtually no analysis of the role/importance of duplicate bills in the legislative production process. What little research there has been to-date on bill co-sponsorship has focused principally on two aspects: (1) description of co-sponsorship networks, and (2) discussion of the putative importance of bill co-sponsorship as a form of credibility signaling to external constituents (referred to as position taking) versus internal coalition-building by Representatives. In addition, there is a tiny thread of literature that addresses the impact(s) of bill co-sponsorship on legislative outcomes. But the compelling questions have been completely ignored: why did the House change its operating procedure and, more specifically, why did the House change its operating procedure when it did? This lacuna with respect to the ‘why’ and ‘when’ renders the discussion of co-sponsorship as position-taking or coalition-building awkward—if bill co-sponsorship is driven principally by the desire of Representatives to signal policy-related positions to their constituents or to aid coalition-formation with their colleagues, surely these imperatives would have been present 10, 50, or 100 years earlier than 1967. Bills were co-sponsored in the US Senate throughout the 20th Century, so it is not plausible that House members didn’t understand that co-sponsorship was possible. That is, bill co-sponsorship simply could not have been a not-previously-considered innovation in the legislative production process. Total, unique, and duplicated legislation in the US House of Representatives Number of unique bills with multiple sponsors by Congress In this paper, we attempt to provide an economic explanation for the adoption of bill co-sponsorship by the US House of Representatives in 1967. In doing so, we demonstrate empirically that key features of legislative production prior to 1967 (when House members’ support for a bill was indicated by introduction of duplicate bills) and post-1967 (when political support for a bill is indicated by co-sponsorship) are strikingly similar. Specifically, the raw number of supporters of a bill, whether indicated by duplicate bills or by co-sponsorship, is not nearly as critical to advancement of that bill through the House of Representatives as is the political power of the individual who introduces it and those who support it. The relative sizes of these effects are highly consistent over time. In effect, this finding means that the underlying factors of importance in the House’s legislative production function did not change significantly when bill co-sponsorship was adopted. This suggests that the change in operating procedure may have been driven by an intra-chamber struggle to control the legislative outcomes. We present empirical evidence that is highly consistent with this hypothesis—adoption of bill co-sponsorship in 1967 coincides exactly with the post-World War II peak in a concentration ratio of legislation passed in the US House of Representatives. Prior to the 90th Congress, there was a more-or-less steady increase in concentration of legislation passed by the five busiest committees that peaked at over 0.4 in the 90th Congress and then declined precipitously to under 0.15 by the 93rd Congress.",1

Theory and evidence on the pricing of health services in Uganda,February 2016,Kjetil Bjorvatn,Jakob Svensson,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Health systems in poor countries are often inadequate and inefficient.Footnote 1 Governments and donors have therefore suggested that private providers should play a larger role to increase the supply of affordable health services to the population (IFC 2007). But what kind of private providers should be invited to play this role, for-profit or not-for-profit institutions? Not-for-profits seem like a good candidate as they do not appropriate profits and often have a mission to serve the poor (Agg 2006). However, there is a debate on the organizational behavior of not-for-profit actors, whether they behave altruistically or just like profit maximizing agents, with weak board control allowing managers to capture benefits (Sloan et al. 2001; Duggan 2000; Glaeser 2003; Lakdawalla and Philipson 2006; Rose-Ackerman 1996). In this paper we analyze the behavior of for-profit and not-for-profit organizations using theory and data from health clinics in Uganda. Our study is based on Reinikka and Svensson (2010), but addresses the question of organizational behavior from a different angle. While Reinikka and Svensson identify behavior by looking at how health clinics respond to a financial reform, we here use differences in market structure as the source of variation, focusing on the clinics’ pricing behavior. The idea is that the price response to competition may depend on the governance of the clinic. In particular, with another clinic in the catchment area, the health impact motive of a clinic governed by altruistic owners and/or workers becomes less important, with the response being to raise the price. In contrast, a for-profit clinic is likely to respond to competition by lowering its price to defend its market shares. We develop a simple model detailing this argument, and use data on prices and market structure to investigate its empirical relevance. To our knowledge, this is the first paper analyzing the price setting behavior of different types of health clinics conditional on the degree of competition in a developing country context. The data support the predictions from our model, suggesting that not-for-profit clinics indeed behave differently from for-profit clinics, choosing prices that are consistent with altruistic motives. Our findings are thus consistent with those in Reinikka and Svensson, who find that the two types of clinics respond differently to the financial reform. In what follows, we present a model that can explain why competition may have a qualitatively different effect on the price of a not-for-profit provider relative to that of a for-profit provider. The model also gives predictions on how distance between population centers affects pricing behavior. Section 3 looks at the data to investigate the link between competition and prices among health clinics in Uganda. Section 4 concludes.",3

Every country is part of at least one regional integration agreement (RIA) and on average an African country is member of four agreements (The World Bank 2005). Yet, it is hard to reconcile this enthusiasm for regional integration with its results. Most indicators show that African economies are barely integrated. Tariff reduction schemes are backlogged, rules of origin are extremely restrictive and cross-border transportation facilities are either inadequate, or missing altogether. As a result, the level of intra-regional trade of most African RIAs rarely exceeds 10 % (relative to around half of all trade in NAFTA or the EU-27), and in some cases it even fell after signing the agreements (UNU-CRIS 2006). Theoretically, the reasons for African integration have never been very compelling to begin with. First of all, most African countries do not produce any of the products that are of interest to neighboring countries. The bulk of African trade is with developed economies, in particular the European Union. The African trade patterns are not complementary and static analysis warns that this will most likely result in trade diversion and hence lower welfare. Similarly, the long term dynamic effects are unlikely to be strong and many of the new regionalism theories are conditional on strong economic integration. Rent-seeking behavior on the other hand can provide a valid alternative explanation for the interest in African integration in the form of the rent-seizing, rent-shielding and rent-destruction hypotheses. They can account for the strong interest in integration in the absence of a positive effect on welfare, as well as for the lack of progress in breaking down the barriers to trade. The rent-seizure hypothesis states that RIAs are used to set up rent-extracting mechanisms. The agreements bestow extensive powers on the negotiating parties, which combined with the absence of an increase in welfare creates an ideal environment for lobbying and in the worst case bribery. Conversely, rent-shielding remonstrates that the government can use RIAs to protect parts of the economy by removing them from the direct control of the government. Similarly, rent-destruction claims that RIAs increase competition which curtails rents. Depending on how benevolent the government is, all three predict a positive effect of the level of corruption on trade agreements. While there exist ample examples of RIAs being misused for rent-seizure purposes, the evidence remains largely anecdotal. A couple of studies have regressed the desire to enter into a free trade agreement on the level of corruption. Wu (2006) found that an increase in the level of corruption increases the probability of joining a FTA in that year, but ignored characteristics of the partner country. In contrast, Endoh (2006) found that the quality of governance (including the absence of corruption) and the probability of an agreement are positively related. A possible reason for the contradictory results is the fact that these models only looked at a monotonous relation. In contrast, most theoretical models predict that rent-seeking has a non-linear effect and may interact with relative GDP or other characteristics. Arcand et al. (2011) found that government’s welfare mindedness has a myriad of significant interaction terms, among which its squared value and the bargaining power of the government. The goal of this paper is to see whether the level of corruption can be identified as a statistically significant factor in the decision to enter a free trade agreement in Africa. In doing so, we also build on papers by Mansfield et al. (2002), Baier and Bergstrand (2004) and Márquez-Ramos et al. (2011) that try to determine the reasons behind the formation of regional integration agreements. The approach followed in this paper differs from that employed in the papers listed above in a number of ways. Firstly, it is centered on intra-African integration and as we will show, there is significant regional heterogeneity in the reasons for entering free trade agreements. The failure of the traditional economic motivations in explaining African RIAs opens up opportunities to test more political motives. Secondly, we explicitly take into account that the intra-African trade agreements involve more than two partner countries. Moreover, many of these agreements are overlapping, meaning that a country can be in two trade agreements with partner countries that have not signed an agreement themselves. To this end, the bilateral estimation framework is adjusted to deal with the heteroskedasticity caused by the non-nested multilateral trade agreements. Thirdly, we do not infer the level of rent-seeking from tariff rates like Arcand et al. (2011), but instead use different indicators of corruption perception as a proxy for the level of rent-seeking. Finally, we address the endogeneity of the relationship between corruption and trade integration in a number of ways: using lagged values, a control function approach as well as an instrumental variable probit regression model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the different reasons for economic integration and their merits and demerits in explaining African integration. Next, we expand on the idea of rent-seizure, rent-shielding and rent-destruction as driving forces of integration. Sections 4 and 5 cover the data and econometric method used, after which we discuss our findings.",1
17.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,12 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-015-0177-6,Corruption and anxiety in Sub-Saharan Africa,February 2016,Robert Gillanders,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Corruption makes frequent appearances in popular and academic debates on foreign aid, democratisation and a host of other development issues. Given this prominence, it is important to understand all the benefits that policies aimed at curbing corruption might bring. Using Afrobarometer data, this paper assesses the relationship between an individual’s experience of providing bribes in exchange for various services and their self-reported anxiety. While corruption has been found to be an undesirable phenomenon in terms of many outcomes, its relationship with this aspect of well-being has so far escaped the attention of applied researchers. Well-being is an increasingly popular dependent variable in applied microeconomics and related disciplines. Carol Graham provides an excellent overview in her book ‘Happiness Around the World’ and Helliwell and Putnam (2004) is notable for using both life satisfaction and happiness as dependent variables. In terms of Africa, this literature has a relatively long history and continues to develop. For example Møller and Jackson (1997) and Ebrahim et al. (2013) document the factors associated with happiness and life satisfaction in South Africa. There are studies examining the impact of corruption on happiness (e.g. Graham and Chattopadhyay 2009) and on self-reported life satisfaction (e.g. Tavits 2008). There is a pertinent literature that empirically examines various determinants of mental health. Good examples of this literature are Heflin et al. (2005) and Gardner and Oswald (2007). Azfar and Gurgur (2008) show that corruption can have deleterious effects on physical health outcomes in the specific case of the Philippines. This paper though is concerned with the potential anxiety costs of corruption (and tangentially on its relationship with self-reported living standards). To the best of my knowledge, there are no existing studies that empirically examine corruption’s relationship to anxiety. However, the possibility of such a relationship has been noted by scholars. Shavell (1993) argues that similar events such as robbery and extortion can lead to anxiety for the victim. Ari (2008) presents survey evidence that suggests that bribery is rife in Kyrgyz education and claims that such practices will generate anxiety for the students. Pedigo and Marshall (2009) provide qualitative evidence that bribery is a source of anxiety for Australian business managers working in international settings. Wiesenfeld (1997) finds that a perception of procedural unfairness is associated with higher anxiety in managers. While one could argue that some of these are likely to be more or less applicable in the context of petty corruption in Sub-Saharan Africa, the literature thus points to victimhood, uncertainty, a sense of unfairness, and ethical discomfort as being potential drivers of anxiety. Anxiety is an interesting outcome in its own right and an understudied one in the context of the developing world. There is also a channel through which corruption could operate on more traditional economic outcomes through anxiety. If experiencing corruption causes stress, then lowering corruption may carry an indirect economic benefit. Banerjee and Duflo note in their recent book ‘Poor Economics’, that stress is associated with the level of cortisol produced in the body and point to research presented in van den Bos et al. (2009) that shows that cortisol is detrimental to rational decision making (Banerjee and Duflo 2011, pp. 140–141). Porcelli and Delgado (2009) show that stressed subjects are more likely to exhibit a bias in risk taking behaviour in a financial decision making setting. Relatedly, trait anxiety has been shown to predict more conservative investment decisions (Gambetti and Giusberti 2012) and also less risky decision making in a non-financial setting (Peng et al. 2014). Rational decision making is important in any setting and even more so in countries where resources are especially scarce. Finally, while the simple binary measure of self-reported anxiety used in this paper is very different from a proper medical categorisation of anxiety disorders, there is a literature that has demonstrated that anxiety disorders have large costs for both the individual and society both in terms of direct medical costs and lost productivity (Greenberg et al. 1999; Marciniak et al. 2004). The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 describes the data and the econometric approach; Sect. 3 presents the results from the pooled data and contrasts them with those obtained from a model that uses living standards as the dependent variable; Sect. 4 includes some round specific variables; Sect. 5 considers some variables that are potentially endogenous and shows that their inclusion does not change the key result; Sect. 6 looks at the type and level of corruption and Sect. 7 concludes.",10
17.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,14 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-015-0178-5,A political-economy perspective on social expenditures: corruption and in-kind versus cash transfers,February 2016,Zohal Hessami,Silke Uebelmesser,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"During the last 150 years, the welfare state has become a core institution in advanced industrial societies. Social expenditures, which are mostly transfers, nowadays make up about a third of public spending in many OECD countries. Transfers are allocated in different forms (e.g. cash transfers, monetary transfers to bank accounts, food stamps, public housing, basic health care) and to recipients who face various challenges such as old age, unemployment, incapacity to work, sickness, child-rearing, and survivorship. The objective is to reduce inequities and to provide insurance against extreme life events. A first look at the data on social expenditures reveals the large cross-country variation in the share of GDP spent on social transfers. The literature mainly attributes this variation to partisan biases (Congleton and Bose 2010), social trust (Bergh and Bjørnskov 2011; Bjørnskov and Svendsen 2013), and the increased vulnerability to international macroeconomic shocks (Leibrecht et al. 2011; Rodrik 1998). A second and more puzzling observation is the variation in the choice between cash transfers and in-kind transfers for which the existing literature provides hardly any explanation.Footnote 1
\(^,\)
Footnote 2 This paper attempts to fill this gap. A classic argument in favor of cash transfers is efficiency. Cash transfers do not distort consumption choices. In contrast, in-kind transfers are distortionary under the standard assumptions that they can neither be resold nor be topped up.Footnote 3 If this were the only consideration in the choice between in-kind and cash transfers and institutions functioned perfectly, we should observe no in-kind transfers anywhere in the world. Yet, there are also considerations that render in-kind transfers relatively more attractive than cash transfers. One example is paternalism. Hessami and Uebelmesser (2013) show that governments may choose to provide private goods such as housing, education vouchers and food stamps in order to induce “desirable” consumption behavior. There are most likely further considerations relevant for the choice between cash and in-kind transfers which the literature has neglected. Currie and Gahvari (2008) even go so far to say that “the empirical work seems to largely accept the paternalism theory and move on to other questions” (p. 334). While the theoretical public finance literature on the public provision of private goods (i.e. in-kind redistribution) that emphasizes self-targeting and paternalism is extensive (see Balestrino 1999; Besley and Coate 1991; Blackorby and Donaldson 1988; Blomquist and Christiansen 1995; Munro 1992; Nichols and Zeckhauser 1982; Thum 2000; Thum and Thum 2001), political-economy explanations are scarce despite the view that “Political economy considerations must also be part of the story” (Currie and Gahvari 2008, p. 334). As a first notable exception, Bergstrom and Blomquist (1996) argue that selfish taxpayers without children favor public provision of daycare so that mothers join the labor force and generate additional tax revenues. Lundholm and Ohlsson (1998) extend this argument. Both papers, however, only provide a general rationale for in-kind transfers in the specific context of daycare and do not analyze the relative importance of cash and in-kind transfers. Bearse et al. (2000) analyze why poor countries allocate more transfers in kind than rich countries. The authors find that high-income earners in poor countries may opt out of the publicly provided goods (e.g. education) if the quality of provision is below a certain threshold. This in turn induces the (poor) median voter to allocate more resources to in-kind redistribution.Footnote 4
 This paper provides a new argument why in-kind transfers are widely used. Our analysis emphasizes institutions and assumes the political-economy perspective. In particular, we take into account the possibility that institutions are weak, i.e. there is corruption, and analyze how this affects the government’s choice between cash and in-kind transfers.Footnote 5 In a corrupt environment, the choice between cash and in-kind transfers is likely to be influenced by the extent to which their appropriation by corrupt politicians can be observed.Footnote 6 Voters prefer high observability in terms of who receives the transfers. In contrast, politicians prefer low observability to avoid detection and potential punishment. We argue that in-kind transfers allow for a relatively better (but still imperfect) monitoring than cash transfers (see Sect. 2). A case in point are the 2 million Euros paid every month as pensions to already deceased individuals in Greece (Reuters 2011). Had these old-age transfers been provided in kind, e.g. in the form of accommodation in a nursing home, the absence of the deceased would have been more easily noticed and the gain from this fraud would have been less attractive. In a corruption-free environment, preferences of voters and politicians are aligned: voters prefer cash transfers that do not distort their consumption choices and politicians willingly provide cash transfers to please voters and to get elected. However, in a corrupt country politicians attempt to appropriate cash transfers whose receipt is relatively more difficult to monitor and voters try to limit the discretion of politicians in doing so. Our theoretical considerations therefore suggest that the shift from cash transfers to in-kind transfers when corruption increases is brought about by voters. We provide evidence that supports this argument by testing whether the positive association between corruption and the in-kind share of transfers is stronger or exclusively observed in the most democratic OECD countries and in countries where particular democratic institutions are well-developed, i.e. in countries where voters have the most influence on policy outcomes. This paper makes the following contributions to the existing literature. (1) We formulate theoretical considerations that propose corruption as a determinant for the choice between in-kind and cash transfers. (2) We discuss how the level of democracy may affect the relationship between corruption and in-kind transfers. Both considerations are new contributions to the theoretical perspective on the determinants of the in-kind/cash transfer choice. (3) Given “the limited empirical evidence that can be brought on” theoretical explanations regarding the choice between in-kind and cash transfers (Currie and Gahvari 2008, p. 334), we test our predictions using data for 34 OECD countries over the time period from 1984 to 2007.Footnote 7
 Our estimation results provide evidence that the in-kind share of social transfers increases with corruption in the most democratic OECD countries. In less democratic OECD countries, we do not observe a positive relationship between corruption and the in-kind share of social transfers. We also find that particular political institutions that characterize democratic countries such as a free press, a high voice and accountability score, high political polarization, and an independent judiciary explain this effect. Our results are confirmed by three robustness checks which apply the following changes to the baseline model: the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable, the use of an instrumental variables approach to address the endogeneity of corruption, and the use of in-kind transfers as a share of GDP (instead of in-kind transfers as a share of total transfers) as the dependent variable. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 provides the theoretical background of our analysis and derives empirical predictions. Section 3 describes the data used in our empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy and the baseline estimation results. Section 5 provides the results for three robustness tests. Section 6 concludes.",9

Political influence on federal onshore oil and gas leasing in the Western United States,May 2016,Karen Maguire,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In this paper, I analyze the influence of federal political leadership on the amount of oil and natural gas leasing on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the contiguous western United States. The allocation of BLM lands between conflicting uses including conservation, recreation, and resource extraction has led to criticism of the federal government over its administration of these lands. The debate, over how to responsibly develop oil and natural gas resources on public lands, intensified in the 1960 and 1970s with the rise of the conservation movement (Muhn and Stuart 1988, p. 104). During this time the BLM “began to transform itself from an agency primarily processing land and mineral applications into an agency actively planning for the nation’s future needs.” (Muhn and Stuart 1988, p. 106) Critics of the leasing process often argue that political motivations are the primary factor in determining the amount of land leased rather than legitimate oil and natural gas resource needs. The paper examines oil and natural gas leasing on BLM lands after the conservation movement had begun, from 1983 through 2007, in order to determine if leasing was shifting with the political winds or if market factors were the primary factor in determining leasing outcomes. Previous research has generally focused on examining either oil and natural gas markets or political and bureaucratic outcomes generally. There are some notable exceptions; Libecap and Smith (2002) and Libecap and Wiggins (1985) examined the historical role of markets and politics in influencing the development of unitization contracts. Other work that focuses on the market and regulatory framework unique to federal lands examines the disparate influence of federal and private ownership in development outcomes (Fitzgerald 2010). Much of the remaining empirical work focuses on offshore rather than onshore oil and gas development on the federal mineral estate. In addition, this literature does not focus directly on the political aspects of lease issuance. This literature has instead focused on auction price theory to analyze the process for issuing competitive leases (Moody and Kruvant 1988; Hendricks et al. 1993, 2003), or on the determinants of oil and gas supply and production using a market supply and demand framework (Walls 1992; Iledare and Pulsipher 1999). The relevant literature on the federal political environment in the United States includes articles on the influence of political parties, articles examining the influence of a state’s congressional delegation on federal budgetary allocations to the state, and articles analyzing the role of federal politics in influencing bureaucratic agency outcomes. The findings regarding political party vary. There is a significant literature arguing that political parties matter in a variety of political outcomes (Levy 2004; Levitt and Snyder 1995; Rohde 1994; Cox and McCubbins 1994), but there is also a literature that argues that the role of political parties is dominated by other political factors including individual ideology and the legislative committee system (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; Shepsle and Weingast 1987). This paper delves into the debate by including measures of political party and ideology for various salient political actors in federal leasing, including the federal legislative and executive leadership, relevant federal legislative committee leaders, and state delegations to the U.S. Congress. The literature on the influence of state delegations on the allocation of federal resources has largely focused on federal budget allocations to the state (Albouy 2013; Hankins et al. 2014; Knight 2008). Albouy finds a positive effect on federal grant funding from party alignment between a state’s delegation and the majority party in the U.S. Congress. In particular, for states that align with a Republican majority, there are additional federal grants for defense and transportation, while Democratic alignment leads to additional grants for education and urban development. My paper builds on this literature by examining whether alignment between the state delegation and U.S. Senate or U.S. House of Representatives influences federal leasing outcomes in the state. I also examine the influence of Republican and Democratic alignment separately in order to account for their potentially disparate influence. In regards to bureaucratic influence, several papers have examined the degree of influence that a political leader has on federal bureaucratic agencies in the United States. One set of literature argues that bureaucrats have significant discretion in terms of bureaucratic outcomes (Niskanen 1975) while another body of literature argues that elected officials play a dominant role in dictating the bureaucratic environment and legislative outcomes. (Cropper et al. 1992; Moe 2006; Ringquist 1995; Shipan 2004; Weingast and Moran 1983; Wood 1988; Wood and Waterman 1991) While this literature has provided analyses of the role of various federal bureaucracies, it has not provided an evaluation of the influence of federal politics on BLM leasing in the western United States.Footnote 1
 The literature on the relationship between politicians and bureaucrats focuses on identifying when the preferred policies of the principal, the politician, are in fact instituted by the agent, the bureaucracy. Weingast and Moran (1983) is the seminal paper with regard to the interactions between the legislature and the bureaucracies that they manage. They find that despite the fact that the federal legislature does not closely monitor the day-to-day activities of the bureaucratic agencies, they do in fact control their agenda. This is done largely through credible threats to limit or remove funding and to withhold approval of political appointees in leadership roles (Weingast and Moran 1983). Shipan (2004) expands on the arguments of Weingast and Moran (1983) by examining not only if legislatures might influence bureaucracies, but also when. He argues that it is not legislation that matters in determining bureaucratic agency outcomes, but the potential for legislation. This paper leverages this argument for control of bureaucracies through indirect measures. Rather than focusing on a specific mechanism such as legislation and its effects on the number of leases issued by the BLM, I analyze the overall impact of changes in the relevant federal political leadership. The mechanism of influence could be legislation, threat of legislation, or limits on funding.",
17.0,2.0,Economics of Governance,03 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-015-0168-7,The ruling bargain: sovereign wealth funds in elite-dominated societies,May 2016,Artur Grigoryan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The past two decades have been characterized by a significant growth in the number of states setting up SWFs (SWF Institute 2014). Especially, resource-rich developing countries form a large majority among new sponsors of SWFs.Footnote 1 During the last years, a considerable volume of research, both theoretical and empirical, has been directed towards explaining this phenomenon. The existing literature gives some answers to the question why so many countries are setting up SWFs. The traditional normative theory sees a high potential for managing resource revenues in these funds and links the rise of SWFs to the “resource curse” literature (van der Ploeg 2008). The core idea being that SWFs can be used to mitigate negative effects of the “resource curse”, at least if they are designed properly and governed well. For instance, the short-term oriented and highly risk-intolerant stabilization funds are widely used to absorb high price volatility and resulting changes in resource revenues (Bagattini 2011). If assets are parked overseas, currency appreciation and closely related Dutch disease problems are minimized. The widely discussed experience of Chile shows that SWFs combined with clearly defined funding and withdrawal rules can be used as institutions improving fiscal discipline and reducing the fiscal procyclicality bias of governments in resource abundant economies (Frankel 2011). In summary, the reason of setting up SWFs is not only to establish a new resource revenue management tool but also to reduce risks generated by different macroeconomic shocks. For instance, the general purpose of commodity funds is to abate commodity price volatility risks; reserve investment corporations provide insurance against 1997-style crises; and pension reserve funds combat the risks of an ageing population (Dixon and Monk 2011). In this paper, I argue that in the case of some countries there could be an additional motive to set up a SWF. These countries’ societies are dominated by a ruler and an influential elite so that the loyalty of the elite is crucial for the ruler. Independently of whether these are ethnic (tribes, ethnic groups), economic (oligarchy) or political elites (ruling party), the ruler will need the elite’s support to remain in power. By letting elite members participate in the management of the SWF, the ruler will be able to link their interests to the existence of the regime and gain their support. For these countries SWFs represent some kind of “white elephants” which have small or negative social surpluses but provide a political advantage to the ruler (Robinson and Torvik 2005). The idea of the paper is similar to the study of (Pistor and Hatton (2011)). Paying attention to the fact that many SWFs come from non-democratic countries, they consider these funds as autonomy-maximizing institutions for the sponsor country’s ruling class. By using case studies, they show that the ruler can use SWFs to obtain domestic political dominance. Under certain circumstances, the ruler is able to pacify the elite’s ambitions using the SWF and thereby maximize his autonomy against domestic opponents. Dixon and Monk (2012) explain a similar idea from a wider point of view analyzing the link between the financial power of a state and sovereignty relative to powerful states. In this case, SWFs can be considered as tools providing the possibility of increasing a state’s sovereignty in general. Taking into account the nature of SWFs as long-term oriented and strongly institutionalized investment vehicles, I show that in weakly institutionalized political systems they can be used to partly solve the ruler’s commitment problem. Given the fact that it can be costly to withdraw funds from an existing SWF, the ruler will use the SWF to credibly promise to compensate the elite if he remains in power. The assumption that a coup d’état would lead to political instability and might end with a non-elite group in power, reinforces this argument. Consequently, even though the ruler would like to invest the resource rents and then consume a fraction of the output, he is forced to use a part of the resource rents in form of a SWF to buy the support of the elite. As a starting point, a simple theoretical model partly based on the framework of Caselli (2006) and Caselli and Cunningham (2009) is constructed. In the political economy literature, many papers analyze the economic policy under elite domination and are related to the framework presented here. Some of them are worth being mentioned. Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) consider the decision of a ruling elite to increase the political power of non-ruling citizens in order to prevent revolutions. This happens because the elite has no credible tools of commitment for future redistribution. The idea of the model in this paper is close to that of Acemoglu and Robinson (2000). However, the model in this paper analyzes the decision of a ruler in the presence of two groups—non-ruling elite and citizens—and introduces additional political uncertainty in the case of a coup d’état. Acemoglu et al. (2010) analyze the role of a strong military in autocratic regimes. Here the military helps the ruler via repressions to remain in office. However, if the ruler is not able to compensate the military sufficiently, they will stage a coup and replace the ruler. Padró i Miquel (2007) presents a model of an ethnically divided society. The weakly institutionalized succession process allows the ruler to gain support from a considerable part of the population while extracting rents both from his own and other ethnic groups. The model analyzes the use of patronage and the existence of ethnic bias in taxation. The uncertainty about the outcome of succession is driving the results. Hodler (2012) provides a model of the Arab Spring where dictators either belong to the ethnic and/or religious majority or not. He shows that the power of the elite plays an important role as to whether the ruler is able to repress protests and remain in power. Depending on whether the country is oil-rich, dictators may concede power, bribe the population or pay their own group for repressions. This paper combines the theoretical findings from political economics with specific features of SWFs to illustrate how these funds can be used in weakly institutionalized economies to ensure the power of ruling elites. It makes a contribution to the existing literature on SWFs analyzing why so many countries set up SWFs from a positive point of view. The rest is structured as follows. Section 2 provides evidence from Abu Dhabi’s SWFs and the ruling Al Nahyan family to motivate the theory. Section 3 describes the model framework, discusses results and presents some additional anecdotal evidence. Section 4 provides concluding remarks.",12

Historical evidence from U.S. municipalities,May 2016,John A. Dove,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Through the nineteenth century U.S. state and local fiscal policy was a constant ebb and flow of public investment in the economy meant for economic development. At times this led to the rapid accumulation of public debt in order to finance many of these projects (dubbed “internal improvements”). In several instances this accumulation led to default and repudiation after macroeconomic financial crises hit. This pattern was witnessed in the aftermaths of the Panic of 1839, the Panic of 1873, and during Civil War Reconstruction. Specifically, as a result of the Panic of 1839 eight states and one territory defaulted on their debt obligations, with five of those states repudiating all or part of those outstanding debts. A similar situation arose during Civil War Reconstruction when all of the former Confederate states, after having accrued large debts to finance internal improvement projects, also defaulted and repudiated sizeable portions of those debts.Footnote 1 Finally, the Panic of 1873 culminated with nearly twenty percent of all outstanding municipal debt (again largely incurred for the construction of railroads and other internal improvement projects) being defaulted on at some point (Hempel 1964; Hillhouse 1936). However, after each of these episodes numerous state legislatures and state constitutional conventions implemented various constitutional reforms in order to ensure that similar behavior was not pursued in the future. Thus, through the 1840s states passed constitutional amendments that significantly limited or prohibited those governments from issuing debt in the future, limited the ability to raise revenue through early variants of tax and expenditure limits, and limited the ability of states to invest in private companies. This situation also arose during Reconstruction, when a number of former Confederate states also imposed various fiscal restrictions. An unintended side effect of these constraints was that through the 1850s and into the 1870s municipal governments began to accumulate large debts in order to finance these internal improvement projects, especially railroads. However, due to the Panic of 1873 many of these projects were shown to be unprofitable, which left many municipal governments unable to pay their outstanding obligations, forcing them into default and repudiation. Thus, similar restrictions as those that had been placed on state governments were finally also forced on local governments across numerous states. All of these limits were meant to minimize or prevent similar behavior from occurring in the future. Both contemporary accounts of the time and more recent research would suggest that this was the purpose these fiscal constitutions were to serve (Dove 2012, 2014; Thies 2002; Hillhouse 1936; Ratchford 1941).Footnote 2 However, no work has been done to formally evaluate whether these constitutional limitations were successful in preventing future default. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a brief historical account of the development of these constitutional rules, especially those imposed on municipal governments, and to then empirically examine how these fiscal constitutions affected the likelihood that municipal governments would default in the future. This latter work is done by evaluating the period through the Panic of 1893, with default data covering 1890 through 1905 for local and county governments. Importantly, the Panic of 1893 and ensuing depression was an even more severe financial crisis that beset the country than was the Panic of 1873. However, whereas the aftermath of the Panic of 1873 left nearly 20 % of all outstanding municipal debt in default, in the wake of the Panic of 1893 less than 10 % of all outstanding municipal debt met the same fate with no state governments defaulting (Hillhouse 1936; Hempel 1964). Therefore, this period provides an opportunity to see how, if at all, these fiscal constitutions impacted the likelihood that a given municipal government would default. Overall, the results suggest that outright prohibitions on the accumulation of debt significantly decreased the likelihood of default, while procedural safeguards increased that likelihood, though the latter result is not robust. Further, strict tax limits also increased that likelihood whereas hard budget constraints reduced the likelihood of default. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 provides a brief historical account of the development of these fiscal constitutions at the state and local level. This section also evaluates the state and local defaults and repudiations that occurred through the nineteenth century and the possible mechanisms that may have been in place to minimize municipal default during the Panic of 1893 and ensuing depression. Section 4 describes the data and empirical specification employed in order to evaluate how these constraints affected municipal default between 1890 and 1905. Section 5 presents and discusses the results, while Sect. 6 concludes.",16

Another common argument from the literature on political participation maintains that, barring intrinsic interest, rational citizens have no incentive to invest in learning about national issues that they cannot realistically expect influence through their own efforts (Downs 1957; Lupia and McCubbins 1998). As a result, regardless of whether or not these individuals are motivated by self-interest or general social concerns, their inability to influence outcomes means that they do not necessarily have an incentive to seek information about the proposed reform. Although the lack of voter information about and interest in economic reform is uncontroversial, the empirical literature does not consider its implications for understanding the formation of public opinion about reforms. Most studies simply ignore respondents who either have no opinion or declare their indifference to reform by treating them as missing observations, and proceed to explore the determinants of support or opposition against reform. Quantitative studies of public opinion about market reform in Eastern Europe and Latin America (Stokes 1996), electricity privatization in India (Santhakumar 2008), trade liberalization in Latin America (Baker 2003), and reversal of privatization in post-communist countries (Denisova et al. 2012) are just some examples of studies that overlook why and how some people simply do not have an opinion. An important exception is found in Berinsky and Tucker (2006). Analyzing public opinion about economic reform in post-communist Russia, their “major finding is that Russians who fail to answer survey questions tend to be consistently less ‘liberal’ than their counterparts who are able to answer such questions” (Berinsky and Tucker 2006: 73). However, this study does not explicitly address the formation of public opinion. What are the implications of non-response for the study of public opinion about economic reform? In this paper, we argue that researchers need to take the process of opinion formation into consideration. With proper statistical model, responses like “don’t know” or “indifferent” offer important analytical leverage that allows us to explore the formation of opinion (i.e. whether one will have an opinion about the issue at stake) and the direction of opinion (i.e. whether one supports or opposes the issue at stake) at the same time. For evidence, we explore public opinion about the power sector reform in India. The analysis is based on the assumption that the present system of state control is inefficient. Using data from a 2004–2005 survey that covered 13 major states of India (Santhakumar 2008), we evaluate the effects of education and perceived inefficiency of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) on people’s preference toward electricity privatization.Footnote 1 Since the survey was conducted only one or two years after the passage of the Electricity Act in 2003, a major legislation that liberalized power distribution but failed to privatize the entire industry, the timing of the survey is ideal for exploring the formation of public opinion about the topic. Moreover, given that India’s public electricity sector is widely recognized to be highly dysfunctional (Bhattacharyya 2005; Chatterjee 2012), the empirical setting is ideal for assessing our account, which assumes privatization to promise at least some gains, while allowing distributional conflict and political controversy for realism and relevance. To highlight the importance of accounting for opinion formation in theory building, 52 % of the sample have no opinion (33 % say “don’t know” and 18 % report “indifferent”) about electricity reform. We find that both information and perceived inefficiency with the current system mainly promote opinion formation, rather than dictate the direction of opinion, toward power sector privatization. While estimating public support without considering missing responses reveals that more education and dissatisfaction with the public power sector predict support for privatization, both factors in fact play a much more substantial role in predicting the likelihood of holding some kind of an opinion once we account for the process of opinion formation. In our preferred specification, highly educated individuals (an increase of 5.08 years over a mean value of 7.91 years), whom we assume to be more informed about privatization than others, are 7 percentage points more likely to report either “yes” or “no” to reform. Conditional on having an opinion, better educated respondents are only 3.8 percentage points more likely to support reform. Likewise, a negative perception of the SEB’s current performance increases the probability of having an opinion by 18 percentage points, but only raises that of supporting privatization by 7 percentage points. These results have several important implications for the politics of reform. As the amount of information about reform options and perceived inefficiency of the system increases, the number of people with an opinion grows. If these people were initially predisposed against reform, the newly opinionated public might comprise more people who oppose reform, even if education and perceived inefficiency slightly tilt the yes-no balance toward the former. For example, a negative perception of the SEB has a much larger effect on the number of people with an opinion than on the number of people who choose “yes” over “no.” Negative perceptions of the SEB may increase the number of people who actively oppose privatization, perhaps because they worry about negative distributive effects despite overall efficiency gains. The omission of non-responses paints a misleading picture of the true scale and drivers of opposition to economic reform. The lack of information creates a silent public, and additional information makes latent opponents of reform more vocal. Even though information and negative perceptions of efficiency increase support for reform among those who already have an opinion, the size of this effect is much smaller than the size of the effect of these same variables on turning latent opponents into vocal, active participants in the debate. The initially passive and detached population becomes politically active, with opponents dominating the debate due to their higher numbers in the first place. Power sector reform becomes a highly politicized topic among the public. The finding squares nicely with the argument of Drèze and Sen (2002) that education can contribute to civic engagement in India. It is not clear, however, that a more educated and aware population would demand reform. Political mobilization through education also creates new constituencies who vocally oppose reforms, and this effect must be considered in any political economy analysis. Varshney (1998) has argued that reforms in India move forward when they are not politicized, and we have shown that perceptions of inefficiency and general awareness through education tend to make reforms salient to the public. Perceptions of inefficiency and more education may work in tandem to make reform issues more salient for the public, therefore, bring the reform process to a grinding halt. In a country where the public often holds a negative perception of economic reforms (Chhibber and Eldersveld 2000), this kind of provocation of opinion formation would prevent strategies such as “reform by stealth” (Jenkins 1999) from succeeding.",1
17.0,3.0,Economics of Governance,09 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-015-0175-8,Do good institutions improve fiscal transparency?,August 2016,Nicoló Andreula,Alberto Chong,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Despite the worldwide attention that issues related to fiscal transparency have received in recent years, the existing empirical studies on its determinants are still very limited. Whereas scholars have focused on the positive effects of fiscal transparency; such as improved access to international capital markets, improvement in foreign direct investment, prevention of financial crises, and reduced interest rate spreads, not many researchers have studied how such fiscal transparency may be achieved.Footnote 1 As it is often the case, the issue took major relevance after the occurrence of recent dramatic market-shocks, which raised concerns about the need to better understand the determinants of fiscal transparency in order to reduce the probability of similar shocks in the future. In particular, as Hollyer et al. (2011) argue, there has been recent concern about the quality of institutions and the role they play on transparency issues. These researchers ask whether democracies are more transparent than other types of political regimes, as they claim that many people believe the presence of elections alone is not sufficient for a country to be considered democratic. In this context, these researchers argue that transparency must be included as part of the definition of political regime as they are able to demonstrate empirically that democratic regimes are more transparent than others. In this paper we investigate the role of the institutional environment in shaping the informational structure of various national fiscal systems. In particular, we study whether institutional quality may be linked to fiscal transparency (FT). Our approach on the latter is consistent with Kopits and Craig (1998), who identify fiscal transparency as the openness toward the public at large about government structure and functions, fiscal policy intentions, public sector accounts, and projections. Kopits and Craig (1998) explain that fiscal transparency involves ready access to reliable, comprehensive, timely, understandable, and internationally comparable information on government activities. Herewith, the electorate and financial markets can accurately assess the government’s financial position and the true costs and benefits of government activities, including their present and future economic and social implications. Our research is aligned with studies that focus on the relationships between fiscal transparency and fiscal performances and/or other macroeconomic indicators. For instance, Hameed (2005) runs cross-country regressions with 57 observations and concludes that transparency matters for credit rankings, as they are positively correlated. Moreover, countries with a higher fiscal transparency general index have better fiscal discipline. Similarly, Jarmuzek (2006) assesses the role of fiscal transparency in establishing better fiscal discipline. Taking 27 ex-socialist countries, Jarmuzek finds a negative, although weak, relationship between fiscal transparency and debt accumulation. Furthermore, he finds that there is no statistically significant evidence supporting the importance of fiscal transparency in determining fiscal performance, and just marginal when correcting for endogeneity. Other relevant research is Gleich (2003) who shows that budget procedures which reduce collective action problems in Eastern Europe are associated with increased fiscal discipline. Also, Milesi-Ferretti (2004) studies the interactions between fiscal transparency and fiscal rules, focusing on the effects of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union member countries and finds that fiscal transparency shapes fiscal performance, as a highly transparent fiscal context makes politicians implement the necessary practices to actually balance the budget. Similarly, Alt and Lassen (2006) show that fiscal transparency negatively affects public debt and deficits, even after controlling for political variables like common law history, political competition, and presidential system. Ferejohn (1999) models transparency as a constitutional choice of an information structure. At the beginning of every period the incumbent chooses the degree of precision of the signal perceived by the electors (principals), knowing that in most cases this informational accuracy would be directly proportional to the amount of resources that voters would be willing to allocate to politicians. Agents who want to manage a larger amount of public goods will raise fiscal transparency levels in order to be perceived as more trustworthy by voters who will eventually give them more resources. Furthermore, Alt and Lowry (1994) argue that democrats increase transparency to achieve their preferred higher amount of public goods. Alt et al. (2006) focus on the determinants of fiscal transparency by exploring its political and economic causes. They suggest that both politics and fiscal policy outcomes influence transparency levels. We use new data on fiscal transparency for a cross-section of countries that enjoy several advantages. First, the data are from in-depth reports based on a standardized methodology and protocol. Second, this is the first study that has such large country coverage, 82 in total. Third, the fiscal measures have been obtained with the collaboration of government authorities, which make them particularly reliable. In fact, the main contribution of this paper is the provision of a new index of FT constructed by translating the qualitative information recorded in the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) issued by the International Monetary Fund into consistent numerical values. Additionally, we assemble sub-indicators according to the following categories: (i) clarity and assurances of information, roles and responsibility (Quality&Resp), (ii) open budget preparation (BudgPrep), and (iii) public availability of information (InfoAvail). We find that our FT index is highly correlated with institutional measures; however, when disentangling such correlation using principal component analysis (PCA), we find that there is substantive information that is not overlapped. This implies that different aspects of the institutional framework have different association to our disaggregated fiscal transparency measures. In fact, we further pursue the idea that better institutions may yield higher levels of fiscal transparency and find that when using an instrumental variables approach we find that this appears to be the case. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 defines fiscal transparency and reviews the relevant literature, our methodological strategy and presents our dataset, Sect. 3 presents and discusses empirical results and robustness checks, Sect. 4 concludes.",12

Downs (1957) and Black (1958) have shown that if the policy space is one-dimensional then both parties choose the median voter’s “bliss point” as their party platform. Although this theoretical result is a nice justification for a two-party system, we do not observe this outcome in US politics. In the real world, we observe that candidates whose positions are quite far from the median voter’s are quite often elected in party primaries, especially in parties with a strong subgroup with extreme positions. In 2004, moderate Republican senator Arlen Specter faced a tough challenge from the Right in the Republican primary election; but once Specter defeated the challenge by a narrow margin, he was comfortably reelected in the general election with great support from moderate central voters. During his reelection bid in 2006, moderate Democratic senator Joe Lieberman lost the Democratic Party primary election but won the general election as a third-party candidate. These examples show that party primary elections by party members play an important role in determining party candidates. Wittman (1983), Calvert (1985) and Roemer (2001) show that policy divergence can occur if party members are policy motivated and voting outcomes are uncertain (valence models). Although the result that parties’ levels of policy orientation explain the level of equilibrium policy divergence is quite reasonable, one problem still remains. How did each party’s policy orientation evolve? A party’s policy orientation should be determined by its constituents, but who the party’s constituents are is also affected by the two parties’ policy orientation.Footnote 1
 In this paper, we formulate a two-party model in which the party-separating threshold political positions and parties’ policy orientation (party candidates or policies) are endogenously determined. We assume that voters are strategic in choosing their parties, foreseeing their influence on the choice of candidates (party constituency affects the party’s policy orientation). Then, we introduce uncertainty in voting outcomes following Wittman (1983). Specifically, we assume that each candidate has some chance of winning, owing to the uncertainty of the election. As is often seen in the real world, the candidates’ campaign and debate performances can change the voting outcome.Footnote 2 Some voters may prefer the candidate from the opposite party even if their political position is very far from the candidate’s position.Footnote 3 With such uncertainty in the voting outcome, even if an extreme candidate runs as the party candidate, she may win the final election if she happens to be judged much more likable than the moderate candidate, although such an event would occur only with very low probability. Suppose that an extreme candidate is chosen by a party through the influence of a strong, extreme subgroup in that party. Then, the moderate potential supporters of the party are alienated, as the party does not reflect their voice in choosing the party candidate. If they participate in the other party, which has more diverse support groups, they may be able to play a more significant role in choosing that party’s candidate. As a result, the party threshold shifts accordingly, and the more diverse party selects a more moderate candidate, while the party supported by an extreme group selects a more extreme candidate. This is a self-sustaining outcome—an equilibrium. Obviously, the diverse party’s candidate’s political position is closer to the median voter’s position, and she has a higher probability of getting elected. In the above story, one important missing element is how a candidate is elected in a party primary. The mechanism of choosing a primary winner is very important to a complete description of a two-party system with primary elections. We will adopt a bold simplification of how party primaries work in order to concentrate on the voters’ party choice problem: we assume that each party chooses a median-positioned candidate of the party’s constituents. This simplifying assumption, used by Besley and Coate (2003), is useful in illustrating how party orientation (here policy) and party constituents interact.Footnote 4 We also discuss the relaxation of this assumption in the conclusion. Our game goes as follows. In stage 1, voters choose their parties by calculating their expected utility from the final election from joining each party (with small groups of other voters). By the voters’ party choice, the two party candidates are assumed to be selected as the median voter of each party. In stage 2, Nature plays, and the two candidates’ relative likability (valence) is determined randomly. In stage 3, voters cast their ballots for the preferable candidate given the two candidates’ positions and likability. A voter’s party affiliation does not bind her voting behavior, and she votes sincerely. The final voting outcome is the equilibrium outcome of this voting game. Our solution concept, political equilibrium, is a subgame perfect equilibrium, except that we allow for small coalitional deviations instead of each voter’s unilateral deviation in the party-choice stage (stage 1). We will not simply adopt Nash behavior, since we assume that each voter is negligible. In this framework, unilateral deviations cannot affect the parties’ candidate-selection processes, so any partition of voters can be a Nash equilibrium. To avoid this difficulty, we consider small coalitional deviations and define a “political equilibrium” as a partition of voters from which any arbitrarily small coalitional deviations are unprofitable. We will first characterize our political equilibrium, and find that our equilibrium is consistent with voters’ party sorting. Using this property, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a political equilibrium (Theorem 1). Then, we move on to investigate how the party threshold is affected by the distribution of voters over policy space. If a party’s support group is concentrated on the extreme side while the other party’s support group is more spread out, then the party tends to lose the moderates’ support, since moderates tend to choose the more diverse party that makes it easier for voters to have a voice. This effect is illustrated in Example 1 with an asymmetric voter distribution. In an example with a tri-peaked symmetric voter distribution (Example 2: a step function with peaks at the left extreme, the center, and the right extreme), we conduct a comparative static exercise to analyze what happens when voters are more politically divided. When the voter distribution is uniform, there is a unique symmetric equilibrium. However, as the population of the moderate left and right decreases gradually, two other asymmetric equilibria suddenly appear. Such asymmetric equilibria have the feature of having one party composed mostly of extreme voters and the other party composed of the rest of the voters, including the centrist group: the former party chooses an extreme candidate with a low probability of winning (but still a chance of winning if common shock is strongly in his favor), while the latter chooses a moderately oppositely biased candidate with a high chance of winning. Voters who are happy with the extreme candidate despite her low chance of winning continue to support the extremist party. However, another oppositely biased equilibrium is also self-sustainable. Thus, if voters are deeply divided politically, there will be multiple quite asymmetric equilibria.Footnote 5
 Three articles are most closely related to our paper. Feddersen (1992) constructs a model in which voters choose political positions and calls a group of voters who choose the same political position a party. In the sense that voters choose their party strategically, our model is closest to Feddersen (1992), since voters are assumed to be strategic players in his model as well as ours. However, there are also a number of differences between the two approaches. Feddersen’s model is deterministic, allows an arbitrary number of parties, and allows a multidimensional policy space. In contrast, uncertainty plays an essential role in our model, and we restrict our attention to the two-party case on a single-issue space. In our model, a party’s political position (the candidate’s position) is determined by aggregating the party supporters’ political positions (via the party’s median voter’s policy). Extending the Wittman (1983) model, Roemer (2001, Chapter 5) endogenizes the party threshold by assuming that voters sort into parties by comparing their (deterministic) utility levels from two candidates’ policies, which are determined by strategic interactions by the two party-median voters. In our model, voters compare the expected utility levels of joining each party. In this sense, voters in our model are more farsighted and strategic in their party choice, although primary elections are greatly simplified in our model. Our Example 2 will bring out the difference between these two approaches. Gomberg et al. (2004) also consider a two-party model, which endogenizes voters’ party affiliation that determines each party’s candidate’s position. They prove the existence of a strong Nash equilibrium allowing for multidimensional policy space, while assuming that the policy outcome is determined by the two parties’ policy positions weighted by the size of each party’s support group, following the spirit of Alesina and Rosenthal (2000). Our model is a static model, and we do not discuss the causality of events. Fiorina et al. (2011) argue that each party’s elite activists tend to have rather extreme views, and they influence primary election outcomes, resulting in greater polarization of policy. Levendusky (2009) stresses the role that party elites play in sorting voters into the two parties by clarifying each party’s political positions.Footnote 6 Sorting of voters can aggravate the polarization of the party candidates even further. Levendusky (2009) provides empirical evidence that supports his hypothesis. However, it would be very difficult to construct a formal game-theoretical model with many players (party elites, voters, party candidates, etc.) that describes the dynamic evolution of party policies and voter sorting, since we need to specify our model precisely through specific assumptions on how rational party elites and voters are and what information they possess when they choose their actions. The results and predictions will be very sensitive to specific setups and assumptions. In Sect. 2, we present our model. In Sect. 3, we define political equilibrium and investigate its properties. Using these properties, we provide some insights into how the party threshold is affected by the distribution of voters over their political positions. In Sect. 4, we show by two examples when the equilibrium is biased and when there are multiple equilibria. The main observations from the examples are: if one party has a stronger extreme subgroup, then that party loses some of its centrist supporters; and if the voters are more polarized, then there tend to be asymmetric equilibria in which one party consists of mostly extremists while the other party has both centrists and extremists as its supporters. In Sect. 5, we conclude with a brief discussion of how relaxing our assumptions affects our results.",
17.0,4.0,Economics of Governance,03 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-016-0181-5,Policies against human trafficking: the role of religion and political institutions,November 2016,Niklas Potrafke,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The human trafficking problem has worsened in many countries. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) states that “a conservative estimate of the crime puts the number of victims at any one time at 2.5 million...it affects every region of the world and generates tens of billions of dollars in profits for criminals each year.”Footnote 1
 Because human trafficking threatens national security and compromises domestic human rights (Cho and Vadlamannati 2012), anti-trafficking policies are an important instrument in human development policies. To combat human trafficking, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted in the year 2000 the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. Cho et al. (2014) have introduced the novel 3P
Anti-Trafficking Policy Index, which measures to what degree government policies reflect these guidelines. Data is provided for up to 185 countries over the period 2000–2010. Cho et al. (2014) and Cho and Vadlamannati (2012) exploit variance across countries and over time by using panel data to examine whether variables such as income per capita, corruption, rule of law, women’s rights, voting behavior in the UNGA and spatial dependencies influence anti-trafficking policies.Footnote 2 The results show, for example, that democracies and countries that combat corruption have implemented strict anti-trafficking policies. A pertinent question is who the victims and culprits of human trafficking are. The UNODC states that “victims of trafficking can be any age, and any gender. However, a disproportionate number of women are involved in human trafficking both as victims and as culprits.”Footnote 3 Because many of the victims are women and combatting human trafficking reinforces human rights, cultural traits and religion are likely to influence policies against human trafficking. Religion has been shown to influence human development and economic policy-making. Religion influences, for example, gender equality: in the education system and the labor market, discrimination against women is quite prevalent in countries with Muslim majorities. By contrast, discrimination against women is less pronounced in countries with Christian majorities.Footnote 4 I review the empirical evidence on gender discrimination in the next section. With many of the victims being women, policies against human-trafficking may well be regarded as policies corroborating gender equality. Investigating whether types of religion predict policies against human trafficking thus contributes to the literature on religion-induced gender-(in)equality. Religion has also been shown to influence political institutions which, in turn, influence human development and economic policies. Empirical studies examining how religion shapes human development and economic policy-making therefore need to consider feedback effects via political institutions. I expect that anti-trafficking policies are more likely to be present in countries with Christian than with Muslim majorities and that political institutions enhance/mitigate the influence of religion on anti-trafficking policies: countries have more effective anti-trafficking policies when they are democracies. Democratic countries are more likely to implement stricter policies against human trafficking because, for example, democratic countries usually follow international law and citizens in democracies have opportunities to monitor policies the government pursues and whether the policies comply with international treaties. I investigate empirically the role of religion and political institutions on policies against human trafficking as measured by the new 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index and its sub indices on prosecution, protection and prevention policies. As compared to Cho et al. (2014) and Cho and Vadlamannati (2012), I elaborate on how religion is associated with the 3P indices. I do not estimate panel data models but cross-sectional models, because the religion variables do not vary over time. A shortcoming of using cross-sectional data is, of course, to not exploit variation over time. I follow the related empirical literature by considering Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and indigenous religions as the five major religion groups. My main focus is however on the difference between the two largest groups, Islam and Christianity. I elaborate on the types of religion on policies against human trafficking and not religion as such (vis-à-vis atheism). For encompassing surveys on the consequences of religion and religiosity see, for example, Iannaccone (1998).",9

Traditionally, the stable shareholders, such as affiliated firms, banks and insurance companies, held majority of shares in Japanese firms. A distinctive characteristic of such investors has been to develop long term business relationships, i.e., strengthening lending and commercial trade ties with the firm in which they are investing in rather than maximizing returns on their equity investments (Abegglen and Stalk 1985).Footnote 1 These holdings insulate firms from capital market pressures and threats of takeovers (Kester 1991) and provide an opportunity to the stable shareholders to influence corporate strategy in a manner consistent with their objectives (Gedajlovic and Daniel 2002). On the other hand, the primary objective of the market investors, such as foreign corporations, inside investors and private individuals, is to maximize returns on the invested capital. Market investors have an incentive to monitor firms in which they hold shares, reflecting their singular tie to the firm; their monitoring efforts are likely to emphasize corporate profitability (Fukao 1999). Therefore, firm’s performance ought to be sensitive to the block holdings of various classes of investors, because of different objectives and preferences regarding the holdings, and as a result, there should be a systematic relationship between variations in the ownership structure and the firm’s performance. Historically, Japan’s system of corporate governance is tied to a variety of inter-corporate groupings and alliances that dominate the enterprise system. Joint and reciprocal monitoring among business partners, engaged in a multiplicity of business relations, is a distinctive feature of Japan’s system of corporate governance (Roe 1994). Gerlach (1992) describes how these inter-corporate networks transcend formal groupings and pervade much of the Japanese economy. However, in the wake of 1990 bubble burst, a vast list of institutional reforms was introduced for the corporate governance and related mechanisms in the Japanese corporate market. Major steps taken in this regard were: (i) diverting focus to shareholder value maximization, (ii) involvement of outside independent directors in the decisions’ process, (iii) enhancing competition in corporate control market (i.e., activities associated with M&As), (iv) transparency and information disclosure in accounting, financial, and other reporting to investors, and (v) protection of minority shareholders. Prior to these reforms, Japanese firm management was able to pursue its own objectives which were often at variance with shareholder value maximization. Agency costs of this sort were a significant source of economic inefficiency. One of the cornerstones of Japan’s corporate governance reform is the formal acknowledgement by the Japanese government of shareholder value maximization as the primary objective of corporations in their decision-making. Japan’s new company law and other related laws focus on this point. Legal terms for the protection of shareholders’ rights have been clearly set out. The outside independent directors have been involved in the decision making process in order to reduce the agency cost and influence of the insiders to pursue their own strategic objective at the cost of shareholders. If a board is controlled by insiders, which was often the case before the reform, it might be difficult to reduce the agency costs that arise in divergence of the preferences and objectives of the inside management and outsiders, i.e., investors. Competitiveness in the corporate control market was emphasized to substitute the stable shareholders with the market based investors. While Japanese banks played the role as a substitute for the corporate control market, before the reforms they were not able to replicate the benefits of a more competitive market for corporate control. Information disclosure and transparency are the basic prerequisites for efficient functioning of the stock market, allowing investors to evaluate the shares they own. Efficient capital markets also give managers information about the cost of capital which is required for their investment decisions. Efficient stock markets are also essential for developing an active market for corporate control. Japanese bank-based corporate governance mechanisms were insider-oriented and often lacked transparency. Furthermore, under the bank-based corporate governance system of 1970s and 80s, up to 70 % of the listed firms in Japan were owned by financial and other corporate shareholders (Nakamura 2011), who were sympathetic to the incumbent management. Hence, the firm management generally paid little attention to individual and other minority shareholders’ rights. As a consequence of these reforms, the recent empirical evidence from the Japanese corporate control market suggests that the corporate governance is evolving in response to rapid increase in competition in the financial market, changing legal environment and fiscal policies. As a result, the proportion of share and ultimate control held by stable investors is declining and the role of market investors is increasing. As Kikuchi (1999) and Yoshikawa and Phillip (2001) have mentioned that the power of market investors is increasing in Japan, particularly of foreign shareholders.Footnote 2 Foreign and domestic private shareholders are now in a better position than ever before to influence corporate behaviour. Furthermore, the influence of traditional stable shareholders in Japan appears to be shrinking.Footnote 3 At the same time, many contemporary accounts suggest that the relationship between Japanese financial institutions and their client firms have become less relational and more transactional during the past two decades (e.g. Inoue 1999; Yasui 1999).Footnote 4 Moreover, financial market deregulation and the availability of equity and bond financing have lowered the dependence of Japanese firms on banks for financing (Prowse 1996; Yasui 1999). Additionally, tax code and accounting changes have compelled financial and non-financial firms to unwind their equity positions in the affiliated companies (Whittaker and Kurosawa 1998; Fukao 1999; Yasui 1999). These features and trends in the Japanese corporate market suggest that the ownership structure and corporate governance have been evolving in the Japanese corporate market and a new form is emerging. Furthermore, the pressure from capital markets (the rapid increase in M&A’s, in particular) has also played a significant role apparent in the form of a rapid decline in the main bank system and the dissolution of cross shareholding. This pressure has assisted in the restructuring of business organizations’ spheres and capital structure patterns and has contributed to an increase in efficiency and corporate performance of the companies. This is what we intend to empirically evaluate in this study, the aim is to understand the current corporate make-up and performance of the Japanese corporations. Two perspectives of firm performance, i.e., valuation and profitability, and three research questions are focused upon, which are: How does the ownership structure and the change in control influence the firm performance? How does the ownership concentration influence the firm performance? Does the owner’s identity influence the firm performance? In this context, we empirically determine the implications of the ownership structure and control transfers, prompted by the changes in the financial system, the regulatory and the liberalization policies during 1990s, and the pressure from the capital market. To evaluate the impact of the ultimate ownership on the firm performance, a dynamic multivariate analysis has been carried out in order to test the hypothesis of the sensitivity of the firm performance to various stakeholders’ investment objectives. Furthermore, a comparison has been made among private, non-financial and financial institutions’ transfers with regard to the corporate performance within the group of firms that experience change in control. The key contribution of the study lies in the new insights provided by adding a set of formerly unused variables in evaluating the firms’ performance in Japan as well as other countries that are change in ownership and transfer of control to various entities’ variables which gauges the importance of intra-group financial ties and transactional commercial links. Furthermore, we present a systematic explanation of the governance mechanisms in the Japanese capital market that provides an informative contrast to the market based monitoring mechanisms. Two main results emerge from the empirical analysis. First, we find no support for the hypothesis that the overall set of governance structures of the keiretsu firms are more effective at maximizing shareholder wealth than of the market based governance structure. Second, we document significant performance differences among the different types of group member firms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section presents the theoretical background and related literature. Section three deals with the methodological issues, the variables’ construction, and modeling, followed by the empirical results in section four. Section five deals with the various robustness checks of the results and lastly, section six presents the summary and concluding remarks.",12

Cappelen,Tone Ognedal,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is an increasing demand for goods that are produced in a socially responsible way. In many markets, consumers are willing to pay a premium if the producer protects labor rights and the environment beyond what is required by enforced laws and regulations (Bjørner et al. 2004; Rode et al. 2008). This implies that there is a potential for profitable corporate social responsibility. Many consumer products are, however, credence goods, in the sense that it is difficult for consumers to know whether a particular product is being produced in a socially responsible way, even after they have bought the product (Darby and Karni 1973; Dulleck and Kerschbamer 2006). For example, it is inherently difficult for consumers to verify whether or not the clothes they wear or the coffee they drink are produced by employees who are paid well and treated with respect. If consumers cannot distinguish between goods produced in a socially responsible way and goods that are not, socially responsible production is not a profit-maximizing strategy, even when the additional costs are lower than the premium the consumers are willing to pay. In such situations, only firms that are genuinely motivated by social responsibility will choose to produce in a socially responsible way. We shall refer to firms that view concern for socially responsible production as a constraint on their profit maximization as constrained firms; additionally, we shall refer to products that are produced in a socially responsible way as “ethical” products. If constrained firms cannot signal that they produce ethical products, they might not survive in the market, even if they otherwise have lower production costs than some firms that maximize their profit while unconstrained by concern for social responsibility. In other words, there will be too few constrained firms, because they are unable to reap the true value of their products and there will be too many unconstrained firms, because the market price for their products is higher than the true value of their products. Certification may solve this problem, since it helps firms signal that they produce in a socially responsible way. Since certification allows firms that produce ethical products to charge a premium for their products, it helps a greater number of such firms to survive. In recent years, different kinds of ethical certification have become increasingly common. Organizations such as Fair Trade, GoodWeave, Social Accountability International, the Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, C4, and numerous others all provide ethical and environmental certification services. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has played an important role in promoting environmental certification, through the development of the ISO 14,000 family of standards for environmental management and the ISO 26,000 standard for social responsibility. An example of certification for labor rights and worker welfare is the SA 8000, developed by Social Accountability International; it is typically used to certify that corporations comply with national and international labor laws and standards. Our paper examines the effects of improved certification opportunities. We ask whether improved certification opportunities, as a result of reduced certification costs, increase the share of socially responsible firms. We show that increased certification may actually result in a reduced share of socially responsible producers as long as some—but not all—socially responsible firms certify. The intuition behind this result is that certification by some firms reduces the price of uncertified products. This in turn lowers the profitability of the constrained firms that do not certify, implying that some of them will not survive. Thus, certification might crowd out socially responsible production. Furthermore, we show that access to certification may reduce total welfare. Our paper contributes to the literature on credence goods and certification. Several authors have shown, both theoretically and empirically, that certification might increase the market share of socially responsible products and the social welfare (Amacher et al. 2004; Cason and Gangadharan 2002; Costa et al. 2009; Feddersen and Gillian 2001; Hamilton and Zilberman 2006; Teisl et al. 2002). Other papers have shown that certification might have detrimental effects when the certification process is imperfect or when there is imperfect competition (Baland and Duprez 2009; Baksi and Bose 2007; Basu et al. 2006; Bonroy and Constantatos 2008; Dranove and Jin 2010; Dulleck et al. 2011; Mason 2009). The mechanism behind these results is that the certification process could lead to less-productive firms taking a larger share of the market, or that the certification process results in reduced competition. Our paper adds to this literature by documenting an important mechanism through which certification might have adverse effects on socially responsible production, even when the certification process is perfect and when there is perfect competition among the producers. Specifically, we show that certification might result in a reduced share of socially responsible production when some—but not all—constrained firms certify, because the prices in the market for uncertified products will fall. While we focus on how socially responsible production, the mechanism described in our paper also applies to a range of other goods where some desirable characteristics are unobservable for the consumer and where some producers have an intrinsic motivation to produce high-quality products. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2.1–2.3 describe the model in the absence of any certification, and Sect. 2.4 analyzes how access to certification affects the share of socially responsible products. Section 2.5 discusses the welfare effect of access to certification. Section 3 concludes.",5

Hopland,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is a widespread concern that schools and other public buildings are in poor conditions due to insufficient maintenance. Maintenance tends to lose the budgetary battle and may in particular be an easy target when public budgets are to be cut. The popular explanations are many. Shortsighted politicians mainly care about winning the next election and pay too little attention to maintenance activity that may save costs in the long term. Principals and public managers are mainly focused on the services their organizations provide and may not have sufficient competence on how to best maintain buildings. Poor building conditions are likely to have negative consequences for the users of public services. The impact of school facilities on student test scores has received particular attention. As surveyed by Hanushek (1997), the results from the early literature are mixed. A recent contribution by Neilson and Zimmerman (2014) find that school construction projects increase student achievement and house prices. Cellini et al. (2010) also find a positive effect of school construction projects on house prices, while the estimated effect on test scores is generally insignificant. Beyond the effects of larger school construction projects, Hopland and Nyhus (2015) provide evidence that indicators of school facilities and the physical learning environment positively affect student performance. Moreover, Taskinen et al. (1997) and Buckley et al. (2005) find that deferred maintenance and poor building may lead to health issues, turnover, and sick leave that increases labor costs. The findings that school construction projects increase house prices suggest that homeowners value good school facilities, even though the empirical literature is inconclusive on how good facilities directly affect educational outcomes. It is thus a puzzle that school buildings are insufficiently maintained and run down in the first place. This is a highly interesting issue and the research question we address in this paper. More specifically, why do we observe that schools and other public buildings are in good condition in some local governments and in poor condition in others? While Cellini et al. (2010) and Neilson and Zimmerman (2014) investigate the consequences of improved school facilities, we investigate why schools and other public buildings tend to end up in a state where major improvements are needed. A proper understanding of this issue may shed light on how to achieve long-term effects of facility improvements. The conditions of schools and other public buildings are also of concern in Norway. A government commission (NOU 2004) that was appointed to evaluate the facility management in the local public sector concluded that buildings in decay or insufficient maintenance were a substantial problem in two thirds of the local governments. A survey conducted by the commission indicates that political factors are of importance. Nearly half of the local governments responded that low political priority of maintenance was the main cause of buildings in decay. Each of the other alternatives were stated by <15 % of the respondents. None responded that lack of competence on facility management was the main cause. Why is maintenance given too little political priority in order to keep buildings in good condition? In this paper we investigate whether political fragmentation is of importance. The empirical analysis utilizes two unique data sets on building conditions in Norwegian local governments. Both are survey data sets where local governments are asked to rate the conditions of respectively schools and the building mass in general. We are not aware of earlier studies using this type of data. Both data sets document huge variations in building conditions. In a majority of the local governments schools and other buildings are in poor condition, but there is also a sizeable minority with well-maintained buildings. It is a robust finding that a high degree of political fragmentation is associated with poor building conditions, both for schools and the general building mass. We also provide evidence that lack of maintenance is a channel for poor building conditions in local governments with a high degree of political fragmentation. Taken together our interpretation is that local governments with a high degree of political fragmentation are less able to take long run considerations into account, and as a consequence maintenance is given too little priority in the annual budgetary decisions. This finding adds to the empirical literature on political fragmentation that has paid most attention to budgetary variables such as deficit, current expenditures, taxes, and investments. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start out in Sect 2 by discussing related theoretical and empirical literature and our indicator of political fragmentation. Section 3 presents Norwegian institutional details and the two survey data sets on building conditions. The econometric specification is discussed in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 presents the estimation results. In Sect. 6 we investigate whether lack of maintenance is a mechanism underlying the estimated effect of political fragmentation and whether the effect of political fragmentation is robust to the handling of party effects. Finally, Sect. 7 offers some concluding remarks and a brief discussion of policy implications.",12

McCannon,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A substantial literature has developed studying the impact of economic freedom around the world. The catalyst for this research was the development of the Economic Freedom of the World index by Gwartney et al. (1996). They provide a definition of economic freedom. Individuals have economic freedom when property they acquire without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others and they are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others. An index of economic freedom should measure the extent to which rightly acquired property is protected and individuals are engaged in voluntary transactions (p.12). This was followed by state and province-level measurements of economic freedom in the complementary Economic Freedom of North America index by Stansel and McMahon (2013) and, more recently, the Freedom of the 50 States (Ruger and Sorens 2013). The methodology of the former has now been extended to city-level differences in economic freedom by Stansel (2013). The basic premise of the research on economic freedom is that there are government policies that positively impact economic activity, or more specifically, avoid economically-destructive interventions. Numerous studies (to be discussed in the following section), have empirically identified the correlation between economic freedom and other measurements of economic activity. Governments, though, also engage in a substantial amount of non-market, publicly-provided service provision. The question addressed here is whether U.S. states that adopt policies that promote economic freedom are states that, in general, develop and foster efficient, productive institutions. Is there a relationship between good governance regarding economic policy and good governance with non-market production? An important publicly-provided service is the legal system. For state governments it makes up a substantial proportion of public expenditure and it effects the well-being of everyone, whether through being a defendant or victim, benefitting from deterrence, or its effect on public resources. As a representative criminal justice institution, we consider here prosecutor services. We feel this is a particular good bureaucratic office to study. The inputs used and outputs produced are, for the most part, straightforward and measurable. Second, the administration and funding of the offices differ across states and across districts within a state. For example, almost all states use local, popular, partisan elections to select the chief prosecutor. Budgets are often set by local governments (e.g. in New York the county-level legislative boards set the budget using tax revenue). Prosecutors are notorious for the ability to exercise a significant amount of discretion in both office organization and case management.Footnote 1 States differ in laws, sanctions, and restrictions to discretion (e.g. sentencing guidelines). Thus, the state and local government, along with the elected chief of the office, combine to set and distribute the resources of the office to produce convictions. Therefore, we investigate the correlation between economic freedom and effective prosecution to understand whether good governance spills over to all policies or is concentrated in a specific area. To do this, data from the 2330 prosecutor offices in the United States is used to measure productive efficiency. Specifically, a method known as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is common in Operations Research and Industrial Organization, is employed. DEA can be used to, in effect, estimate a Production Possibilities Frontier for an industry and then quantify how close an observation is to the frontier. This generates an efficiency measurement. District-level estimates of productive efficiency are aggregated to state-level measurements. This is then compared to data from the Economic Freedom of North America index. Our results indicate that there is a strong, positive correlation between the two. States with higher levels of economic freedom also have prosecutor offices that more efficiently handle their caseloads. Estimates presented indicate that a one standard deviation increase in a state’s economic freedom index number corresponds to approximately 1/4th of a standard deviation increase in prosecution efficiency.Footnote 2
 A brief background discussion on economic freedom, prosecution, and DEA techniques is given in Sect. 2. Section 3 describes the data used, while Sect. 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.",13

Civil war threatens human rights and welfare and damages economies.Footnote 1
 Since the seminal study of Collier and Hoeffler (1998), many studies have found a negative relationship between per-capita income and the risk of civil war.Footnote 2 In contrast, most empirical studies find no significant relationship between economic inequality and the risk of civil war (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004). However, recent empirical studies cite “within-group” inequality, not overall inequality, as a significant cause of civil war. Using subnational data for sub-Saharan Africa, Østby et al. (2009) find that intra-regional inequality in household assets and education increases the onset of civil conflict. As the failure of negotiations between Israel and Palestine during the 1990s suggests, heterogeneity in ideology among within-group members also affects the likelihood of conflict. Although Israel–Palestine negotiations began with bilateral popular support, the extremist Palestinian faction Hamas hindered them by attacks against Israel (Kydd and Walter 2002). This study presents a bargaining model of civil conflict that illustrates the manner in which within-group heterogeneity hinders peace negotiations and leads to the outbreak of costly conflicts. Our model follows the standard environment in the literature of bargaining models of conflict. If the government and an opposition group initiate civil war, both bear its cost, but the winner deprives the loser of a portion of its resources. The government has little to gain and much to lose from civil war, and it can thus offer the opposition group transfers in order to preclude civil war. If the opposition accepts the government’s offer, war is precluded. As per Fearon (1995), as long as each group is treated as a unitary player, conflict can be precluded through negotiation, because there is no private information, issue indivisibility, or commitment problem. We extend the standard bargaining model of conflict by introducing heterogeneity into the opposition group, and explicitly consider the manner in which conflicting interests among members in the opposing group affect bargaining outcomes.Footnote 3 Income is the opportunity cost of war, and ideology is the payoff from waging war (e.g., antagonism toward the government). Given their heterogeneity, members of the opposition group have different preferences for civil war, and whether the opposition group accepts the government’s offer depends on the distribution of members’ preferences. Therefore, within-group heterogeneity matters with respect to the outbreak of civil conflict. Although many studies treat groups involved in conflict as unitary players, Jackson and Morelli (2007) analyze a situation wherein the net value of conflict for a pivotal decision-maker differs from that for the entire group. In their study, the discrepancy between the pivotal agent’s net value and that of the group is represented as “political bias,” and they show that negotiations cannot forestall conflict if the political bias is large. We present a benchmark model based on an argument similar to that in Jackson and Morelli (2007), to show that extensive within-group income inequality raises the prospect of civil war if the opposition group makes decisions by majority rule. Although our analysis shows the link between within-group heterogeneity and the onset of conflict, the assumption of majority rule is not plausible in the context of civil war. More importantly, although the benchmark model assumes that only pivotal agents affect the outcomes of a peace process—as the failure of Israel–Palestine negotiations indicates—a faction opposed to peace can derail negotiations. In the main part of this paper, we consider the likelihood that negotiations will be unsuccessful when a faction in one of the negotiating parties opposes peace. Specifically, we assume that the probability of negotiations failing will increase continuously as the number of members who reject the government’s offer increases. The greater the number of opponents, the greater their influence is on the peace process. Hence, the probability of civil war increases as their number increases. Under this assumption, we argue that extensive heterogeneity within an opposition group leads to the onset of civil war, via the following mechanism. The net payoff to each member of the opposition from accepting the government’s offer depends on his or her heterogeneous characteristics, and the payoff increases as the amount offered by the government increases. Government can bolster support for peace by increasing the amount of transfer offered, which can in turn reduce the risk of a civil conflict. However, when heterogeneity within the opposition is large, member preferences are dispersed and support for the peace process is less responsive to any change in the proposed transfer. Then, the government’s marginal cost from increasing support for the peace process will increase. In this situation, the government offers the opposition a small transfer, and the equilibrium probability of peace is small.Footnote 4
 This study is inspired by that of Mizuno et al. (2017), and the theoretical mechanism herein is similar to their model. However, the current study addresses a research question that differs entirely from that of Mizuno et al. (2017). Mizuno et al. (2017) analyze relationships among inequality, institutions, and growth in nondemocratic regimes. Specifically, they analyze the decisions of an autocratic ruler who faces a tradeoff between the expropriation of citizens’ wealth and holding on to power. The contribution of this study is that it shows the link between within-group heterogeneity and failed peace negotiations. This study is also related to that of Esteban and Ray (2011), who show that greater inequalities in within-group income are associated with more intense conflicts. In their model, the poor commit their time to conflicts, whereas the rich contribute money. When intra-group income inequality is large, the group’s poorer members face lower opportunity costs by participating in the conflict, and the wealthier members contribute more money to it. However, determining the reasons why the opposing groups undertake costly conflicts exceeds the scope of their analysis. Understanding the reasons for being unable to preclude costly conflict through negotiation is a major issue in the literature; most studies cite private information and commitment problems as factors that underlie failed negotiations (Fearon 1995; Powell 1999, 2002, 2006). The role of transfers (or inclusive policies) in precluding conflict is studied by Azam (1995), Azam and Mesnard (2003), Haimanko et al. (2005), and Reynal-Querol (2005), but these studies do not examine within-group heterogeneity, nor do they undertake analyses on the basis of bargaining models. This paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we provide anecdotal illustrations of peace processes that have collapsed on account of internal opposition. In Sect. 3, we explain our model. In Sect. 4, we consider the case wherein the opposition group’s decision to accept the government’s offer is made by a pivotal internal agent. In Sect. 5, we present the study’s primary contribution. In Sect. 6, we conclude the study.",

Under what conditions is a democratic regime established by the civil society? What is the motive behind a civil-military alliance? The purpose of this paper is to provide a formal game-theoretical model to show the emergence of different political regimes based on different coalition structures. We consider a game among two groups in a civil society that can potentially form two political parties and the military. These two groups differ with regards to their preferences for consumption of public good. For instance, one group prefers investment in cleaner energy and the other prefer more expenditure in national defense.The military in contrast to these two groups has no numerical strength and by itself can never win an election. Despite being outnumbered by these civilian groups, the power of military lies in its combat ability and could potentially be a challenge for others in a conflict. The game occurs in three stages. In the first stage, coalitions are formed sequentially across groups. In the second stage, conflict occurs between coalitions as each coalition formed in the first stage decides whether or not to fight against the other coalitions. The coalition that emerges as a winner in the second stage maximizes the payoff of the coalition in the third stage. The main contribution of the present paper is in constructing a model to illustrate how different political regimes emerge. Furthermore, the present endeavor illustrates real-world examples that can be derived from the model. The following political regimes emerge as a result of political equilibrium in our model: Military Regime: When the military is too strong compared with civil society, an absolutist state is established. If the civil society as a whole is unable to credibly threaten the authoritarian regime, the military has no incentive to form an alliance as dictatorships can be established without it. In this context, the history of democracy in India and Pakistan are contrasted to illustrate the role of the military. Civilian Autocracy: The military is not the only source of power that can undermine competitive politics. A very strong political party can achieve the same end as well. When a particular political group is too strong vis-à-vis others (including the military), a single-group dictatorship is the outcome. The obvious examples are former communist regimes such as the former USSR and China in which the overwhelming power of one party undermines the emergence of competitive politics. Unconstrained Democracy: Democracy is plausible in societies in which the civil society, despite deep schisms within itself, is willing and able to prevent the transgression of its rights by the military. Civil society as a whole needs to be strong enough to resist a military takeover. Examples include the emergence of democracy in England and the United States. Civil-Military Alliance: If a certain segment of the civil society gives allegiance to the armed force, a nondemocratic regime emerges with civil-military collaboration. A civilian group would concede that such collaboration when winning an election seems a less attractive option. In Germany, such alliances were prevalent (Moore 1966). The Grand Alliance: All three groups share the power. The civilian groups alternate via election but since the military till maintains credible threat, part of the revenue is spent on the military. This is a plausible outcome when neither the civilian groups together nor the civil-military alliances can win their battle uncontested. Therefore, sharing the power emerges as the best possible option.",1

Previous studies have shown that transferring resources between agents does not always hurt the donors. For instance, a government intervention through income transfers could correct the market failures associated with imperfect competition and restore Pareto efficiency. Dillén (1995) tackles the issue in a general equilibrium setting, and Thépot (2003) explores the case of a monopoly in which the implementation of a tax subsidy scheme results in welfare improvements to all agents involved. In the Thépot (2003) paper, the transfer mechanism is used as a device to increase the price elasticity of demand, which yields lower prices in the monopoly case. Under certain assumptions, the price reduction compensates for the payment made by contributing consumers, thereby leading to Pareto-improving situations. However, even if his analysis goes beyond the monopoly case, it is always constrained to situations with some degree of market power. In any case, the results of the aforementioned papers are derived by correcting market failures arising in imperfect competition frameworks. Besides, Pareto-improving effects are not surprising when some degree of market power exists because regulations can easily bring forth greater efficiency by moving the equilibrium closer to a competitive situation. The present paper deviates from the previous approach because we examine Pareto-improving income redistributions but in the context of competitive markets. Our analysis is developed for industries that exhibit external economies of scale, implying that the aggregate supply function presents a negative slope in the long run. Using the distinction between internal and external economies of scale introduced by Marshall (1920, p. 221), we recognize external economies when a decline in unit costs arises from an industry expansion without a necessary increase in individual firm sizes. Of course, this is possible because additional firms may enter the market in the long run. Government intervention can reduce the average production cost insofar as it is able to expand industry output, which then reduces the costs of the individual companies operating in the industry. Because of a lower average cost, industry expansion at equilibrium is then associated with a lower price. In this context, if the demand function becomes more elastic, the total amount exchanged in the industry may increase as the equilibrium price declines. Consequently, any policy that increases the elasticity of demand can potentially lead to Pareto-improving situations.Footnote 1
 The alteration of the demand curve can be caused by the introduction of tax-subsidies schemes. For instance, Garcia-del-Barrio (2012) addresses tax-subsidy schemes, income redistribution, and government purchasing commitments in this context. Previously, Glazer and Konrad (1993) show that—under certain conditions—a transfer of income can be Pareto-improving and entail welfare gains to all individuals. However, our approach differs from theirs because our analysis is based on external economies of scale rather than on externalities such as congestion.Footnote 2 Moreover, the originality of the analysis developed in this paper is that it permits the conclusion that self-financing tax subsidy policies can be implemented in a manner that allows them to yield Pareto-improving outcomes. From a theoretical perspective, economists typically acknowledge that external economies of scale are compatible with competitive markets. Chipman (1965, pp. 736–749) offers a general discussion on this issue and Chipman (1970) describes the theoretical debate and explains the differences between internal and external economies of scale in a general equilibrium model with perfect competition. Then, Meade (1952, p. 33) makes clear that perfect competition can prevail under conditions of increasing returns insofar as the economies are external to individual firms. Additionally, some previous studies collect examples of industries with external economies of scale. This feature is commonplace in various types of manufacturing industries but also affects prominent cultural goods markets, including the movie industry.Footnote 3 In this context, our theoretical approach provides a rationale for the existence of certain types of economic policies, such as granting computers to children in India or low-cost access to mobile phone technology in African countries.Footnote 4
 The aim of this paper is to show how tax subsidy schemes can be implemented to enable them to lead to an equilibrium in which all agents enjoy a better welfare situation. To ensure that the redistributive transfer only affects the demand function of the specific industry under examination (rather than the demand elasticities in other markets), we assume that the tax applies to consumption and the subsidy is granted in the form of a voucher.Footnote 5 Our study ultimately advocates that regulation of competitive markets may be profitable in the presence of external economies of scale. In the context of external economies, this paper proposes two different model settings to prove that redistributive income policies can always be designed in competitive industries to lead to Pareto-improving situations. This paper is organized as follows. Having reviewed the literature in the introduction, Sect. 2 develops two alternative model settings. First, Sect. 2.1 examines the case of a linear transfer redistribution similar to the one in Thépot (2003), but that is tailored to account for a competitive framework. Second, Sect. 2.2 describes and analyzes a more plausible implementation of the income redistribution policy. The implications of our results are reported in Sects. 3 and  4 proposes the vaccinations industry as an example to illustrate that the theoretical analysis is relevant to examine existing industries. Finally, Sect. 5 summarizes the main conclusions.",

Specific threats such as public debt and financial crises, terrorist attacks or overwhelming refugee migration are suddenly part of everyday life in countries that were considered safe, and risks that were acknowledged, but not perceived as imminent, now determine high-level office-holders’ daily planning schedule. Many of these risks have a national, if not global, impact. They have to be analyzed precisely before solutions can be discussed, let alone implemented. As it seems, there is a tendency to clutch to democratic values and every suggestion to change a single democratic procedure ever so slightly is perceived as endangering democracy itself. All the more, our times could be bad for comprehensive experiments. Yet, some experimentation might improve the situation—that is what we want to suggest. In uncertain times, it is very important that society backs its government’s policy. A simple way to achieve this is to implement direct democracy: as the voters decide on every issue themselves, they will at least be able to cast their vote on any important decision. If the decision taken corresponds to their wish, they will bear its consequences more willingly, knowing it was their own decision. If they were overruled, they will still know that they have expressed their will directly and that they might be in the majority next time. And if the minority was large, the implementation of the decision might even take that into account and make allowances for this minority. However, direct democracy has its disadvantages: the decision-making process generates significant costs and can delay decision-taking. What is more, the office-holders are fettered by the citizens’ voting decisions and might perceive themselves as mere executors of the public’s will although they are responsible for the government’s policy. And politicians and parties might submit an issue to voting for reasons other than decision-making. Too many or unnecessary decision-taking procedures might discourage many citizens from voting and may generate inconsistencies among legal rules. Yet, the general feeling among the citizens is that by awarding each citizen the same share of decision power, direct democracy fosters a sense of collective responsibility. In representative democracies, things seem to be simple: the voters can only elect the decision-makers and they waive their decision power to the office-holders between elections. Of course, they have the power to express disapproval with a certain policy by deselecting the corresponding party or office-holder, but this decision power is only awarded to them at elections, i.e. at long intervals, and it concerns persons or parties, not issues. Of course, every candidate advertises a policy program, and his actions in office are often quite predictable, as most of the issues arising during the coming office term can be foreseen. Yet, in troubled times, in particular, office-holders might face entirely new situations entailing unheard-of decisions. If decision-makers have to venture off the beaten track, how could they retain the society’s trust and support? This is a difficulty that is typical for representative democracies: although—or because—office-holders have more elbow-room than in direct democracy, they also incur a higher risk of losing the voters’ endorsement as soon as they have to take an important decision, all the more if it arises unexpectedly, if it is hard to justify—at short notice, at least—, and if its consequences are unforeseeable. While it might be true that direct democracy bridles office-holders, representative democracy makes them walk alone. Thus, it might be a good idea to combine the two democratic systems in a judicious way by keeping the advantages and shedding the disadvantages of each, as soon as an important decision is at hand. To achieve this, we suggest to experiment with a new institution which we call “Co-voting”. It is a new decision-making procedure that requires the selection of so-called “Vote-holders”. But let us first examine the wish list of society and government.",4

To a lesser extent, it has also been shown that having more senators or representatives in the majority is associated with more federal expenditure per capita. However, studies have not addressed how the payoff from these political relationships are influenced by the broader political environment. We extend this literature by examining how the political relationships that have traditionally been recognized as important for distributive policy are influenced by political polarization within Congress and political alignment between the president and Congress and between the Senate and House of Representatives. The topic of political polarization has received much attention over the last decade. Recent discussions have included the relationship between political polarization and income inequality (Bonica et al. 2013) and how political polarization affects media bias (Bernhardt et al. 2008) and campaign contributions (Bonica et al. 2014). However, one issue that has not been explored is how polarization might influence distributive politics. The degree of polarization between the parties in the US Congress shapes the environment in which distributive policy will be made and a political majority may very well choose to exploit its advantage in different ways depending upon the level of polarization. In other words, the advantage a state might receive from having more representatives in the majority could be conditional upon the degree of political polarization. These ideas are tested using US federal budget and political representation data for the period 1983–2010. Our findings indicate that having more senators in the majority allows a state to secure a larger share of federal grant spending per capita when Senate-level political polarization is relatively low. As polarization increases and political differences between the two parties widen, the benefit of having more senators in the majority diminishes. This finding lends support to the idea that during periods of low political polarization, when senators in opposing parties have closer ideological positions, members of the majority might feel more susceptible to challengers. Thus, a larger share of federal spending would be directed to these states in order to keep them in the majority. However, during periods of high political polarization, more senate seats may be viewed as safe, giving the majority party less incentive to direct spending to these states. This result can be explained by recent theoretical contributions to the literature on legislative competition, in particular, those by Krasa and Polborn (2015) and Polborn and Synder (2017). In these models, legislators seek reelection by competing for the votes of voters who care not only about the legislator’s ability to satisfy the policy preferences of the district’s median voter, but also about the policy preferences of the median national party member. If voters place a high weight on a legislator’s party label, then certain districts or states can become safe for a party.Footnote 1
\(^{,}\)
Footnote 2 In particular, Polborn and Synder (2017) also assume that voters care about their legislator’s valence, which can be thought of as the legislator’s ability to secure funding for the district. Their result shows an inverse relationship between the importance placed on legislators’ valence and political polarization. However, if the weight placed on candidate valence is higher when polarization is lower, then this could explain why majority delegations feel compelled to secure more spending during periods of low polarization. Overall, these findings provide evidence that political polarization at the federal level affects the politics of distributive spending. In Sect. 2 the literature on the political determinants of federal expenditure to the states is reviewed. We present and discuss the hypotheses tested in this paper in Sect. 3 and discuss the data in Sect. 4. Section 5 outlines the empirical model, presents the results, and conducts robustness checks. Section 6 discusses the results and concludes.",3

Evidence from evolutionary biology departments is that hiring a star has a large positive impact, particularly on the quality of subsequent hires (Agrawal et al. 2014). Agrawal et al. cite Lucas (1988) on the importance of getting good quality colleagues: “Certainly in our profession, the benefits of colleagues from whom we hope to learn are tangible enough to lead us to spend a considerable fraction of our time fighting over who they shall be, and another fraction travelling to talk with those we wish we could have as colleagues...”Footnote 1
 James Heckman had this observation on hiring economists at the University of Chicago: “...mistakes were made, but if anything over most of the period mistakes were in NOT appointing people, not in appointing people.”Footnote 2
 Heckman’s comment alludes to the two types of errors in hiring, tenuring, and promotions: accepting a bad candidate, call it an AB, and rejecting a good candidate, call it an RG. Heckman suggests that his department made more RGs than ABs in hiring. Particularly in tenure decisions, one might expect most departments to care more about ABs than RGs. Although departments do not wish to fail to tenure a star, failure to tenure a good candidate can be rectified by hiring and tenuring another good person in the future. Tenuring a bad candidate is more costly. A scarce faculty slot has been filled with someone who may stay for a long time.Footnote 3
 A recent study (McPherson 2012) ranked U.S. economics departments. I consider universities with the top seventy-five economics departments.Footnote 4 For all but one university (Cal Tech, ranked number forty-one), I was able to determine if a committee outside the department made recommendations on candidates for tenure and promotion.Footnote 5 The University Chicago (number two) does not have an outside committee. At NYU (number six), a dean may choose either an outside committee, or the dean may request additional outside letters.Footnote 6 All of the other seventy-two universities of the top seventy-five for which I have data have an outside committee. 
Sah and Stiglitz (1986, 1988) consider the optimal structure of an organization in which one must determine which projects to accept. They consider a flat structure (what they call a polyarchy) with one evaluator, and a hierarchy with two evaluators. In the former case, a single evaluator decides whether to accept a project. In the latter case, both evaluators must approve the project if it is to proceed. Projects are either good or bad. Evaluators are equally talented, have the same probability of accepting a bad project as they do of rejecting a good project, are independent, and are unbiased. 
Sah and Stiglitz (1986) find that a flat structure selects a larger number of projects than does a hierarchy. Thus, a flat structure accepts more bad projects and rejects fewer good projects than a hierarchy. Lazear and Gibbs (2009) introduce the possibility of something in between a flat structure and a hierarchy, what they call a second opinion structure. However, the basic points remain unchanged: an organization trades off the two types of errors (Lazear 1995), and, supposedly, the closer the organization is to a flat structure (resp., a hierarchy), the more bad projects that are accepted (resp., the more good projects that are rejected). My intention is to analyze the optimal structure of evaluations in universities. I wish to explain why having a committee outside a department recommend candidates, in addition to a department committee, is the preferred choice of a wide range of U.S. universities. The previous literatureFootnote 7 focuses on the tradeoffs between errors, and suggests that universities that fear promoting and tenuring bad candidates more than they fear rejecting good candidates would have both department and outside promotion and tenure committees. I focus on which structure has the lowest expected loss, and demonstrate that a higher cost of promoting bad candidates versus rejecting good candidates is neither necessary nor sufficient for universities to choose a hierarchy. The relative accuracy of department and outside committees, and the likelihood an administration will intervene with split committee recommendations are critical variables in determining the optimal structure for evaluation. There are several features of academic evaluation that may differ from project or applicant evaluation in a firm. These features, discussed in more detail in Sect. 3, are the following. Faculty committees do not decide whether a candidate receives promotion or tenure. Rather, they recommend candidates. Senior administrators (provosts, chancellors, and presidents) have the final decision.Footnote 8 Also, faculty committees do not have equal ability. Finally, an outside committee generally sees the recommendations of a department committee, so the former’s recommendation may not be independent. Introducing an administrator who makes the ultimate personnel decision leads to the possibility of reversing the previous conclusions regarding which structure leads to the most errors of either type. Also, depending on which committee more accurately judges candidate ability, one structure may involve fewer errors of either type. Finally, even if, as suggested above, a university fears ABs more than RGs, and one structure has fewer ABs, that is not necessarily the structure that has the lowest expected loss to the university from both types of errors. Although my intention is to analyze how I believe promotion and tenure committees and administrators behave, my results also can be used for normative analysis of promotion and tenure. Lazear (1995) considered the problem of positive analysis being prescriptive: “A good positive theory is a description of what is, and this precludes a role for those who want to teach it to others as a behavior ideal...Alternatively, we can argue that businesses do not behave according to our models but should...The answer lies in the middle ground. While economics may do very well at explaining most of what goes on in the world, some economic agents may not behave as they should.”Footnote 9
 If, as Lazear suggested, profit-maximizing firms may benefit from some positive economic analysis, it is possible that some non-profit-maximizing universities may not have an optimal structure for promotion and tenure. In this paper, possible strategic behavior by evaluators is mostly ignored. I assume that the recommending committees vote truthfully. I believe that the committees involved in promotion and tenure decisions have the same objective: to promote and tenure good candidates. There seems to be little reason for committees to behave strategically. As argued by Carmichael (1988, 2001), one role of tenure is to induce honest evaluations by faculty. This issue is discussed in more detail in Sect. 9.",3

The founding father of economics, Adam Smith, considered state government in being responsible for performing three duties: national defense, provision of public goods, and civil justice. Recently, a burgeoning literature has demonstrated that self-governance can provide socially cooperative behavior in small and socially homogenous population (Leeson 2009, 2010; Skarbek 2011, 2012, 2014; Powell and Stringham 2009). Studying self-governance in road racing is a way to further our understanding of the economics of governance in sports. In the United States the number of running event participants and finishers reached 54.2 million and 19.1 million, respectively, in 2013.Footnote 1 We examine how self-governance reduces cheating in road racing. Road races differ in their methods of timing. Finishing times can be either electronically-scored or self-reported. Rational choice theory predicts rampant cheating if external monitoring is absent and the benefit of cheating is large relative to the cost (Mazar et al. 2008; Szymanski 2003; Becker 1968).Footnote 2 Moreover, the economics literature demonstrates that people have incentives to cheat in contests when rewards depend on relative performance (Szymanski 2003; Jacob and Levitt 2003; Duggan and Levitt 2002). This paper contributes to the literature on self-governance and the literature on the economics of governance in sports. Very few studies investigate informal governance in sports (Leeson et al. 2012; Fink and Smith 2012; Bird and Wagner 1997). Fewer studies examine the effectiveness of governance in individual sports (Duggan and Levitt 2002). The burgeoning literatureFootnote 3 demonstrates that self-governance can ensure socially cooperative behavior in small and socially homogenous population through repeated interactions which Smith ([1766] 1982: 538) called “the discipline of continuous dealings” (Leeson 2014a; Greif 1993, 1989; Tullock 1985). The literature mainly draws on evidence from historical analysis or experimental studies (Skarbek 2010, 2011, 2012; Leeson 2007b, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014b; Powell and Wilson 2008). In addition, this paper contributes to the literature on corruption in sports (Borghesi 2015; Wolfers 2006). We examine a role of self-governance rather than the structure of the sporting event in eliminating corruption in sports (Jetter and Walker 2017; Zitzewitz 2012). We study how the operation of implicit contract, the effectiveness of internal information flow, and the presence of the premium between honest behavior and cheating facilitate the reputation mechanism to decrease corruption in sports. To examine the economics of self-governance, we use a sample of 5 K (3.1 mile) road races held in 2013 in the New Orleans metro area. We argue that frequent race finishers and club members face higher costs when they are caught cheating. By contrast, infrequent race finishers and non-members have higher incentives to cheat because the magnitude of punishment inflicted on them is much lower. By estimating a pooled ordinary least squares model with monthly fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered by each race, we find that changing the method of timing from electronic to self-reported reduces finishing time by the astonishing 3.8 min, indicating that cheating is occurring. We also examine whether a low-ability runner prefers the self-reported method of timing or not. We find that preference for method of timing is independent of a runner’s gender or the club membership. Finally, we find that the reputational mechanism reduces cheating but the magnitude of this effect is different for a member of the New Orleans Track Club and a frequent race finisher. The club membership reduces cheating in half. For a recurrent race finisher, each additional race reduces cheating by 36.5 s. Moreover, our model estimates that a runner who completes at least one-third of the running season runs slower in self-reported race than in electronically-scored race. Our results underestimate the reputational effect of the club membership because data on informal running clubs are unavailable.Footnote 4
 This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses economics of self-governance and cheating in road racing. Section 3 presents our data set and empirical findings. Section 4 contains the concluding remarks.",

Its continuing existence is maintained through the use of force, threats, monopoly control, and/or the corruption of public officials” (Albanese 2015). Many countries are plagued by criminal organizations, such as the Yakuza in Japan (Hill 2003), ‘La Cosa Nostra’ in Sicily (Gambetta 1993), the Russian Mafia (Varese 2011), and the drug cartels in Colombia (Levitt and Rubio 2005). The absence of effective and formal institutions that guarantee property rights and contract enforcement has been identified as the key factor in the rise of organized crime (Gambetta 1993; Bandiera 2003; Varese 2011; Konrad and Skaperdas 2012). Van Dijk (2007) shows that organized crime is more prevalent in countries where the rule of law is less well-assured. In fact, if the market is poorly regulated and the public sector is unable or unwilling to protect the market, the organized crime groups compete as alternative or parallel institutions to it. Thus, the decline of organized crime mainly occurs where the anti-crime legislations are strongly applied and where there is an increasing mobilisation of civil society to replace the values of the organized crime with those of legality and respect for the rule of law (Paoli and Varese 2014). Cayli (2013) represents this mobilisation as a process that transforms the society through educational practices directed to promote a strong anti-mafia culture. Furthermore, since various empirical studies confirm an inverse relationship between education and crime (Lochner and Moretti 2004; Buonanno et al. 2009), the government expenditure for education may be an important policy instrument to create a culture of legality. However, we have to take into account that some components of public spending may feed into criminal organizations; in fact, various studies report a positive relationship between some components of the government expenditure and organized crime (Caruso 2009; Gennaioli and Onorato 2010; Neanidis and Rana 2014; Barone and Narciso 2015). In this context, as the literature reports mixed results on the relationship between organized crime and government expenditure, a relevant policy question arises: what are effectively the components of public spending that create opportunities for organized crime? This paper investigates empirically this question using the panel data method for the EU Member States over the period 2009–2014. The results select the components of public spending that have a decreasing effect on organized crime, and those components that create opportunities for organized crime, discussing also the role of government efficiency. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses methodology and data. Section 3 reports the results. Section 4 provides robustness checks. Section 5 discusses the role of government efficiency. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",4
19.0,2.0,Economics of Governance,26 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-018-0202-7,"The plough, gender roles, and corruption",May 2018,Gautam Hazarika,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cross-national empirical studies of corruption using ordinary least squares (OLS) often find significant correlation between indices of corruption and women’s participation in the labor force and politics. Nations in which women play a greater role in economic and public life are found to suffer less corruption. A causal relationship, that the greater participation of women in the labor force and politics reduces national corruption, has been inferred. This inference has been controversial in that, first, it is possible unobserved national attributes affect both corruption and women’s participation in the labor force and politics, so that the observed correlation between gender and corruption is spurious, and, second, that corruption may obstruct women’s participation in the labor force and politics, so that there is reverse causality. Instrumental-variables (IV) estimation might have long settled the controversy but for the difficulty of finding credible instruments. This paper argues that a valid instrument may be found in historical geography. A recent study by Alesina et al. (2013) uncovers support for Boserup’s (1970) hypothesis that the ancient adoption of the plough, a heavy implement better suited to use by men, led to a gendered division of labor by which women made their economic contributions from home, and that this gave rise to persistent cultural norms prescribing domesticity in women. Alesina et al. (2013) find that countries in which a greater proportion of the population is descended from ethnic groups who adopted the plough continue to see lower women’s participation in the labor force and politics. This suggests that the geographical suitability of national ancestral lands to crops benefited by the use of the plough is a potential instrument for women’s participation in economic and public life. Its use, it is demonstrated, yields a much weaker and statistically insignificant relationship between gender and corruption. The paper concludes that OLS estimates of the effects of gender upon corruption are biased. Swamy et al. (2001) first discovered that countries in which women make up larger shares of parliament, ministers, and the labor force are perceived to suffer less corruption. Soon after, Dollar et al. (2001) found that perceived corruption is negatively related to the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women. A dissenting opinion was not long in coming. Sung (2003) countered that the observed correlation between gender and corruption was spurious in being caused by the correlation between a third factor, namely, liberal democracy, and each of gender and corruption. While Swamy et al. (2001) controlled for national political freedoms and Dollar et al. (2001) for civil liberties, these measured liberal democracy inadequately, argued Sung (2003). In other words, the regression errors in the analyses by Swamy et al. (2001) and Dollar et al. (2001) included unmeasured aspects of liberal democracy correlated with women’s empowerment, leading to bias in OLS estimates of the effects of gender upon corruption. Sung demonstrated that once liberal democracy is extensively controlled for, women’s representation in ministerial cabinets, sub-ministerial officialdom, and parliament are reduced to statistically insignificant correlates of corruption. Correlation between the regression error and measures of women’s participation in the labor force and politics may also result from reverse causality or simultaneity. Bjarnegard (2013) argues that corruption within political parties, consisting of ‘clientelism’, the exchange of personal favors for political support, is an impediment to women’s participation in politics. Such corruption relies on networks, access to which requires a type of social capital termed ‘homosocial’ capital, built on relationships between men. It is naturally difficult for female political aspirants to break into these masculine networks. Besides, as noted by Frank et al. (2011), corruption may hamper legal institutions’ ability to protect women against discrimination in the labor market and politics. Cross-country OLS estimates of the effects of gender upon corruption are also cast into doubt by ambiguous experimental and microeconometric evidence. Frank’s, Lambsdorff’s, and Boehm’s (2011) survey of laboratory experiments on gender and corruption infers that ‘women are not necessarily more intrinsically honest or averse to corruption than men’ (p. 68). A similar survey by Chaudhuri (2012) finds that ‘the evidence for greater incorruptibility on the part of women comes primarily from developed nations’ with no ‘strong differences in developing countries where the problem of corruption is far more endemic’ (p. 42). As regards microeconometric evidence, Vijaylakshmi (2007) finds ‘no significant gender difference in attitudes towards rent-seeking or in actual levels of corruption between male and female representatives’ (p. 1262) in Indian local government, whereas Brollo and Troiano (2016), who examine differences in incidents of administrative irregularity between Brazilian municipalities governed by male and female mayors, each of whom won election very narrowly to a candidate of the opposite sex, find that such incidents are less frequent when mayors are women. There are two approaches to addressing the endogeneity of measures of women’s participation in economic and public life in a regression in which a gauge of corruption is the dependent variable. If the endogeneity is due to inclusion in the regression error of unobserved national attributes correlated with women’s influence in the economy and politics, these might be treated as country fixed-effects provided a time series of data were available. This is the tactic of Debski and Jetter (2015). The authors consider values of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index for the years 1998–2011 to constitute a time series. By their country fixed effects model, greater participation by women in economic and public life is not associated with perceptions of less corruption. This finding might have been a valuable contribution to the literature but for the fact that values of the Corruption Perception Index aren’t intertemporally comparable. Transparency International warns that ‘CPI scores before 2012 are not comparable across time’.Footnote 1 Furthermore, even if CPI scores before 2012 were intertemporally comparable, fixed effects estimation wouldn’t solve the problem of reverse causality. Instrumental-variables estimation is the other approach to addressing the potential endogeneity of measures of women’s influence in the economy and politics, one that rectifies bias from both the omission of unobserved country-specific effects and reverse-causality or simultaneity. A valid instrument must be uncorrelated with unobserved influences upon corruption, and correlated with women’s participation in economic and public life, without being a direct influence on corruption. There is to date only one published account, by Chen (2013), of IV estimation of the effects of gender upon corruption. There are, broadly, two parliamentary electoral systems in the world’s democracies: majoritarian representation and proportional representation. In the majoritarian system, there is only one parliamentary seat per district. Hence, each political party fields but one candidate per district, and the candidate who wins the most votes is elected to parliament. On the other hand, there are multiple parliamentary seats per district in the proportional system. The proportion of these that a party wins is equal to the share of total votes cast in its favor. For example, a party winning 40% of total votes in a 10-seat district will have gained four of these 10 seats. Chen (2013) argues that political parties are likelier to field female candidates when the system of representation is proportional. She reasons that, first, political parties, long dominated by men, will tend to field male candidates when electoral rules permit but one candidate per district, and, second, that parties are likelier to include women in their field of candidates in multi-seat districts in order to better attract female voters. Besides, as argued by Iversen and Rosenbluth (2010), candidates in majoritarian systems must commit to investing long years in the cultivation of constituents and other politicians, a commitment that women, traditionally drawn to careers that are flexible and accommodating of domestic interruption, have found difficult to make. Chen (2013) demonstrates that the proportion of women in parliament is significantly lower in democracies with majoritarian representation. She proceeds to use an indicator of this form of representation, together with an indicator of the institution of gender quotas in democracies with proportional representation, as instruments for the share of parliamentary seats held by women in a regression in which Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index is the dependent variable. This strategy yields the finding that women’s participation in politics significantly reduces corruption. However, it is uncertain that Chen’s (2013) identifying instruments meet the criterion for valid instruments that they be uncorrelated with the regression error. Proportional representation was devised as a solution to the particular weakness of the majoritarian system that it is possible for the victor in a multi-party race to have won a minority of the vote, that is, possible for parliament to be unrepresentative of the full diversity of national political opinion. It might be argued that a nation that recognizes this shortcoming and acts to remedy it by adopting proportional representation likely possesses (unobserved) progressive institutions and attitudes opposed to corruption. After all, proportional representation is the dominant electoral system of the liberal democracies of Western Europe famed for their good governance. This study too employs IV estimation to address the potential endogeneity of measures of women’s participation in economic and public life, but its choice of instrument, based on nations’ ancestral geography, is more easily defended. Whereas a country’s electoral system was recently chosen by its polity, there is nothing currently discretionary about its ancestral geography. The current progressive institutions and attitudes that cause societies to both pursue gender equality and reject corruption can have no influence upon these societies’ historical geography for the reason that the present cannot affect the past. In other words, ancestral geography is arguably a historical accident. While the past may affect the present, that is, it is possible ancestral geography played a part in the rise of progressive institutions and attitudes, this might be controlled for by inclusion in the IV regression of measures of current and ancestral economic and political development. The particular feature of ancestral geography made use of is the suitability of nations’ ancestral lands to crops benefited by the use of the plough, that is, ‘plough-positive’ crops in the terminology of Pryor (1985). Boserup (1970) proposed that the adoption of the plough in antiquity may have given rise to cultural norms prescribing domesticity in women that persist to this day. The plough, a heavy implement drawn by powerful draught animals difficult to control, is better suited to use by men. So its adoption may have led to a gendered division of labor by which women made their economic contributions from home. Perhaps plough societies gradually came to believe that women’s proper place was the home. Indeed, Alesina et al. (2013) find that there is less female labor force participation, women’s ownership of businesses, and women’s representation in parliament in countries in which a greater proportion of the population traces its ancestry to ethnic groups that took up the plough. Since the plough was likelier to have been adopted in regions better suited to ‘plough-positive’ crops, this ecological suitability is a potential instrument for women’s participation in economic and public life. Its use is found to greatly weaken the relationship between gender and corruption. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains Boserup’s (1970) thesis of a connection between the ancient adoption of the plough and modern gender roles, and describes its testing by Alesina et al. (2013), with a view to establishing the plausibility of this study’s choice of instrument. Section 3 describes the data and presents estimates, both OLS and IV, of the effects of gender upon corruption towards demonstrating that OLS estimates are biased. Also presented are time-series fixed-effects estimates that too demonstrate bias in OLS estimates. Section 4 summarizes the study’s findings and presents its conclusions.",4

This issue is particularly relevant in natural resource-rich countries in the developing world, which possess more than half of the world’s proven oil reserves. Leaders in these countries have been able to hold on to power for extended stretches of time by using a combination of redistribution and repression (Ross 2001, 2008; Anyanwu and Erhijakpor 2013; Boucekkine et al. 2014; Matsen et al. 2016). Yet, an ongoing debate in the economic resource curse literature concerns the consequences of rent capture due to oil endowments or other types of institutional characteristics, for income in the long run. Some recent contributions, such as that of Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2008), Alexeev and Conrad (2009) and Smith (2015), find a positive linkage between natural resources and development, thus discrediting the seminal finding of Sachs and Warner (1995).Footnote 1 Besides, the debate on the economic consequences of institutions encompasses arguments on both sides with some authors arguing that this effect become weak once the specific conditions of countries are controlled for (Rodrik et al. 2004; Acemoglu et al. 2008, 2009). In this paper, I corroborate these recent findings by developing a theoretical mechanism of the potentially favourable effect of a greater ability to capture rents on investment and capital accumulation. An interpretation of this rent-seeking ability is the consequence of oil or other natural resources, or a weaker institutional environment characterised by an inefficient judiciary system incapable of stopping embezzlement by the political actors. I construct a discrete-time growth model with successive generations of agents representing competing political or ethnic factions. These clans enjoy current consumption and transfers to the next generation of their kinship, and they allocate their time between productive or appropriative activities. In this model, the exerted political efforts determine the proportion of de facto power of each clan, which subsequently sets the fraction of a common output available for their respective consumption. I use the concept of influence, or de facto power, to control resources for patronage and clientelism. De facto power, in opposition to de jure power, is what happens in practice or actuality, but is not officially established.Footnote 2
 First, I characterise the equilibrium of this model and demonstrate its uniqueness, and then, I show that the steady state of the model exists and is unique. Next, I study the effect of appropriative competition intensity on long-run income in this context where, apart from the obvious damaging effects due to conflicts and rent-seeking, I reveal a novel mechanism operating through the configuration of de facto power and the ensuing investment share in GDP. When de facto power is concentrated in the hands of a few dominant groups, their political efforts and power shares are boosted by a greater ease to divert resources, compared to smaller groups. There are negative externalities in this strategic common-pool framework where the consumption of one clan reduces availability for the others. Because the groups contributing to investment are the most influential, an increase in appropriative competition intensity could reduce these negative externalities by further expanding their influence, which in turn may spur investment in some cases. To assess the importance of this mechanism, I calibrate the steady state for a global sample of 93 ethnically-divided countries using data on real GDP per capita and investment from the Penn World Tables version 9.0 (Feenstra et al. 2015), and politically relevant ethnic groups from the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) database (Vogt et al. 2015). Using the calibrated parameters, I show numerically that, depending on the value of the capital share parameter, the positive impulse due to power concentration can conceivably dominate the slowdown caused by rent-seeking. This result is important considering the Lipset modernisation hypothesis, which affirms that societies that become richer tend to democratise. Compared with a power-sharing setting, a less democratic and more centralised regime could more easily coerce society into productive investments at the expense of short-sighted consumption. With long-term prospects, this ultimately might lead to a democratic transition beneficial to all strands of the population (Rao 1984; Besley and Kudamatsu 2007; Amegashie 2008). This paper relates to the literature on the economic consequences of corruption and rent-seeking.Footnote 3 Some of these contributions explicitly address resource windfalls (Collier 2010a; Caselli and Tesei 2016; Robinson et al. 2006; Anyanwu and Erhijakpor 2013; Matsen et al. 2016; Caselli and Tesei 2016). Such models study the negative repercussions in situations where adversaries compete for a prize or a common asset by engaging in unproductive appropriative behaviours. The contest success function is a modelling tool frequently used where the effort of a side increases its probability to win the prize. Here, I take the stance to investigate a conflict between politically organised ethnic groups.Footnote 4 Because of that, a special feature of the model of this paper is to allow for more than two groups in the contest. Another particularity is the proportional distribution of the rents. This essential assumption stems from the logic of coalition formation in weak states and the concept of neopatrimonialism.Footnote 5 Furthermore, the EPR data used here reflect the politically salient ethnic divisions, an element well in line with the logic of the model. The literature on ethnic diversity and conflict incidence underpins the modelling choices of this paper (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Cederman et al. 2009). In particular, some recent studies have demonstrated that natural resources cause conflicts at the local level (Caselli et al. 2015; Morelli and Rohner 2015; Berman et al. 2017). I interpret increases in political efforts in the model by these violent actions aiming at capturing resources. For instance, armed groups could use violence to control zones crossed by major pipelines to secure the revenues accruing from them. Alternatively, in a weak institutional context, these political efforts could symbolise political activism to gain important positions in the public sphere or attempts to control the judiciary system with bribes and threats. This paper is related to the institutional approach to economic development which is concerned with the fundamental causes of growth.Footnote 6 Many authors note that insecure property rights reduce prosperity through a negative effect on private investment (Rao 1984; Acemoglu and Robinson 2010; Besley and Ghatak 2010). By examining the evolution of de facto power and investment, it also relates to the topic of the economic implications of political transitions (Tavares and Wacziarg 2001).",1

Desierto,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"When the term ‘resource curse’ was first coined by Auty (1993), it referred to the apparent negative association between natural resources and economic growth. Sachs and Warner (1995) were among the first who tested and verified this association using cross-country data. This has since spawned a vast empirical literature that have employed various statistical techniques to macro and micro-level data to establish or refute any causal link between proxies for natural resources and economic indicators. Eventually, political variables like governance, institutions, regime-type and conflict have been added to the list of outcomes on which natural resources have a negative impact. The political resource curse literature was born. Does the political resource curse warrant a separate analytical framework that is different from the typical, economic curse? The implicit distinction is that the curse is deemed political if the outcome is political. In surveying the empirical literature, Ross (2015) shows that natural resources, especially oil and petroleum, are robustly associated with lower quality of governance. In particular, they make authoritarian regimes more durable, increase corruption, and raise the likelihood of armed conflict. The formal political resource curse literature, however, is scant and fragmented. Deacon (2011) and Deacon and Rode (2015) provide a survey of models that generate a resource curse, but they distinguish a political from an economic resource curse purely in terms of outcome. In this paper, I focus on political resource curse models and propose a definition that encompasses all kinds of political outcomes. Simply put, the political resource curse is the misallocation of revenues from natural resources and other windfall gains by rent-seeking political agents. In other words, what makes the curse political is that the rent-seeking is done by political agents, as opposed to the private sector. This distinction is key. When the private sector allocates their endowments toward rent-seeking efforts, any deadweight losses from the latter may be offset if rents are sufficiently large. That is, rents may not be fully or more-than-fully dissipated, which implies that aggregate social welfare does not decrease. In contrast, a rent-seeking political agent always allocates resource rents in a socially inefficient manner since her utility function assigns more weight to her own income and/or her patrons’ and is thus different from the representative citizen’s utility function. Thus, natural resources and other sources of rents always generate a curse whenever political agents desire rents. Their ability to actually obtain those rents, however, depends on the extent to which such agents can be made accountable to citizens. With greater accountability, the curse is less severe. I formally derive this result in each of the models presented here, in which various mechanisms of government accountability are used, from electoral competition, coalition formation, and the outright threat of violent conflict. The political resource curse is mitigated when the mechanism induces intense competition or contest over political power. In this case, the threat of being replaced is stronger, which constrains the incumbent from too much rent-seeking, thereby limiting the misallocation of revenues. The next section argues for and provides a more analytically distinct definition of the political resource curse that is based on the identity of rent-seekers, and not on the particular outcome of rent-seeking. In Sect. 3, I present an example of a resource curse model in which all rent-seeking is done by the private sector. This contrasts sharply with various political resource models in Sect. 4 in which political agents capture rents. Sect. 5 concludes with a summary.",8

Karakas,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Most existing models of legislative bargaining assume that approval in the legislature is the final step in the enactment of a bill. In reality, a bill’s opponents have access to various institutions for challenging passed legislation, such as, for instance, a public referendum, the presidential veto or the judiciary. This paper focuses on a referendum that is triggered as a result of an insufficient majority in the legislature as one such institution and studies its effects on the composition of a bill and the equilibrium payoffs to the political parties taking part in the process. In designating the procedural rules for enacting a constitutional amendment, the constitutions of a number of countries stipulate a public vote requirement on bills that have gained a simple majority but not a supermajority of the votes in the legislature. Specifically, under this rule, constitutional amendment proposals get enacted without a public vote if they gain the support of at least a supermajority of the legislators and automatically fail if they cannot win a simple majority. If the level of approval in the legislature falls between a simple majority and a supermajority, then the bill becomes the law if and only if a simple majority of the public approves it in a subsequent referendum.Footnote 1 As this procedure is not constitutionally mandated regardless of the proposal’s level of legislative support, it introduces a new strategic consideration into the legislative stage by giving the proposer party the choice between forming a grand coalition in the legislature, thereby making the public’s approval unnecessary, and triggering a referendum whose outcome would be uncertain. One of the more recent instances in which the triggered-referendum institution received widespread media attention was concerning the electoral reform package Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi introduced and succeeded in passing in both houses of the parliament. As the support for the proposals fell short of a supermajority in both houses, a referendum was held in 2016 in which the Italian voters rejected the reforms. The reform package had called for changing the rules by which parliamentary seats are allocated according to the parties’ vote shares in national elections and had introduced changes to the relative powers of Italy’s Senate and its Chamber of Deputies. The arguments for a yes vote in the referendum centered on political stability and a greater ability to fight corruption at the regional governments. The proponents of rejecting the reform package argued against the concentration of power in the political party with the most votes. The opposition parties campaigned for overturning and the party of the Prime Minister campaigned for passing the reform bill, using diverse mediums such as rallies, grassroots organizations and the media.Footnote 2
 Another country that features the triggered-referendum institution in its constitution is Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently held a referendum on adopting a presidential system. With 550 seats in the parliament, the Turkish constitution requires a two-thirds supermajority (367 seats) in order for a constitutional amendment to pass without a referendum, or a three-fifths majority (330 seats) for its approval to be decided in a referendum. Holding only 317 seats and relying on the support of a smaller opposition party, the government narrowly won the passage of its coveted reforms, first in the parliament and then in a referendum that was held in April 2017. A similar scenario played out in 2010 when a series of constitutional reform proposals, most notably concerning the selection of judges, were able to gain the minimum 330 votes but not the required 367 for immediate passage, leaving their enactment to a referendum in which the reforms passed with a 58 percent approval.Footnote 3,Footnote 4
 A large literature, including Matsusaka (2005a, b), documents the surge in spending on referendum campaigns, examples of which include advertising, media coverage or political rallies. Moreover, there exists growing evidence that the public is influenced by these campaigns, as documented in de Figueiredo et al. (2011).Footnote 5 Motivated by this evidence and the above examples, this paper asks the following questions: To what extent do the bills introduced in the legislature reflect the proposer party’s strategic considerations for the referendum that would be triggered following approval by an insufficient majority? For instance, would Italy’s electoral reforms include more concessions to the opposition parties if they were considered to be more powerful players in a subsequent referendum? More specifically, how does a referendum process in which parties campaign to influence its outcome affect the contents of a legislative proposal? Which conditions facilitate the forming of a grand coalition that would obviate a referendum, and which incentivize the proposer party to instead trigger the referendum institution? In order to address these questions, this paper builds a one-period legislative bargaining model between two parties in which the proposer makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer of a bill composed of an ideology and a rent allocation. If the proposal wins approval, it immediately becomes the law. Otherwise, the post-bargaining challenge stage begins in which the parties can campaign for or against the bill during a referendum. This stage is modeled as a Tullock contest between the two parties. The parties’ exogenous campaigning budgets capture their post-bargaining power. Whether the bill becomes the law is then determined by the public using a simple majority rule. The proposer party’s equilibrium behavior is determined by the trade-off it would face in a referendum between a higher probability of having its bill upheld by the public and capturing a greater share of benefits for itself. This is due to the fact that each party’s equilibrium campaign spending during the referendum is increasing in the difference between its winning and losing payoffs. While a bill that rewards the proposer more increases its payoff in case the public approves the bill, such a bill also intensifies the other party’s equilibrium efforts at winning, making it less likely that the proposer party will prevail in the referendum. The optimal proposal with which the proposer would trigger the referendum reflects a balancing-act between these two opposing incentives. While achieving unanimous agreement in the legislature requires compromise from the proposer in equilibrium (except for some extremely low status-quo payoffs for the non-proposer party), this is not necessarily the case for bills that will be contested in a referendum. In contrast to the findings of the literature on strategic restraint in contests with endogenous prizes, such as Epstein and Nitzan (2004), the results here indicate that there exist parameter values that produce an equilibrium bill that does not make any concessions to the non-proposer party for the purpose of controlling its campaign spending.Footnote 6 Such a bill that only reflects the proposer’s interests is observed in equilibrium when the two parties have large ideological differences that are costly to reconcile and low status-quo payoffs. This is because ideological differences increase the cost of compromising for the proposer and a low status-quo payoff decreases the non-proposer party’s stake from the referendum, limiting the threat it poses. On the other hand, the proposer always makes concessions on the bill that will be contested in a referendum if the non-proposer party has a sufficiently large campaigning budget or if the two parties are ideologically close. In equilibrium, unanimity is observed for sufficiently low status-quo payoffs for the non-proposer party and close party ideologies, because these factors increase the proposer’s sure-payoff in case of unanimous agreement. A sufficiently large campaigning budget for non-proposer party may also induce unanimity as larger budgets constitute a threat for the proposer during the referendum that decrease its expected payoff. These results on the incentives campaigning budgets provide for reaching unanimity in the legislature carry policy implications regarding campaign finance regulations for referenda. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The following section discusses the related literature and this paper’s contribution to it. Section 3 introduces the model and Sect. 4 presents the equilibrium analysis. Section 5 concludes.",

The participants compete with each other; some demand tougher law enforcement policies, and others demand laxer law enforcement policies. For example, some citizens take part in anti-organized-crime activities and blame political connections between policy makers and organized crime groups, such as the Mafia. Environmental protection groups make efforts to prevent pollution generated by firms. Residents in some regions desire more severe law enforcement, while residents in other regions do not agree with this proposal. More importantly, law enforcement authorities seem to be the main actors in pursuing stricter law enforcement policies and have to be involved in such competition for the budget. Previous law enforcement literature has not focused on this competition, while this competition can be the source of enforcement distortions and the detrimental consequences to society. This paper presents a model in which groups can have effects on law enforcement processes by making upfront investments, such as a monetary payment to the policy maker who is in charge of the decision process; this is similar to the lobbying form. By making these investments, winning groups can achieve their preferred proposal for detection policies, such as police activity. In this paper, we consider that groups face competition for criminal detection, which is one of the principal activities of law enforcement. Finally, by investigating the relation between the imposition of severe sanctions and the group incentives, we discuss the social welfare implications of this competition. Although this discussion has similarities with those of avoidance activities and private protection (Malik 1990; Ben-Shahar and Harel 1995; Langlais 2008; Friehe and Miceli 2017), this paper presents different results, i.e., that competition can prevent inefficiency in law enforcement policy, while punitive groups such as the law enforcement authority have power in shaping law enforcement policies. This is because groups that desire tough enforcement must succeed in lobbying, where each group proposes its preferred policies in competition with each other. In such a situation, a moderate policy is proposed to avoid intensified competition. This result extends the recent discussion about law enforcement policy design and how to control the punitive law enforcement authority as in Dharmapala et al. (2016) from the political–institutional perspective. This paper also provides new interpretations that posit these avoidance activities and private protection as the sources of rents for the policy maker who is in charge of law enforcement decision processes. We also investigate the policy maker’s motivation for establishing sanctions to extract more payments, such as bribes. This is similar to Friedman (1999), in that the government does not always act as a social-welfare maximizer, and other actors have an effect on the enforcement decision process.Footnote 1 This setting extends the discussion in the literature on corruption and law enforcement—e.g., Bowles and Garoupa (1997), Polinsky and Shavell (2001) and Echazu and Garoupa (2010)—by considering the non-welfare maximizing government and interactions of private protections. Therefore, this paper provides an inclusive framework for understanding avoidance activities, private law enforcement motivated by payments, and corruption. This paper shows that the policy maker with rent-seeking motivation tends to establish lesser sanctions than those concerned with social welfare. Thus, the use of non-monetary sanctions can also be a method of eliciting rents; Garoupa and Klerman (2002, 2010) similarly attempt to understand this phenomenon and consider detection revenue as the only the source of payment. Hence, compared to their papers, we discuss the relation between the quality of the government and illegal activities, as in Sung (2004) and Lin (2007), with a wider range of viewpoints. This reinforces the one positive aspect of the separation of powers in the law enforcement policy process. This paper also has much in common with the political economy approach, e.g., that of Dittmann (2006) and Langlais and Obidzinski (2016), which introduces non-social-welfare-maximizing governments. Dittman assumes that the government tries to maximize its budget rather than social welfare. Langlais and Obidzinski assume that law enforcement policy depends on political competition, such as in elections. In line with this approach, this paper proposes a different mechanism, which is intended to explain how distortion has emerged in the presence of several social actors and which has been unaddressed in the literature. Since this paper focuses on political lobbying, our framework complements the existing literature with this approach. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the basic framework for competition among groups. Next, we investigate how sanction choice depends on government motivation with respect to (1) social-welfare maximization and (2) payment seeking and then consider the optimal policy to prevent payment-seeking behavior among public law enforcers. The final section provides a discussion and concluding remarks.",4

Ramello,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Any democratic society and its economy are solidly rooted in the effective workings of adjudication. The organization that carries out the bulk of this task, the judiciary, is crucial not only in supplying justice to citizens in the broadest sense of the word but, equally, in providing certainty and completeness to economic agents. In this respect, dispute resolution is a central task of the judiciary because it fills the interaction gap between the parties, thus enabling the reshuffling of unexpected contingencies which might otherwise lead to market failures (Voigt 2016). Additionally, judicial enforcement can be decisive for policy success, or failure. For instance, in the case of tax courts, their workings are equally essential in providing incentives against tax evasion and in collecting tax revenues. From an economic perspective, adjudication can be represented as an industry whose main production entity—often a monopoly—is the judiciary, and which has the function of serving society by supplying various outcomes needed to regulate interactions among individuals. In other words—though this is an extreme simplification—, the court system has many features in common with other production sectors. Accordingly, it is amenable to be investigated using the customary tools of economic analysis. Taking this approach, our paper contributes to the study of the industrial organization of the judiciary through the investigation of its dispute resolution technology. Using a novel dataset on the Italian fiscal judicial system, we first investigate the performance of Italy’s tax judiciary and its determinants. Then, having shown the pivotal role of judges in the courts’ efficiency, we study the incentives characterizing the activities of judges. In particular, this work advances the current understanding of courts’ production technology and its main input, the work of judges, by taking advantage of an idiosyncratic feature of Italy’s tax courts, which rely to a great extent on part-time judges (e.g. public administration employees or tax professionals) with temporary and renewable mandates. In this respect, our study follows the literature on judges’ behavior by testing the effects of external income opportunities on the effort expended in judicial activity, thus trying to advance the literature on judicial decision-making as far as income maximization is concerned. Our main findings provide empirical evidence–albeit restricted to the Italian tax judiciary—supporting Posner’s claim (1993) that judges are economic agents just like everybody else. The likely policy implication for the considered case is, accordingly, that if one wants to increase the productivity of judges, and by extension that of the courts, economic incentives do have an important role. However, as will be further discussed, a proper policy recipe requires a more careful analysis, that also considers the impact on the public budget. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 frames the research within the relevant literature, while Sect. 3 presents an overview of the Italian tax judicial system and its production organization. Section 4 briefly introduces the methodology and presents the data, descriptive statistics, and results, as far as judicial efficiency is concerned. Section 5 discusses our findings about the economic behavior of tax judges. Finally, Sect. 6 illustrates the conclusions.",2

(2015) point out, full capitalization of surf breaks occurs only when their impact on real estate valuations is included in the statistics. Their study addresses this issue by combining a hedonic price model with data from three distinct beach-adjacent neighborhoods in Santa Cruz, California. They find that, after controlling for proximity to the beach, ocean views and other property and neighborhood effects, proximity to surf breaks provides a significant boost to residential real estate values.Footnote 4
 An important aspect of surfing not encompassed by its macroeconomic impact described above is the common-pool nature of a surf break, where, at the point of congestion at the break, additional surfers contribute to negative congestion externalities. In this way, surfing is similar to commercial fishing. However, unlike vocations such as commercial fishing, surfing is an avocation for which positive network externalities are present. In this regard, surfing is much like other avocations or recreational activities wherein the utility of participants is enhanced by the participation of others. Thus, the utility or enjoyment received from surfing combines with the macroeconomics of surfing described above to make it an important activity in the U.S. and abroad. The importance of surfing in the U.S. and elsewhere that is highlighted above provides a foundation for a recent series of economics studies of the governance of surf breaks by Kaffine (2009), Mixon (2014) and Mixon and Caudill (2018). This series provides a novel examination to the common property resource elements of surf breaks and how surf gangs are formed in an effort to prevent crowding of a local surf break by non-locals. This series also fits into the framework of two separate but related streams of the resource economics literature highlighting the positive association between private property rights and resource quality.Footnote 5 The general conclusion in this series is that “localism,” or informal property rights protection that is backed by either threats of violence or actual violence, is exhibited to a greater degree (by surf gangs) at high-quality surf breaks than at low-quality surf spots. That is, where the benefits of localism are greater, surf gangs will form and expend greater resources producing localism effort. As Kaffine (2009) indicates, the theoretical and empirical investigations in this recent series of economic studies concerns the second half of a two-stage model wherein user-enforced property rights are established, and not the first stage of that process wherein local surfers address the collective action problem associated with surf gang formation. This study addresses that void by examining the economics of surf gang formation, particularly how surf break congestion, localism effort, and surfing camaraderie work to determine the optimal size of a local surf gang. In doing so, this study integrates some of the seminal public choice research on clubs (e.g., Buchanan 1965; Cornes and Sandler 1996; Sandler 2013) and recent research on prison gangs (e.g., Skarbek 2014; Roth and Skarbek 2014) into an analysis of the formation of surf gangs. In providing an approach to the first stage of the two-stage model of the surf break commons, this study also provides a more complete picture of how informal governance may impact both the macroeconomic prospects and individual utility (enjoyment) associated with this important recreational endeavor.",3

Dewatripont and Maskin (1995) formulate the problem as a case of time inconsistency in the context of a principal and agent relationship. More specifically, owing to a lack of commitment, a lender, acting as the principal, bails out a costly project started by a borrower, acting as the agent. Such a bailout might not be desirable from the ex ante perspective when the project is not yet initiated, but it can turn out to be desirable ex post, once the initial cost is sunk. In anticipation of the ex post rescue, however, the agent undertakes such an ex ante undesirable project. In this setting, although a hard budget constraint (HBC) is ex ante desirable, the principal cannot commit to it and, therefore, the SBC prevails. Wildasin (1997) applies the SBC to the context of intergovernmental relations. Ex post, the central government, as the principal, bails out the local government, acting as the agent, which undersupplies an interregional spillover-generating public service. The bailout is motivated by enhancing ex post efficiency, but it exacerbates ex ante inefficiency, given that the local government acts in a strategic manner to manipulate ex post transfers in its favor. This study is extended by Akai and Sato (2008). The above studies presumed that the HBC is ex ante preferable to the SBC. However, there may be circumstances in which the SBC constitutes a desirable contract from the second-best perspective. Indeed, Kornai et al.’s (2003) survey addresses such a case, where the government deliberately utilizes the SBC as a device to affect the incentives of its agent, such as the local government. In this regard, the SBC may ex ante dominate the HBC. In line with this, Besfamille and Lockwood (2008) consider that the central government imposes the HBC or the SBC on the local government ex ante. The project requires a certain effort at the local level. Without this effort, completion of the project will require additional costs. In the case of the HBC, there is no transfer to finance the extra cost of the project, so it must be terminated. Conversely, in the case of the SBC, the central government grants a transfer ex post to complete the project. Besfamille and Lockwood (2008) suppose that the central government is ex ante capable of committing to the HBC or the SBC and derive the circumstances that the SBC can be the ex ante second-best option and that the government commits to it. The distinct features of their model are as follows. First, the policy options of the central government are limited to either giving no grant or fully bearing the additional cost required to complete the project. Second, the analysis presumes that commitment to the policy designed ex ante is possible. No ex post discretion is allowed, so that the federal government cannot change from the HBC to the SBC. Third, the game between the governments is a one-shot game, without consideration of future welfare. This paper extends Besfamille and Lockwood (2008) in the following directions. First, our model enriches the consideration of the central government’s policy instruments by including a matching grant scheme, which can subsidize part of the additional cost ex post, with the remainder self-financed by the regional government.Footnote 1 Then, the matching grant scheme is expected to improve social welfare relative to the situation in which the ex ante policy option of the federal government is limited to the hard or the soft budget. Second, we incorporate the reputation effect and make the commitment ability of the government endogenous. The commitment problem arises when the central government is allowed to pursue the ex post optimum by changing its policy ex post. The reputation effect can prevent such an ex post motive. Then, we show that it contributes to enhancing commitment ability and improving social welfare. To be precise, the reputation effect is modelled by the trigger strategy in the repeated game setting pioneered by Barro and Gordon (1983) who establish that the reputation refrains central banks from exercising discretionary monetary policy and thus inflation is kept lowered over times. Cooley and Soares (1999) show that pay as you go social security can be sustained as a political equilibrium in the overlapping generation context when the trigger strategy is adopted. In the game theoretic approach to economic history, Greif (1993) formalize the custom of Jewish Maghribi traders engaged in long-distance trade all over the Muslim Mediterranean in the 10th to 13th centuries by repeated interaction with the trigger strategy. To our knowledge, however, there is no theoretical work on the soft budget problem that focuses on the reputation effect in the context of a repeated-game setting within the federalism literature. Crivelli and Staal (2013) account for the fixed cost associated with the ex post bailout but they assume that it is exogenous. The present paper does not intend to replicate certain institutional practices regarding intergovernmental relations. Rather, we aim to provide a theoretical framework to synthesize the different views on the HBC versus the SBC. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the setting of the model with a matching grant. Social and regional gains from cases such as HBCs, matching grant and SBCs are discussed in Sect. 3. The commitment problem associated with the matching grant in the repeated-game model is examined in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",
20.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,08 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-018-0213-4,Corruption and paradoxes in alliances,March 2019,Ricardo Nieva,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Corruption, the abuse of an entrusted power for private gain (see Rose-Ackerman and Palifka 2016), has been found to be associated with low productivity in the empirical literature.Footnote 1 We are interested in explaining this association in the case of a person who can adjudicate over property rights (of land). An apparently unrelated literature provides us with an explanation. Midlarsky (1988) discovered an association among population growth, land concentration, and conflict in predominantly agrarian societies. Other empirical studies (refer to Homer-Dixon 1994) found that a decrease in the quality and quantity of renewable resources, growth in population, and unequal distribution of resources induced by capture by certain groups have led to the “ecological marginalization” of other groups. After a dam was constructed in 1989 in the Senegal River Valley, which led to an increase in land property, the white Moor elite captured valuable land with the backing of the state. Capture also occurred in the Philippines, with the best lands being controlled by 10% of the families in the country.Footnote 2 In all these cases, marginal productivity of labor is low. Additionally, there is a strong non-productive enforcer (or a group of enforcers) that colludes with a subset of the workers to gain some benefit at the expense of the other ones. However, then the natural question is whether the enforcer would exclude an extra worker if he is productive enough. It seems that the answer is no. Our contention is that low marginal productivity of labor causes corruption, land concentration, and conflict.Footnote 3 This discussion motivates us to examine the issue of corruption in the case of a person who can adjudicate over property rights. The hope is that the outcome of this study will help us understand related social situations. Based on Nieva (2003), we extend the Tullock contest model by letting identical workers and a non-productive enforcer, who is more efficient at fighting, contest over, say, a piece of land. Property rights for the output are well defined, but they are not defined for the resource. A worker generates one unit of output. Unless otherwise stated, marginal productivity of labor is zero. If the enforcer assigns the valuable piece of land mentioned in the example in the way he was mandated, then it can be said that the grand coalition forms. Alternatively, if he colludes with a subset of the workers, then this coalition fights over the piece of land against other groups of workers. In this case, corruption occurs.Footnote 4\(^{,}\)Footnote 5 It is possible for anarchy to ensue or for the enforcer to be deposed. We assume that there are binding agreements for fighting together as a group and also the necessity to abide by a sharing rule via transfer of output to the enforcer. Effort is supplied non-cooperatively (see Esteban and Sakovicz 2003, for a discussion on the assumption of binding agreements despite non-cooperative effort supply). We focus on the effect of a coalition structure in the intergroup conflict. In order to give intuition, we consider beginning with several three-player games with heterogeneity in effort, which differ with respect to the assumption we make in terms of effort costs. Subsequently, we extend our model to one enforcer and a finite number of identical workers for general strictly convex cost functions. We assume linear dependence in terms of effort and differential effort in the contest success function.Footnote 6 Suppose an extra worker does not increase output. We show that if the aggregate effort level is fixed, a coalition that differs from a given one only in that it includes the enforcer has a higher probability of winning and a higher sum of payoffs. Provided the enforcer is effective enough, the sum of payoffs is also larger for the coalition in the cross-section that has the enforcer as an extra member in comparison with the coalition having one member less, comprising only workers. Next, we allow for general equilibrium effects. We show that if the effectiveness of the enforcer goes up, the aggregate level of effort increases.Footnote 7 In this case, if an adequately effective enforcer is added to a coalition of identical workers, the individual payoffs of the workers still increase.Footnote 8 Further, the sum of payoffs in the new coalition is higher than the sum of their members’ payoffs in the original coalition structure.Footnote 9 Finally, this merging generates negative spillovers on the other coalitions.Footnote 10 The driving force of our results is that since the workers free ride on the more effective enforcer, fighting is less costly for the group and the more efficient fighter fights more; the enforcer’s zero outside option makes this coalition an even more attractive prospect.Footnote 11 Thus, it is immediately apparent that if the enforcer is effective enough, a small coalition that includes him maximizes per capita payoffs. Motivated by this intuition, we conjecture that the following result is generalizable for any version of our game, provided the enforcer is effective enough. In the three-player fixed-effort model, if only the enforcer has positive endowment of effort (and thus, we have the perfect enforcement case) and if the marginal productivity of labor is sufficiently low, only the coalition of the enforcer and one of the identical workers forms; if the marginal productivity is high enough, the grand coalition forms, and hence, there is no corruption. This follows after the employment of the Rubinstein coalitional bargaining model presented in Ray (2007), which uses the rejector-proposes protocol, as “the perfect enforcement case turns out to be the employer-employee game” (in this game, workers get to produce only if they collude with the owner of the capital).Footnote 12\(^{,}\)Footnote 13 This result will rationalize the empirical association between land concentration and conflict due to population growth and the induced lower marginal productivity of labor. The same can be said about productivity and corruption. In Sect. 2, we review the existing literature pertaining to our study. In Sect. 3, we motivate undertaking the analysis of corruption through the use of the Tullock model in consideration of coalition structures. In Sect. 4, we examine the three-player case. Subsequently, in Sect. 5, the general case is dealt with. After conjecturing on the outcomes of coalition formation in Sect. 6, we conclude this paper.",2

Ideally, a bureaucracy would be staffed by motivated bureaucrats who voluntarily exert a high level effort when left unsupervised. Such intrinsically motivated regulators, teachers, soldiers, and diplomats willing carry out the goals of their agency because of the intrinsic reward that affecting policy brings them (Perry 2000; Vandenabeele 2007; Naff and Crum 1999). Not all bureaucrats, however, are motivated by their work. In the absence of oversight, some bureaucrats prefer to exert as little effort as possible. Under certain conditions, these intrinsically unmotivated bureaucrats may imitate their motivated peers in order to secure promotion or retention, after which they shirk on their duties. This creates a problem for political overseers as unmotivated bureaucrats cannot be identified and removed. Intuitively, an agency’s performance should improve whenever unmotivated types can be identified and removed from their positions. Left to their own devices, these bureaucrats exert minimal effort, dragging bureaucratic policy output downward. Removing these types early in their careers makes room for motivated types to replace them. This gain from screening, however, comes at a significant cost. Effective screening causes unmotivated types to shirk early in their careers, as their only motivation for exerting effort is to mimic a motivated type and be retained. An important implication of this effect of screening on bureaucrat behavior is that improvements in monitoring technology that allow principals to identify the motivation of bureaucrats can be welfare reducing, even if a monitoring technology is costless to install. Similarly, downward adjustments to government wages that induce only motivated bureaucrats to pursue continued employment with an agency may also lower agency performance. A welfare-enhancing screening mechanism must therefore generate benefits that exceed the policy cost that arises when motivated and unmotivated types separate. This paper employs a formal model to examine a particular personnel policy capable of bringing about welfare-enhancing screening: “selection rates”. By adopting a selection rate, a principal commits ex ante to retain only a percentage of bureaucrats in a cohort. I show that this policy can yield welfare-enhancing screening when monitoring and wage policy result only in welfare-reducing screening. Selection rates provide a strong incentive for motivated types to separate from unmotivated types. To separate, motivated types exert additional effort toward observable policy-generating activities in their first period of employment. They do this to raise the cost to unmotivated types of imitating them to a prohibitive level. The additional policy output generated by motivated types offsets the cost of separation that arises as unmotivated types shirk in the first period. By offsetting this cost, the principal can reap the second-period gains that come from removing unmotivated types after one period. The welfare-enhancing properties of selection rates help to explain characteristics of several government personnel systems. The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA), for example, legislates retention and promotion rules for U.S. active duty military officers. A notable feature of this act is the “target selection rate” whereby only a certain percentage of officers from a cohort may be retained at each stage in the cohort’s progression through a schedule of promotion opportunities based on time of service. Under recent targets, after 4 years of service 95% of a cohort is retained and promoted. After 9–11 years of service, this drops to 80% of remaining cohort members. After 15–17 years this falls to 70% and after 21–23 years to 50%. The DOPMA borrows from the British army’s “manning control” system in which cohorts of soldiers are thinned every 3 years. A similar “up-or-out” system was implemented for the Foreign Service by the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Recent studies of teacher tenure policies in economics examine retention rates as a means of optimizing the quality of retained teachers (Staiger and Rockoff 2010; Rothstein 2015). These personnel policies are often criticized as arbitrary. This paper provides a theoretical justification for this apparent arbitrariness. The imposition of a selection rate would in fact result in random dismissal were every member of a cohort identical on an observable dimensions of action. The results of the model, however, imply that whenever it is strictly welfare-enhancing to impose a selection rate, motivated and unmotivated types separate. By inducing a separating equilibrium, selection rates serve as the basis for merit-based retention and promotion. The model also implies general conditions under which selection rates can be welfare enhancing. When pecuniary or ego rewards to government office are high, slackers have strong incentives to pool. In order to separate from unmotivated bureaucrats, motivated types must exert a high level of effort. When the policy benefit that motivated types realize is low, the amount of effort that motivated bureaucrats prefer to exert is low. As the gap between these two types of benefits rises, the amount of additional effort that motivated bureaucrats exert to separate from the unmotivated bureaucrats rises. Selection rates therefore become increasingly welfare enhancing as non-policy benefits rise and policy benefits fall. If the level of policy discretion afforded to bureaucrats correlates with the magnitude of the policy rewards that motivated types enjoy from government employment (Golden 2000; Prendergast 2007; Gailmard and Patty 2007, 2013), selection rates should be found in agencies with low policy discretion and high non-policy rewards. This characterizes the military officer corps where large ego rents are enjoyed by officers who have little say in the conduct of defense policy. Conversely, bureaucrats working in regulatory agencies are granted considerable discretion by Congress to specify the details of regulatory policy. The results of the model provide an account for why selection rates are a personnel policy used in the military but not in regulatory agencies.",
20.0,2.0,Economics of Governance,18 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-019-00224-4,Step-by-step group contests with group-specific public-good prizes,June 2019,Katsuya Kobayashi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The achievements reached by group members’ effort, which accompanies the possibility of members’ free-riding, affect the outcomes of competition among groups. In some cases, each achievement has the binary characteristic of “one or nothing.” Competition in research provides an example. Research groups at universities face the challenge of making a scientific finding or not, that is “one or nothing.” One finding linked to a publication needs a certain analytical level, and this becomes an achievement for the group. Moreover, the groups compete for a scientific breakthrough by making the related findings “step-by-step”.Footnote 1 While the group that reaches more findings than its rivals likely attains the breakthrough, which group actually attains it is uncertain. The group members who have attained the breakthrough share the pleasure of attaining it, a publication with a huge impact, and access to resources for future research, making the breakthrough a public good for the group members. In many competitive research fields, especially experimental fields in biology, chemistry, and medicine, making one finding demands cooperation among the group members; however, at the same time, it could fail because of a mistake caused by a slight lack of effort by one member. These characteristics of “one or nothing” and “step-by-step,” which are a sort of discreteness, in group competition can provide effort incentives to group members, relieving the problem of free-riding. In particular, “one or nothing” gives group members a similar incentive to the contract of Holmstrom (1982), which shows that the contract that all agents in a team are rewarded by the principal only when their team production reaches the quantity promised in advance can be the first best. Consequently, this structure provides the group with more achievements than those able to be reached by a single member. However, previous studies have not clarified whether such discreteness motivates group members without any incentive scheme. The purpose of this study is to theoretically clarify this structure. We can find a real-life story in Yamanaka (2012). In 2012, Professor Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.Footnote 2 When establishing his own laboratory in 1999, he set the ultimate goal of reprogramming somatic cells back into the embryonic state. He thought that this would be a major medical breakthrough because, by attaining this goal, we would be able to avoid the ethical problem of using human embryos and immune rejection after transplantation in existing medicine. He guessed from previous studies that some factors in embryos and embryonic stem cells derive pluripotency and he planned to approach the goal in a “step-by-step” manner by finding factors expressed predominantly in embryonic stem cells. In fact, his group found some of those factors and published papers on them. Those findings and related expertise led to the breakthrough discovery that the mature cells of mice and humans could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006; Takahashi et al. 2007). His group won a narrow victory, as the paper by Yu et al. (2007), reporting similar results about human cells, was simultaneously published. Yamanaka put his group’s breakthrough down to all group members’ dedicated work and tireless efforts. In summary, he shared a final goal and approached it in a “step-by-step” manner with his group members. Each step was achievable with cooperation among these members and would not be achievable if one member failed to make the required effort. This structure motivating group members to work hard without any incentive scheme is a key factor in the governance of organizations. Despite its real-world significance, these characteristics of “one or nothing” and “step-by-step” have not been the focus of previous studies of group contests [e.g., patent races, research joint ventures (RJVs), political lobbying]. The achievement of effort, which is called a group impact function, in the literature on group contests is approximately defined as a continuous function that is straightforward to deal with. Based on the foregoing, this study examines a contest among groups in which the achievement of effort increases step-by-step for a group-specific public-good prize. In the contest, individuals expend effort in their groups to win the prize, with the associated problem of members’ free-riding. We characterize the Nash equilibria of such contests and their existence. In this study, we show that the existence of the Nash equilibria always includes at least one equilibrium at which no members in each group free-ride on the others, but rather expend positive effort. At the Nash equilibria in our model, in the case of each group member with a small valuation of the public good, multiple group members expend effort, including an equilibrium at which all members expend effort without any free-riding. In the case of some group members with a high valuation, there is also a Nash equilibrium at which only a single group member expends effort in addition to the equilibrium at which all group members expend effort. Furthermore, while the total effort level in each group at the Nash equilibria is as much as or less than the optimal effort level for each group, higher achievement levels than the reachable level on which only a single member expends effort are reachable at a Nash equilibrium in our model. Those characteristics at the Nash equilibrium are different from the results on the continuous achievement of effort in previous studies where, at the Nash equilibrium, only one member expends effort and the others free-ride in each group. Indeed, the results of previous studies are not always consistent with real-world cases of lobbying and research competitions as Topolyan (2014) mentions. This study shows a solution for this issue. Group contests can be classified into two strands of the literatureFootnote 3: stochastic competition and deterministic competition. Under the former, the winner is determined stochastically and competitors’ effort increases the winning probability in the contest (Katz et al. 1990; Ursprung 1990; Baik 1993; Riaz et al. 1995; Dijkstra 1998). Under the latter, the competitor who exerts the largest effort becomes the winner (Baik et al. 2001; Topolyan 2014). In this study, we focus on a stochastic competition model that has a group impact function with “one or nothing” and “step-by-step” structures. Baik (2008) studies a contest among groups by considering a stochastic competition model in which each individual’s effort is beneficial by itself marginally and continuously in each group. The author’s main result is that only an individual with a maximum valuation of the public-good prizes exerts effort at the Nash equilibrium, whereas the others free-ride on such effort. In our model of step-by-step group contests, effort adds to the winning probability only when the total effort of a group reaches a certain level. Our results thus differ from those of Baik (2008). Such stochastic group contests for public-good prizes have been studied expansively. Based on the works of Hirshleifer (1983; 1985), Lee (2012) studies weakest-link contests with group-specific public-good prizes in which the minimum effort level among group members’ effort levels is their group effort or members’ effort is a perfect complement. Lee (2012) explains that such a structure appears in team competitions of a research contest in which some experts’ works are indispensable. In that case, there are multiple Nash equilibria, and a unique coalition-proof Nash equilibrium without free-riding exists. On the contrary, Chowdhury et al. (2013) examine best-shot contestsFootnote 4 in which the maximum effort level among group members’ effort levels is their group effort. They mention that an example of this structure is the case of competing RJVs in which a high-quality innovation proposed by one RJV member also benefits the other RJV members. In this case, there are multiple Nash equilibria, and at each equilibrium, only one player in each group at most exerts effort, whereas the others free-ride. Chowdhury and Topolyan (2016) combine both contests. They study the attack-and-defense group contest in which the maximum effort level among group members’ effort levels becomes the effort of one group (attacker) and the minimum effort level among group members’ effort levels becomes the effort of another group (defender). According to them, such a structure appears in asymmetric patent competitions between parallel multiple R&D teams run by one firm and a sequentially specialized R&D team run by another firm. In this case, multiple Nash equilibria exist at which only one member exerts effort in the attacker group and all members exert effort in the defender group. There is also a unique coalition-proof Nash equilibriumFootnote 5 at which the effort level of the defender group is the largest effort of the Nash equilibria. The results of these studies except for the perfect complements case show that only the member with the highest valuation of the public-good prize in each group expends effort, while the others free-ride. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model and conditions for the Nash equilibrium. Section 3 presents the existence of the Nash equilibria. Section 4 compares the group-optimal effort level with the levels of the Nash equilibria for each group. Section 5 considers the coalition-proof Nash equilibrium. In Sect. 6, we conclude with a brief discussion of our results. All proofs are in the “Appendix”.",

Hall,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Education is an important part of publicly-provided services in both urban and rural areas, and public libraries can be a large part of community and K-12 education (Collins and Halverson 2010). For example, in an important recent paper, Bhatt (2010) finds that library attendance of school children increases their time spent reading at home and positively impacts their homework completion rate. In addition, urban and rural communities value libraries in ways that are not captured in usage statistics as evidenced by contingent valuation studies (Aabø 2005; Aabø and Strand 2004; McCallum and Quinn 2004). The American Library Association (2015) estimates that there are over nine thousand public libraries in the United States, representing nearly 8% of the total number of libraries in the country.

The IMLS (2013a) reported that in 2012 public libraries had revenues of $11.5 billion, 84.4% from local government sources, 6.9% from state sources, and less than 1% from the federal government. Across states, however, there is considerable variation. In West Virginia, for example, the state average local operating revenue per capita was $13.04 compared to a national average of $32.31 in the 2012 fiscal year. The benefits of public libraries do come with costs, however, and Aabø and Strand (2004) highlights the recent pressures on public library budgets given other demands such as health care. As reported by Aabø and Strand (2004) and several others, local governments have been cutting public library funding, resulting in library branch closures and/or reduced hours.Footnote 1 In response, some localities have passed special local levies to provide more funding to public libraries to restore cut or reduced services. West Virginia is an interesting case as 11 counties have special laws to fund public libraries. Since 2014 there have been at least two new levies placed on the ballot that have passed.Footnote 2 We have three primary aims in this paper. The first is to evaluate the efficiency of West Virginia public library systems. Given ongoing strains in public budgets in West Virginia (and other states), it is important to know whether public funds are being used efficiently. Second, after finding variation in technical efficiency (TE) across public library districts, we use our measures of TE to test whether the source of funding matters for efficiency. Hoxby (1999) provides reasons why local property tax-based finance can improve the productivity of local public good producers. Hall (2007) finds that Ohio school districts with a greater share of funding from local sources have higher scores on state exams. Additionally, people are concerned with the size of government and if their tax money is being allocated properly. Similar looks at the sources of public sector efficiency include Afonso et al. (2005), Smith and Street (2005), Afonso and Aubyn (2005), Afonso and Fernandes (2006), Detotto and McCannon (2017), and Zhu and Peyrache (2017). Lastly, we explore how county characteristics affect the technical efficiency. Library funding comes from four different sources: local, state, and federal government, or non-public sources of funding. In West Virginia, local funding comes from direct appropriation, excess levies, or special laws; these can come from different local authorities like the Board of Education, County Commission and Municipal Funding, which have different budges and responsibilities. State funding is a direct assistance on a per-capita basis and require matching funds from local authorities. Federal funding are available, but is dependent on each library to secure it. The non-public sources include fees, donations/fundraising, and grants (West Virginia Library Commission 2013). In looking at the technical efficiency of libraries we follow in the footsteps of a number of papers, each focusing on a different region. For example, Worthington (1999) assesses the efficiency of local government libraries in Australia, Hammond (2002, 2009) analyzes libraries in the of United Kingdom, and Witte and Geys (2011) studied all municipal public libraries in Flanders, Belgium. In United States, there are a handful of papers (Vitaliano 1997, 1998; Sharma et al. 1999; Hemmeter 2006). Vitaliano (1997) looks at the state of New York state using a stochastic frontier model and finds that public libraries are 3% more inefficient than not-for-profit libraries. Vitaliano (1998) uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) on 184 libraries—also in New York—and finds that libraries could reduce their inputs by one-third without compromising output. Sharma et al. (1999) evaluates 47 libraries in Hawaii for one fiscal year using DEA and find that the average technical efficiency is 0.84 with a range of 0.45–1. As for Hemmeter (2006), the author analyzes the cost-efficiency of nearly all public libraries in the United States using a stochastic cost frontier and finds that inefficiency in smaller libraries is decreased with local government spending.Footnote 3 We follow Vitaliano (1998) and Hammond (2002) and estimate the technical efficiency of public libraries in West Virginia using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). After estimating the technical efficiency of West Virginia libraries, we look at the institutional determinants of library efficiency in the state. Our results show that for West Virginia, local (that is, non-county or multi-jurisdictional) libraries have lower levels of technical efficiency, suggesting an inability to take advantage of economies-of-scale. We also find a negative relationship between local support and technical efficiency, contrary to what the work of Hoxby (1999) and Hall (2007) suggest would be the case. These results are robust across different specifications and are important to voters, policymakers, and scholars of government efficiency.",3

DeAngelo,Bryan C. McCannon,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa pressed more than two million people to cross into Europe in 2015.Footnote 1 This phenomenon created divisions over how responsibility for refugees should be distributed across the European Union (EU) member states. The European Commission allocated quotas on asylum seekers to each EU member state in order to redistribute people who arrived in Greece, Hungary and Italy. However, the push to allocate refugees is a source of constant contention. In October 2016, the Hungarian government, for example, called for an anti-immigration referendum. Hungarians were asked to cast a vote on whether they accept the EU quota schemes.Footnote 2 While an overwhelming majority voted against the EU quota schemes, the turnout was too low to make the poll valid. However, the referendum suggests that the majority of people were overtly opposed to opening their country’s borders to refugees. The Hungarian government is obviously not the only government opposed to welcoming refugees. The question of immigrants in general and of refugees in particular has been a defining issue in the United Kingdom’s June 2016 referendum on EU membership. The hostility to immigration has been argued to be an important contributing factor to the British vote to leave the EU. The extant literature in economics, political science and psychology points to different reasons why “natives” would refuse to welcome refugees, or immigrants more generally (Fong 2001). The costs and benefits of hosting immigrants have been investigated from a macroeconomic (Tumen 2016) and a market design perspective (Moraga and Rapoport 2014) in the economics literature. In the political science literature it has been shown that elite discourse shapes mass opinion and action on immigration policy (Brader et al. 2008) and that cultural differences matter (Hopkins 2015). Psychology research focuses on intergroup prejudices (Abrams et al. 2005). However, economic, psychological, and political science research do not typically examine the behavioral reactions of citizens in response to voting on immigration related issues.Footnote 3 One neglected question concerns the effect of voluntarily (by voting) accepting or refusing solidarity with zero-income immigrants on the native population’s post-voting contributions to the provision of local public goods or public services.Footnote 4 Local public goods, by definition, benefit members of a group or community even when these individuals did not or could not contribute. However, adding a zero-income individual (or individuals) who cannot make his or her own contribution to the group or community is costly due to the congestible nature of local public goods (Scotchmer 2002). Solidarity with immigrants might mean that the native population accepts to give access to various local public goods—congestible—to zero-income individuals who were not previously part of their community. This, in turn, is likely to affect their behavior in terms of how much they want to contribute to the provision of local public goods. If the majority of natives vote against welcoming immigrants and therefore against letting them benefit from local public goods—such as hospitals, museums, or even sidewalks—the voting outcome could strengthen cooperation among the natives because refusing solidarity may express one’s commitment to preserve local public goods for natives, or conversely it might communicate one’s egoistic type, thereby destroying group cohesion.Footnote 5 Obviously, the question of how voting on immigration issues affects local public goods provision is not confined to the current situation in the EU. One could think of many economic, political and social crises that pressed millions of people to cross the border and led governments to raise the question of whether and how local citizens should be consulted and how this will affect social cohesion. Mexican immigration in the United States of America is one bold example. More generally, Hatton (2016) shows how each year about 60 million people flee their home country and seek to cross into developed countries, thus urging the latter to develop different policy responses to face the growing concerns about how immigration may affect social order. This article investigates the effects from one such policy response that is based on ingroup members voting on whether to share the benefits from locally provided public goods with zero income outgroups. To study the effects from voting we build on a firmly established paradigm from experimental economics, namely, the public goods game (Chaudhuri 2011). Our contribution to the literature is that we study the effect of voting on ingroup cooperation when ingroup members need to choose on whether they want to help less endowed outsiders. To study the effect of voting on ingroup cooperation, we design a two-part public goods experiment in which we introduce, in the second part of the experiment, income asymmetry between groups. That is, we keep symmetric the within-group endowment but vary the between-groups endowment. The between-groups asymmetry results in one-half of the groups being randomly selected to continue receiving an endowment similar to the first part of the experiment, while the other half of the groups have their endowments reduced to zero for the second part of the experiment. In our main treatment of interest (hereinafter VOTE treatment) we ask subjects in each group with a positive endowment to vote on whether they are willing to share the benefits from their group’s account with one other group composed of subjects who, due to an exogenous shock, have zero endowment for the second part of the experiment and therefore cannot contribute to the public good. The voting outcome is decided by simple majority. We then examine how the voting outcome affects ingroup cooperation levels. We designed two control treatments. The first control treatment (hereinafter NOSOL treatment) is identical to the VOTE treatment with the exception that there is no vote and no sharing. In case the groups vote against sharing in the VOTE treatment, the game’s strategic environment would be identical to the NOSOL treatment. The second control treatment (hereinafter SOL treatment) introduces sharing automatically, i.e. without voting. In case the groups vote in favor of sharing in the VOTE treatment, the SOL treatment isolates the effect of voting on ingroup cooperation. Our results show the perils of voting in that groups always choose not to share the benefits from the provided public goods and cooperation is significantly lower in the post-voting rounds compared to the NOSOL treatment where there is no sharing and no voting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experiment to study the effects on cooperation from introducing voting in an environment where ingroup members can help less endowed outgroups. But we are not the first to examine the impact of voting on cooperation in the context of the public goods game. Our work is closely related to Dal Bo et al. (2010) who experimentally showed that the effect of a policy on the level of cooperation is greater when it is chosen democratically by the subjects rather than when it is exogenously imposed. Also Feld and Tyran (2006), Ertan et al. (2009), Sutter et al. (2010) and Markussen et al. (2014) found that punishments and rewards in public goods games have a greater impact on behavior when they are allowed democratically.Footnote 6 There are, however, important differences with the aforementioned works. First, we investigate the effect of voting on cooperation in the context of endowment inequalities between groups. Second, our focus is on how ingroup cooperation is affected by the mere act of voting whether or not to share the benefits from the group’s account with zero-income outgroups.Footnote 7 In line with the previously mentioned literature, we find a strong effect from allowing people to vote. However, we find that the implementation of voting significantly reduces cooperation for groups whose members were asked to vote (i.e., within the positive endowment groups).Footnote 8 We find, indeed, that all our positive endowment groups voted against sharing and subsequently cooperated one-half as much within their own group compared to the control treatment without sharing and without the vote. We further show how the process of voting against sharing resulted in a breakdown in cooperation within the positive endowment groups. The existing models of altruism (Becker 1974), warm-glow (Andreoni 1990), and inequality-aversion (Fehr and Schmidt 1999) fail to point to a coherent explanation of the post-voting behavior we observe. The three models would suggest that post-voting behavior should not be different compared to the treatment where positive endowment groups were not asked to vote, but were merely informed of the presence of zero endowment groups. The strategic environment in the two treatments is the same. Our data supports the conditional cooperation model proposed by Markussen et al. (2014) where conditional cooperators decrease their contributions when voting signals the egoistic type of the majority in one’s group. In the next section we describe the experimental parameters and implementation. Section 3 formulates a number of predictions stemming from the literature on social preferences. The results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 provides an explanation for observed behaviors, and the paper concludes in Sect. 6.",2

Effectiveness of dimensions of enforcement in curbing corruption",December 2019,Salvatore Capasso,Rajeev K. Goel,James W. Saunoris,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The recent spurt in the empirical research on the causes and consequences of corruption has outpaced the related growth of theoretical research on the determinants. Researchers have studied multiple causes and effects of corruption with varying samples, variables, time periods and measures (Dimant and Tosato 2018; Lambsdorff 2006; Seldadyo and de Haan 2006; Svensson 2005). Despite the large body of research, one relevant aspect, namely of the effectiveness of government enforcement in controlling corrupt activity, has received relatively larger theoretical attention with relatively little empirical evidence. On this issue this paper attempts to fill the gap between theory and evidence by determining the effects of law enforcement and institutional setting in shaping corruption. More specifically, the work examines the relative effectiveness of various types of law enforcement (police, judges, prosecutors), judicial efficiency (measured by conviction rates), and broader measures of related institutional quality (e.g., rule of law, regulatory quality—see La Porta et al. 1999; Rose-Ackerman 1999) in combating corruption. The main idea is that while law enforcement may not necessarily be effective in curbing corruption, the quality of the institutional setting is a necessary condition to reduce corruption. This occurs both because law enforcement might drain (crowd out) public resources from other useful public investments, and because the institutional setting is the contingent framework within which enforcement run (hence institutions are “gums” within which the “teeth” are set). In this sense, law enforcement (police and prosecution) may be described as the “direct or visible tool” to control corruption, while better institutional quality can be seen as “the framework” within which one can activate those tools. We hence expect to find a stronger and sound negative effect of institutional quality on corruption and a weaker or even uncertain effect of law enforcement on corruption. It could be the case that, in certain nations, there might be a higher share of police, judges or other enforcement officials, but the overall quality of governance might be low when, for example, the enforcement officials are themselves corrupt or the delegation of duties (chain of command) is not clear. Differences in institutional setting and relevance of law enforcement are quite pronounced across nations with different social, economic, political, geographic and historical compositions—all of which can potentially bear upon corruption (Goel and Nelson 2010; Treisman 2000). The theoretical literature has considered different related scenarios, focusing on optimal punishments to deter corruption, stylized games between corrupt officials and enforcers (who themselves might be corrupt), etc. However, the empirical literature has failed to keep up as a few of these dimensions are not readily quantifiable (e.g., behavioral aspects of interactions between bribe takers, bribe givers and enforcers), while in other cases comparable data over time or across jurisdictions is not available (e.g., enforcement employment across countries). In fact, in a recent review of the empirical literature, Dimant and Tosato (2018) list two dozen odd categories of influence on cross-country corruption but enforcement is not listed as a category. A similar omission is noted in an earlier well-cited literature summary by Treisman (2007). This paper used data on a large sample of nations to examine the relative effectiveness of law enforcement (police, judicial and prosecutorial), judicial efficacy (conviction rates), and related institutional quality (law and order, regulatory quality, rule of law). In general, most of the corruption literature, barring a few country-specific studies (e.g., Goel and Nelson 2011; Goel and Rich 1989), use aggregate indices such as the rule of law to capture enforcement. This study, on the other hand, is able to consider direct measures of enforcement (i.e., police, judges, and prosecutors) across a range of nations and compare their efficacy in reducing corruption vis-à-vis aggregate indices of government quality/enforcement (see La Porta et al. 1999). To draw clear comparisons, we use dental analogies, terming law enforcement employment as teeth, prosecution rates (judicial efficiency) as bite,Footnote 1 and institutional quality as gums. As healthy gums house teeth that enable an effective bite, so do good institutions empower enforcement agencies to effectively and credibly provide deterrence. Placing the analysis in the literature on determinants of cross-country corruption, the results show that piecemeal enforcement efforts to combat corruption by increasing enforcement employment would not be effective, rather comprehensive improvements in institutional quality by strengthening the rule of law or regulatory quality bear greater results. These findings are robust across indices of corruption that capture somewhat different aspects and have useful implications for the design of government policies to combat corruption. Since the institutional setting, more than other aspects of the economy, characterizes capital accumulation and development, these results are particularly relevant for policy implementation in developing countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides the theory and discusses the extant literature; Sect. 3 describes the data and estimation; Sect. 4 reports the results; and concluding remarks are given in the final section.",17

Theory and empirical evidence on Brazil,December 2019,Rodrigo Schneider,Diloá Athias,Mauricio Bugarin,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"If all citizens can freely enjoy publicly provided goods the same way, then enfranchisement of poorer voters decreases the income of the median voter and increases public spending. This result follows from the fact that richer voters disproportionately finance publicly provided goods. Meltzer and Richard (1981) exposed this argument theoretically using a political economy model of tax redistribution. Although the theory is intuitive, it is not trivial to empirically test it. The main challenge is to identify the direction of causality, since an increase in public spending could incentivize low income voters to turnout and support incumbent politicians that better represent their fiscal policy preferences.
 There is evidence both in favor and against the prediction that enfranchising poorer voters increases public spending. Hodler et al. (2015) finds that enfranchisement of less educated voters decreased government welfare spending and business taxation in Switzerland. The authors argue that this is because less educated voters are more impressionable by political campaigns, which are financed by interest groups demanding lower taxation. Hoffman et al. (2017) show that, in Austria, making voting compulsory increased turnout but not government spending. They explain this result by showing that newly enfranchised voters had low-interest in politics. In the other direction, several authors show empirical evidence corroborating Meltzer and Richard’s (1981) model (see Lindert 2004; Mueller and Stratmann 2003; Brown and Hunter 1999; Husted and Kenny 1997). However, as Alesina and Giuliano (2011) argue, all these empirical works may suffer from endogeneity as public spending may cause voting turnout. Cascio and Washington (2013) and Fujiwara (2015) solve this issue using shocks of poorer voters’ enfranchisement (i.e., enfranchisement of black voters in the U.S. in the former and introduction to electronic voting in Brazil in the latter) to show empirical evidence that confirms the argument in Meltzer and Richard (1981). In this work, we take advantage of the introduction of electronic voting (EV) in Brazil—which made casting a valid vote easier, especially among low income voters—as an exogenous shock to identify the impact of enfranchisement biased toward poorer voters on public spending. Differently from Fujiwara (2015) who also uses electronic voting in Brazil to study the impact of enfranchisement on public spending, this work contributes to the literature in at least three ways. First, we present a theoretical model showing that voting turnout only influences policy makers’ choice of redistributive taxation when voters are able to cast a valid vote. Second, we estimate the magnitude of an increase in voting turnout on fiscal policy by expanding Fujiwara’s (2015) analysis to local governments and to other public spending outcomes.Footnote 1 Third, we use a difference-in-differences (DID) setup analyzing fiscal policies at the municipality level in a context where voting is mandatory, and a specific group was disproportionately affected by EV. Hodler et al. (2015) and Hoffman et al. (2017) also use a DID setup to deal with endogeneity, however, their data examine state level expenditures and focus on a policy that did not target a group with specific policy preferences as the case we analyze. Moreover, the fact that voting in Brazil is mandatory makes voting turnout high and mitigates attrition bias. Finally, as electronic voting disproportionately enfranchised poor and less educated voters, we can also explore heterogeneous effects of the new technology across socio-economic groups. In addition to contributing to the literature on voting and redistribution, our paper also speaks to the literature on voting costs. In his seminal work, Downs (1957) explains the decision to vote through a cost-benefit analysis, whereby a citizen balances the benefits of having her candidate win, weighted by the probability of being a pivotal voter, and the cost of turning out to vote. As the probability that an individual vote matters is extremely low, the level of turnout should be smaller than it is in most democracies. Ricker and Ordeshook (1968) explain this paradox by including a variable into the model that captures the sense of civic duty. If this variable is large enough, then the benefit to vote can offset the cost. A more recent literature explaining the decision to vote includes psychological attitudes such as social norms (Blais and Young 1999; Schram and Van Winden 1991; Schram and Sonnemans 1996; Edlin et al. 2007; Feddersen and Sandroni 2006). The main prediction of these theoretical models is that decreasing the cost of voting increases turnout. There is also a growing empirical literature measuring the effect of voting costs on turnout. Fujiwara et al. (2016), for example, find empirical evidence that rainfall on current election days, as well as on past election days through habit formation, reduces voter turnout. Hassell and Settle (2017) find that life stress reduces turnout for those individuals who are not routinely involved in the electoral process. Bhatt et al. (2019) find statistical evidence that reducing registration costs increases both voter registration and voter turnout. Furthermore, the paper “highlights the importance of voter registration costs for electoral participation, especially for citizens from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.” Braconnier et al. (2017) conduct a large-scale experiment in the 2012 French presidential and parliamentary elections and find a similar result. They assign 20,500 households to one control group or six treatment groups. The latter groups received canvassing visits providing either information on voting registration or assistance to register, which increased their registration level. The paper concludes that “easing registration requirements could substantially enhance political participation and interest”.Footnote 2 Consequently, institutions and rules are often devised to encourage civic involvement in politics by decreasing the cost of vote. For instance, democracies promote participation by holding elections on holidays or weekends, allowing postal or proxy voting, and creating initiatives such as the prominent Get-Out-The-Vote (GOTV) campaign (Berinsky et al. 2001; Berinsky 2005). Nonetheless, campaigns to increase voting participation such as GOTV, mostly increases the participation of the rich and the impact of enfranchising poor voters is still unknown. Our paper shows that de facto enfranchisement of poor and less educated voters through a reduction of their voting costs impacted fiscal policies. In Brazil, there are elections every 2 years. For instance, in 1994, federal elections elected federal and state representatives, senators, governors and the president. Two years later, municipal elections elected municipal representatives and mayors.Footnote 3 This pattern is illustrated in Fig. 1. EV was first implemented in the 1996 municipal level elections, but only 57 municipalities used it.Footnote 4 Nonetheless, in the 1998 federal elections, all Brazilian municipalities with more than 40,500 eligible voters, and all the ones belonging to four selected states (Rio de Janeiro, Amapá, Alagoas and Roraima), used the electronic voting system (i.e., close to 500 municipalities). Beginning in 2000, all voters used EV in Brazil. Federal and local elections in Brazil The large impact EV had on voting enfranchisement biased toward the poor—exclusively in legislative elections—is well documented in the literature (Hidalgo 2012; Fujiwara 2015). For instance, before EV, only 58% of voters cast a valid vote (correctly cast votes) to federal representatives and in 2002, when EV was a feature across the country, this number increased to 92% (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, TSE). Using rigorous empirical analysis, Hidalgo (2012) and Fujiwara (2015) show that EV increased the valid votes to turnout ratio for federal and state representatives by 23 and 12 percentage points, respectively (i.e., close to a 33% increase). Also, this effect was larger in municipalities that had less educated and poorer voters. This large impact of EV on enfranchisement concentrated on low income voters can be explained by how the new voting system facilitated the requirements to cast a vote for representatives in Brazil. Figure 2 shows the paper ballot system on the left-hand side and the electronic voting machine on the right-hand side. The paper ballot system required one to clearly write the name or number of the candidate in the ballot. Therefore, it was essential to be literate to understand the ballot instructions and cast a valid vote in Brazil. The new voting system, only required voters to press the candidate’s number on a standard numerical keyboard and after verifying the picture of the candidate, press a green button to confirm their vote.Footnote 5 By removing these two requirements, namely, the need to read the ballot instructions, and the need to write one’s candidate’s name, the new EV technology enfranchised many voters, especially poorer and less educated ones. Paper ballot (left) and electronic voting machine (right) We follow two steps in our study investigating the impact of enfranchisement of low-income voters on public spending. First, we build a theoretical model allowing voters to cast, not purposefully, an invalid vote, and show that when poorer voters’ likelihood of casting a valid vote increases, social spending increases as well. Second, we present a difference-in-differences (DID) model, where municipalities using EV comprise our treatment group, to empirically test our theoretical model prediction. We focus our empirical analysis on states that had electronic voting across their territories and use them as the treatment group. Our decision to use within state variation is based on two arguments. First, as Schneider et al. (2019) show, representatives elected in 1998 sent more discretionary intergovernmental transfers to municipalities using EV. Second, as intergovernmental transfers comprise a mechanism to explain any observed increase in public spending caused by EV, we needed to segregate representatives elected by the new technology from the remaining ones. To do so, as states in Brazil act as a multi-member districts in congressional elections, we wanted to make sure that all representatives elected in the treatment group were elected solely by voters using electronic voting. Thus, we restrict our sample to municipalities with less than 40,500 voters, which allows us to compare municipalities with similar size, while at the same time guarantees that the treatment group is composed by municipalities that only had representatives elected by EV representing them in congress. Our empirical model finds a positive impact of EV usage on social spending. To preview our findings, our DID model estimations report that an increase of 1 percentage point in the valid vote to turnout ratio for state representatives increases health spending by 1.8%; education spending by 1.4%; and public employment spending by 1.25%. We also find that the revenue collected at the local administration level increases, which provides a mechanism explaining our findings. Our results show that an increase of 1 percentage point in the valid vote to turnout ratio for state representatives increases intergovernmental transfers by 1% and local taxes by 2.6%. Besides the introduction, this work is divided as follows. Section 2 presents a model that motivates the empirical analysis. Section 3 briefly discusses the data. Section 4 presents the difference-in-differences model and results. Section 5 presents an heterogenous effects analysis. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the work.",4

Rothenberg,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In May 2010, Barack Obama proposed a line item veto—presumably one that would pass Constitutional muster—on the grounds that it would prevent unnecessary earmark spending that the standard executive veto made impossible to deter. This request was reminiscent of a 2006 George Bush proposal and presaged subsequent recommendations of budget-conscious members of CongressFootnote 1 and by Donald Trump in 2018. On the one hand, such suggestions are unsurprising, as an intuitive argument is that executives, as well as legislative budget hawks, desire as flexible and as far-reaching a veto authority as possible to reduce spending. For example, de Figueiredo (2003) maintains that conservative state legislators believing that liberals are in ascendancy tend to push line item vetoes through (43 of 50 states having some form of the line item veto during 1830–1994), which permit governors to remove specific expenditures from a larger budgetary bill.Footnote 2 On the other hand, academic literature questions the importance of changes in veto authority for impacting budgetary outcomes whatsoever. Some of this literature is theoretical, showing that moving from a standard veto that requires rejecting an entire bill and returning to a reversion point does not necessarily produce more spending than a veto allowing the chief executive to delete specific items from a bill (for the classic work, see Carter and Schap 1987, 1990; for more recent perspectives, see Indridason 2011; Brown 2012). Other empirical research suggests that the net effects of such changes produce very little reduced spending (e.g., Holtz-Eakin 1988; Bohn and Inman 1996; Krause and Melusky 2012; Kousser and Phillips 2012; for reviews of the literature, see Krol 2007 and Rose 2010) and that, at best, any effects are conditional on factors such as divided government (e.g., Besley and Case 2003).Footnote 3 While theoretical works show how strategic considerations might minimize the effect of item veto on spending level, empirical findings suggest other possibilities. For instance, one explanation for the item veto’s ineffectiveness vis-à-vis spending is that governors use their veto authority to achieve their policy goals instead (Gosling 1986); another is that legislators agree to more pork-barrel spending to build a larger coalition that counters stronger executive veto authority (Gabel and Hager 2000). In this paper, we study theoretically and empirically the effect of different veto rules on budgets. Theoretically, we present a model that generates new, previously unrecognized, features of the relationship between veto rules and budgets. We first find that more flexible veto instruments do not necessarily produce lower spending even for a frugal governor. Building on Carter and Schap (1987), who show an example in which spending under an item veto is higher than that under an all-or-nothing veto, we demonstrate that an item-reduction veto (allowing the chief executive to reduce rather than reject an expenditure) also sometimes permits higher spending than an all-or-nothing veto. We then characterize the gridlock sets—the sets of points whose resulting policy remains at the same position—under different veto rules. In doing so, we find that while the set produced under the most restrictive veto rule is negligible in a multidimensional bargaining situation, this is not the case when more flexible veto rules are adopted. In turn, this theoretical finding implies that we should observe less budgetary volatility in states with more powerful veto rules. As the gridlock set captures the conditions when there will be political stalemate by which policymakers cannot agree on any movement from the current status quo, the bigger the set, the less volatility we should observe in spending. This result has been previously unrecognized and may constitute an unintended consequence of expanding veto authority either through line item or item-reduction (for empirical analyses of budget volatility, see Crain 2003; Fatas and Mihov 2006). Empirically, we examine our supposition of budgetary volatility by analyzing American state budget expenditures from 1978 to 2007, finding that our theoretical expectation is borne out when either individual budget categories or total spending is examined (we begin in 1978 as that is when all data are available and stop at 2007 in order to avoid the potentially disruptive effects of the Great Recession, which could make pooling the data over time problematic). These results indicate that delegating greater authority to executives such as governors, perhaps unexpectedly, can serve to both strengthen expectations about future budgets and reduce the responsiveness of spending to changing preferences or circumstances. While more uncertainties about state budgets might produce additional costs for economic activities in the private sector or reduce organizational performance in the public sector (Andersen and Mortensen 2010), our theoretical analysis suggests that this type of volatility is unavoidable for more democratic governance reflecting voters’ preferences efficiently.Footnote 4 As Miller (2013) argues, elected officials are responsible for making policies responsive to voters’ preferences. Interestingly, we find that such responsiveness can be better achieved when the governor has less powerful veto authority, retaining greater flexibility when bargaining with the legislature. In our analysis, we first present our budgetary decision-making model under alternative veto rules and discuss its implications. We then empirically examine budgetary choices in the American states from 1978 to 2007. We conclude by discussing what our results imply for policy choices and representation.",1

One of the rationales for these reform efforts has been decreasing high levels of public sector politicization and patronage, the latter being understood as the “power of political leaders to distribute public sector posts” (Di Mascio 2012a, p. 379), and to provide public offices with professional and competent human capital (Dahlström et al. 2012). Nevertheless, privatizations of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have allowed the political class to continue holding appointment powers over these new private-public bodies (Bortolotti and Faccio 2009). On the one hand, the persisting partial ownership of those private-public entities, coupled with golden shares, enables the political class to influence the decision-making process by appointing politicians to their boards of directors (henceforth BODs), as shown by Bellò and Spano (2015) as to the Italian case . On the other hand, patronage is also an opportunity for distributive politics (Stokes et al. 2013). The focus of this paper is on the selection of politicians within the BODs of private-public enterprises (henceforth PPEs). In particular, we look for the determinants which could favor a parliamentarian’s appointment in such firms. Indeed, the law has in many cases reserved the choice of the BODs of PPEs to the Government; contemporaneously, no measures regulate parliamentarians’ incompatibilities with the positions in question.Footnote 1 Thus, the Government in charge may provide such appointments to parliamentarians and party members in general, choosing them, for instance, among legislators whose loyalty is tested during a legislature. In this paper we focus on three research questions. Firstly, we test whether the effort made in Parliament has an actual effect on the likelihood of members of Parliament (henceforth MPs) being appointed. We imagine that legislators who have proved to be more congruent with (or loyar to) their party needs are always preferred targets for this kind of patronage appointments, ceteris paribus.Footnote 2 Secondly, we also check whether these particular appointments represent a political means involving a strong element of the spoils system as described by Katz and Crotty (2006). Lastly, we try to verify whether we can interpret these appointments merely as instruments aimed at politicizing PPEs, i.e. guaranteeing a party presence on PPEs boards, or whether we can conceptualize them as valid means also providing these firms with expertise useful for them. Indeed, as pointed out by Grindle (2012), political discretion over appointments does not imply that the appointees are chosen without regard to competences and skills. Italy is a relevant case for the analysis of patronage appointments, as also evidenced by the huge amount of newspaper articles denouncing the pathological dimension that the phenomenon has assumed.Footnote 3 In general, politicization is deeper in Italy than in other European countries (Kickert 2011) and this politicization is reflected in the political control of administration, the relations between politicians and bureaucrats, the political appointments of officials, party patronage and clientelism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this kind of analysis has been performed: essentially, a lack of data has limited opportunities to investigate this research issue. As we will discuss in the next sections, there are some studies that analyze how parties behave with loyal MPs and how skilled they are. Said studies focus on the selection of MPs in order to run for a seat in Parliament. That is not the focus of this paper. In our opinion, the main objective of an MP is to be confirmed as MP. Hence, the appointment to a BOD is a secondary goal that MP could consider when leaving Parliament. Therefore, we will run a probit analysis on MPs in the XII, XIII and XIV legislature, considering the whole sample and the sub-samples of defeated and retired MPs. The analysis will suggest that MPs who exit Parliament receive an appointment to PPE boards if they signal their willfulness to follow party indication and if their outside options when leaving Parliament are limited. The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2, we review the related literature. In Sect. 3 we describe the data and the empirical strategy. In Sect. 4 we develop the econometric model. In Sect. 5 we present the results and conduct a general discussion of them. Section 6 contains the conclusions.

It solves many problems of collective action, reduces the need for formal agreements and improves property rights. Social capital is associated with many positive outcomes that foster prosperity, such as financial knowledge (Guiso et al. 2004). It is also linked with negative outcomes, such as crime. The existing literature generally concentrates on the effect of social capital on crime. Rosenfeld et al. (2001) and Buonanno et al. (2009) showed that social capital can be a strong deterrent to crime. However, the other side of the equation, i.e., the way in which crime affects social capital, has received little attention. Few works have focused on how individual crime victimization affects trust. Corbacho et al. (2015) analyzed the effect of victimization on horizontal and vertical social capital, finding that victims of crime are 10% less likely to trust the police compared to non-victims. Blanco (2013) and Blanco and Ruiz (2013) studied the role of victimization and the fear of crime on trust and support in democracy, along with other dimensions of trust, for Colombia and Mexico, finding a strong negative effect of victimization. In the present paper, we explore whether victimization affects trust in other people and in various types of organizations. In this way we can evaluate whether there are differences between organizations that directly manage law and order, such as the police, and those that do not, such as the media. We consider individual data taken from the AmericasBarometer for all the available Latin American countries from 2004 until 2012. As a result, we have above 100,000 observations, many more than previous studies. Using propensity score matching, we find strong evidence that those who are victims of crime have lower levels of trust. For example, a victim has 7% less trust in other people. We also find that trust is lower in institutions that directly manage law and order, such as the police. Trust is one of the main features of social capital (Coleman 1994; Putnam 1995, 2000), but not the only one. Other dimensions, such as civic engagement and election turnout, are also important in promoting economic development and reducing transaction costs. Despite their significance, few papers have evaluated the effect of crime on these other dimensions. In particular, we know little about how victimization affects participation in social groups. As far as our knowledge extends, only Bateson (2012) studied its role in political participation, finding a positive effect. In the present paper, we make several contributions: we consider the effect on a variety of social groups, not just political ones. We use the same dataset and econometric technique as those used in the analysis of trust. As the main outcome variable, we use All Groups, a dummy equal to one if the respondent participates once a week in various groups, and zero otherwise. Our econometric analysis shows that victims of any type of crime are about 2.5% more likely than non-victims to participate in some kind of social organization (using a single nearest neighbor). We explain such results using a psychological theory, known as the stress-buffer hypothesis (Cohen and Wills 1985). This states that a victim of crime seeks social support to alleviate the stress caused by such a negative experience. As a consequence, this individual will participate more in such groups. Since we are not psychologists, we will not explore this idea in detail, and do not pretend it to be the only explanation. As a robustness test, we repeat the estimations with the Chilean victimization survey (Chilean Ministry of The Interor and Public Security 2016), which largely confirms the previous findings. Victims of crime reduce their trust in other people and institutions but increase their participation in social organizations. As a final exercise, we perform the Rosenbaum Bounds (Rosenbaum 2002; Becker and Caliendo 2007) test for the presence of unobservables. This reveals that the results relative to trust are very robust, whereas we should be more cautious about the ones relative to participation. The findings of this paper are important from a policy perspective. On the one hand, victimization reduces individuals’ levels of social capital via reduced trust. On the other hand, it increases it, via participation in social organizations. This means that it is incorrect to say that victimization reduces social capital. Rather, victimization decreases trust. The net effect of victimization on social capital should be reconsidered in the light of these results.Footnote 1 This paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we review the literature on the links between victimization and social capital. Sections 3 and 4 explain the data, the econometric technique, and present the main results. Section 5 contains the robustness exercises. In the sixth section we conduct several sensitivity tests. Section 7 concludes.",3

21.0,2.0,Economics of Governance,21 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-019-00233-3,Borda paradox in the 2017 Iranian presidential election: empirical evidence from opinion polls,June 2020,Mehdi Feizi,Rasoul Ramezanian,Saeed Malek Sadati,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Iran has a theocratic presidential form of government. Every 4 years, a presidential election is held to announce the president based on the majority rule. If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the election is repeated for a second round between the top two candidates. Nevertheless, opinion polls give us this opportunity not only to see what would happen in different voting methods, but also to determine its anomalies and paradoxes. At least in Iran, the 2017 presidential election was the first time to have had some survey data with polling agencies reporting relative pluralities and also pairwise comparisons. On the one hand, the machinery does not still work perfectly since Iranians are experiencing elections for only a few decades and emotional instances might change voters’ attitude toward different candidates. On the other hand, most of the people do not identify themselves with a specific political party since there are no western-style political parties who campaign months before the Election Day. They make up their mind about whom to vote for very late, even in the last days before the Election Day. Meanwhile, their preference over candidates might vary a lot and be prone to different social and behavioral biases. Therefore, looking from this perspective, with not necessarily consistent and rational political preferences, it is expected to observe some paradoxes in political preferences of voters over candidates. To make a collective choice that genuinely represents the will of the people, we need to aggregate individual preferences socially via a voting method. Theoretically, three main voting methods are chosen for this study: The Plurality Rule, the Condorcet Method, and the Borda Count. The Plurality Rule elects the candidate with the most, and not necessarily the majority, of first-place votes. In other words, if the number of ballots ranking a candidate as the first preference is higher than those of other candidates, then the candidate is the winner in the plurality rule. While in pairwise majority rule, the winner of each contest between any pair is decided by the majority rule. The plurality rule is not indeed strategy-proof and tends to be biased toward extreme candidates. A Condorcet Method selects the candidate who would win in all of the one-to-one contests against each of the other candidates based on pairwise majority. Such a candidate is called the Condorcet winner while a candidate who would lose in all of the one-to-one contests is called the Condorcet loser. The Borda Count is a single-winner consensus-based voting method that gives each candidate, for each ballot, a number conforming to the sum of alternatives the voter ranked inferior. For instance, in an election with n candidates, each candidate gets \(n-1\) points for each of his votes as the first-choice, \(n-2\) points for each of his second-choice votes, and so on, with no point for each of his vote as a last-choice. Once all ballots have been calculated, the candidate with the most points is the winner. Nevertheless, as social choice theory suggests, making societal preferences based on individual preferences is not only problematic but also sometimes perplexing (Arrow 1963). The appearance of a paradox in elections casts doubt about effectiveness and fairness of democratic governance and makes some normative concerns on its relevance. Mackie (2003) confronted and subdued these doubts, and argued that problems of cycling, agenda control, and strategic voting are not that harmful, frequent, or irremediable. He also examined every serious empirical illustration of cycling and instability and showed that almost every empirical claim is inaccurate, and none is normatively troubling. Kurrild-Klitgaard (2014) also pointed out that cycles in social preferences appear to be occurring much less frequently than perhaps social choice theorists first thought. Nevertheless, they might exist and should be seriously taken as possibilities. Social scientists have identified some paradoxes that arise while dealing with social choices. The two well-known puzzles are Condorcet paradox, named after Marquis de Condorcet, and Borda paradox, after Jean-Charles de Borda. The strict Borda paradox arises when a plurality of voters prefer a candidate who is beaten in pairwise match-ups with each of the other candidates. (cf. Gehrlein 2006; Gehrlein and Lepelley 2011). The weak Borda paradox follows when at least one candidate could beat a plurality winner when compared head-to-head. The Condorcet paradox occurs when there is a cyclical majority in a head-to-head comparison of societal preferences between candidates even if the individual preferences of voters are acyclic. This means that for each candidate, it might be possible to select an opponent where the opponent would win a majority of the votes. e.g., A beats B, B beats C, but C also beats A. (cf., e.g., Gehrlein 2006; Gehrlein and Lepelley 2011). This cyclical majority is inconsistent since the majority’s desire is in conflict with each other and the availability of a losing candidate could influence election of the winner. The Condorcet paradox implies that the election has no Condorcet winner since no candidate can win a head-to-head election against other candidates. This will pose real problems to democratic decision making since once we only have societal ranking over candidates, there is no fair and deterministic resolution to solve this puzzle. Voting paradoxes are not just hypothetical mathematical or made-up hypothetical situations but rather the very reality of ordinary elections that might be highly consequential. These paradoxes may even interfere with real-world politics inadvertently as a by-product of institutional choices made earlier (Kaminski 2015). With these paradoxes, we might have a discrepant choice as it depends not only on societal preferences but also on voting arrangements. Since modern social networks, such as Facebook and Telegram, have allowed manipulation of news and beliefs, and also presentation of a fabricated view of reality, polls could assist a better understanding of societal trends by utilizing scientific and credible measurements. Although conducting polls in the course of electoral campaigns has increased lately, they mostly use plurality voting which does not elicit preference ranking over candidates. Therefore, it is not possible to measure potential voting paradoxes in the preference of voters since we do not have any information about the pairwise comparison of candidates. Hence, with the lack of actual data, it is not possible to assess paradoxes empirically in social choice. That was the reason why studies often reconstruct real preferences (Kaminski 2015: 367ff) or deal with hypothetical scenarios (Kurrild-Klitgaard 2001). Polling has recently become a universal toolbox in electoral campaigns to realize voters’ preferences and somehow open up what is going on in their minds. However, the problem has been once again raised as their data have been mostly private and not provided for general audiences. Although there is a growing literature on theoretical basis and implications of these paradoxes for social choice, there have been relatively few studies with empirical pieces of evidence of these puzzles in real elections. This lack of observational testimonies has mostly happened since in voting only one’s best choice is counted and his/her second or third, etc. choices are not. Empirical research studies have mostly failed to provide real-world evidence of theoretical phenomena studied in the social-choice literature such as cyclical collective preferences or strategic voting. The purpose of Lagerspetz (1993) was to show empirical relevance for theoretical results of social choice theory as almost all its theoretically interesting phenomena were evident in the 1956 Finnish Presidential elections. As it will be explained later in this paper, Lagerspetz (1997) analyzed the Finnish presidential elections in 1925, 1931, 1937 and 1982 and demonstrated that preference cycle and strategic voting have had a significant impact on those elections. Using pair-wise comparisons, Kurrild-Klitgaard (2001) suggests the existence of a real cyclical majority in a poll of Danish voters’ preferred prime minister. Moreover, this result is compared with those of a similar poll. However, each poll results in different choices when we use different voting methods. Kurrild-Klitgaard (2008) used survey data to analyze voter preferences for eight general elections for the Danish parliament. He concluded that three types of social choice paradoxes occurred in eight general elections for the Danish parliament though with different frequencies. 
Van Deemen (2014) reviewed the literature on empirical relevance of Condorcet’s paradox and investigated conditions on the domain of voter preferences to prevent the paradox, its likelihood, and empirical detection. His overall conclusion was that the empirical relevance of Condorcet’s paradox is still unsettled. Kurrild-Klitgaard’s study (2017) was one of the few studies with empirical evidence of Condorcet as well as Borda Paradoxes in real elections. Kurrild-Klitgaard identified that a cyclical majority might have existed in Republican voters’ preferences in the pre-primary 2015 by using polling data from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Furthermore, later polling data in early 2016 suggests that while Trump was the Plurality Winner with less than half of the total votes, he could have been the Condorcet Loser. This paper is intended to demonstrate that social choice paradoxes are indeed not only happening in elections but also might affect their outcomes. Our study follows the same procedure with different data and various results. We will conduct this research by using some specific polling data, before the 2017 Iranian presidential election, which have not previously received any attention. Our results not only prove the practical importance of theoretical voting paradoxes and importance of voting procedures but also shed some light on surprising and unforeseen outcomes of elections in Iran. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we will briefly review the 2017 Iranian presidential election. In Sect. 3, we introduce the main opinion polls conducted during electoral campaigns and focus on some specific dates when we had data from some of the polling agencies. In Sect. 4, we discuss the general results from all polls and present conclusions.",1

In 2015, for example, despite conditions of economic and fiscal hardship that have set macroeconomic indicators on an unsustainable path (World Bank 2016), political actors failed to approve important reform, such as a mandatory budget law. However, in November of the same year, the same political actors, operating in the same configuration of political power, approved law No. 44, a controversial reform aimed at “fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.”Footnote 1 Numerous accounts can be cited as to why some of these bills passed while others did not, which are mostly personalistic or related to Lebanon’s fractionalized consociational democracy (see Leenders 2012; Salamey 2014; Salloukh et al. 2015 for recent reviews). However, differing outcomes of political collaboration on reform despite a similar configuration of political power are commonplace in fractionalized countries (Williamson and Haggard 1994; Corrales 1998; Galasso 2014). Extant theoretical approaches tend to model the delay or adoption of reform with distributional conflict as a function of the degree to which a country is fractionalized (see Khemani 2017, for a review). While these models offer explanations for why reform gets delayed, they offer few insights into why actors encounter a varying degree of difficulty to collaborate on reform depending on the issue they are dealing with. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain observable variation in legislative output across time and policy areas. We leverage the framework to explore the mechanisms through which fractionalization affects political collaboration in Lebanon. We argue that the properties of a reform project determine the extent to which fractionalization affects political collaboration on reform: the higher the institutional requirements of a reform are, i.e., the number and nature of political actors and institutions involved in accrediting the legislation, and the broader its impact, i.e., the number of groups that are affected, the more fractionalization can impede political collaboration. We depart from previous research in two important ways. First, because political bargaining ultimately takes place in governmental institutions, we analyze the impact of fractionalization on political collaboration at a governmental level. We thereby refine the scope of recent empirical work, which analyzes the effects of fractionalization for a country as a whole, and not government itself. While extant research focuses on the impact of ethnic diversity (Alesina et al. 1999; Ashraf and Galor 2013), ethnic inequality (Kyriacou 2013; Alesina et al. 2016), and cross-cleavages (Finseraas and Jakobsson 2012) on political and economic outcomes, our contribution follows recent research in highlighting the impact of fractionalization within governmental institutions (Beach and Jones 2017). Second, we depart from extant literature on the political economy of reform by using legislation itself as a dependent variable, rather than aggregate reform indices or the amount or quality of public goods. Traditional reform indices mostly reflect changes in the regulatory environment of a given country and thereby risk conflating distinct causal connections that link collaboration and regulatory change (Babecký and Campos 2011; Campos and Horváth 2012). Similarly, analyzing the provisioning of public goods inherently restricts the analysis on a specific set of policy areas, such as education or health care. By treating reform as a multi-layered concept, we achieve a fuller understanding of the phenomena under investigation, that are, political collaboration and reform. We derive our core concepts from political transactions theory (Spiller and Tommasi 2003; Stein et al. 2006; Scartascini et al. 2013). To achieve reform, political actors need to engage in political collaboration, which requires political transactions in the form of intertemporal agreements. These transactions are intertemporal in nature in the sense that political concessions today are exchanged in return for concessions tomorrow. The central argument of political transactions theory is that the functioning of political institutions impacts upon the capacity of political actors to engage in political transactions and, hence, the quality of policies. Because the concept of political transactions applies to democratic regimes independent from the structure of a polity, we employ it as an epistemological framework in this paper. Moreover, we refer to fractionalization as the number of politically significant social groups with veto powers in the process of collaboration (Cox and McCubbins 2001; Tsebelis 2002). Extant studies on the political economy of reform find higher degrees of fractionalization to decrease the likelihood of reform in specific policy areas, such as trade or privatization (Banerjee and Munger 2004; Brooks and Kurtz 2007; Bortolotti and Pinotti 2008; Galasso 2014), and the ‘level’ of reform (Tsebelis 1999; Torenvlied and Haarhuis 2008). As many of these findings are results of panel-data regression analyses, however, they tend to leave transmission channels that could explain individual reform episodes underdetermined (De Scheemaekere et al. 2015; Mahmalat and Curran 2018). This study addresses this shortcoming by applying our framework to the case of Lebanon.Footnote 2 The country is a particularly relevant case to study as political interactions are largely determined by a high degree of fractionalization among sectarian communities and has a track record of low legislative output.Footnote 3 We present evidence in a mixed-methods approach in two steps. First, based on a novel database of legislative activity, we show that the core concepts of our framework help to explain variation in legislative output. We exploit a sudden reconfiguration of political power that occurred in 2005: the so-called Cedar Revolution, which ended Syrian military presence in Lebanon. The revolution led to the sudden, in its timing unexpected realignment of political power as the withdrawal of a political hegemon reinforced the position of political parties and enabled the (re)appearance of politically significant parties that had formerly been outlawed or oppressed. The effects of the revolution reduced the production of “high-profile” legislation with high requirements and broad impact, while it left legislative activity with lower requirements relatively unaffected (Sect. 3). In a second step, we discuss reasons for the reduction in high-profile legislative activity and use the framework to identify mechanisms that link the properties of reform projects to political collaboration (Sect. 4). The analysis is based on 32 guideline-based semi-structured expert-interviews with parliamentarians, ex-ministers, and government and party officials of all major political factions represented in the Lebanese parliament. We identify two mechanisms. First, uncertainty about time horizons of key actors reduces the incidence of legislation for which the duration of the collaboration game overstretches those of political actors in office. Second, a higher number of political actors requires more mutual trust to make intertemporal agreements credible in the absence of impartial enforcement mechanisms. Our findings contribute to existing literature in two important ways. First, our results help to make sense of ambiguous empirical evidence on the extent to which fractionalization affects the likelihood of reform. Following war-of-attrition models (Alesina and Drazen 1991) and veto-player theory (Tsebelis 2002), this literature argues that higher degrees of fractionalization in government settings protract reform over distributional conflict and the reduction of the win-set of the status quo. However, empirical evidence fails to confirm these arguments coherently in studies on different reform areas, such as product market reform, liberalization, or privatization (Campos and Horváth 2012; Mahmalat and Curran 2018). This paper offers a framework to explain observable variation of legislative activity across policy areas. It suggests that fractionalization impacts collaboration depending on the degree of mutual trust required to make intertemporal commitments credible. In environments without impartial enforcement mechanisms, trust gains in relevance the more players are affected by a reform project and take part in the collaboration game. As different policy areas impact different sets and numbers of social groups, trust among actors varies in importance for collaboration. Second, our findings elaborate on research which contends that governmental cycles influence the likelihood of reform (Pinea 1994; Williamson and Haggard 1994; Alesina et al. 2006; Høj et al. 2006; Tompson and Price 2009). The central argument of this strand of research is that governments are more likely to reform just after having taken office. This literature suggests two channels. First, governments enjoy higher legitimacy just after having taken office which allows them to enact more contentious reform. Second, governments want to pass contentious reform early in their legislature to allow the reform to take effect in an effort to avoid electoral backlashes. Our analysis offers a refinement of these mechanisms. The time-horizons of political actors affect collaboration depending on the requirements of a legislative project. As legislation increases in requirements and complexity, the elaboration and bargaining time prolongs and the more likely it is that reform take longer to pass than a ministers’ term in office. Short or uncertain time-horizons lead to friction losses as incentives increase to avert that other parties that follow suit reap any benefits of own efforts. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 develops the conceptual framework. Section 3 presents evidence of its applicability. Based on the framework, Sect. 4 identifies mechanisms by which fractionalization impedes collaboration. Section 5 concludes.",3

This is an important question for foreign policy makers who regularly find themselves wanting to alter the behavior of foreign governments in a way that is favorable to their interests. For instance, for US presidents, how to curb Jewish settlements in the West Bank and to contain nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea are important questions. In a world where she could have her wish, there is little doubt that the citizen of an established democracy would have a preference for proffering positive incentives to democracies while reserving sanction threats for nondemocracies. But what feels right may not be what is most efficient. As we shall see, a large number of political scientists who have done research on sanction threats have concluded that such threats are more effective when used against democracies than nondemocracies. And although rewards have not received as much attention as sanctions, at least one study concludes that democracies are less sensitive to promises of rewards than nondemocracies. Against popular wish, current science claims that democracies should be punished and nondemocracies rewarded. Israel should be threatened with sanctions while Iran and North Korea should be engaged with positive incentives. We revisit the issue of regime type and incentive form to conclude that neither the popular wish nor the scientific claim have it quite right. We argue, instead, that the question of the respective efficiency of sanctions and rewards is a non-linear function of regime type. Specifically, when we distinguish between three types of regimes lined up on an accountability continuum, governments in democracies are accountable, they are less so in limited autocracies, and from l east so to not at all in dictatorships. Given this trichotomy, we argue that sanctions and rewards work better with both extremes—democracies and dictatorships—than with the intermediate category of limited autocracy, for which only rewards work. In other words, we find a U-shaped relation between regime and effectiveness of incentive. It is intermediate regimes like Iran—regimes that are neither quite as democratic as Israel nor as absolutely autocratic as North Korea—that are the least responsive to sanctions. We make our argument by formalizing the consequences that sanctions and rewards have on the domestic make-up of the targeted country. In doing so, we incorporate the rally round the flag effect, the fifth column effect, and the extortion effect in the model. Specifically, we model that sanctions elicit rallies around the flag among groups who expect to benefit from the sanction and thus oppose compliance; that rewards elicit fifth-column effects among those who expect to benefit from the reward and thus support compliance; and that rewards may elicit extortion, a preemptive investment in wrongdoing on the part of the target government with an aim to raise the ante. It is only by modeling sanctions, rewards, and their respective side effects in “a unifying theoretical model of positive and negative incentives” that we may be able to determine under what circumstances sanctions, rewards, or a mix of the two constitute the most appropriate incentive. The theoretical model yields the claim that limited autocracies stand out from democracies and dictatorships by being less responsive to sanctions, and consequently by attracting more rewards. This is because limited autocracies uniquely reserve the ability to switch their supporting coalitions and thus can utilize the rally round the flag for their political benefits. The rally round the flag and fifth column effects can be felt in any type of regime, but we show that they only have significant consequences for rulers in limited autocracies that enjoy enough autonomy to strategically choose between compliance and defiance with a demand on the basis of the external incentives that are threatened or promised. This condition eliminates democratic leaders from that list, for they do not enjoy enough autonomy from their support base. In dictatorial regimes where no support of any coalition is ever necessary for the government to stay in power, rallies and fifth column effects are also inconsequential. In Sect. 2, we review existing findings on the matching of incentives to regime types and on the relative effectiveness of sanctions and rewards in general. Our goal is not to dismiss existing results but to bring them together in a unified theoretical framework. In Sect. 3, we present the model followed by detailed analysis of the model in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, we summarize testable predictions from the theoretical model that are subjected to an empirical test in Sect. 6. We discuss real world implications of the main argument in Sect. 7 before concluding in Sect. 8.",1

Its purpose is to maintain stability and prevent crises in the international monetary system. Most of the IMF’s daily business is decided by the Executive Board, which is chaired by the IMF Managing Director (MD). The latter is also the Fund’s most visible face to the public and head of its operating staff. To this day, the MD has always been a European national, pre-selected in informal coordination with the USA; and except for 9 weeks early 2019, when Kristalina Georgieva served as Acting President, the World Bank has similarly been led by an American. Georgieva was named successor to MD Christine Lagarde on 25 September 2019 and started a 5-year term on 1 October 2019. Little detail of her nomination and appointment—which necessitated canceling the maximum age requirement in the official By-Laws of the IMF—was made public. The Fund has a tradition of aiming for internal agreement without raising external attention. Emerging market and developing countries have been complaining about intransparent EU and US deals for long and have called for greater say in IMF decisions (see, e.g., Foreign Affairs, 9 June 2011). In January 2016, some of their demands were met. Based on the 14th General Review of Quotas, agreed in 2010, quota changes in favor of emerging economies came into force and it was affirmed that future MDs will be selected from  ... a shortlist of three candidates ... without geographical preferences. The shortlisting process will be implemented through indications of which candidates receive the most support among Directors, taking into account the Fund’s weighted voting system ... Although the Executive Board may select a Managing Director by a majority of the votes cast, the objective of the Executive Board is to select the Managing Director by consensus ... (IMF Press Release 16/19;Footnote 1 emphasis added). Practical decision making by the IMF, as by any other organization, may differ from declarations and by-laws. But negotiations and arm-twisting can generally be expected to take place in ‘the shadow’ of official voting rules: whatever consensus may arise on an issue was likely affected by the ways in which formal votes would have gone. The Fund’s weighted voting system has, therefore, received considerable research interest. See, e.g., investigations by Leech (2002, 2003), Alonso-Meijide and Bowles (2005), Aleskerov et al. (2008); Leech and Leech (2013), and Kurz (2016). Most of these studies have focused on the a priori distribution of voting power in the IMF, operationalized as decisiveness in a binary framework. This note makes similar a priori assumptions—abstracting from historical correlation patterns, alliances, etc. in order to assess the institutional playing field as such—but is novel in two respects. First, we study success rather than decisiveness.Footnote 2 That is, the (un)levelness of the current distribution of voting rights in the Executive Board is assessed in terms of expected satisfaction of members’ preferences rather than the probability to cast a pivotal vote. Second, we consider choice between three candidates shortlisted for the MD position, rather than a binary yes-or-no or a versus b vote. It seems plausible that other decisions by the Executive Board, not just selection of a new MD, and by similar voting bodies can involve more than two options, too. The present study thus complements binary voting analysis more generally.",3
21.0,3.0,Economics of Governance,19 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-020-00238-3,A theory of revolutionary organizations,September 2020,Mario Ferrero,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Despite the fact that the social science literature on revolution and kindred contests for political power fills up whole libraries, no theory as yet exists to analyze the working of a revolutionary organization—even when such an organization does exist. To be sure, many regime changes occur—and many more are attempted but fail—without the agency of a dedicated organization, either as the work of agents who already existed for different purposes, such as the military or other elite, or in the aftermath of exogenous shocks such as defeat in war and foreign occupation, or as the outcome of unplanned, spontaneous uprisings from the grassroots. Many successful or failed regime changes, however, do involve the work of a specialized, purposely designed organization; and often—though not always—such revolutionary organizations are committed to a goal of radical reorganization of society and are prepared to sustain a long-term struggle to achieve it. This paper offers a model of these long-horizon revolutionary organizations and then applies it to a sample of relevant historical cases. Besides being helpful in other ways that are incidental to the main concerns of this paper—such as providing some theoretical ground, as opposed to a list of circumstantial factors, to distinguish revolutions from other kinds of state takeover or violent contests for powerFootnote 1—our theory of revolutionary organizations, it is hoped, can advance our understanding of long-term political and societal change in two ways. First, it looks inside what has so far been a black box, which should allow a better understanding of the organization’s choices and responses to external conditions and hence of the revolutionary dynamics in a given time and place. Second, and at least as important, it suggests one way, grounded in the theory of the firm, to bridge the gap between revolution and reform in political economy. The literature on political transitions, exemplified by Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) and its successor research, has room for revolution only as a constraint on the elite, called the “revolution constraint”: the poor threaten revolution and expropriation, and the elite, in their own self-interest, respond by a combination of redistribution and democratization. Thus, the theory of revolution is linked to the theory of reform only through the choice of the ruling class, and the revolution itself remains unexamined as a threat point from “the people” in a redistribution game. However, the linkage may occur through the choices of a revolutionary organization. There are many important instances in which the revolutionary struggle was there but then it mutated into a struggle for reform—that is, erstwhile revolutionaries became reformers within the confines of existing political institutions. Thus, one and the same organization may be the agent of revolution and then turn into an agent of reform, or the other way around, and its structure may be the key to explaining the shift. When revolution is addressed by economists in its own right, it is in fact pictured as a generic insurgency or civil conflict in which a revolutionary organization is either absent or unexamined. In Grossman’s (1991) original approach, in a general equilibrium model the representative household devotes a fraction of its time to insurrectional activity, i.e. to appropriating the current income of the ruling class, rather than to work or leisure; here insurgents are in effect indistinguishable from bandits. In later developments (Grossman 1995, 1999), the revolutionary leader is a wealth maximizer who hires fighters at market wages—a wholesale borrowing from textbook firm theory with utter disregard for real-world revolutionary organizations. Yet, Grossman’s modeling approach is still followed today when required by the problem at hand (e.g. Apolte and Gerling 2018). Another stream of literature, exemplified by Bueno de Mesquita (2010), models a “revolutionary vanguard” that uses violence to mobilize the public by modifying their beliefs about everyone else’s willingness to participate in the movement against the government. But again, the vanguard itself remains a black box. Finally, in their recent assessment of the public choice approach to revolutions, Kuran and Romero (2019) focus exclusively on the dynamics of unanticipated collective explosions aimed at regime change, again ignoring the agency of revolutionary organizations and the strategic choices they face. Something seems to be seriously amiss in the above accounts. To take a step towards the real world, in this paper we emphasize two features of a revolutionary organization committed to action over a long time-horizon: the need for full-time, professional revolutionaries, as opposed to part-time insurgents or soldiers, and the related need to give them the appropriate incentives when the reward from success is both very uncertain and expected to materialize—if ever—in a distant future. In such conditions, the workers will need to be associated to the organization not as employees but as partners, sharing in its expected revenues and pooling their risks, and part of their rewards will have to come from parallel activities that yield benefits here and now, while the main struggle is still going on. At the same time, the parallel sector serves to build the followers’ trust in the organization and sustain their loyalty to the revolutionary struggle. Thus described, our revolutionary organization can be modeled as a two-sector producer cooperative, and the existing analytical apparatus that deals with this form of enterprise can be put to use.Footnote 2 In fact, we will argue that a number of important revolutionary organizations can be well reconstructed as cooperatives, ranging from the socialist parties of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to a number of nationalist parties fighting for independence and self-determination, to the Islamist organizations of today’s world. Furthermore, owing to the special comparative-statics properties of a two-sector cooperative, the parallel sector, when successful, can expand at the expense of revolution and finally take on a life of its own, forgoing revolution and turning into full-fledged reform—something that could never happen in a profit-maximizing firm à la Grossman; this will depend, however, on the market environment in which the parallel sector operates. Thus, building on Ferrero’s (2004a) model of the revolution versus reform dilemma in twentieth-century socialism, our model highlights an endogenous mechanism, grounded in the organization’s cooperative structure, which may trigger a switch from revolution to reform, overcoming the separation that prevails in the current literature. In the quote at the beginning of this paper, taken from a classic American adventure movie set in the terminal days of the Mexican revolution, Burt Lancaster poignantly asks, who are the good guys. The scholarship on revolution and conflict has mostly dodged the question, converging on an implicit consensus that it all depends on one’s point of view—and who cares anyway? However, they do care—revolutionaries have always yearned to be acknowledged as different from other power-seekers; witness the Bengali nationalists who, during the struggle for India’s independence, were labeled terrorists by the British—to say nothing of the Irish revolutionaries. And we should care too because, as our model will show, the distinction proposed here carries important implications for counter-insurgency policies. The approach of this paper provides one answer to Burt Lancaster’s question: the “good guys” here are the revolutionaries who, by committing to a long horizon, building the structures required for such a long haul, and bearing the attendant cost, at least give their supporters an assurance that they are no quacks selling empty promises and taking advantage of their goodwill. Needless to say, here the “good” label is only meant to describe trustworthiness in exchange and need not imply endorsement or sympathy for their doings. In the remainder of this paper we first (Sect. 2) lay out a collection of observable features that sharply distinguish organizations engaged in radical long-term struggles from other types of insurgencies and protest movements. Next, Sect. 3 develops the model of a two-sector cooperative organization and emphasizes the potential bifurcation between pursuing revolution and turning to reform. Section 4 then reviews a sample of historical case studies that fit the description and can be subjected to the predictions of the model. The final section discusses some policy implications and concludes.",

For instance, the so-called Second Generation of fiscal federalism theoretical models have deepened our understanding of the potential role that political economy considerations can play as determinants of the economic performance of decentralized systems (Weingast 2009; Oates 2005). One area of investigation for which Second Generation models open up especially promising perspectives is the empirical investigation of the determinants of decentralization, which remain surprisingly little explored despite a well-documented global trend towards delegation of expenditure and revenue decisions to lower level governments. While the essentially normative focus of the First Generation theories might have limited their appeal as a guide to empirical research, positive Second Generation theories typically lend themselves naturally to empirical implementation.Footnote 3 In this paper, we anchor our empirical analysis of the determinants of decentralization in a political economy theory of ‘partial expenditure decentralization’ (Joanis 2014).Footnote 4 That theory’s main testable prediction pertains to the determinants of the degree of decentralization: decentralization is endogenous and depends, among other factors, on the relative political conditions prevailing at each level of government, i.e. the extent to which each level of government can affect its electoral fortunes by contributing to the public good. The paper’s endeavour is to test this key prediction empirically by estimating the effect of political considerations on the de facto degree of (partial) expenditure decentralization. It is tested with data from a panel of Canadian provinces. To the best of our knowledge, the paper is the first to test the predictions of a formal political economy theory of decentralization’s determinants in a within-country application dealing with national-subnational decentralization.Footnote 5 To perform such an analysis, we exploit Canada’s Provincial Economic Accounts data as they exhibit the key feature of compiling public spending by the federal government within each province, together with comparable data on provincial and local governments. Being one of the world’s most decentralized federations, Canada displays ample cross-province heterogeneity and over-time variation in the de facto degree of expenditure decentralization, making it an ideal laboratory for our purposes. Our paper is related to a still fairly small (but growing) empirical literature on the determinants of fiscal decentralization, where decentralization is measured in terms of a revenue or expenditure ratio between different levels of government. An early, cross-sectional attempt is Panizza (1999), who finds that country size, income, ethnic fractionalization and the degree of democracy all reduce the degree of fiscal centralization. Complementary results with a focus on economic and institutional variables are presented by Arzaghi and Henderson (2005), Treisman (2006), Bodman and Hodge (2010) and Sacchi and Salotti (2014), using country panels. Also in cross-country panels, Dreher et al. (2018) and Jametti and Joanis (2016) explicitly consider political and institutional variables. With a specific focus on institutions, Stegarescu (2009) provides, in a panel of OECD countries, an insightful take on the role played by political integration as a force behind both fiscal centralization and decentralization. Our paper empirically tests a political economy theory of the determinants of decentralization in a within-country panel, thus allowing us to introduce explicitly the effects of political choices on the national-subnational degree of decentralization while directly tackling the inherent endogeneity issues (through fixed effects and IV regressions). The other within-country studies that we are aware of deal with the rather different issue of subnational-local decentralization.Footnote 6 Our paper is also related, but to a lesser extent, to the large body of empirical research investigating decentralization as a determinant of various economic variables.Footnote 7 Consistent with the theoretical model’s predictions, our empirical results show that the de facto degree of federal-provincial expenditure decentralization within a province increases with the electoral strength of the provincial government and decreases with the electoral strength of the federal government, together with being affected significantly by the partisan affiliation of both levels of government. The effect of political variables and other controls are identified within province and over time, with province fixed effects included in all empirical specifications. This allows us to control for systematic differences between provinces that may jointly influence provincial politics and the degree of expenditure decentralization, such as the provincial-municipal fiscal arrangements or the specificity of a province’s political landscape and economic structure. In addition, any common shock affecting all provinces—such as federal policies—is controlled for by year fixed effects in our baseline specifications. A series of alternative empirical specifications, including an IV regression exploiting campaign spending data, are presented to assess the robustness of our main results. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays down the theoretical model and derives empirically-testable predictions. Section 3 introduces the Canadian data used to test the model’s predictions. The empirical strategy and results are presented in Sect. 4, while Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Prinz,Christian J. Sander,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As a reaction to citizens’ dissatisfaction with the political leadership in Saudi Arabia, the new crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, announced a series of reforms for modernizing the state and reducing the influence of religious fundamentalists (Lacroix 2019). Meanwhile, protesters in Iran also demand restrictions on muslim clerics’ say in political issues (Abdoh-Tabrizi and Shahi 2020). In this paper, we engage with the general question of how the interaction of religion with the political system of a country is associated with government performance. More precisely, we present a comparative analysis of the quality of public goods and services in alternative political regimes. We thereby differentiate between religious and non-religious forms of non-democratic leadership. Furthermore, we provide an argument linking religious diversity to the quality of public goods and services. It is well-known that religions, as cultural institutions, have survived because of their significance in personal life, as well as in enabling an effective community. Although it is difficult to define religion in all its aspects, it seems generally accepted that religion is part of culture, understood as a framework of shared values and implicit rule systems (Kasper et al. 2012, p. 178). Religion entails spiritual and transcendental beliefs and provides a system of values and behavioral norms. As mental and social constructs,Footnote 1 religions influence both preferences and behavior.Footnote 2 From an institutional economics viewpoint, religions are often considered as formal organizations rather than institutions at the level of society, because they are purpose-oriented and have a hierarchical structure (see the definition of organizations in Kasper et al. 2012, p. 108). Nonetheless, within these organizations, there are institutionalized formal and informal rules for social behavior; the latter indicating that religions may be interpreted as both organizations and institutions (see Kasper et al. 2012, pp. 106, 108 ff. for a definition of institutions and their different forms). As organizations with institutionalized rules, religions can become politically relevant or even dominant. This is the key point for analysis in this paper. Religions as organizations may be theocracies, defined below as authoritarian political systems that are led by individuals at the apex of a religious elite. The legitimization of this kind of leadership comes at least partially from the religion itself. In this respect it differs clearly from other autocratic political systems and from democracies. While Western societies developed their institutions mainly independently of, or even in conflict with religions, the separation of politics and religion, prevalent in contemporary Western societies, is not common in other parts of the world. In Europe, the separation of the church and the state started in the medieval age (Pollack et al. 2013). As indicated by the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) in Europe, it took a long time for this separation to be completed. From a global viewpoint, however, the separation of religion and politics remains incomplete. For instance, countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also the Vatican, are still examples of theocracies, at least according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica (2020). A theocracy may be defined by three key constituents: the government consists of divinely guided leaders, government leaders are clerical persons and the legal system originates from religious laws (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2020). Although some democratic elements, such as general parliamentary elections, are also established in theocratic countries, they do not play a prominent role in politics. Put differently, theocratic countries are those that are not politically secularized. Moreover, according to this definition, theocracies cannot be considered democracies. In a democracy, the legitimization of political power is granted for a certain period of time by the country’s electorate. This contradicts and runs contrary to the devine origin of political power in a theocracy. In this paper, the association between religious leadership and religious diversity and the quality of public goods and services is analyzed. Based on three archetypical forms of society, i.e. a theocratic regime with religious leadership, an autocratic regime, and a democracy, we analyze the quality of public goods and services in a simple Buchanan–Brennan Leviathan framework. The respective political leaders provide public goods and services that are paid for by taxes in order to legitimize their leadership in all regimes. Furthermore, all leaders appropriate some private goods for themselves and their political supporters. However, the extent and legitimization of the political establishment differ between regimes. Our theoretical framework implies that the population is less satisfied with the quality-adjusted level of public goods and services in theocratic or autocratic regimes than in democratic regimes. In addition, theocratic leaders provide religious goods and services to legitimize their rule, whereas in autocratic and democratic regimes these goods are provided privately. The private provision of religious public goods in non-theocracies may reduce the perceived quality of public goods and services, which are supplied by the state, as these goods are—at least in some parts—substitutes for each other. For instance, social welfare, health care, kindergartens or schools may be provided by religious groups or by the state. We argue that the private provision of religious public goods is higher in countries with greater religious homogeneity, due to economies of scale. Consequently, religious diversity may reduce the private provision of religious goods and increase the perceived quality of public goods provided by the state, since the state’s supply is less contested. We test the theoretical differences in the quality of public goods and services by using data of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project in 190 countries, as well as data on the religious diversity and political system of these states. In particular, the so-called delivery quality indicator is applied as a measure of the quality of public goods and services in the included states. The religious diversity within countries and their political regime are considered as the crucial determinants of delivery quality. As an innovation, we combine the dichotomous democracy–autocracy regime data provided by Bjørnskov and Rode (2020), with information about the separation of religion and state, in order to categorize a country’s political regime as either theocratic, autocratic, or democratic. The empirical analysis shows that the political system does matter indeed for the provision of public goods and services. All specifications demonstrate that theocratic and autocratic regimes are associated with a lower average delivery quality than democracies. Delivery quality does not differ systematically between theocratic and autocratic societies. However, there is a statistically significant positive association between religious leadership and delivery quality in strict autocracies (polity 2 range from − 10 to − 2). Higher religious diversity is linked to higher levels of delivery quality in democracies only. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, the relevant literature is reviewed. Section 3 derives the hypotheses. The empirical investigation is presented in Sects. 4 and 5. Section 6 concludes.",4

A roadmap,December 2020,Hans Gersbach,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For better or worse, we daily contribute to powerful monopolies: We use products of the world’s largest technology companies—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.Footnote 1 The more of us are using them, the more useful they become to us. Several further aspects make this type of monopoly self-strengthening (see e.g. Müller and Wambach (2018); Crémer et al. (2019)). First, if an internet service like Google attracts more users, its search results become more relevant and its algorithms more refined, which makes it more attractive for individual users and thus for advertising companies—so that Google reaps more benefits. Second, many of the services offered by so-called “Tech Giants” are free of charge for the individual customers, thus heightening incentives to join and use these services. The growing number of users allows to demand higher prices for advertising on theses services. Of course, the users pay for the services without noticing it, by paying attention to advertisement and by contributing to valuable databases. Third, for those services and products we do have to pay, the positive network effects entail better products. As so many people use Microsoft products, for example, these products are more likely to be improved constantly, and the programming of any new (external) application will ensure its being compatible with Microsoft products. This, in turn, will attract more consumers and reinforce Microsoft’s monopoly. Fourth, although Tech Giants also face competition for services and products, their monopoly manifests itself in various forms. Amazon offers a wide range of products. This makes it attractive to buyers and sellers, but also relegates competitors to “niche products”, on a smaller scale. Apple has built up such an impressive reputation for innovative, attractive “must-have” design and the flair of innovation in functionalities that customers are practically addicted to its products. Fifth, thanks to their economic power, Tech Giants can buy competitors and innovative startups, or discourage them, and while a few years ago, we were using Tech Giants by choice, we are now trapped into using them for want of equivalent alternatives.",

W. Temple,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The number of democracies in the world was broadly steady, or expanded, every year between 1975 and 2007 (Diamond 2015). But after this point, the unprecedented expansion of freedom and democracy ceased. There was no net expansion in the number of electoral democracies, and even an incipient decline, or what Diamond terms a ‘democratic recession’. The economic consequences of this are uncertain, since the roles of political rights and institutions in growth remain debated. Some autocracies may be insulated from lobbying and other political pressures, and able to make long-term decisions that might be unpopular in the short run but effective in the long run (Olson 1993). This argument generally appeals to successful growth episodes under periods of autocracy: China, Indonesia, Singapore or South Korea, or more recently, Ethiopia. But there is an obvious problem with this approach, which is that many autocracies have a weak growth record.Footnote 1 For a domestic population - who often have little say in the matter - autocracy could be a risky gamble with their prospects, relative to democracy.Footnote 2 Sah (1991) and Weede (1996) may have been among the first to consider this question. Przeworski et al. (2000, p. 177) showed that most growth miracles and growth disasters occurred under dictatorships. Later work by Almeida and Ferreira (2002) also found that growth outcomes have been more variable across autocracies than across democracies, but in most of their analyses, the data ended in 1989. Others to consider variation by regime type include Rodrik (1997), Glaeser et al. (2004), Besley and Kudamatsu (2008), Knutsen (2018), and Luo and Przeworski (2019). This paper revisits the question using the latest available data, spanning more than fifty years, rather than the twenty years covered in Almeida and Ferreira (2002). Like them, we show that long-term growth outcomes vary much more across autocracies than across democracies. Importantly, this is true even when rich countries are excluded. This seems to be a general result, since we draw on a range of data sets on political regime classifications, all of which point in the same direction. In more detail, the paper contributes to the literature in several ways, beyond the long time span. We carry out robust variance tests, better suited to this type of data than some of the methods previously used in the literature. We examine whether outcomes under autocracy vary less if we remove certain types of autocracy from the analysis, but this does not eliminate the variation in long-term growth outcomes under autocracy. We do find, however, that the cross-section variance is highest for closed autocracies, then electoral autocracies, and lowest for democracies.Footnote 3 Finally, we also look at channels: are political regimes reflected in the dispersion of investment rates and productivity growth? The evidence on channels is more tentative than the results we find for growth rates, but again suggests that the cross-section variance is highest for closed autocracies, then electoral autocracies, and lowest for democracies. The dispersion of outcomes under autocracy is sometimes loosely equated with ‘fat tails’ in outcome distributions, and the chances of extreme outcomes such as growth miracles and growth disasters. Conceptually, the shape of the tails is separate from dispersion: all normally distributed variables share the same kurtosis, regardless of their variances. One novel aspect of the current paper is that we look for excess kurtosis, to see whether extreme growth outcomes are more likely than a normal distribution with the same variance would predict. Our results suggest that growth outcomes do often show fat tails even in this more technical sense, but the evidence is not always decisive. Why do outcomes vary so much under autocracy? One argument is that autocracies differ, and what could seem at first glance like fine distinctions might be central to growth. Knutsen (2018) discusses some of these distinctions, such as protection for property rights, the presence of a legislature, the role of parties, and the nature of the coalition supporting a leader. Our finding that outcomes vary most across closed autocracies, rather than electoral autocracies, is consistent with the idea that autocracies differ. But we also show that excluding one type of autocracy is never enough to bring the cross-section variance into line with that under democracy. We demonstrate this using several datasets, with varying approaches to classifying political regimes. Another interpretation is that autocracy makes outcomes contingent on the decisions of a small number of people, leading to variability. Sah (1991) emphasizes that individual decision-makers are potentially fallible. By involving a larger number of decision-makers, decentralized societies are likely to avoid the extreme outcomes (good and bad) that might be seen in autocracies.Footnote 4 In more centralized societies, the abilities of particular individuals become more important (see also Sah and Stiglitz 1991). Sah argues that his account is broadly consistent with observed outcomes under autocracy since the 1950s. Using data since the Second World War, Jones and Olken (2005) found that exogenous deaths of autocratic leaders led to changes in growth rates, whereas this has not been true for the exogenous deaths of democratic leaders. The arguments in Sah (1991) and Sah and Stiglitz (1991) are related to the ancient idea of the wisdom of crowds, which goes back to Aristotle.Footnote 5 But where the usual version of the wisdom of crowds says that collective decision-making leads to better mean outcomes, here we ask what democracy means for the dispersion of outcomes. In assessing the consequences of democracy and autocracy, comparisons of both mean and variance are relevant, and yet the variance has been explored less than the mean, and excess kurtosis not at all. A large literature looks at whether democratizations lead to faster growth, with recent contributions including Acemoglu et al. (2019) and an extension by Eberhardt (2019).Footnote 6 The recent papers use within-country variation and typically have to assume that there is no selection into democracy based on time-varying unobservables. In our case, it is the variance of growth rates across countries that we are investigating, rather than the conditional mean of the growth rate. As Almeida and Ferreira note, the conditional distribution of growth — conditional on a democracy index—could vary even when mean growth is the same across political regimes. This is a separate question from whether growth is more volatile within autocracies than within democracies; for evidence on this see Rodrik (2008, pp. 168–180) and (Knutsen 2018). The results in this paper have implications for panel data studies of democratization and growth. If some autocracies grow much faster than others, we should not expect to see uniformity in the causal effect of democratization on growth. In abstract terms, heterogeneity could arise from the origin, the destination, or the journey. In more concrete terms, variation in the treatment effect of democratization could arise because autocracies differ, democracies differ, or transitions to democracy differ. Our work suggests that at least the first of these is likely to be relevant; so democratization may lower growth in some countries, and raise it in others.Footnote 7 Where an analysis recovers only the average treatment effect, its interpretation will depend on the initial composition of the set of autocracies. Given selection into democracy, we need to be careful about inferring causality. On a cautious interpretation, we investigate stylized facts that could constrain future theoretical analyses; if there is an association between autocracy and the cross-section variance of growth rates, future work will need to respect this association. In other words, even when there is selection into democracy, any candidate structural account of the origins and consequences of democracy will need to be consistent with the reduced-form fact that long-term growth varies more across autocracies. For example, Paltseva (2010) presents a model in which autocracies deliver either the best or the worst performance, while democracies fall in an intermediate range. In her model, selection into democracy turns on whether or not it is possible to extract resource rents.Footnote 8 Among recent papers, the closest to our work is Knutsen (2018). He looks at cross-section variances but considers a much longer time span than we do, and investigates the links between growth rates and specific features of dictatorships. Our work is complementary, based on different tests and graphical devices; distinguishing between closed and electoral autocracies in determining the cross-section variance of growth rates; considering excess kurtosis; and studying the cross-section variances of investment rates and productivity growth. The next section describes the data, before Sect. 3 reports the main findings. Section 4 looks at some channels through which regime type could matter, before Sect. 5 concludes.",1
22.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,01 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-021-00249-8,The effect of California’s top-two primary system on voter turnout in US House Elections,March 2021,Daniel D. Bonneau,John Zaleski,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 2010 California voters passed Proposition 14 and implemented the “top-two primary” system that is now in place for all statewide elections, excluding Presidential elections. Traditional primary systems use internal nominating contests to decide which candidate will represent the party in the general election. Conversely, the top-two system does not use internal nominating contests. Rather, each candidate runs on a single primary election ballot. The two candidates with the largest share of the vote, regardless of political affiliation, will be the candidates listed on the general election ballot. Since the 1990s, California electorates have increasingly preferred extreme candidates, leading to polarization within the state (Jacobson 2004). The top-two primary was pitched as a way to incentivize candidates to seek more votes from the political center during the primary contest (Nagler 2015). In theory, this should also increase proximity voting, as constituents are able to select candidates most similar to their own ideological preferences (Ahler et al. 2016). However, through conducting an experiment on likely voters, Ahler et al. (2016) found that voters do not possess enough information to know which candidate is most closely aligned to their ideological preferences. This top-two system creates the potential that two candidates affiliated with the same party will appear on the general election ballot. As of early 2019, nearly 80% of the members in the California State Assembly are Democrats. Additionally, Republicans have only accounted for roughly 20% of all US Representatives from the state since 2000. In such a state that decidedly favors one party of the other, it may be argued that placing two candidates more closely aligned with the median voter within the state or electoral district may increase the competitiveness of the general election. This is in contrast to the traditional system in which the primary for the Democratic party within California may be more competitive than the general election. The top-two system would shift the most competitive race to the general election, where there is typically higher voter turnout. However, voters may be slow to adjust to the increased importance of the primary election. This may be exceptionally true in the first elections using this system. This concern is also likely to be more pronounced for members of the minority party in the district. As a consequence, minority party voters may chose to abstain from that particular race in the general election, even though they participate in the races higher on the ballot. This paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of the effect of the top-two primary on voter turnout and roll-off in the general election. Two papers are of critical importance to this study. Nagler (2015) evaluates the probability of strategic voting after California’s implementation of a top-two primary system. The findings suggest that there is little crossover voting present, but that there may be levels of voter abstention in particular races that featured candidates from the same party. Building off these results, Highton et al. (2016) compares the voter roll-off for the U.S. and California Senate and Assembly races and finds that these results persist in a more rigorous analysis. Our analysis varies from these papers in a few key ways. Most notably, Nagler (2015) only analyzes the first year of the top-two primary (2012) and while Highton et al. (2016) analyzes 2014 as well, our expanded sample size through 2018 provides 18 more non-traditional races for analysis. In addition, we consider non-traditional elections that include a third-party. Our identification strategy diverges from previous studies with the use of party registration as our variable of interest. Finally, our analysis extends their state-level results to U.S. Congressional races. Our results confirm those found at the state level, with voter roll-off increasing up to 7% for the House.Footnote 1 Informing this idea of voter abstention is the seminal work of Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996). The authors provide a theoretical justification for less-informed voters to abstain from voting even if voting is a costless process. This phenomenon, coined as the “Swing Voters Curse”, explains the importance of indifference between candidates in the decision process of these less-informed voters to abstain. While the theory does not directly address the phenomenon discussed in the present study, its theoretical foundation is useful in informing the analysis. If we suppose that Republican voters, for example, are less-informed about Democratic candidates, and view them nearly as two sides of the same coin, this phenomenon may be present. Importantly, the idea that voting has low costs after beginning the ballot, it substantiates the idea that the Republican voters in the example above may strictly prefer abstention to voting. Introducing partisanship into the equation, Battaglini et al. (2010) experimentally test the Swing Voters Curse. This seems useful in considering the setting introduced by Proposition 14. However, if the alternative to the partisan presented in their model is not truly an alternative (in the beliefs of the voters) then the documented offsetting behavior of less-informed voters may not be likely to occur.Footnote 2 There may be concern that we are placing too much weight on the partisan label of candidates. Contrary to the argument made above, it may be the case that voters are able to see past the party labels and notice the nuanced differences between candidates under the same party label. This potential was explored in Bonneau and Cann (2015) using partisan labels in U.S. judicial elections. Their findings suggest that voters were able to ascertain party identification in nonpartisan elections based on ideological cues or policy preferences. Applying this result to the current study can inform our analysis when the general ballot omits a major party in favor of a third-party. Voters for the omitted party may not view the third-party candidate as ideologically different than the opposing major party candidate. Therefore, even though this isn’t a top-two primary with both candidates affiliated with the same party, voters for the opposing major party may view it as such. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses previous research on various forms of primaries, while Sect. 3 surveys the literature more directly on voter turnout in general elections. Section 4 presents the data for each analysis. Section 5 discusses the data used for analysis. Section 6 presents the results. Finally, Sect. 7 offers concluding remarks.",1
22.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,21 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-020-00246-3,Oil bonanza and the composition of government expenditure,March 2021,Keisuke Okada,Sovannroeun Samreth,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There have been debates in the “resource curse” literature about whether natural resources are a curse or a blessing.Footnote 1 Proponents of the resource curse hypothesis have indicated that the endowment of natural resources can have negative socio-economic and political consequences. One notable negative consequence, the widely known “Dutch disease,” explains the possible negative effects of resource abundance on an economy. Resource revenue will induce currency appreciation, causing contraction of the manufacturing sector (Corden and Neary 1982). A seminal study in this regard shows that natural resource abundance lowers economic growth and provides a supportive view of Dutch disease (Sachs and Warner 1995). Over-estimating revenue from natural resources can lead to over-consumption for unproductive purposes (Weil 2013). This temptation to increase consumption may cause persistent budget deficits and have an adverse effect on the economy. In addition to its negative economic effects, natural resource abundance can also have toxic effects on politics or institutional quality (e.g., Ross 2001; Bulte et al. 2005).Footnote 2 Lucrative revenue from natural resources can lead to an increase in rent-seeking activity and corruption, or possibly armed conflicts, as experienced by countries such as Nigeria and Sierra Leone. However, other research argues that resource abundance does not necessarily lead to adverse consequences. Some recent studies argue that natural resources have a positive effect on economic development (e.g., Alexeev and Conrad 2009; Smith 2015). These different streams of research in the literature indicate that the effects of natural resource abundance are not straightforward. Given the differing views, research on the socio-economic and political effects of resource abundance is important and worth pursuing. Many studies have focused on examining the effects of natural resource endowments on economic development and the quality of institutions. In an attempt to provide new evidence, this study investigates the effects on government behavior (i.e., government expenditure), which has not been sufficiently addressed by previous studies. In general, governments of natural resource-rich countries depend heavily on revenue from natural resources. For example, in Nigeria, oil has accounted for 70–85% of all government revenue and 90–95% of all foreign exports since the 1970s (Amundsen 2017). Because of this high dependency, natural resources undoubtedly play an important role in shaping government behavior. Motivated by this possibility, this study comprehensively investigates how natural resources affect the size and composition of government expenditure. This study differs from previous studies and contributes to the literature in several aspects. First, we investigate the detailed effects of natural resources on the size and composition of government expenditure.Footnote 3 One may note that these effects are not necessarily clear, depending on the socio-economic and political environment. If natural resource companies are completely state-owned, government revenue as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to increase. Alternatively, if resource companies are completely privately owned, natural resource windfalls do not necessarily increase government revenue to a large degree. Government revenue also depends on the royalties and taxes imposed by the government. How natural resources affect the composition of government expenditure is also ambiguous. Some studies examine their effects on specific government expenditure, for example, health expenditure (Cockx and Francken 2014), educational expenditure (Gylfason 2001; Cockx and Francken 2016), and military expenditure (Cotet and Tsui 2013a; Ali and Abdellatif 2015). In an attempt to provide new evidence and a significant extension, our study examines government fiscal behavior in a more comprehensive manner and focuses on seven specific areas of expenditure: health, social protection, education, economic affairs, general public services, defense, and public order and safety. Detailed investigation of this nature may provide more insights into the relationship between natural resources and government behavior and various policy implications may arise. Second, this study focuses on the effect of giant oilfield discoveries. Because these discoveries result in the exogenous variation of resource windfalls, as Lei and Michaels (2014) point out, focusing on them avoids the possibility of biased estimation results caused by endogeneity problems. Previous studies have analyzed natural resource exports, natural resource rents, and natural capital wealth as proxies for resource dependence. When examining the effects on government expenditure, using these measures may result in endogeneity problems such as simultaneity and reverse causality. These issues should be addressed because they can cause biased estimation results and incorrect implications. Our identification approach addresses this by using giant oilfield discoveries as a proxy for resource windfalls, which are exogenous shocks. Third, this study considers the mediation role of democracy on the effect of natural resources on the size and composition of government expenditure. Democratization generally extends the franchise to poor citizens, and therefore nurtures redistribution (Meltzer and Richard 1981). Furthermore, the consolidation of democracy emphasizes checks and balances on government behavior. The government in a more democratic country generally has less decision-making power. We investigate how the level of democracy holds governments accountable and maintains transparency regarding expenditure. This examination can provide important implications regarding the role of democracy.Footnote 4 Our study is closely related to previous studies on the relationship between natural resources and overall government expenditure. The macroeconomic effects of giant oil and gas field discoveries have been investigated by Arezki et al. (2017). Their study shows that aggregate investment increases after giant oil field discoveries, and this effect is caused by private investment, not public investment. Next, resource windfalls increase municipal revenue and spending on public goods and services in Brazilian municipalities, although household income does not necessarily increase (Caselli and Michaels 2013). Furthermore, previous studies examine the relationship between natural resources and specific government expenditure, such as health, education, and military. We note that the results are not easily comparable because they use different proxies for natural resources and different estimation methodologies. Some studies investigate the effects of natural resource abundance on government expenditure on health and education. Natural resource abundance decreases public health spending significantly (Cockx and Francken 2014).Footnote 5 Regarding educational spending and outcome, natural resource abundance has a negative effect on educational inputs, outcomes, and participation (Gylfason 2001). Resource dependence decreases education spending significantly (Cockx and Francken 2016). The previous literature discusses the effect of natural resource abundance on military expenditure.Footnote 6 Whereas oil discoveries do not necessarily increase the likelihood of political violence, they increase military expenditure in non-democratic countries (Cotet and Tsui 2013a). This relationship is also investigated using data from the Middle East and North Africa countries (Ali and Abdellatif 2015), showing that oil and forest rents increase military expenditure, but coal and natural gas rents decrease it. However, the causality issue is not addressed sufficiently; natural resource rents may not be an exogenous variable of military expenditure. In addition, several studies focus on the political determinants of military expenditure (Albalate et al. 2012; Nordhaus et al. 2012; Töngür et al. 2015). Finally, resource discoveries do not have any effect on revenue decentralization, which leads to expenditure centralization (Bhattacharyya et al. 2017). This study also contributes to the literature on the relationship between political regimes and government expenditure. The political system does not influence fiscal variables other than revenue used for aid (Easterly and Rebelo 1993). Furthermore, as democracy is consolidated, military expenditure decreases but nonmilitary government consumption, education spending, and social spending remain the same (Mulligan et al. 2004). Regarding the effects of democratization on the size and composition of government expenditure, democratization decreases military expenditure and increases health expenditure, whereas it does not have an effect on total government expenditure (Kotera and Okada 2017). More expenditure on education and health is assured in a democratic regime; however, this increase does not necessarily guarantee better education and health outcomes without more institutional reforms (Nelson 2007). Democracy does not necessarily have a significant effect on tax revenue and tax composition when controlling for countries’ fixed effects (Profeta et al. 2013). Using data on 168 countries between 1972 and 2008 for the estimation, the main findings of our study are summarized as follows. Whereas the results show weak evidence of the effect of oilfield discoveries on total government expenditure in the medium and long run, the effects are more evident in the short run, especially when controlling for other factors affecting the total government expenditure. In addition, democracy has a mediating effect on this increasing effect. If the democracy level in a country is consolidated, the government size does not increase even when giant oilfields are discovered. This finding may indicate that checks and balances in a democratic system function as a factor that constrains government temptation to increase expenditure. Considering each category of government expenditure, giant oilfield discoveries increase expenditure on health and social protection significantly, whereas they decrease educational expenditure. Furthermore, giant oilfield discoveries decrease expenditure on economic affairs and defense and increase general public services and public order and safety. Finally, they increase the net implicit gasoline subsidy in the long term. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we explain the estimation methodology and discuss our hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data definitions and sources. Section 4 presents the estimation results and the corresponding discussion. Section 5 concludes.",3

In comparison, Germany, which is one of the most robust economies in the world with a GDP per capita of 45,551.5 USD (in constant 2010 USD) presents a cabinet of 15 ministers (World Factbook 2016; World Bank 2016). The impressive size of the government of Niger is common in many sub-Saharan countries like Cameroon, Uganda or Zambia, which typically display governments with more than 30 ministers. This apparent inadequacy between the wealth of these countries and the size of the cabinet raises a matter of interest: Why are there so many ministers in such poor countries? This article aims to investigate the factors underlying the size of the government cabinets in Africa. We argue that the size of the government is driven less by economic efficiency objectives, but instead is more supported by a state building imperative, into which the elites’ goal of preserving power is inserted. More specifically, we propose that there may be a negative association between the size of the government cabinet and the number of ethnic groups excluded in national politics. This suggests that the most inclusive government cabinets in terms of ethnic representation tend to be the largest. However, we also emphasize that this inclusion is favorable to powerless positions, which means that inclusion is an illusionary power-sharing since the incumbents control the key positions, while the ethnic groups that have been included occupy peripheral positions. This suggests that inclusion is actually more of a resource-sharing between the elites of different ethnic groups and less of a power-sharing. The ethno-linguistic fragmentation of African countries is a factor that emerges in development literature as an impediment to the effectiveness of public investment and relevant growth performance (see Mauro 1995; Easterly and Levine 1997; Gyimah-Brempong 2002). A properly managed ethnicity issue is then a serious challenge in African countries. In this respect, the present paper follows the analyses of Van de Walle (2001) and Arriola (2009) on the interest of studying the relationship between the size of government and the ethnic composition of African countries. However, the focus of this paper differs from the one of these two studies. Indeed, the aforementioned studies support a positive correlation between ethno-linguistic fragmentation and the size of governments in Africa in a cross-section framework. In contrast, evidence from this paper suggests that it is less a question of the number of ethnic groups—ethno fragmentation—that determines the size of the government. Instead, it is rather the choice of including them or not in the national politics that determines the size of government. Thus the variable of interest of this study, ethnic exclusion, is found to be robustly associated with cabinet size, while the ethno-linguistic fragmentation variable is not. This is in line with the work of Lindemann (2011) in the case of Zambia, which advocates a differentiation between ethnic inclusion and ethnic fragmentation. Through its focus on African government cabinets, this study is in line with the recent work of Francois et al. (2015), notably on the fact that the executive power is the core of the country's political, economic and institutional decision-making, since most of African political regimes are presidential or semi-presidential. However, while Francois et al. (2015) examine the share of each ethnic group in the executive branch in 15 African countries, this study examines the implications of the inclusion of these ethnic groups in a sample of 35 African countries. Specifically, this paper examines the implications on the size of government cabinets, which may be critical for the efficiency of public expenditure.Footnote 2 In this vein, our work shows that the inclusion of the elites from different ethnic groups into the government does not mean the reduction of the share that should return to each ethnic group. Rather, the enlargement of the number of government positions that would be distributed. Alternatively, if the government was a cake, the results of this paper reveal that the invitation of new members to share this cake is not made by the reduction of the piece of the cake which should return to each member, but rather, it is done through the extension of the cake to share, i.e. by expanding the size of the government cabinet. To sum up, we have collected data on the size of government cabinets in Sub-Saharan African countries over the post-democracy transition period (2001–2010). Within this panel, we investigate the relationship between the size of the government cabinet and the ethnic exclusion variable and find a negative relationship between both variables, suggesting that the more inclusive governments in Africa, in terms of ethno-based groups, tend to be the largest governments. We also investigate the explanation of this result and find that this inclusion is in favor of powerless positions, meaning that the inclusion is an illusionary power-sharing, but seems to be a real resource-sharing among elites of different ethnic groups. These results are robust to various sensitivity analyses, including estimation methods as well as alternative scenarios. The remainder of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 briefly reviews the background of power-sharing and cabinet formation in Africa and provides arguments that help to interpret the empirical results. Section 3 describes the data used in the empirical estimation. Section 4 presents and discusses the results. Lastly, Sect. 5 concludes and suggests policy implications.",1
22.0,1.0,Economics of Governance,10 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-021-00250-1,Corruption and politicians’ horizon,March 2021,Hélène Laurent,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A vast political science and economics literature attempts to understand how particular institutional and electoral settings provide officials and politicians with incentives to behave in the public interest rather than for private benefits. Once elected, politicians may indeed be tempted to use their position for private interest by implementing policies increasing their utility at the expense of social welfare, or by misappropriating public funds for their own gains. A distant decision-making horizon is important in such cases as it creates incentives for politicians to be more public-interested (Olson 1993). However, the more frequent renewal of representatives not only improves the state’s legitimacy and triggers innovative policies by a competition between both political parties and ideas, but it also makes the threat of removal in case of bad behavior credible (Matland and Studlar 2004). Accordingly, the right setting is not obvious, as illustrated by the variety of retained settings around the world. In particular, the frequency of elections and the decision to place term limits on politicians’ mandate vary across countries. This paper complements the literature about causes of corruption (Dimant and Tosato (2018) for a review of empirical evidence on the causes and consequences of corruption). It specifically complements the political science and economics literature studying the importance of politicians’ horizon in explaining the level of corruption. We provide cross-country evidence of the correlation between different dimensions of politicians’ horizon—political turnover, term limits and term lengths—on leaders’ rent-seeking behavior. We use information provided by CIA’s World Factbook and data from National Elections across Democracy and Autocracy (Hyde and Marinov 2012) to construct variables of term limits, term length and political turnover as they apply to each country’s head of state or top executive. We simultaneously estimate the effects of these three variables on rent-seeking—measured using a country-wide corruption index—from pooled cross-sections of 137 developed and developing countries observed from 2000 to 2015. We find (i) a positive correlation between term limits and corruption for low level of term length, while insignificant for longer terms; (ii) a positive correlation between term length and corruption in an institutional framework without term limits, but insignificant otherwise; (iii) a positive correlation between political turnover and corruption; and (iv) below a threshold, a negative correlation between political turnover and corruption that disappears when we control for measures of politicians’ accountability. This paper is not the first to empirically test the effect of some politicians’ horizon dimensions on corruption (see Sect. 2 for a review of this literature). However, it is to the best of our knowledge, the first to simultaneously investigate these dimensions. With this approach, we are able to highlight how term limits and term length interact in explaining the level of corruption. Moreover, we underline mechanisms between these electoral settings and dimensions of accountability in explaining corruption. In particular, we show that observability and accountability technologies explain the downward sloping part of the U-shaped relationship between political turnover and corruption that is found in existing empirical papers. Our findings are robust to the introduction of a large set of economic, cultural, institutional and electoral covariates, as well as to alternative measures of corruption. However, the macro perspective of this paper does not allow for tackling endogeneity issues, as discussed in the conclusion. Still, our empirical findings are consistent both with the theoretical predictions of political sciences models, and with existing micro level empirical findings. This paper also extensively discusses the mechanisms that drive empirical findings through the lens of political economy theory. First, probabilistic voting models predict that a greater ideological uncertainty (a greater political turnover) creates more uncertainty about elections outcome and leads to more corruption. However, in political accountability models, a higher political turnover reflects more competition among candidates and makes the threat of removal in case of bad behavior credible in the eyes of politicians. Elections are then a mechanism that disciplines incumbents by creating a trade-off between current rents and future revenues if re-elected. Second, political accountability models underline how term limits removes the disciplining effect that elections might have on politicians as it removes all re-election incentives. Finally, models career concerns illustrate that shorter term length, i.e. more frequent elections, allows for a better control over politicians’ behavior and curbs rent-seeking behavior. We extensively discuss these mechanisms in Sect. 4 and describe how each class of political economy models fails or succeeds to account for the observed empirical correlations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature. Section 3 lays out data and the estimation methodology, and also presents empirical results. In Sect. 4, we discuss the empirical findings through the lens of political economy theories. Section 5 concludes.",2

The region has become the most violent globally, with robbery rates that double those of Africa and nine times greater than those of Asia (Hernández 2019a). Peru is not excluded from this phenomenon. The view that lack of safety is the country's primary problem has increased significantly from 12 to 55% between 2002 and 2017, surpassing problems such as unemployment and poverty that traditionally topped the priority list (Fig. 1). Perception of principal problems in Peru (%) It is crucial to address the increase in crime nationally. Crime not only affects economic performance (Londoño and Guerrero 2000; Heinemann and Verner 2006), but it also impacts political and institutional stability (Soares and Naritomi 2010). Nonetheless, research in Peru has been focused on the economic costs of crime (Hernández 2019a), giving less attention to social costs. The erosion of social capital, measured by the loss of institutional trust, is one of the main intangible costs that has consequences in aspects such as economic growth (Beugelsdijk and Van Schaik 2005; Westlund and Adam 2010), weakening of political and institutional systems (Blanco 2013), and lower accumulation of human capital (Baliamoune-Lutz 2011). Several studies for developing countries have shown the negative impacts of crime victimization on institutional trust (Blanco and Ruiz 2013; Corbacho et al. 2015; Pazzona 2020) and how these effects are more harmful to vulnerable populations (Liu et al. 2009; Jackson and Gouseti 2016; Hernández 2019a). The literature also highlights that increases in crime create vicious circles since greater distrust leads to little cooperation between citizens and public institutions, making it harder to fight crime (Blanco 2013). In this context, our study aims to measure the impact of crime victimization -expressed as robberies or robbery attempts- on trust in institutions responsible for safeguarding the public's security and punishing crime, thus exploring the social costs of crime. In this way, our study contributes to the discussion of this topic in four aspects. First, it is the first study that associates crime victimization and institutional trust in Peru to the best of our knowledge. Second, we employ several nationally representative data sources, addressing the shortage of such studies in the region (Dammert et al. 2017). Third, we apply machine learning techniques to approach the topic causally. Finally, we estimate heterogeneous impacts for vulnerable populations as suggested by the literature. Our study is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the theoretical background that links crime and institutional trust and an exhaustive literature review. In Sect. 3, we describe data sources and empirical strategy, highlighting the virtues of the methodology proposed. In Sect. 4, we present our main results, the heterogeneous impacts for female and repeat victims, and a set of sensitivity tests to prove the robustness of the results. Finally, in Sect. 5, we discuss our results and make policy recommendations.",4

Swope,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The study of the economic organization of hunter-gatherer societies has a long multi-disciplinary history and has attracted some attention from economists.Footnote 1 The enduring interest in hunter-gatherers might be attributed to both the apparent adaptability and success of the hunter-gatherer way of life for millenia, and the fact that hunter-gatherer institutions so sharply contrast with those of modern society. It might also owe to the insights provided into the origins of human social behavior.Footnote 2 What are the salient features of hunter-gatherer society? While there is considerable variation across societies, in the typical hunter-gatherer society access to resources is free to members of the group, and the output obtained from resources distributed via some combination of reciprocal exchange, gift obligations, and sharing arrangements. Further, decision-making about how and when to produce is decentralized, and some do a lot more work than others. Still, in the end, there is a relatively egalitarian distribution of output. We argue that these features of the hunter-gatherer economy are interrelated. Our view is based on the idea that sharing and gift-giving constitute a comprehensive system designed to mitigate the tragedy of the commons in a decentralized fashion. We adopt an incentive-based view of sharing and gift-giving, in which the fundamental role of sharing and gift-giving is to implement socially desirable production decisions, given that hunters share access to resources but may differ in hunting ability. We show how this system decentralizes the task of coordinating work effort so as not to overuse open-access resources, while at the same time eliciting truthful information about hunter abilities. Indeed, while hunter-gatherers share access to resources, one interesting aspect of the typical hunter-gatherer society is that common resources are typically not over-utilized, in spite of the possibility that they could be. As Smith and Wishnie (2000, p. 509) write: “...detailed ethnographic evidence indicates that subsistence hunting by indigenous hunters can lead to localized depletion...or even regional extirpation...” But in most cases hunter-gatherers do not wind up overusing their resources, in spite of evidence suggesting that they do not consciously engage in resource conservation.Footnote 3 Our theory presents an institutional explanation as to why hunter-gatherers typically do not overuse resources; sharing helps manage hunting effort to prevent resource over-usage. The system results in a relatively equal distribution of output, even as it creates disparities in work effort. We hasten to add that our theory does not preclude other theories of sharing, and perhaps complements them. That having been said, some aspects of the hunter-gatherer economy that are not easily explained by existing theories of sharing can be attributed to a resource management role. For example, our theory offers an explanation as to why free-riding on the efforts of more productive hunters seems to be tolerated in many hunter-gatherer societies, as too much effort might overuse resources. In our model the output sharing mitigates over-exploitation of the commons, a potential role for sharing originally hinted at by Alchain and Demsetz (1973), more formally developed by Cauley et al. (1999) and Ellis (2001), and explored in an experimental setting by Schott et al. (2007). In contrast to this work, however, we explore in detail the consequences of rules when hunters vary in productive capability, and we focus attention on the informational properties of the rules. We argue that a sharing-rule based system of CPR management may have advantages over alternatives, such as observing effort directly and punishing deviations from established norms, as in, for example, Sethi and Somanathan (1996). Sharing and gift-giving rules, while relying on observation of hunter output, can be set up so that actual hunting effort does not need to be observed and hunters volunteer truthful information about ability. Also common among hunter-gatherers is a relatively equal distribution of output, even though individuals vary greatly in ability (Woodburn 1982).Footnote 4 In light of work effort disparities, this implies that some hunters share more with others and give more to others than they receive in return. While our model does not produce a perfectly egalitarian distribution of output, we show that the sharing and gift giving regime may result in a compressed income distribution in spite of stark differences in ability and effort levels. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the literature on output sharing in hunter-gatherer societies, existing theories of sharing, and some of the difficulties with these theories. In Sect. 3, we append the discussion in Sect. 2 with more detailed information on production and sharing among Kalahari Desert hunter-gatherers. In Sect. 4, we develop a simple model that shows how sharing rules among users can feasibly mitigate a commons problem without relying upon observation of effort. We then illustrate a potential adverse selection problem created by the sharing scheme, and then show how this adverse selection problem might be mitigated through the introduction of gift-giving obligations.

Non-linearities and complementarities of the rule of law,June 2021,Omar A. Guerrero,Gonzalo Castañeda,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, public governance has become one of the main topics in the international development agenda.Footnote 1 However, in spite of significant efforts to procure public governance through the rule of law,Footnote 2 there seems to be a mismatch between the expectations from policy prescriptions and real-world outcomes.Footnote 3 In this regard, the World Bank asserts—in its 2017 World Development Report: Governance and the Law—that legal improvements to the rule of law have rarely succeed in achieving drastic reductions of corruption.Footnote 4
Baez-Camargo and Passas (2017) offer a reasonable explanation: the ineffectiveness of reforms to the rule of law may originates from inconsistencies between the de jure governance and the social norms that guide citizens and bureaucrats; that is to say, from the disregard of systemic effects. This paper studies, theoretically and empirically, the causal linkage between government expenditure, the rule of law, and corruption. We find that improvements to the rule of law do not necessarily generate lower levels of corruption in all countries because, in the real world, (1) the ceteris paribus condition for other policy issues does not hold (partly because of the trade-offs that emerge when prioritizing policy issues) and (2) co-movements in other topics introduce effects that may oppose the traditional conduits of anti-corruption policies (i.e., inverting the net benefit of misbehaving and curtailing the discretionary use of resources). Moreover, while overall increments in public expenditure tend to generate improvements in the rule of law and a fall in corruption, this relationship can easily become fuzzy if the relative levels of expenditure across multiple policy issues is altered. We argue that the disappointing performance commonly observed in policies attempting to improve public governance is a consequence of dealing with a complex world, in which unexpected outcomes are the result of systemic considerations that produce non-linearities and a rugged landscape; blurring the mapping between policy packages and outcomes. In particular, the existence of spillover effects between socioeconomic indicators, and the associated policy issues, produce externalities that might distort the incentive structure of public officials in charge of implementing such policies. This, in turn, can create non-anticipated opportunities to divert funds under a setting of imperfect supervision. Accordingly, we introduce a systemic perspective that allows us to move beyond the principal-agent framework and consider the implicit trade-offs in any budgeting exercise that supports a multidimensional policy space. Through simulations with an agent-based model, we produce country-level estimates for 140 nations during a period of 21 years, while taking into account interactions between numerous indicators. Our computational approach has three key advantages over traditional econometric analyses: (1) it does not require pooling cross-national data, so the model is calibrated for each country individually (i.e., it is consistent with the ‘context matters’ premise by incorporating country-specific characteristics); (2) it provides micro-foundations of a causal process that links expenditure, the rule of law, and corruption (i.e., it is more suitable to deal with problems of endogeneity and revere causation), and (3) it can control for the interactions that take place among a relatively high number of indicators (i.e., it is scalable with respect to the dimensions of the policy space). The rest of the paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 provides a review of the literature on corruption with an emphasis in econometric studies, and presents some stylized facts that are key to understand why another approach is needed. Section 3 introduces the theoretical model, based on tools of agent-computing, network science, behavioral economics, and political economy games. Section 4 indicates the nature of the data employed for the analysis, how the spillover network is estimated, and how the computational model is calibrated. Section 5 presents empirical findings of the model that are consistent with the stylized facts and the hypothesis outlined in this introduction. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes the arguments and results of this paper, and provides some additional reflections.",5

Piano,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For most of human history, meal preparation was a mundane enterprise. Its goal was to make food tastier and more digestible. With the rise of Haute Cuisine in nineteenth century France, the craft of cooking turned into culinary science. It’s only with the advent of Nouvelle Cuisine in the 1960’s and 1970’s that meal-preparation became a creative endeavor and the chef turned into an artist. Today, patrons of fine-dining establishments expect their culinary experience to consist of a unique combination of sensory stimulations–from the flavor profile of the meal to the combination of the colors and geometric composition of the plate to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. Chefs are well aware of this and often refer to their job as that of “selling an event” or “fulfilling [the customers’] dreams”, rather than the mere selling of good-tasting food: My greatest wish is to surprise the people who come to me, to enchant them with my dishes. When they eat, and I see how much they like it, I am happy, I have reached my goal. For this I am willing to do everything.Footnote 1 
As is typical with experience goods, trade over dining services is supported by significant reputational investment on the supply side. Since the importance of reputation in an industry grows with the degree of complexity of the commodity supplied (Shapiro 1982), by increasing the complexity of the services sold by fine-dining establishments, the Nouvelle Cuisine movement was bound to affect the way the industry is organized. This article develops an ‘optimal organization’ framework to study the internal structure of restaurants in the fine-dining industry. This framework identifies the fundamental determinant of a business’ organizational choice as the tradeoff between benefits from internal specialization in ownership and across tasks on the one hand and the potential losses due to an agent’s opportunism on the other. The allocation of residual claimancy and the extent of specialization are popular topics in the study of economic organizations. My argument relies on theories of organizational choice as developed by Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990), Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991), and Wernerfelt (2002). Becker and Murphy (1992) and Allen and Lueck (1998) develop models of specialization where individuals and firms must decide which tasks to perform internally and which to outsource to the market.Footnote 2 My framework differs from these contributions in two important ways. First, theories of organizational choice study the ownership of the firm’s physical assets as determinant of equilibrium incentives, while my focus is on the ownership of the firm’s brand and reputation. Second, most work on the division of labor aim to explain its prevalence between firms while my analysis centers on the allocation of tasks within the firm.Footnote 3 The framework produces testable predictions about the internal organization of high-end restaurants and explains several of its characteristics. These include the prevalence of chef-owned establishments in the world of fine-dining, why chefs directly oversee the purchase of ingredients and why other tasks (like the management of the kitchen during service) are outsourced to the chef’s agents. To test these implications, I rely on a mix of qualitative and quantitative evidence, including accounts of the history and current status of the fine-dining industry, public information on the ownership of Michelin-starred restaurants in the United States, and a small dataset on the allocation of tasks within high-end establishments in Europe. While, due to data limitations, it falls short of providing definite proof of causality, the evidence I present is strongly supportive of my framework. The share of chef-owned restaurants increases with the quality of the establishments, proxied by the number of Michelin stars received in 2019. Similarly, the pattern of task-allocation in the available sample follows a systematic pattern consistent with the theory: Tasks that are more likely, ex-ante, to yield opportunistic behavior on the part of an agent tend to be performed by the chef-owner. Scholarly work on the fine-dining industry is scant. Ferguson (1998) provides a sociological theory of the development of gastronomy in post-revolutionary France. Rao et al. (2003, 2005) study the emergence of Nouvelle Cuisine in the second half of the twentieth century through similar sociological lenses. They argue that the new movement was able to solicit defectors from the ‘old school’ and establish itself as the new standard in the industry by leveraging discrepancies and contradictions in the received identity of traditional French chefs. Balazs (2001, 2002) study the entrepreneurial characteristics of celebrity chefs in France. Ottenbacher and Harrington (2007) investigate the innovation process employed by Michelin-starred chefs to develop and update their menus. Johnson et al. (2005) provide a typology of Michelin-starred restaurants based on thirty-six restaurants from four European countries. Finally, work in economics has focused on the effect of the award of a Michelin star on an establishment’s pricing strategies (Snyder and Cotter 1998; Gergaud et al. 2007, 2015).Footnote 4 My article contributes to this literature by extending insights from organizational economics to study the world of high-end restaurants.Footnote 5 To my knowledge, there has been no attempt in the literature to explain the ownership structure of these establishments and the pattern of division of labor and task-allocation within them. However, kindred work has focused on the internal organization of North American farms (Allen and Lueck 1998), carpentry shops (Simester and Wernerfelt 2005), and the trucking industry (Baker and Hubbard 2003).",1

Byrd,John A. Dove,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Antebellum federal preemption legislation were ad hoc bills that allowed squatters to purchase unappropriated land at a guaranteed price per acre. Origins of these bills date back to the 1790s. However, the focus of this paper is on those found in the 1830s and 1840s, as these bills have received a significant amount of academic attention. This is particularly true regarding the factors that may have influenced how and why individual members of Congress voted the way that they did. Historians long considered the South-West versus Northern coalition to be the driving force behind Congressional voting patterns over preemption rights bills. However, Gailmard and Jenkins (2018), hereafter GJ, question this view. Instead, they propose a distributive politics model, one that considers regional aspects of voting and standard factors like party ideology, reliant on rent-seeking behavior of political actors where the South, in particular, was primarily against preemption rights. Reasons for such questioning extend naturally to internalizing public revenue gains from restrictive settlement, protection from agricultural competition, and labor wages. In this article, we build on the framework and results of GJ by empirically testing factors that influenced antebellum preemption legislation. To do this, we utilize bank counts and the estimated labor share of farmers across United States counties in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. As immigrants undoubtedly increased the farming labor share during westward migration and assuredly diminished the farming labor share of the old States, sectional strife was likely to have intensified. Indeed, preemption laws of the 1830s and 1840s were precursors to the Homestead bills of the 1850s and 1860s and the Free Soil movement (Hibbard 1965). While the former bills sought a Pareto improvement, the latter bills and movement were a potential cause of the American Civil War. Our results show that an increasing share of farm labor significantly affected positive voting on preemption legislation. Moreover, as there were six of the bills over 11 years, the increased distributive interests likely left deep-seated roots of tension for US politics for the decades that came after. To that end, while still finding support for the distributive politics hypothesis, we also find a clear negative relationship for the coalitional arguments raised by many historians. Thus, the study in the growth of distributive politics is significant as what acts or bills may initially be seeking Pareto improvements may ultimately regress a country’s political and economic core. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief history of land policies and preemption; Section 3 contains the literature review and theoretical considerations. Finally, Section 4 discusses our model specification, data, and results, while section 5 concludes.",

To answer this question, I provide a game-theoretic model where media learn information from politicians and present it to voters. The model shows that the bargaining power of the media compared to politicians may erode if their number increases. As a result, there will be more media bias. Bias hurts voters because they learn less about policy and make worse voting choices for themselves. The model contributes to the understanding of media bias in advanced democracies. Media bias (V-Dem 2021) plotted against the number of commercial TV-stations in the United States. I subtract the original bias score from 1 so that higher values correspond to more bias. A higher bias indicates less or more negative coverage of the opposition. The number of television networks comes from Statista (2021) Figure 1 above motivates the question. It plots the score for media bias against the number of commercial TV stations in the United States across time. Though it is hard to make conclusions from a few observations, the graph suggests that having more media outlets does not reduce media bias. How does media bias emerge in advanced democracies? In such regimes, it is hard for politicians to bribe or threaten journalists. However, politicians can bear influence by using access to information. Specifically, politicians can be available to journalists who emphasize their strong sides while evading others. This strategy has two effects. First, voters become more interested in media outlets that are loyal to the politician because they have more information. Second, journalists are willing to cover a politician positively to learn more from her. Recently, Donald Trump demonstrated this strategy. To start with, Fox News, which supports Trump, got better interview opportunities than other media. As of 2019, Trump gave 42 interviews to Fox News and only 10 to other major television networks combined, out of which CNN got none (Mayer et al. 2019). Given that journalists usually strive to interview a President (Wemple 2019), Trump’s reluctance to give interviews to certain outlets was the likely reason for this imbalance. Moreover, there were instances when the Trump administration excluded journalists that represented hostile media, such as CNN and the New York Times, from press briefings (Taylor 2019). Supporting Trump may have contributed to the success of Fox News. The channel is one of the most popular and trusted in the United States (Gramlich 2020; Joyella 2020). Moreover, the show by Sean Hannity, who frequently speaks with the President (Mayer et al. 2019), is one of the most popular shows on cable news (Joyella 2020). Conversely, Trump is highly popular among Fox News viewers compared to the average American (Gramlich 2020). Hence, for him, it was useful to cultivate a special relationship with Fox News. The example above demonstrates a high degree of media bias in American media. Moreover, in 2017, 45% of Americans saw “a great deal of bias” in the news media, and 51% could not name an objective source (Jones and Ritter 2020). The American media market is competitive, yet, competition does not rule out media bias. By contrast, in 1989, with fewer media outlets, only 25% of Americans reported “a great deal of bias”. To give another comparison, the BBC in Britain, which controls a large share of the news market, is trusted by both right- and left-wing voters. Also, consumers value the station for its objectivity (Nielsen et al. 2020). These facts suggest that competition among the media may increase media bias. The rest of the text provides a game-theoretic model to explain this phenomenon and is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and provides empirical support for my model. Section 3 provides a game-theoretic model. Section 4 discusses the analysis of the model. Section 5 concludes.",1

Miceli,Murat C. Mungan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Why is there a speed limit? The obvious answer is that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that imposes risks on others, and so a mandated maximum speed is needed to induce drivers to balance their private benefits from driving against the external costs. On further reflection, however, it is evident that driving at any speed imposes risks on others, and so if the goal is truly to balance benefits and risks, the optimal policy should be to impose a fine on all driving, with the amount of the fine rising proportionately with speed (risk). In other words, driving, or any risky activity, should be subject to a schedule of Pigovian taxes. This paper examines various explanations for why this approach is generally not taken in favor of an enforcement structure that only criminalizes risky activities when they surpass a specified level of riskiness. For example, it is only a crime to drive above a certain speed, or to possess a certain amount of a particular drug. What determines this threshold of criminality? We consider factors arising from both the law enforcement side and the crime commission side. One factor on the enforcement side are fixed costs. We consider two: the cost of notifying the public that an act is against the law (for example, the cost of posting a speed limit sign), and the cost of responding to a crime once it has been committed. Both are fixed in the sense that they are not proportional to the amount of harm caused by the act. Thus, for acts that impose a low level of harm, it will not be efficient to incur these costs. For example, fining all driving based on speed would entail very high administrative costs, as compared to fining only those who exceed a certain speed.Footnote 1 In contrast, the optimal expenditure of effort to apprehend offenders once an act has been committed does optimally rise with the harm, and equals zero if the harm is zero. This cost, which is the only one considered in most models, is therefore not a reason for limiting the scope of law. The costliness of punishment is another reason not to criminalize acts that impose a low level of harm. This factor will be relevant when the marginal benefit of deterrence is not large enough to offset the increased expected cost of imposing punishment. Another limiting factor is a finite marginal productivity of effort, which for low harms will be less than the marginal cost for any positive level of effort. One factor that contributes to this limit is the possibility of false apprehensions (type 1 errors). This is not because such errors are necessarily socially costly (though they may be), but rather because they dilute the deterrence benefit of enforcement. On the benefit side, criminality is limited if all offenders have strictly positive benefits from committing the act in question. This factor renders a low level of enforcement effort useless because no one is deterred by the threat of punishment at low enough levels of enforcement. After examining these various limitations, our discussion turns to an examination of how the optimal scope of law is affected by what is sometimes called the “expressive function” of law, which refers to the role of the law in instructing people about what acts are socially undesirable.Footnote 2 To the extent that some people in society are responsive to this sort of moral persuasion apart from any threatened sanction, deterrence can be “purchased” very cheaply by simply asserting that a certain act is illegal. It would seem, therefore, that a society in which more people have internalized this moral sentiment should have a more expansive scope of law. It turns out, however, that this is not necessarily the case. The intuitive reason is that some acts, when optimally deterred, nevertheless confer a positive net benefit on society because some law-breaking is actually efficient. For example, it is efficient to exceed the speed limit in situations where the benefit is large enough (as when rushing an injured person to the hospital). People who reflexively obey the law, however, will not commit such acts and will therefore be “overdeterred” if the act is criminalized. In this case, the scope of law is optimally reduced as the number of such people in society rises. It is important to note, however, that this logic only applies if the gain offenders receive from committing harmful acts is counted in social welfare, for only then can there be such a thing as an “efficient crime”. This insight motivates a brief discussion of the question of whether or when the gains of offenders should be counted in welfare, which has long been debated in the economics-of-crime literature.Footnote 3 We do not seek to resolve this debate here but rather to point out that if the benefits from crime are not counted in welfare, then the scope of law should expand as more people are persuaded to obey the law by the mere criminalization of certain acts. Some previous authors have addressed the scope of criminal law. For example, Bowles et al. (2008) and Mungan (2012) discuss the merits of controlling harmful acts through criminal law versus other modes of regulation. That exercise, however, is different from the current one, in that it focuses on whether or not to use legal means to regulate certain harmful acts at all. There is also prior scholarship which addresses more specific questions pertaining to public enforcement, and wherein optimal limits to regulation emerge. Garoupa and Klerman (2002), for instance, compare the optimal probability of enforcement versus that implemented by a rent-seeking law enforcer, and find that rent-seeking enforcers will tend to over-enforce low-harm acts. Additionally, the authors find that it is inefficient to criminalize acts which carry harm below a positive threshold. Shavell (1991) derives a similar result. The results in both models are special cases of the general family of enforcement technologies that we consider here; namely those which involve finite marginal productivity of effort. The current analysis is also related to the study by Garoupa and Obidzinski (2011), which examines the choice between harm-based and act-based sanctions in law enforcement. This distinction reflects the probabilistic nature of many harms, and shows that some risky acts should be subject to sanctions, while others should only be sanctioned if some harm actually occurs. For example, exceeding a speed limit, which is not harmful per se, is a punishable act, whereas driving below the speed limit is not. The question of where to set the threshold then determines the scope of the law. In answering this question, the model in Garoupa and Obidzinski (2011) emphasizes such factors as the cost of imposing punishment, the ease of obtaining information about harm, and whether offenders will be judgment proof. This approach to the bifurcation of sanctionable versus non-sanctionable acts is complementary to the current model, which treats all acts as inherently harmful and asks which should be sanctionable. Our contribution to the foregoing line of research is to provide a fuller catalog of those properties that result in optimal limits of law enforcement. Our characterization of how the expressive function of law affects enforcement, however, is to our knowledge novel. The next section introduces the basic set-up that we will use to formalize our observations. Section 3 examines the various factors which limit the optimal scope of law, comprising both enforcement factors and offender-benefit factors. Section 4 turns to an examination of how law’s expressive function affects its optimal scope. Section 5 provides concluding remarks. The proofs of all propositions are contained in an “Appendix”.",1

Tax evasion—when individuals and firms do not pay their legally due tax liabilities in a timely manner—compromises all of these goals. Governments therefore devote many resources in an attempt to combat tax evasion, even while individuals and firms devote many resources to minimizing their tax liabilities. However, both the methods by which governments enforce the tax laws and the methods by which individuals and firms evade their taxes change over time, due to such things as changing tax policies, changing economic forces, changing institutions, changing norms, and changing technology.Footnote 1 In this paper I examine how changing technology seems likely to affect tax evasion in the years ahead, especially technological changes driven by the transformation of information into digital formats for use by computers. I argue that many of these changes in technology will improve the ability of governments to decrease tax evasion, mainly by increasing information available to government, offering government the potential to generate better information, better analysis of this information, and better systems and policies based on this information and its analysis. However, I also argue that these changes in technology will open up new avenues by which some individuals and some firms can evade (and avoid) taxes. At this point it is unclear which trend will dominate, so that the effects of technology on the overall level of tax evasion are uncertain. Even so, I believe that the distributional effects of these technological changes are more predictable, given the differential effects of technology on the abilities of individuals of different levels and types of income to evade their taxes. Indeed, I argue that changing technology will make evasion increasingly difficult for most taxpayers, especially those subject to employer withholding and third party information reporting, but that evasion will be increasingly viable for a small number of taxpayers, especially very high income taxpayers. Regardless of the overall impact of technology on the level of tax evasion, I conclude that the effects of technology will likely increase economic inequality. It should be noted at the start that measuring tax evasion is enormously challenging, for obvious reasons. After all, individuals have strong incentives to conceal their tax evasion, as well as other activities that reduce their tax payments like money laundering and tax avoidance, given financial and other penalties that may be imposed on individuals. Even so, research has been increasingly creative in finding data to examine these activities using naturally occurring field data, controlled field experiments, and laboratory experiments. Due to space restrictions, I do not discuss the measurement issues in this paper.Footnote 2",9

In fact, the record of modern central banks is lackluster at best. For instance, arguably the most successful central bank in the world, the Federal Reserve, has failed to improve the predictability of the price level or economic volatility (Davis 2004, 2006; Hogan 2015; Miron and Romer 1990; Selgin et al. 2012). The primary problem with modern central banks is that they are not designed robustly to handle knowledge and incentive problems (Boettke et al. 2021; Hogan et al. 2018). In fact, Nobel laureates F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman and James M. Buchanan struggled with the way to best structure central banks to overcome these concerns (Boettke and Smith 2016). Given the poor record of central banks in providing sound currency, some scholars have turned to exploring historic banking institutions which operated via private self-enforcing mechanisms, such as private clearinghouse arrangements (Calomiris and Kahn 1996; Selgin and White 1987; Timberlake 1984; White 1984), private mints (Selgin 2008; White 2020), forming clubs (Nair 2016) and free banking (Briones and Rockoff 2005; Dowd 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994; Selgin 1988). By and large, this literature examines how private banks, outside the direct control of government, provided a sound currency. This paper contributes to this literature using a unique historic example of a government mint adopting self-enforcing governance mechanisms. It was an even bigger struggle to achieve in early manifestations of modern central banks; government mints (Burns 2013). This paper provides a historical case study of one of the most successful early government mints, the Zecca Mint of historic Venice. The Zecca, which was located in the governmental heart of Venice, played a key role in the life and wealth of the republic. Its geographical position across Piazza San Marco from the doge's palace was indicative of the importance of the mint to the life of the Venetian state, a trade-dependent economy that was supported by the coinage and the revenues that the Zecca brought in (Stahl 2011). The Zecca Mint held great importance and was among the biggest and most influential mints in all Europe. This was especially true in the thirteenth century when the grosso (the Venetian silver coin) dominated the trade of the Mediterranean world and in the fourteenth century when the ducat (the Venetian gold coin) became dominant (De Lara 2002). The ducat, also known as the zecchino (from the word zecca), circulated widely in trade throughout the Muslim world for centuries (Markowitz 2015). As Lane and Mueller (1985: 90–91) write, “[t]he Rialto attracted foreign coins as well as foreign merchants […]. Venice was distinctive as a bullion market. Florence and Genoa are more famous as the homes of international banking houses, but neither approached the position that Venice attained as a center through which silver and gold were imported and exported.” Understanding the unique monetary institutions of historic Venice is important for two reasons. First, it helps us better understand the success and longevity of the Republic of Venice (Ching et al. 2011; De Lara 2008; Ferraro 2012; Horodowich 2009; Lane 1973; Madden 2012; Strathern 2013) as its sound money was likely one factor contributing to its success. In this way, this paper contributes to the growing literature on the political economy of Venice, including its use of formal term limits (Fink 1945; Grendler 1990; Lane 1973; Queller 1986), informal term limits (Bouwsma 1968; Coggins and Perali 1998; Finlay 1980; Smith et al. 2020) and turn-taking in office (Smith 2020). The republic of Venice became well-known for having a stable currency and a financial environment that enabled international currency exchange (Horodowich 2009: 54–57; Mueller 1997). In fact, some of the first deposit banks in the world were established in Venice (Madden 2012: 265). This financial stability is considered an important factor in the economic success of Venice (Robbert 1974: 49). The second reason is that examples of historic success could inform modern discussions of the political economy of central banks. While the important differences between modern central banks and historic government mints must be appreciated, there are still lessons that could be potentially applicable to modern debates on binding central bankers (Boettke et al. 2021; Salter 2014). Most notably, the Venetian framework of accounting for the knowledge and incentive problems of policymakers and mintmasters in the design of their monetary institutions provides an under-appreciated insight in the modern central banking literature. By accounting for the epistemic and motivational shortcomings, the Venetian patricians designed a system that was relatively robust to deviations from idealized conditions. This reflects an incredibly advanced understanding of robust political economy (Boettke and Leeson 2004; Levy 1981; Pennington 2011) for that time. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief history of early European mints. Section 3 briefly explains the reasons that led to currency reforms in Venice. Section 4 examines the operable constitutional constraints on Venetian policymakers and mintmasters. Section 5 concludes the paper.",1

This paper examines how, in a context of electoral party competition, the proposals of political parties adjust to respond to such sudden changes in voters’ preferences. When an exogenous shock affects the policy preferences of voters, the equilibrium that competing political parties had attained prior to the shock is upset. Changes in voters’ preferences change voting decisions and parties must realign their policy positions in order to react optimally. The magnitude of the policy shifts needed by each party depend on the magnitude of the shift produced on the voters’ preferences, and thus, on the intensity of the shock, but also on the optimal reaction to opponents’ re-adjustments. Changes in voter’s preferences favour some parties and damage others. Hence, the optimal policy revisions that follow after a preference shock are asymmetric across parties. An exogenous shock can affect the voters’ policy preferences and their voting behavior in two different ways. On the one hand, a shock might shift the voters’ ideal points on a given issue. For example, in the case of a terrorist attack it is plausible to think that all voters shift their preference towards an increase in national security. Thus, in the policy dimension affected by the shock, the ideal points of all voters change and they all change in the same direction. On the other hand, a shock may change the balance between the different policy dimensions. Voters are likely to shift their attention to the policy dimension affected by the shock, and regard it as more important and relevant. Thus the salience of a previously unimportant policy dimension may increase, turning it into the dominating issue after the shock. A preference shock benefits some parties and hurts others. When a shock drives the ideal policy of all voters closer to the ideal policy of a given party, then this party will enjoy an electoral advantage because earning each vote becomes cheaper in ideological cost: to attract votes after the shock this party must make policy proposals that are closer to his ideal points than the policies required prior to the shock. At the same time, for a party with opposed views, the shock causes a disadvantage because the shock drives the voters’ ideal points away from the ideal policy of the party. Each single vote becomes more expensive in ideological cost after the shock: to attract votes after the shock requires policy choices further away from his ideal points than those proposed before the shock. Consequently, the parties’ policy adjustment as a reaction to a voters’ preference shift are asymmetric. A main focus of our interest are the consequences of a preference shock that changes the relative salience of issues; that is, situations where voters’ attention shifts unexpectedly and an issue that was previously disregarded suddenly becomes the relevant dimension of political competition. When voters turn their attention to a new issue their decisions are based on their evaluation of the parties’ policies on this new salient issue, and parties must strategically choose policy positions on the new relevant issue. If the two parties have different ideal points in this new salient issue, then they will move to compete in the new dimension, aiming to attract the voters with ideal points located between their opposed ideal points. Party competition in the new issue may face a symmetric distribution of voters, in which case both parties will optimally moderate a bit their positions. But, the new salient issue may be one where voters’ views are closer to one of the two parties; thus one party is favored by the proximity of the median voter to its ideal point and the other party is damaged by the larger distance between the median voter and its ideal point. In this case, the optimal policy choices of parties would imply asymmetric moves from their ideal points. This is the scenario where the shock delivers the most interesting consequences while maintaining the electoral competition among the initial parties. There is one last possible scenario: If both parties hold similar positions regarding the new issue, i.e. both parties share the same ideal point in the new salient issue, then new parties may find it profitable to enter the electoral competition with proposals that confront the one shared by the two old parties, so that the change on issue salience might break up the stability of the party system. We focus our analysis on the case with asymmetric voters’ preferences. In particular, we consider the effects of a polarized preference distribution. To analyze these phenomena we construct a model of two party electoral competition with policy motivated parties and sincere voters. We assume that there is a decisive voter whose ideal point is unknown to the parties and parties have beliefs about it that are common and common knowledge. In this model we introduce two assumptions that relate closely to the two effects described above: an exogenous shock produces an increase of the salience of a given policy dimension and in this dimension the voters’ preferences are polarized. We characterize the equilibrium policy choices of two parties that compete in an election both before and after the shock takes place, and compare the different outcomes that arise. In equilibrium, parties that are policy motivated choose policies that are moderate compared to their ideal points. If they compete on a dimension with a uniform distribution of the voters’ preferences then the policies chosen by the parties are symmetric with respect to the expected location of the ideal point of the decisive voter (the median voter). These results are in line with the ones described in Calvert (1985) and Wittman (1977, 1983). If parties compete on a dimension with an asymmetric distribution of the voters’ preferences then the policies chosen by the parties will moderate following the direction of the asymmetry of the distribution of the voters’ preferences and the magnitude of the adjustment will be different for each party. In fact, if the distribution of the voters’ ideal points is biased to one side of the policy space then the ideal point of the decisive voter will be relatively closer to the ideal point of one of the two parties, and away from the ideal point of the other party. This implies that one party benefits from the shock while the other party suffers damage. The party that is damaged by the shock needs a greater adjustment in its policy proposal in order to remain competitive in the electoral contest, while the party favored by the shock needs a smaller change, only to react to his opponent change of strategy. Thus, compared to the policies chosen prior to the shock, the policy choice of the party disfavored by the shock is more moderate, while the policy of the party favored by the shock can be less moderate (closer to the party’s ideal point). The equilibrium policies chosen by the parties depend on the relative salience that the voters assign to each of the issues. The more salient an issue the more moderate are the parties’ policy choices on that issue. In particular, if only one issue is salient, that is, under the assumption that voters base their voting decision only on the policy proposals regarding the issue they consider most important then the equilibrium policies on the salient issue coincide with the outcomes of a one-dimensional model, while the equilibrium policies on the non salient issue coincide with the parties’ ideal points. Indeed, there is no reason for the parties to compromise their policy positions on an issue if voters are not paying attention to it. When a shock changes the issue that voters consider salient, both parties react by a substantial moderation of their choices, moving their policies towards the ideal point of the expected median voter, in the newly relevant dimension, while they turn radical, towards their ideal points in the dimension that is no longer salient. More interestingly, if the shock increases the salience of an issue for which the voters’ preferences are polarized in an asymmetric way the in equilibrium parties may react by choosing divergent policies. The party that is damaged by the shock reacts by moderating a lot its policy, while the party favored by the shock does not need to moderate its policy so much. However, now the outcomes after the shock have to be compared to the parties’ ideal points on that dimension, since this was their optimal choice prior to the shock, when the affected issue was not salient. We also find that if the distribution of voters’ preferences after the shock are very asymmetric in equilibrium parties do not moderate their policies at all. Instead they choose to implement their ideal points. We offer a characterization of the conditions on the parameter values of the voters’ distribution that produce each type of equilibrium outcomes. The asymmetry in policy reactions that follows whenever a shock affects the voters’ relative issue salience, is consistent with the empirical evidence provided by Plümper and Epifanio (2015). They analyze the changes in antiterrorist policies implemented by incumbents of different countries after a terrorist attack. They find that the intensification of antiterrorist policy is greater for leftist incumbents than for rightist incumbents. The formal arguments developed here offer a theoretical explanation for the empirical observation provided by Plümper and Epifanio. Our results also point out that shocks that induce changes in relative issue salience may affect the electoral balance between the two competing parties. By favoring one party over the other, the shock imposes different electoral costs to the parties: it makes electoral competition much lighter for one party and much more costly for the other. Implementing a large policy shift may be very costly for a party, because compromising ideological principles may cause internal frictions among the different factions within the party and may end up destroying the party’s internal equilibrium. At the same time, when a shock brings to salience a new policy issue, if the positions of established parties on the new issue are too similar, the shock might induce the entry of new parties and reconfiguring the political landscape. We illustrate this argument with a discussion of the recent political upheaval in Catalonia and the United Kingdom. In 2010 high court decisions in Spain boosted the salience of the independence issue among Catalan voters’. As a consequence the two main political parties faced demands for drastic changes in their policy proposals and suffered major crisis. The Catalan party system of more than thirty years has been knocked down. The Brexit referendum is another shock that has turned on the salience of a previously disregarded issue and brought about a major crisis in the political party system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we argue that unexpected events that change the relative issue salience and may also polarize the voters’ preferences are a relevant fact and we review the empirical evidence that supports this claim. Section 3 turns to the theoretical model. In Sect.  4 we examine the effects of an increase of salience of an issue where voters’ preferences are polarized on the parties’ equilibrium policy choices. In Sect. 5 we illustrate how changes in issue salience that require a large policy shift cause instability on party’s internal consistency. Section 6 concludes with some final remarks.",

On the one hand, the size of a country is shaped by ethnic conflicts, regional separatism, and other centrifugal forces which may lead to secessions. On the other hand, the size of a country is also shaped by conquests, annexations, and other forms of integration. Research in the economic and political science literature has mainly focused either on peaceful separation and unification or on violent secessions and wars of conquest. The strategic behavior in these types of conflicts is thus well understood. However, these theoretical models are not helpful to understand the determinantion of a country’s size by political struggles which include both types of conflict.Footnote 1 Various conflicts point to combinations of these two opposing forces. An ethnic group in one country may have an interest to actively enforce a separation in order to merge with its ethnic peers in another country. These movements towards secession can be accompanied by the other country’s effort to enforce the unification. One of those conflicts is Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. In November 2013, Ukraine’s president Viktor Yanukovych did not sign a trade agreement with the European Union. Instead, he continued the cooperation with Russia. Pro-European citizens started protests in Kiev against the political orientation towards Russia. President Yanukovych was dismissed. The reorientation towards the European Union led to Pro-Russian riots in the Crimean capitol. Russia intervened, and a secession referendum for the Crimean Peninsula took place. The organizers reported approval of secession by more than 90 percent of the voters. Hereupon, Russia accommodated the Crimean Peninsula into its territory. However, the Russian involvement in the conflict was criticized by many western countries and they initiated economic and political sanctions. In this paper, I present and solve a model of ethnically motivated secessionist conflict, which treats an annexation as the explicit outcome of a secession. I use this model to better understand conflicts which combines secessions and annexations. One ethnic group is distributed between two countries and constitutes a minority in one country. This ethnic minority could be the pro-Russian population in the eastern parts of Ukraine. The ethnic minority is separated from its ethnic peers in the neighboring country. Ethnic groups may have differing preferences for the implemented policy, which descend from ethnic identity.Footnote 2 In the aforementioned case of the Crimean annexation, the pro-Russian population was negatively affected by the Ukrainian government’s decision to strengthen ties with the European Union. The pro-Russian population in Ukraine could avoid these heterogeneity costs by leaving the Ukraine and merging with Russia. The motivation of an ethnic minority to split and to merge with its own ethnic peers in the neighboring country is twofold. First, the seceeding group receives its preferred public good and hence, heterogeneity costs are eliminated. Second, the tax base may increase by this unification. In my setup, I assume that a secession is the explicit outcome of a conflict between the ethnic minority and the central government, while the ethnic minority can be supported by its ethnic peers, i.e., the neighboring country. In this paper, the neighboring country’s intervention is motivated by the gain of the ethnic minority’s tax base.Footnote 3 Further, the model includes sanctions which are imposed on the neighboring country for intervening in the secession conflict. The model shows that the separatist group is only supported by the neighboring country, i.e., by the third party if the secessionist group’s fighting ability is sufficiently low. The model also reveals that sanctions provoke a more intense conflict. The secessionist group has to compensate for the third party’s reduced willingness to provide support. Furthermore, the model shows that secessions and annexations are more likely if heterogeneity costs are high and if sanctions are weak. My paper is complementary to the economic literature on the size of nations. (Alesina et al. 1995) and (Alesina and Spolaore 1997) provide a theoretical framework which centers around the trade-off between size and heterogeneous preferences.Footnote 4 (Bolton and Roland 1997; Goyal and Staal 2004), and (Wittman 2000) provide complementary approaches. In the economic literature on the size of nations, the size of a population leads to economies of scale in the public good provision. Different groups within a country can have differing preferences about the implemented policy. Preferences are determined by the ethnic or geographical distance between ethnic groups. All citizens pay taxes and contribute equally to the public good provision. However, they perceive different utilities from the public good. Members of the ruling ethnic group have a higher utility than members of other ethnic groups.Footnote 5 These heterogeneity costs can lead to a secession. The political minority could be better off if they separate and provide their preferred public good. A shortcoming of the economic literature on the size of nations is the neglection of explicit conflict. (Spolaore 2008) provides a model which takes secessions as the outcome of explicit civil war.Footnote 6 He finds that economies of scale reduce the probability of secessions, whereas the size of the seceding region increases the probability of secessions. Using a similar framework, (Hentschel 2019) provides a dynamic model of secessions. However, (Spolaore 2008) and (Hentschel 2019) do not consider third-party intervention in their models. The annexation of the Crimean Peninsula illustrates that third parties can be motivated to intervene in a secession. In a complementary approach, (Sambanis et al. 2020) analyse the interactions between exogenous intervention and endogenously determined ethnic polarization in civil conflicts. Among others, they find that intervention can increase polarization between ethnic groups which may lead to civil conflict. The model in my paper builds on the theoretical frameworks in (Spolaore 2008) and (Hentschel 2019) and aims to expand the literatur on the size of nations by considering third-party intervention in secessions. In contrast to the model in (Sambanis et al. 2020), the focus of my model is on the endogenous determination of third-party intervention. Thus, the two approaches complement each other, while focusing on different mechanisms in civil conflict. By allowing for a third player, my model is also closely related to the economic literature on third-party intervention. (Regan 2002) illustrates that two thirds of all civil wars between 1945 and 1997 experienced intervention by foreign countries or transnational organizations. There can be several reasons for third-party intervention in civil wars. Among other reasons, a third party may intervene in order to reduce the level of conflict or it can be motivated by gaining a political or economic rent. See, among others, (Siqueira 2003; Amegashie and Kutsoati 2007; Regan 1998; Chang and Sanders 2009), and (Chang et al. 2007) for various forms of third party’s motivation. The nature of intervention is also a crucial element in conflicts with third-party involvement. Third-party intervention as modeled by (Amegashie and Kutsoati 2007) and (Chang et al. 2007) reduces the marginal cost of the respective ally. (Chang and Sanders 2009) analyze third-party intervention in an intra-state war in which the intervention increases the cost of the ally’s enemy. Different forms of interventions can be found in (Amegashie and Kutsoati 2007; Amegashie 2014; Chang et al. 2007; Chang and Sanders 2009; Carment and Rowlands 1998), and (Regan and Aydin 2006). In my paper, the theoretical foundations for third-party intervention are closest to (Chang et al. 2007). The third party will only intervene if it receives an extrinsic benefit from supporting one party in the conflict. Despite this similar view on the motivation of intervention, my approach differs in some crucial points from the model by (Chang et al. 2007). First, the payoff structure differs. In (Chang et al. 2007), the third party’s evaluation of the conflict outcome is independent of the other player’s evaluation. In my model, the third party’s potential gain is the potential loss of the ruling group in the ethnically fractionalized country, and depends on the size of the secessionist group. Second, the third party’s intervention has a direct effect on the conflict outcome while it has an indirect effect in the paper by (Chang et al. 2007). Third, my model includes sanctions for the third party’s intervention.Footnote 7 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the theoretical model; Sect. 3 solves the model; Sect. 4 presents comparative static results; and Sect. 5 concludes.",

Indeed, almost 50 newly-established democracies have so far retained democratic rule.Footnote 1 The cases of failed transitions have long been outshined by the success stories, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe. This notwithstanding, a non-negligible share of newly established democracies have not been successful. Some did not even survive their first years of existence. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan went more or less straight into plain dictatorship following the Soviet collapse, and Belarus followed shortly after. Three Central Asian former Soviet republics, the countries of Caucasia as well as the Ukraine remained partly democratic at best. And on a worldwide basis, a number of countries that initially seemed to evolve into successful young democracies eventually backslid into autocratic structures. Perhaps the most prominent examples are Russia, Venezuela, Thailand and Turkey. Recently, even Hungary and Poland became candidates.Footnote 2 By now, these latter countries symbolize the end of the post-1989 democratization wave. The Polity Project database labels a country as “democratic” if it scores 6 or higher in the polity2 data series which ranges from \(-10\) to \(+10\). Figure 1 gives an overview of countries that had reached at least a score of 6 in polity2 in some year following 1989 but later on fell below 6 and thus lost their status as “democratic”. The black bars give the highest score between 1990 and 2017, while the grey bars give the loss in polity2 scores between their respective maximum and the level in 2018. The largest loss was experienced by Belarus that reached a maximum of 8 in 1994 and ended at \(-7\). Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela all scored 9 in the early 1990s and ended at \(-3\) or \(-4\) (Turkey) in 2018. All countries in Fig. 1, except Comoros, Burundi and Mali had reached their respective maximum in the decade between 1990 and 2000, and most of them in the early 1990s. Source: See Appendix A Autocratic transition. A high rate of failure of democratic constitutions is by no means only a recent phenomenon. To the contrary, the history of modern-age democracy is full of failing endeavors to establish democratic constitutions. Of ten newly established democracies following World War I,Footnote 3 six failed until 1938, not to speak of what happened next. Perhaps more surprising is the recent development of seemingly established, though still young, democracies in Europe, like those in Hungary and Poland. Their governments became notorious for openly challenging widely held convictions about indispensable institutional traits of democracy; remarkably, these governments have enjoyed extensive public support while doing so. This applies in an even more pronounced way to the government leaders of Turkey and Russia, who have already turned their countries into plain autocracies. These leaders started by attacking standard matters of course in established democracies, such as the freedom of the press and an independent judiciary. At the same time, they denounced such indispensable components of democracy as instruments secretly established by some internal or external conspirators. Further, they claim that these instruments are a threat to national values as well as to vital national interests and sovereignty. This, then, is the basis for how these governments justify restricting activities by national and international NGOs as well as by insubordinate media representatives. While some democracies have been able to sustain attacks like these, some others have already fallen victim to them. Russia and Turkey are clear-cut cases of the fallen democracies while the fate of the Hungarian and Polish democracies is still open to date. A distinctive feature of these as well as of most other post-1989 autocratic transitions is that they emanated from deliberate activity of elected governments rather than from “classical” roots, such as military coups, foreign interventions or domestic revolts. These observations represent the point of departure for this paper. It derives empirically testable conditions under which democracies sustain or fall victim to autocratic transition performed by elected governments. In doing so, the paper aims at contributing to the heretofore relatively narrow literature on self-enforcing democracy and self-enforcing constitutions as it has been developed by authors like Przeworski, Weingast, Fearon and others. Based on a simple game-theoretic analysis, we carve out the conditions under which a democratic constitution can be expected to sustain autocratic attacks by sitting government leaders. We start with democracy as an initial institutional equlibrium in order to establish the conditions under which a government leader may be willing and able to trigger a critical mass of further government actors to coordinate on an autocratic equilibrium. With this approach, we hope to shed light on the question of under what conditions governments will adhere to the constitutional rules by virtue of their individual incentives and, by contrast, under what conditions they may embark on a process toward autocratic transition. Our central hypothesis rests on a strategic interaction between a government leader on the one hand and a number of further key government officials on the other, like heads of executive offices, judges, chief commanders of the police or the military, and so forth. The public may intervene into this interaction by challenging a government leader who seeks autocratic transition by vote or by public protests. The latter requires (1) the public’s capability to solve its collective-action problem and (2) a critical mass of the government officials to defect to the public. We will capture these contingencies by the assumption of some—possibly terminal—election to be called for during the transition process which might, with non-zero probability, both stop the transition process and end the unfaithful government leader’s tenure. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We give a brief overview of the relevant literature in Sect. 2. We then develop our model in two steps. In order to first focus on the problem of coordination on extra-constitutional activity, we present a restricted version of the model in Sect. 3. We then fully unfold our model in Sect. 4 by embedding the government leader’s credibility problem regarding the distribution of autocratic rents. In Sect. 5, we discuss our results and derive some normative as well as some empirical implications. We conclude in Sect. 6.",

Humphreys (2019) estimated that state, provincial and local governments provided $32.5 billion in subsidies from 1970 to 2017, in 2017 dollars. Drukker et al. (2020) estimated that the 36 new sports facilities that opened in the US since 2000 resulted in an implicit subsidy of $3.2 billion through tax-exempt bonds to finance new sports facility construction, as well as $3.7 billion in forgone tax revenues. Government subsidies of this size require economic justification, preferably in terms of a thorough cost–benefit analysis. Subsidy proponents, including local politicians and developers, team owners, and fans typically focus entirely on benefits and argue that the construction of new sports facilities will create large tangible economic benefits in the form of increased employment, income, tax revenues, and other beneficial local outcomes. Economists generally find little evidence supporting these claims (Humphreys 2019). Instead, residential and commercial property values near new sports facilities appear to be the only substantial type of local economic benefits generated by new sports facilities.Footnote 1 Public choice scholars view these subsidies as basic rent-seeking (Kalich 1998, Hudson 2002, and Haddock et al. 2013) and Mitchell (2019) describes how state policy makers across the political distribution have favored ““sexy” industries such as hi-tech, entertainment and sports over pedestrian industries such as car repair.” The empirical evidence on sports stadiums implies an interesting political economy of sports facility subsidies where local politicians attempt to gain broad-based support for these subsidies by claiming the creation of widespread economic benefits when the primary beneficiaries will actually be team owners, property developers, and nearby homeowners. The presence of a team and a new stadium in a city could also generate intangible benefits not captured in standard economic outcome measures like a sense of civic pride, world class city status, and other quasi-public goods. Evidence generally supports the idea that residents place a modest value on sports-related intangible benefits (Orolowski and Wicker 2019). In addition to intangible benefits, the presence of one or more professional sports teams and facilities in a city could represent an urban leisure amenity, like a large variety of restaurants, theatres, live music venues, and other consumer goods and services. Urban leisure amenities appear to play an important role in driving urban economic growth by attracting new residents to move to cities in order to gain access to these amenities (Carlino and Saiz 2019). Previous research on the economic impact of professional sports teams and facilities mentioned the potential importance of the effect of professional sports teams and facilities on in-migration to cities. Coates and Humphreys (2005) noted.  “The sports environment in a city, like good weather or access to a coast, may be viewed by workers as an amenity for which they receive compensating wage differentials….The existence of compensating wage differentials depends critically on a steady-state equilibrium where individuals sort themselves into cities based on the amenities and wages across these cities. To date, no research has examined the link between migration and sports, but this area is ripe for additional empirical analysis.” pp. 351–352. No subsequent research addressed this topic. Understanding the impact of new, often publicly subsidized sports facilities on migration represents an important piece of evidence for assessing the overall economic impact of new sports facilities in urban economies and the political economy of sports subsidies. Cities that attract new residents grow faster than cities that lose residents (Glaeser and Shapiro 2001). Local politicians often justify sports subsidies with claims that new facilities will attract new residents, generating substantial long-run local economic benefits, among other community-wide benefits. In this study, we explore the relationship between new sports facilities and migration at the MSA-level using U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data from 1993–2014. We find no significant relationship between new facility openings or spending on new facilities and migration in most model specifications. Where we find statistically significant results, they indicate that new sports facilities have a negative effect on net migration. This paper contributes to the growing literature analyzing the impact of consumer amenities on urban economic development. The migration literature emphasizes that people move to cities because of the presence of many consumer amenities or because of the higher wages that residents of cities earn relative to rural residents. Since cities typically contain high concentrations of both consumer amenities and high wage jobs, disentangling the impact of each on residential location decisions presents an empirical challenge. Quantifying the quantity and quality of consumption amenities further complicates this issue. In terms of governance and sports, elected officials need to understand the full dimensions of the economic impact of new sports facilities in order to make informed decisions about subsidies for the construction of new sports facilities. Unsubstantiated claims about new sports facilities driving migration could influence the government’s decision-making process, leading to a poor allocation of public funds. Ruling out the possibility of a positive impact of new sports facilities on migration increases understanding of the scope of the economic impact of sports facilities and improves decision making by government officials.",2
23.0,3.0,Economics of Governance,03 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-022-00268-z,Does hosting a professional sports team benefit the local community? Evidence from property assessments,December 2022,John Charles Bradbury,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It has become common for local governments to subsidize the relocation and retention of professional sports teams through the construction and operation of sports venues. Since 1970 more than 120 sports stadiums and arenas have opened in North America to host major-league franchises, with public subsidies covering a majority of total construction costs (Humphreys 2019). This does not include funding of minor-league and college sports facilities that also often benefit from public subsidies. The penchant for funding sports venues among local governments in the United States and Canada remains strong, and thus the economic justifications for these projects is an important subject for public policy. Stadium and arena subsidies are often defended as economic development projects, based on the expectation that associated commercial activity will spill over onto the surrounding community to stimulate economic growth. However, consensus findings reported in the large literature on the economic impacts of sports facilities and events offer little support for the hypothesis that sports-related commerce stimulates the local economy (Coates and Humphreys 2008). Spending on sports appears to emanate from intrajurisdictional transfers among residents who sacrifice other local consumption options rather than generating net new economic activity in the community. Thus, the continued subsidization of sports venues appears to be unjustified, which represents a curious example of a persistent government failure. Despite the lack of observable impacts on tangible measures of economic performance (e.g., income, output, employment, etc.), the presence of a professional sports franchise may confer social benefits to the community through neighborhood externalities and non-excludable public good amenities that enhance residents’ quality of life. These potential unpriced benefits are not captured in sports consumption but are still valued by local residents. Rosentraub (2014) argues that amenity spillovers from hosting a professional sports team make the region more attractive and livable for businesses and residents, which ultimately results in positive returns on public investments in sports stadiums: “As investments, the tax dollars expended for venues have generated positive net financial returns. Cities can and do win in the sense that the financial returns the public sector receives are more than the funds expended”(p. xv). If professional sports teams generate positive fiscal impacts through existence spillovers, then public subsidization of sports venues and their widespread political support may be justified. In a Tiebout (1956) and Oates (1969) framework, the welfare gains from spillovers that derive from hosting a professional sports team should be reflected in local property values. As Carlino and Coulson (2004) notes, “If people like having a professional sports franchise in their community, they are presumably willing to pay for it, if not directly through the purchase of season tickets, then indirectly through an increased willingness to pay for housing in the area” (p. 27). Increased local property values should translate into greater property assessments that raise additional property tax revenue for the host municipality, providing another channel through which a stadium may have a positive fiscal impact on its community. Therefore, fiscal effects from stadium spillovers on resident taxpayers ought to be observable in property assessments. Though economists have examined neighborhood effects of stadiums on local real estate prices, the extended fiscal impact through property assessments has received little study. In 2013, Atlanta National League Baseball Club (ANLBC) of Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that it was moving its team (“Atlanta Braves”) from its downtown Atlanta stadium (Turner Field) in Fulton County to the suburban business district of Cumberland in adjacent Cobb County. As part of the agreement to host the team, Cobb County committed $300 million in public funds to subsidize the construction and operation of a new stadium (Truist Park).Footnote 1 A novel feature of the stadium is that it is part of a broader mixed-use development, which is owned and operated by ANLBC. The stadium is also uniquely positioned within metropolitan Atlanta to attract new customers and residents from the region, due to its location at the junction of major highways on the Cobb County border. Thus, the stadium is placed ideally to facilitate economic activity by attracting cross-border consumption and migration from non-Cobb residents and expand the County’s taxbase through added sales and property tax collections. Cobb Board of Commissioners Chairman Tim Lee touted the stadium development as an economic “home run for Cobb County,” which would stimulate economic growth and pay for itself through increased tax revenue derived from the project, declaring that the stadium would be “the single greatest economic development project in the modern history of Cobb County” (Klepal 2013; Lee 2016). However, the predicted impacts have not manifested in the local economy. Studies of the business district surrounding the stadium (Bradbury 2022) and County sales tax receipts (Bradbury 2021) do not identify significant increases in economic activity following the opening of the ballpark. This analysis extends the examination of the stadium’s impact further by observing changes in county-wide property assessments. Added residential and commercial amenities from the stadium should be evident in local property values, which ought to reflect the social and economic value of the stadium borne by the citizens who funded the project. Increased property values should correspondingly grow the County’s tax digest to help cover the costs of the stadium. Though the stadium may not have directly stimulated sufficient commercial activity to justify the public subsidies, the total social benefits may rise to that level. I use the synthetic control method to compare Cobb’s property assessments before and after the announcement and opening of Truist Park relative to other metro-Atlanta counties, which provide a donor pool of control units to generate a reasonable counterfactual estimate of Cobb County property assessment values absent the stadium. Synthetic control comparisons indicate that Cobb property assessments did not deviate from their pre-stadium trajectories following the announcement or opening of the stadium. Instead, Cobb’s property tax digest growth has been typical among metro-Atlanta counties, which indicates that post-stadium growth in Cobb property assessments reflects a regional trend rather than a response to the stadium development. The estimates are robust to sensitivity and placebo tests. Because the team relocated within the same metropolitan area, cross-county congruence cannot reflect spillovers from the Cobb stadium onto the larger region. Though Cobb residents have borne the financial obligation of funding the stadium, they have not experienced a corresponding financial return through increased property assessments. The findings also contribute to the regional science and economics literatures on intangible stadium spillovers, in which studies have produced mixed findings. Georgia’s property assessments are regularly curated to reflect market transactions and thus capture social benefits capitalized in property values. The lack of deviation from pre-stadium trends in Cobb assessment values does not support the hypothesis that sports stadiums are strong sources of non-pecuniary social benefits to local residents. Though this analysis is a case study, its findings are likely generalizable to other stadium projects. From its inception, Truist Park was well-suited to be successful and generate net new economic activity and tax revenue through interjurisdictional competition in the region. Its impotence despite its unique advantages indicates that most stadium projects are unlikely to have strong positive effects on local communities that would justify standard levels of public subsidies typically provided for stadium projects.",5

Prior to 1998, participation was limited strictly to amateur athletes to the exclusion of professionals. In the sport of ice hockey, this meant that players from the top professional league in North America, The National Hockey League (NHL), were excluded from eligibility. In the U.S., rosters were comprised mostly of college-level players who could meet the eligibility requirements. In a major policy shift, the NHL allowed their players to represent their respective countries in the Olympic Games from 1998 to 2014. This was not without significant disruption, as the NHL is the only professional sports league in North America whose season is directly interrupted by players participating in the Winter Olympics.Footnote 1 During Olympic years, NHL play was paused for the duration of the Games, eliminating the need for players to miss league games. The NHL made this accommodation in part to increase demand for the sport by leveraging the increased visibility of the sport at the Games.Footnote 2 In 2017, Commissioner Gary Bettman reversed this decision, ending NHL participation in the Olympics. His reasoning was that added fatigue from the additional 12 games played, the possible lengthy travel and because of a potential season-ending injury for star players. As late as May 27, 2019, Bettman indicated in his annual state of the league address that their position on Olympic participation remained unchanged.Footnote 3 Despite that, in July 2020, the NHL changed course yet again, approving player participation in 2022 and 2026.Footnote 4 Based on published reports, the primary issues driving the decision to participate (or not), revolve around insurance and media rights for the league, and the players’ desire to play as expressed by the NHLPA.Footnote 5 This represented a distinct change in perspective from the league. According to NHL.com columnist Nicholas Cotsonika, as of 2017, the NHL “…has never seen any objective evidence of a positive impact on the business or sport. In many ways, it has seen a negative impact.”Footnote 6 In January 2017, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly stated, ""[Q]uite frankly we don't see what the benefit is from the game standpoint or the League standpoint with respect to Olympic participation.""Footnote 7 Given that one of the primary benefits of participation by professionals may be growing interest in the sport both in North America and beyond, systematic investigation of this question is vitally important for those who govern the structure of Olympic competition (members of the IOC) and the North American professional game (The NHL league office). In this paper, we construct a game-level attendance model to address this question. Specifically, our goal is to determine the extent to which having Olympians on an NHL team roster increases attendance in an Olympic year.Footnote 8 To our knowledge, no previously published studies consider the impact of player participation on subsequent demand for NHL games. Figure 1 provides some evidence from the last Games at which players participated that Olympic participation increases attendance at the league-wide level in the season in which the Games occurred. To construct this graph, we run a linear regression using attendance as the dependent variable and time as the independent variable. For each of the four groups analyzed (according to number of Olympians), we run two separate regressions considering the period before and after the end of the Games. There appear to be clear discontinuities at the time of the Olympic break. More intriguing are the apparent differences in the response to the Games based on how many Olympians were on the NHL team. This, of course, could be driven by factors other than increased fan interest due to Olympic participation. The extent to which this is driven by Olympic participation by players is unknown and our primary purpose with this study. Changes in average live attendance pre and post Olympics, 2013–14 Season. Data source: Hockey-reference.com In Figure 2, we show the monthly average of NHL attendance across six seasons: from the 2012–12 up to the 2017–18 season. The figure clearly shows that the only season with a strong increase between January and February (when the Olympics ends) is 2013–14.Footnote 9 Of particular note are the declines in attendance in February and March during the 2017-18 season, which was also an Olympic year but one in which NHL players did not participate. Taken together, Figures 1 and 2 appear to show an Olympic attendance effect that varies by team depending on the number of Olympians on that team. More generally, NHL attendance is remarkably consistent across seasons. If there is an “Olympic effect” on attendance, it appears to be brief. Measuring average NHL monthly attendance across six different seasons. Data source: Hockey-reference.com (Schedule and Results) While it may be that allowing players to participate has significant spillover effects in terms of increases in attendance for NHL contests after the conclusion of the Games, it must be balanced against the potential risks. During previous Olympics, a number of players have sustained serious injuries. During the 2014 Sochi Games, four players suffered season-ending injuries and several other players suffering less severe injuries that forced them to miss league games at the conclusion of the Olympics (Rosen 2017). Fatigue may also be a significant risk. If teams that send large cohort to the Games are left physically drained for having done so, their post-Games performance may suffer. Rosen (2017) notes multiple examples of teams who sent the most players to the Olympics faring badly in the postseason. As the IOC, NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) governing bodies work to craft a long-term solution, it will be important to compare these costs to the hoped-for benefits of increased demand. In the section that follows, we review the existing literature related to our research question. Section 3 describes our data; Sect. 4 contains our empirical strategy; Sect. 5 contains our results and discussion and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",

23.0,3.0,Economics of Governance,26 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10101-022-00279-w,College sports governance: “Amateurism” enforcement in big time college sports,December 2022,Rodney Fort,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Amateurism has been part of the credo of college sports since the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS), the forerunner of the NCAA in 1906.Footnote 6 In this early formative period, UAs used the IAAUS/NCAA just to proclaim amateurism. IAAUS (1906) makes its claim to amateurism crystal clear in Article VI, Principles of Amateur Sport. However, over time, philosophy was pitted against other values that sports could produce for UAs. It is these values that are pertinent to this paper since they represent the reason why UAs care about college sports in general, and amateurism specifically. Fort and Winfree (2013, p. 33) summarize and reference the large literature concerning the values of college sports to UAs. Only the actual direct payment of student support to the university (tuition and any portion of room, board, and books) appears on the athletic department books. The longest list of values is collected indirectly across the entire campus.Footnote 7 Fort and Winfree (2013) also posit that UAs decide the size and scope of athletic endeavor that best contributes to their objectives of research, teaching, and service. UAs take all of their opportunity costs and relevant value margins into account, with the athletic mix considered relative to the overall university endeavor. Then, just as with any unit they oversee, UAs choose a spending level for a particular quality and quantity of college sports to satisfy their objective. And it is here that the value of amateurism matters to UAs. It is completely non-controversial in the economic analysis of college sports that amateurism results in a transfer from some athletes to UAs.Footnote 8 UAs then include the transfer as they consider funding their research, teaching, and service goals. To the extent that UAs control any portion of the transfer, amateurism adds dollars to the UAs consideration of the quality and quantity of college sports at their institution. Quite bluntly, under amateurism, athletes subsidize the creation of the values created by their sports participation. The following model formulation lends rigor to the simple description in Fort and Winfree (2013). For a given (for now) quality and quantity, UAs choice of the best athletic department that suits their objectives will lead them to minimize their expenditure on college sports, referred to as “institutional support”. The amount of institutional support equals the remaining costs after sports-generated revenues. In the absence of any transfer, let \(C=A+M+S\) be the total cost of running sports. \(A\) is the “unrestricted” payment to athletes that would otherwise occur in the absence of amateur enforcement,Footnote 9\(M\) is the payment to other mobile resources like coaches and athletic directors (ADs). \(S\) is the rest of the cost of running all the sports. Let \(R\) be all sources of generated revenues from running the sports (gate and gate-related, television, memorabilia, and donations). With this formulation, the institutional support required for the quality and quantity of sports under consideration can be written: A very few programs are fortunate to have \(R\ge A+M+S\Rightarrow{I}^{0}\le 0\), that is, either no institutional support is required, or UAs may even need to consider what to do with excess sport-generated revenue. According to UAs own “Member Financial Reports”, discussed later, it appears that the vast majority of UAs have \(R<A+M+S\Rightarrow{I}^{0}>0\), that is, positive institutional support will be required in order to generate the level of the values created by college sports that UAs judge as best serving their goals. The amateurism transfer from athletes to UAs is a portion of their otherwise unrestricted payment, \(0\le \alpha \le 1\). If \(\alpha =0\), there is no transfer and athletes receive their unrestricted pay. For a given quality and quantity of the output they produce, amateurism reduces the athlete’s pay to \(\left(1-\alpha \right)A\). The rest goes to subsidize the pursuits of UAs. The actual determination of \(\alpha\) over the history of the NCAA is discussed below. The UAs view \(\alpha A\) as another source of revenue in addition to \(R\). But portions of \(\alpha A\) are competed away to other mobile resources. If one AD won’t spend some of the transfer on, say, coaches, others will. Let \(0\le \beta \le 1\) be the competitively determined portion of \(\alpha A\) going to the mobile resources. Completely brisk competition over mobile resources could, indeed, push \(\beta =1\), gobbling up all the transfer from athletes to UAs. UAs retain \(\left(1-\beta \right)\) and would prefer that \(\beta\) be as small as possible. Attempts to reduce β directly have failed in the past. Through the NCAA, UAs attempted to reduce pay to assistant coaches in 1995 but were foiled by the courts (Law v. NCAA, 902 F. Supp. 1394 (1995)), subsequently costing the organization $66 million (Johnson 1998). But the number of assistant coaches has been limited by the NCAA, for example, the limit in FBS football is now 10 on-field assistant coaches, four on-field graduate assistants, and five strength coaches. (Division I Manual, 11.7.4). With the introduction of \(\beta\), the new institutional support consideration becomes: The difference between (2) and (1) is: Note that \({I}^{{\prime }}-{I}^{0}<0\) for \(\beta <1\). So long as competition does not send all the transfer from athletes to the mobile resources, the transfer reduces institutional spending for a given quality and quantity of sports. From this perspective, anything UAs can do to increase \(\alpha\) will reduce the amount of other budget resources they must invest toward their ideal athletic department as institutional support. Their investment would be lowest for “pure” NCAA-defined amateurism, that is \(\alpha =1\). Thus, higher \(\alpha\) is a real policy goal if it can be obtained. The history that follows below documents their efforts concerning \(\alpha\).Footnote 10 Notice that the presence or absence of the transfer need not change either the quantity and quality of sports or the university choice by athletes and coaches if the same proportional impact occurs across universities. That leaves at least some of what would otherwise be institutional support to be redirected to other UA purposes. Of course, that savings could be used to increase the quality and/or quantity of sports as well.Footnote 11 Amateurism enforcement becomes policy and action aimed at maintaining the highest possible \(\alpha\). Following the logic above, it is important to note that an iterative process produced compensation rules governing the size of payment to athletes, \(\left(1-\alpha \right)A\), observed today. Direct payment of athletes was rampant for decades after the formation of the NCAA as the best players produced the highest revenues. In the previous presentation, this would have \(\alpha \cong 0\). Couched in terms of “purity” and “amateurism”, objections arose to this direct payment. Interestingly, while a few voices argued sports should be purely amateur, per se, so that \(A=0\), the types of impositions that resulted began a gradual increase in \(\alpha\) so that payment to athletes \(\left(1-\alpha \right)A\) declined. Without driving \(A=0\), the transfer from athletes to UAs would increase because of the historical imposition of limitations on athlete compensation. The Sanity Code, put in place for the 1948 season, outright forbade any payment to athletes at all. Under the Code, even academic tuition was considered pay-for-play. This should have maximized the transfer to UAs. However, there were no detection and enforcement powers over “cheating” on this cooperative agreement granted to anybody, including the NCAA. In the classical way, the Code failed to stop payments to athletes and lasted only to 1951. For example, the “Seven Sinners” boldly granted academic tuition to their athletes in open and direct violation of the Sanity Code.Footnote 12 However, the successful use of their NCAA to regulate television broadcasts in that same year 1951 led UAs to undertake the first investigation into using their NCAA to enforce amateurism in 1952.Footnote 13 In 1956, amateurism was redefined from zero compensation to allowed grants-in-aid (GIAs), and the NCAA simultaneously was granted the formal power via its new enforcement division. Originally, GIAs were explicitly and only for tuition, room, board, and books, an amount that was less than the full cost of attendance determined and published by university registrars. For the next few decades, changes to the definition of amateurism concerned restricting athlete compensation to subsets of expenses on “tuition, room, board, and books”, and imposing limits on the size and number of GIAs in all sports except football and basketball. For example, Title IX was passed in 1972 and Divisions I, II, and III were created in 1973. There was work to do in redefining athlete compensation. NCAA (1975, pp. 38–63) chronicles proposed amendments to exclude course-related supplies, books, and incidental expenses; to limit GIAs to students that could demonstrate need, and to further limit the size and number of GIAs in all sports, passed in 1973. By 2014, in the face of court hostility in that year’s O’Bannon v. NCAA, the “autonomy” programs were granted separate power to define and administer categories of college sports finance, independent of the other NCAA members.Footnote 14 The very next year, in 2015, the autonomy programs redefined amateurism yet again. GIAs would be allowed, but not required, to equal “full cost of attendance” as defined by university registrars. Originally, the full cost of attendance redefinition of amateurism only applied to the autonomy programs. But it was a short time before some of the rest of the programs also pushed for the same full cost of attendance GIAs for their athletes. In addition, athletes could avail themselves of special needs NCAA programs for other funding. It was even allowable that programs pay for parents of athletes to travel to events. And there had long been rules that allowed Olympic athletes to keep training reimbursement and competition monetary awards. Amateurism was re-defined again because of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Alston v. NCAA, removing limits on NCAA caps on the amount of education-related compensation to athletes. In addition, state laws allowing athletes to capitalize on their name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights activated in some states on July 1, 2021. The only remaining restrictions concern so-called NIL “collectives” that cannot just act as payment mechanisms without services required and, of course, that athletes cannot collect any of the game day, television, or post-season revenue they help to generate. As noted earlier, college sports amateurism bears no resemblance to the common understanding of that term; it literally is whatever UAs say that it is, limited by the courts, and codified in the Division I Manual. The remainder of this section is concerned with the inevitable result that, as with all cooperative arrangements, there is an incentive to cheat on amateurism compensation restrictions. Recall the limiting case of no enforcement and the end of the Sanity Code. Whenever rules are enacted and enforced, there are winners and losers. Since the losers would pay to be in the pre-rule situation, amateurism rules without enforcement cannot be an equilibrium. Losers would just return to their previous behavior, “leaking” the transfer back to athletes. Rules create incentives to cheat and require enforcement. Following the literature about cheating on amateurism, Fort (2018b, Chap. 13) summarized the economic basics of cheating, algebraically and graphically. Let \(P\) be the probability of getting caught, \(G\) the gain from cheating, and \(L\) the penalty if cheating is detected. The expected value of cheating is: For given \(G\), and a particular announcement of \(L\) by the enforcer, the potential cheater considers the linear tradeoff between EV and \(P\) in (4). In the previous notation, we could write \(\alpha \left(P,L\right)\), \(\frac{\partial \alpha }{\partial P}>0\) and \(\frac{\partial \alpha }{\partial L}>0\) so that greater enforcement and/or stricter penalties help to maintain higher \(\alpha\).Footnote 15 The rest of the sections in this paper deal in the main with the determinants of observed enforcement, consistent with the three criticisms listed in the introduction— spending on enforcement, the relative costs of types of enforcement, and the values that UAs place on enforcement aimed at higher- and lower-revenue programs. Fleisher et al. (1988) and Fleisher, Goff & Tollison (1992, Chaps. 2 and 5) offer the economic logic behind cheating by individual coaches, alumni, and schools. Fort and Quirk (1999) offered further insights into who would be the most likely to cheat. These authors essentially discuss the determination of \(G\) in expression (4).Footnote 16 Cheating might accompany dramatic changes in fortunes on the field. Older coaches risk a higher reputation value if they get caught, so cheating should happen most with younger coaches. The potential for high financial gain should increase cheating. This might characterize programs with potential but uncollected TV contracts and/or a stadium with excess capacity. Finally, lower academic standards can increase cheating by allowing academically underqualified athletes to participate at a high level. It ends up that all of these have explanatory power in empirical work.Footnote 17 Coaches want to jump from lower-revenue departments to higher-revenue departments and have the incentive to offer additional payment to athletes to aid in that goal. Coaches’ desires become more consistent with maximizing their AD’s revenue only after they have joined the larger-revenue program. As for athletes, some know that they are worth more than their GIA and will be glad to take the coaches up on their cheat offers. Fort (2018a) concludes that there is little incentive to cheat by ADs. The amateurism system was designed to leave revenue maximization, and the resulting distribution of success across departments intact. All cheating reduces the transfer from athletes to UAs. In addition, conference revenue sharing reduces the incentive to cheat since the entire shared pie is reduced in size when transfers leak back to coaches or athletes. In the more extensive presentation in this paper, expression (3) shows that all cheating that occurs by boosters, coaches, and players reduces \(\alpha\), requiring either less athletic department output or an increase in the institutional support if the level of athletic department output is to remain constant. This all suggests that ADs, rather than having any incentive to cheat, instead have every incentive to monitor cheating.Footnote 18 The overriding result from the foregoing overview is that there is an incentive for coaches and athletes to cheat and that cheating reduces the transfer from athletes to UAs. Amateurism enforcement is required to keep \(\alpha\) and the resulting transfer from athletes to UAs at their highest attainable levels.",

As a public-facing, emotionally driven industry, professional and elite-level sport provides an important opportunity to explore the connection between business and politics. Thus far, work highlighted important connections between professional sport teams, local politicians, residents, and consumers (Friedman and Mason 2004; Delaney and Eckstein 2006). In particular, some research explores how the political identity of team owners (as measured by political donations) affects organization-level outcomes (Hayduk 2021a), and how ideological similarity between owners and local residents affects teams’ profitability (Hayduk 2021b). While the previous work has contributed to the study of sports and politics, there are significant opportunities to build on this line of inquiry. First, this work utilizes political donations as a signal of owners’ ideological beliefs, but does not examine the determinants of individual donation choices. Second, this work did not examine owners’ donation activity across multiple leagues, creating questions about generalizability. Third, the extant work has not explored how election cycles impact owners’ donation activity, raising questions about whether and how heightened media attention moderates owners’ donation activity. Thus, the purpose of this paper was to identify the league- and election cycle-based dependencies of professional sport team owners’ individual donations. The paper explores determinants of both (a) donation amount and (b) donation partisanship. The paper does so by analyzing N=2,789 donations tied to 158 owners across six leagues and three election cycles. Results from the analysis reveal that donation amounts and partisanship vary significantly across both leagues and election cycles. The results of this analysis produce implications for academics and practitioners. First, the variations across leagues and election cycles creates natural incentives for future research to examine the generalizability of previous league-specific findings (e.g., Hayduk 2021a 2021b). In particular, researchers should explore how teams’ valuations impact owners’ personal cash flow and donation patterns. Second, research should examine in more detail the growing role of leagues’ consumer strategy in the creation and implementation of formal policies. Future research also needs to identify a framework for explaining the impact of presidential cycles on donation patterns, which this paper documented as inconsistent with popular election cycle frameworks. For practitioners, the findings reinforce that owners’ donation patterns can be connected to leagues’ strategic priorities, and suggest that policy support via donations can perhaps be used as a mechanism to build consumer loyalty and trust.",

Depken II,Adam J. Hoffer,Abdul H. Kidwai,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Team and League governance of rival fan interactions is a pressing issue for policy-makers and sports administrators. In North American sports there have been a number of recent instances of fights between home and away fans inside and outside the event venue, some of which have resulted in death or substantial injury. During the 2021 Major League Baseball season alone, there were fan fights in October (between fans of the Houston Astros and Chicago White SoxFootnote 1) in August (between fans of the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers,Footnote 2 between fans of the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox,Footnote 3 between San Diego Padres fansFootnote 4), in May (between fans of the Los Angeles DodgersFootnote 5). In 2013, a Los Angeles Dodgers fan was fatally stabbed in a fight with a San Francisco Giant fan after a game in San Francisco.Footnote 6 In the National Football League, a San Francisco 49er fan was left in a medically-induced coma after a fight with a Los Angeles Rams fan after the NFC Championship game at Los Angeles’s home stadium.Footnote 7 During the 2021–2022 National Hockey League season, there was an altercation in November between fans of the home team Las Vegas Golden Knights and the visiting Edmonton Oilers (that involved a prosthetic leg)Footnote 8 and another in May between fans of the visiting Anaheim Ducks and the home team St. Louis Blues,Footnote 9 to name just a few. In Europe, Hooliganism in Italy’s Serie A football (soccer) stadiums became such a negative influence on families and other fans attending matches in the early 2000s, that in 2007 the league instituted a “fidelity card” intended to weed out the hooligans and signal to less committed fans that attending the matches would be less onerous. The program was expanded in 2009 to involve fan-specific identification cards which can only be obtained after a police background check and which can be revoked if the holder engages in banned behavior.Footnote 10 Concerns about public safety surrounding hooliganism in English football, and other football leagues in Europe, have led to regulations and club rules about where visiting fans can sit (Taylor 1989, p. 6), how ticket transfers are regulated (Taylor 1989, p. 47), how pre- and post-match interactions between home and visiting fans are regulated (Taylor 1989, p. 44–45), and whether alcohol is sold in the stadium (Taylor 1989, p. 43, and Jabbar 2018). There might be an increase in recent fan altercations inside and outside stadiums but it is difficult to say for sure. There is no long-running record of fan altercations and recent news coverage might be as much driven by social media and other means of advertising that such altercations have occurred compared to earlier eras. Nevertheless, sports economics researchers are interested in studying the interaction of fans with each other, especially in the context of rivalries and team and league decisions on whether and how to limit negative interactions (for example Baxter et al. 2019). To the extent that negative interactions might reduce interest in attending a team or league’s events or consuming them in various media, teams and leagues have a fiduciary incentive to monitor and mitigate such interactions. However, the literature focusing on how home and visiting fans interact is relatively scant. The bulk of the literature relies on ex post data of police reports of various types of crimes that happen before, during, and after a sporting event in the host city and, perhaps in the city of the visiting team as a counterfactual (see, for example, Card and Dahl 2011, Billings and Depken 2012, and Menaker, et al. 2019). Most studies find that crime increases in the vicinity of the event venue leading up to and immediately after the event and that crime is higher when there is an unexpected loss on the part of the home team (see the aforementioned papers). There is also evidence that domestic violence incidents increase during certain sporting events even though the interaction, in this case, is not between home and visiting fans (Card and Dahl 2011). The implication of this nascent literature is that there are potential social costs to sporting events that are not included in the traditional cost–benefit analysis of sporting events and this suggests there is a need for more information about how home and visiting fans might interact ex ante to the sporting event. Because it is cost prohibitive to undertake a wide-spread survey of home and visiting fans attitudes about each other and their possible interactions, both amiable and antagonistic, that might occur before, during, and after the event, we turn to the experimental economics literature to simulate interactions between home and away fans with each other. Specifically, we turn to the large and established literature that investigates in-group and out-group discrimination patterns using dictator-taking experiments designed to elicit authentic attitudes towards in-group and out-group members through value-at-risk measures (see, for example, Forsythe et al. 1994, and Lane 2006). Humphreys (2015) suggests that behavioral studies in the field of sports economics has a prominent role to play in future research that explores decision-making by consumers, managers, individuals, and groups. In this paper, we combine previous literatures on experiments that attempt to measure group-based discrimination with sports economics research on fan behavior and rivalries. In this study, we conduct an artefactual dictator-takings field experiment that explores group discrimination using sports rivalries as a naturally-occurring group identifier. As part of our artefactual experiment design, we recruit sports fans as our subject pool – individuals who are passionate about sports (as opposed to using a subject pool of, say, a classroom of economics students). The artefactual field design helps us bridge the observed differences between field and lab studies. We also employ a within-subject design that allows us to explore discrimination heterogeneity at the subject-level. To preview our results, we find significant discrimination toward the out-group. In a dictator power-to-take game, participants took on average $1.20—$1.90 (out of a possible $10) more from rival fans than from in-group fans or fans of an unknown affiliation. That amounts to an increase in taking—a discriminatory effect—of roughly 18.5 to 28.9 percent. This effect is statistically different from zero in all model specifications. The effect size is considerably larger than many previous findings in the literature. We suggest that our results are not only informative about the specific groups that are self-identified by the experiment participants, but that our results are a proof of concept that can be replicated in various cities and regions of the United States to help inform teams and leagues about different attitudes about in-group and out-group members, here interpreted as home and visiting fans. Informed on these attitudes, leagues and teams can adapt their governance of the interaction between home and away fans before, during, and after the event, when such interactions are expected to be extremely negative and potentially violent. Such measures might be similar to those taken in European football (soccer) including limits on where visiting team fans can sit, how many tickets they can purchase, when and where they can enter and leave the stadium, or might be venue and rivalry specific.",

Empirical studies (e.g. Sherer, 1967; Blundell et al. 1999) reveal that the answer is ‘yes’. There are many explanations consistent with this answer. One is that the firms with high market shares have incentives to innovate pre-emptively in patent races, and sometimes even wastefully (Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1980; Gilbert and Newbery 1982; Fudenberg et al. 1983). Another explanation is that incentives to hide valuable information can induce firms to use their profits to finance R &D for patent-related innovation and this is much easier for firms with higher market shares or profits (Bhattacharya and Ritter 1983). According to a different view proposed by Blundell et al. (1999), firms with higher market shares tend to have a larger stock of patents to ensure a higher valuation on the stock market. Our paper suggests another explanation: Monopolies may invest in R &D to reduce the likelihood of regulatory threat. To check whether this can be true, we consider a natural monopoly with private cost information and show that this monopoly when threatened to be optimally regulated by a public authority (regulator) under the mechanism of Baron and Myerson (BM) 1982, can reduce the likelihood of this threat by investing in cost-reducing innovations and the regulator, anticipating this strategic behavior, can optimally set the likelihood of regulatory threat. The BM (1982) mechanism is a direct revelation mechanism that consists of a price and quantity schedule, a subsidy schedule, and a probability schedule identifying when the monopolist should be allowed to operate. This mechanism, which asks the monopolist to report its marginal cost information, maximizes expected social welfare under the incentive-compatibility condition that the monopolist has no incentive for misreporting and the individual-rationality condition that the monopolist does not make any loss under truthful reporting. In cases where the expected social welfare function puts a lower weight on the producer’s expected profit (expected operation profit plus expected subsidy received) than on expected consumer welfare (expected consumer surplus net of expected subsidy paid), the optimal mechanism requires the regulatory price schedule to exceed the marginal cost of the monopolist by an informational markup. This markup contracts the quantity of the monopolist and limits the actual producer profit consisting of informational rent. The integration of the BM (1982) model with the idea of regulatory threat is novel. Recently, Saglam (2022) studied whether a natural monopolist facing an external threat to be regulated by the mechanism of BM (1982) can reduce the likelihood of this threat by constraining its price. While Saglam (2022) extends the pioneering work of Glazer and McMillan (1992) who consider the self-regulation problem of a monopolist under symmetric information, we extend both of these works in two directions. First, we differ in the self-regulatory tool available to the monopolist. We assume that the monopolist alleviates the threat of regulation by controlling the amount of R &D investment,Footnote 1 instead of constraining its price as in Glazer and McMillan (1992) and Saglam (2022). Second, we change the causality between the external regulatory threat and the self-regulation of the monopolist. In Glazer and McMillan (1992) and Saglam (2022) the monopolist appeals to self-regulation (by constraining its price beforehand) to optimally control the likelihood of regulatory threat whereas in our paper the regulator appeals to regulatory threat to optimally impact the R &D investment (or self-regulatory behavior) of the monopolist. Previous works have studied incentives of monopolies in cost reducing R &D when they face external regulation with certainty. (See, for example, Baron and Besanko 1984; Lewis and Yildirim 2002; and Giuseppe and De Vincenti 2004.) These works generally assume dynamic setups with multi-period monopolies and some of them even assume away the moral-hazard problem. The closest works to our paper are by Cantner and Kuhn 1999 and Saglam (2019), who study the incentives of a monopolist, in a single-period framework, to invest in cost-reducing innovations whenever it is regulated with certainty under an incentive-compatible mechanism that extends the solution of BM (1982). Our paper differs from those of Cantner and Kuhn (1999) and Saglam (2019) in two important aspects. First, unlike in their papers, we assume that the regulator is always aware of the monopolist’s R &D technology and that she can fully monitor its R &D investment. Second, and more distinctively, the monopolist has an additional incentive to spend on cost-reducing R &D in our paper. Both Cantner and Kuhn (1999) and Saglam (2019) assume that external regulation will occur with certainty, leaving no role for the self-regulation of the monopolist. Thus, the monopolist’s incentive to spend on cost-reducing R &D is only to increase the information rent that will be provided by a given incentive-compatible regulatory mechanism. However, in our work the external regulation may occur with uncertainty and this uncertainty presents an additional incentive for innovation once the monopolist realizes that it can alleviate the regulatory threat by making cost-reducing R &D investments. We assume that the regulatory process consists of two stages: the ex-ante stage and the interim stage. In the ex-ante stage, the monopolist has not learned its marginal cost yet.Footnote 2 In this stage, the regulator picks a probability value and announces that the monopolist will be regulated in the interim stage with this probability and under the optimal regulatory mechanism of BM (1982). The monopolist, hearing this announcement, chooses the optimal level of R &D investment maximizing its expected profit under the regulatory threat it faces. In the following (interim) stage, the monopolist privately learns its cost parameter. Then, the randomization associated with the regulatory threat is realized.Footnote 3 If the outcome requires regulatory action, the monopolist is regulated in accordance with the BM (1982) mechanism, under which the monopolist reveals its private cost information in return for some information rent. But, if the outcome of the randomization implies no regulatory action, the monopolist is allowed to freely enjoy its monopoly profit. The described regulatory process involves a strategic game played by the monopolist and the regulator in the ex-ante stage. The regulator picks and announces a probability of regulation and the monopolist, after hearing this announcement, decides on its R &D level. We assume that the regulator can solve this sequential game by backward induction. That is, she can calculate for each value of the probability of regulation, the monopolist’s optimal R &D response and expected social welfare induced by it. This calculation allows the regulator to determine the equilibrium probability value under which expected social welfare, induced by the monopolist’s R &D response, is maximized. The strategy pair involving the monopolist’s optimal R &D response schedule (calculated at each value of the probability of regulation) and the socially-optimal probability of regulation forms a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) for the described sequential game. We numerically compute this equilibrium for a rich set of parameter values and make several comparative statics. Our main results suggest that the monopolist invests more in R &D if the regulatory threat is less certain. Anticipating this behavior, the regulator makes her threat less certain if the monopolist becomes more favored by the social welfare function. Moreover, we find that regulation with uncertainty can be Pareto superior to regulation with certainty if the weight of the monopolist’s profit in social welfare is sufficiently, but not extremely, high or if the cost of R &D is sufficiently small. However, we also show that regulating the monopolist with uncertainty is not self-enforcing (incentive-compatible from the viewpoint of the regulator) if it is socially more beneficial than regulating the monopolist with certainty, which arises if the welfare weight of the monopolist is sufficiently large. The idea of a monopolist’s self-regulation through R &D investment to alleviate the risk of external regulation is, to the best of our knowledge, novel to our paper. However, the regulatory-threat hypothesis –that the prices/rates of firms are affected by regulatory threat– has been extensively studied in the previous literature, pioneered by Klevorick (1973). Empirical studies showed that the regulatory threat affected/restrained, in the past, pricing strategies in several industries/markets, involving the oil industry (Erfle and McMillan 1990), the pharmaceutical industry (Zweifel and Crivelli 1996; Ellison and Wolfram 2006), long-distance telephone markets (Taylor and Zona 1997), the automobile insurance market (Boyer 2000), electricity pool market (Acutt et al. 2001), the credit card market (Stango 2003), and the heating industry (Bonev et al. 2020). While the theoretical work of Klevorick (1973) modeled the uncertainty element associated with the regulatory threat by assuming that regulatory rate reviews occur stochastically through time (according to a Bernoulli process), the empirical studies measured the level of regulatory threat either by the number of customer complaints about prices received by a national board, or by the intensity of debates (in a congressional committee or a congress) about bills proposing explicit price/rate caps, or even by the frequency in which the threat of regulation is mentioned in major newspapers and banking newsletters. On the other hand, our work determines the uncertainty associated with the regulatory threat endogenously using a game-theoretic framework, as was earlier done in the literature of self-regulation by the works of DeMarzo et al. (2005) and Van Koten (2021) where a self-regulatory organization or a governmental oversight uses the probability of investigation to optimally inspect fraud in a financial sector model. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces our theoretical model, Sect. 3 presents our computational results, and Sect. 4 concludes.",

However, coordination is not always successful. Important coordination problems can arise when the groups that need to coordinate differ considerably from one another. Coordination becomes particularly challenging in firms and organisations that are faced with the need to first promote cooperation within groups and then coordination between groups. In these complex situations, group partnership is central to explain the success of intergroup coordination. This paper experimentally investigates the role of inter- and intragroup heterogeneity in intergroup coordination. The source of heterogeneity is based on the pro-social preferences of group members. Specifically, an exogenous sorting mechanism is applied to create groups based on the similarity of initial propensities to cooperate. Previous research has shown that assortative matching is one of the most effective non-punitive mechanisms to foster intragroup cooperation (Chaudhuri 2011; Guido et al. 2019), but its effects on intergroup coordination remain unexplored. This paper therefore addresses an important empirical question: are sorted groups more or less able to achieve efficient intergroup coordination than randomly formed groups? A novel laboratory experiment is designed to answer this question under tightly controlled conditions. Intergroup coordination is modelled by means of an intergroup rank-order competition game. This competition game involves providing incentives for groups to coordinate on multiple Pareto-ranked symmetric pure strategy equilibria. The efficient equilibrium consists of all groups contributing at the maximum level, while zero contribution by all groups leads to the worst equilibrium. At any symmetric equilibrium, all groups are top-ranked and win the competition (“all-can-win”). The competitive context captures the essential features of an “equality-of-opportunities” society (not “equality-of-outcomes”) at the group level.Footnote 1 This is a significant feature for addressing group diversity and social inclusion. The experiment has two treatments, each of which has three phases. For both treatments, phase 0 consists of eliciting individual cooperative preferences by playing a one-shot public goods game (Gächter and Thöni 2005). In phase 1, participants are grouped into 12-person organisations consisting of four 3-member groups. There are two procedures to form the groups, one for each treatment. Using a fixed-matching protocol, members in each group play a repeated linear public goods game for ten periods. Later, phase 2 introduces a rank-order competition among the four groups that make up each organisation, holding constant the group composition from phase 1 (Reuben and Tyran 2010). At the end of the experiment, a questionnaire is administered to assess another aspect related to preferences: distributional preferences (Singelis et al. 1995). The two treatments are conducted in a between-subject design. They differ in the grouping procedure applied at the start of phase 1. In the horizontal-heterogeneity treatment (H-Hetero, hereafter), groups are formed randomly, so that individual heterogeneity is randomly distributed within and between groups. In the vertical-heterogeneity treatment (V-Hetero, hereafter), groups are exogenously created based on the dispositions of individuals to cooperate elicited in phase 0. The sorting mechanism consists of an initial segregation into different groups of high cooperators and low cooperators, which remain fixed during phases 1 and 2. Consequently, intergroup differences are expected to be more salient in V-Hetero than in H-Hetero. The effects of heterogeneity distribution (horizontal or vertical) on intergroup coordination are tested in phase 2, when intergroup competition is introduced, by comparing behaviour between random groups (H-Hetero) and sorted groups (V-Hetero). The experimental results reveal that vertical heterogeneity does not reduce the ability of groups to coordinate, although a high degree of coordination failure is observed in both treatments. Furthermore, in V-Hetero, competition significantly reduces intergroup differences while maintaining the overall performance at very high levels. Interestingly, two behavioural patterns are observed in relation to initially low cooperators with intergroup competition: (1) they do not respond to the contributions of their group partners in either heterogeneity treatment, and (2) those with strong vertical distributional preferences cooperate more under vertical heterogeneity. Intergroup coordination has been little studied in previous research. Some studies have suggested that groups may coordinate better than individuals to achieve efficient outcomes (Feri et al. 2010; Chaudhuri et al. 2015). In coordination between groups, the effects of some sources of intragroup heterogeneity, such as the matching protocol (Chaudhuri et al. 2015) or ethnic identities (Morton et al. 2020), have been examined. In general, these studies show that greater heterogeneity between groups can impair intergroup coordination. This research is also closely linked to the literature on cooperation and competition. On the one hand, experimental evidence on public goods games shows that: (1) repeated interactions between cooperators and would-be free riders within a group are important in explaining the decay in cooperation levels, and (2) many subjects behave as conditional cooperators (see the surveys of Ledyard 1995; Chaudhuri 2011). Sorting mechanisms have shown to be effective in promoting cooperation in the presence of conditional cooperators (Guido et al. 2019). In particular, separating cooperators from free riders to exogenously form homogenous groups can impede the decay in contribution levels (Gächter and Thöni 2005; Burlando and Guala 2005; Ones and Putterman 2007; de Oliveira et al. 2015). On the other hand, it is well documented in the literature on group contests that intergroup competition can be a powerful force for promoting cooperation within groups (Bornstein et al. 2002; Gunnthorsdottir and Rapoport 2006; Tan and Bolle 2007; Puurtinen and Mappes 2009). Sheremeta (2018) provides a comprehensive survey of experimental evidence in group contests. More closely related to this study, research on rank-order competition (with more than two groups) confirms the positive properties of intergroup competition when individuals are randomly assigned to groups (Reuben and Tyran 2010; Markussen et al. 2014; Cárdenas and Mantilla 2015). This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, this study advances our understanding of the effect of group diversity on intergroup coordination by investigating the effects of group formation, in particular by comparing random groups (H-Hetero) to groups sorted according to initial pro-social preferences (V-Hetero). The experimental results suggest that vertical heterogeneity (sorted groups) does not hinder group coordination, at least in the strategic context considered in this paper. Second, this study contributes to the literature on intergroup competition by analysing the effectiveness of an exogenous sorting mechanism in a competitive context. The experimental findings provide novel evidence on: (1) the overall positive effect of competition on cooperation with sorted groups; (2) the intragroup conditional behaviour of initially high cooperators and initially medium cooperators, regardless of the grouping procedure; and (3) the intragroup unconditional behaviour of initially low cooperators, independently of the grouping procedure. Therefore, this research extends the findings of the social dilemmas literature on conditional/unconditional behaviour to competitive contexts. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the literature. Section 3 presents the experimental design, procedures and research hypotheses. Section 4 reports the main results, which are discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.Footnote 2",

To help tackle this issue, I provide a theory of the formation of transaction costs and the consequent selection of property rights incorporating into economics the key Calabresi and Melamed’s (1972) insight that incomplete property rights can be efficient when transaction costs impede valuable exchange/innovation and, thus, deliver large ex post misallocations. Consistent with this view, despite all legal systems punish theft and embezzlement and provide remedies for dispossessed owners, parties are allowed, whenever the obstacles to transactions are sizable, to take private property without the original owners’ consent and by possibly paying a predetermined compensation (Bouckaert and De Geest 1995). This is the case of a good faith buyer acquiring from an intermediary a good either stolen or embezzled from its original owner, a nonpaying tenant successfully avoiding eviction,Footnote 1 a state expropriating a citizen for private for-profit use, an agent lawfully breaching a contract, majority shareholders successfully extracting from a firm creditors’ and minority shareholders’ resources, a principal lawfully segmenting a market and a downstream firm exploiting an upstream party’s intellectual property through fiduciary duties and shop right provisions. To analyze these and other cases of legalized direct and indirect—i.e., mediated by the state—private takings, I study the design of the property rights on either a good whose consensual transfer entails a transaction inefficiency or an upstream firm’s input whose random cost is nonverifiable and ex ante non-contractible. Following the “property rights"" literature (Allen 2000),Footnote 2 I define the strength of the original owner’s property rights as the odds with which he receives back a good expropriated by the potential buyer and the legal protection of the upstream firm as his ex post bargaining power.Footnote 3 Both definitions are consistent with Alchian’s (1965) view that economic property rights are those of “individuals to the use of resources."" Departing from the property rights literature, I define transaction costs as “any impediments or costs of negotiating"" (Calabresi and Melamed 1972), and I distinguish between trade barriers that are outside the control of transactors—e.g., financial frictions—and trade/innovation hurdles driven by either the market power, superior information or contractual advantage of some of them (see the Internet Appendix). I label the former as “exogenous"" transaction costs and the latter as “endogenous"" transaction costs. Starting with the interplay among property rights, transaction costs and exchange, I build on Guerriero (2016a), and I evaluate a society equally split into homogeneous original owners and potential buyers having different valuations for the single good in the economy. The two groups are randomly matched by an intermediation technology allowing the potential buyers to obtain the good via either a consensual transfer entailing a transaction inefficiency or by expropriating it at a cost that, without loss of generality, I assume negligible. When transaction costs are exogenous, consensual transfers require that the potential buyers pay to the original owners their valuation plus a socially wasteful fee. Then, full protection of the original owners’ property implies that an expropriated good is always returned and some potential buyers with valuations higher than that of the original owners are inefficiently excluded from trade due to the transaction fee. Weaker property rights, instead, alleviate this misallocation by probabilistically allowing middle-valuation potential buyers to consume, but, contemporaneously, push low-valuation potential buyers to inefficiently expropriate their match. This trade-off between inefficient exclusion from trade and expropriation implies that property rights are optimally weakened when transaction costs are sizable and more so the larger are the impediments to negotiation. Intuitively, a rise in transaction costs has both the marginal effect of pushing some high-valuation potential buyers to expropriate the good and the infra-marginal effect of decreasing the social gains from consensual transfers. Being both effects welfare-decreasing, larger negotiation costs must also weaken the protection of property and, in turn, shrink the market, i.e., decrease the measure of consensual transfers. Similar patterns prevail when transaction costs are endogenously determined by either the original owners’ market power or their privileged information. In the former case, the markup selected by the original owners is socially valuable as a transfer but entails an equal distortion in the potential buyers’ demand. Since a rise in the dispersion in the traders’ valuation increases the measure of matches on which a markup is commanded relative to the number of matches supporting expropriation, it also augments the markup itself and the demand distortion to the point of making incomplete property rights optimal. When it is the degree of asymmetry in information to inefficiently exclude middle-valuation potential buyers, a rise in the difference between their payoff and the original owners’ valuation endogenously worsens the lemons-type distortions and calls for a weaker protection of property. Turning to the interplay among property rights, transaction costs and innovation, I build on Grossman and Hart (1986) and Guerriero and Pignataro (2021), and I consider heterogeneous projects each involving an upstream and a downstream firm. The former can either produce in-house via an “old"" technology or adopt a “new""—more efficient—technology necessitating both parties’ investments. While both input costs and payoffs are nonverifiable and ex ante non-contractible, only the former are ex post contractible and only the upstream firms’ input cost is random and realized after he has committed his investment. The mix of contract incompleteness and the upstream firm’s uncertainty on his cost assures him an “appropriable quasi-rent"" (Barzel 1994), which rises with the likelihood of a low cost realization, equals the specificity of the downstream firms’ input and distorts the extent of innovation if too large. As a consequence, a strong protection of the upstream party’s input excessively increases the expected appropriable quasi-rent, discouraging high-productivity downstream firms from innovating. When, instead, property rights are weak, low-productivity downstream parties inefficiently select the new technology. This trade-off between inefficient exclusion from innovation and expropriation entails that larger odds of a low innovation cost and, thus, a more severe contract incompleteness must undermine the upstream firms’ property rights and reduce the extent of in-house production. Two obvious objections to the model reasoning are that some transactors have more political influence on institutional design and that weak property rights entail a disincentive effect. Crucially, the model testable predictions survive when I consider these possibilities, but two novel implications arise. First, property is protected too much in the most likely case in which those guiding institutional design are also initially holding economic value since these transactors prefer a too strong protection of their property. Second, property rights are optimally strengthened to incentivize original owners to either produce or invest. To assess whether the correlations in the available data are consistent with the most innovative model implications, I analyze a panel of 139 countries spanning the 2006–2018 period. For this sample, the Executive Opinion Survey—EOS, hereafter—reports measures for the protection of the original owners’ and downstream firms’ personal, intellectual, and financial property as well as proxies for the severity of financial frictions, market power, lemons-type distortions and the specificity of the downstream parties’ input, which, as aforementioned, picks the severity of contract incompleteness. By combining information collected from the EOS and the Doing Business Project, moreover, I obtain a measure of the availability for firms of technological innovations, which I employ as proxy for less disperse traders’ valuations and larger odds of a low innovation cost. While the second interpretation is straightforward, the first one is consonant with recent firm-level evidence suggesting that a limited technological availability, and not more severe transaction costs, induces less-developed countries to organize themselves around economies marked by a larger dispersion in the firms’ productivity and, in turn, in the consumers’ valuation for final goods (Porzio 2018). Conditional on country and year fixed effects, OLS estimates reveal two key results coherent with the model. First, the protection of the original owners’ and downstream parties’ property is weaker where financial frictions, market power and lemons-type distortions are more severe and where the downstream firms’ input is less specific. Second, the availability of technological progress is negatively related to financial inefficiencies, market power and lemons-type distortions and positively linked to the specificity of the downstream parties’ input. To gain more insights about causality without the presumption to prove it, I discuss in the Internet Appendix three extra results. First, my conclusions are similar when I either switch to an objective measure of property rights or consider different proxies for both exogenous and endogenous transaction costs. This pattern suggests that measurement error does not seem to be a major issue. Second, I also consider the other main determinants of property rights and transaction costs such as income, inclusiveness of political institutions, non-produced output, both external and internal conflicts and a culture of innovation. Including these observable factors together leaves the results almost intact as it does also considering the main determinants of either legal protection or transaction costs lead one year. The fact that these lead values are insignificant, moreover, excludes that the estimates are driven by reverse causation. Finally, I calculate that the influence of unobservables would need to be on average more than seven times stronger than the influence of all the observables that I consider to completely explain away the OLS estimates. Accordingly, it seems difficult to envision that unobserved heterogeneity is driving the empirical results. This study provides and tests a first theory of endogenous market design clarifying how fundamental factors, such as the dispersion in the traders’ valuation and the odds of a lower innovation cost, shape the severity of the impediments to negotiation and, in turn, the protection of property. The strength of property rights determines, in turn, the limits between market and non-market activities. Hence, my paper is related to four strands of the literature on transaction costs and property rights. First, it is linked to several contributions showing that weak property rights can be optimal in an endowment economy (Kaplow and Shavell 1996; Jordan 2006; Bar-Gill and Persico 2016; Segal and Whinston 2016; Arruñada et al. 2019). As Guerriero (2016a), not only do I extend this result to production economies, but I also clarify how weak property rights can partially neutralize market frictions and failures [see also Boldrin and Levine (2013)]. Different from the present paper however, Guerriero (2016a) focuses on the link between the diversity in the potential buyers’ valuation and the legal protection of original owners, without characterizing theoretically the determinants and impact of contract incompleteness and empirically the determinants of transaction costs and their impact on property rights. Second, my study is also related to that of Guerriero and Pignataro (2021), who analyze the interplay among the intensity and specificity of the firms’ inputs, their property rights, and the ownership structure. Because of their focus on ex ante incentives, these Authors conclude that the strength of the upstream firms’ property rights not only falls with the specificity of the downstream parties’ input but also rises with the specificity of their own investment. Third, my analysis of negotiating costs is part of a body of research—still in its infancy—on endogenous transaction costs (Williamson 2010; Barry et al. 2014). None of these papers, however, has emphasized the roles of the dispersion in the traders’ valuation and/or the odds of innovation. Finally, Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) compare property rights protection with contract enforcement. Different from these Authors, I examine the determinants of the trade-off between these two institutional strategies created by the possibility of non-consensual transfers, and I emphasize that weak property rights are society’s response to sizable transaction costs (see also Aghion et al. (2010)). The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, I show that the basic correlations in the available data are consistent with the main model implications. Next, I illustrate the main model in Sect. 3, and I evaluate its robustness to alternative assumptions in Sect. 4. Finally, I conclude in Sect. 5, and I gather proofs, tables, and figures in the Appendix.",

This seems straightforwardly obvious and yet it is not. To paraphrase the title of a book by Corbett and Fikkert (2009), “helping hurts”. Despite a short-term relief, the recipients of aid or charity, gifts or transfers lose self-reliance, work and save less and adopt riskier behaviors. As a consequence, their wellbeing decreases, rather than increases; their situation deteriorates rather than improves and they end up increasingly relying on external help. In addition, lured by the short-term positive effects of aid, other persons in need ask for help too. The negative consequences of aid and charity spread. Indeed, help gives birth to “tragic commons” (Schmidtz 2000, 686), creates “charity hazard” (see Raschky and Weck-Hannemann 2007; Browne and Hoyt 2000), or, as Buchanan put it (1975a), traps both the helper—the “Samaritan”—and the recipient in a “Samaritan’s Dilemma”. A rather problematic situation, the Samaritan’s Dilemma is also striking by its “pervasiveness” (Pasour 1991). It was identified in a large variety of situations: private settings—families, for instance (see Futagami et al. 2004)—as well as public environments—redistribution and poor relief (Wagner 2005; Skarbek 2016), medical care and national health insurance, social programs (Bovard 1983; Boettke and Martin 2010), international aid, in particular in case of natural disaster such as hurricanes or earthquakes (Boone 1996; Gibson et al. 2005; Coyne 2008; Williamson 2010; Stone 2008; Rajan and Subramanian 2005; Burnside and Dollar 2000, among others). Therefore, preventing the Dilemma from occurring and finding ways to help Samaritans and recipients to get out of it seems particularly important. Studying ways out of the Dilemma has thus unsurprisingly been the subject of a large number of works.Footnote 1 It was also one of Buchanan’s objectives, if not his major purpose when he wrote “The Samaritan’s Dilemma”. The solutions Buchanan suggested were clearly a consequence of the conviction that guided him in his project. Indeed, the point is often neglected and even misunderstood in the literature, Buchanan’s concern went beyond stressing the existence of a Dilemma that would specifically affect welfare programs, redistribution and charity He was talking of the society as a whole. He was, as he clearly puts it, attempting to develop a hypothesis that is generalizable to much of the behavior that we observe in the modern world […] The hypotesis does apply to certain aspects of the current policy discussion of welfare reform, but this is only one among many applications, and by no means the most important one. (1975a: 74; italics added). Among these applications, one for example finds the case of a mother who “may find it too painful to spank a misbehaving child” (76) or that of the airplane captain facing hijacking (80). They evidence the problem he had identified was not (or, at least, not primarily) that helping decreases the individuals’ incentive to work, or invest and therefore generate wealth or (taxable) income. Dealing with it was consequently a matter of individual behavior, and how to control or orient individual behavior. To achieve that objective, Buchanan first claimed that Samaritan’s Dilemmas would be avoided if Samaritans were following an “ethics of responsibility” that would prescribe them not to help free-riders or “parasites”, as he evocatively called them in 1975. The purpose is to limit individual flexibility of action and instruct those in Samaritan-like positions to act in the interest of the entire society, thereby “inhibiting personal behavior that was aimed solely at gratification of instant desires, whether these be charitable or selfish.” (1975a, 83). Then, alternatively, if following such ethical rules was not an option, escaping the Dilemma was possible if Samaritans could display what Buchanan calls “strategic courage” and decide not to indulge their charitable impulses (albeit genuine they are) to avoid inflicting long-run costs upon both recipients and any third parties that may be affected by their choice. “Strategic”, because in order to stick to this course of action, Samaritans must be able to properly compute the long-term effects of their charity acts. “Courage”, because not helping forces Samaritans to observe recipients remain in their state of distress. Thus, either way, if Samaritans were able to adhere to an ethics of responsibility or behave courageously, the Dilemma would not occur and the entire society would end up in a long-run better situation. This is probably one of the main messages Buchanan conveyed in his essay, one of the strongest points of his work, that is very rarely noted—among the exceptions are Schmidtchen (1999), Skarbek (2016) and Goodman and Herzberg (2020). Yet, the other and complementary important message Buchanan conveyed in his paper was that, in the USA of the early 1970s, Samaritan’s Dilemmas could be avoided only if constitutional rules were devised to frame the social game and limit the behaviors individuals could adopt. Why the need for a third solution? Because, in Buchanan’s view, Samaritans were not—no longer—capable of behaving responsibly nor courageously. Incapable of understanding the importance, the necessity indeed, to behave strategically, Samaritans behave pragmatically—helping becomes the Samaritan’s “pragmatic or independent-behavior response to the choice situation that he confronts, whether or not [she] recognizes that [the recipient] exists as a choice-making entity who opposes him in a game-like situation” (1975a: 72). This could be explained by the fact that “[w]hat we may call ‘strategic courage’ may be a markedly inferior economic good, and what we may call ‘pragmatic compassion’ may be markedly superior”.Footnote 2 Indeed, Buchanan insisted: “modern man has ‘gone soft’” (75) and “become incapable of making the choices that are required to prevent his exploitation by predators of his own species” (74). Thus, quite understandably, since he believed that the widespread diffusion of charitable and helping behaviors across all fields of human interactions combined to the Samaritans soft-heart and lack of strategic courage had led to those pervasive and persistent situations, Buchanan was mainly concerned with finding solutions to the Samaritan’s Dilemma. Consequently, he did not actually study the origins of the Dilemma but simply postulated its existence. He indeed started with two game matrixes to characterize the two forms—the active and the passive—of the Dilemma and assumed without explaining that the payoffs of the Samaritan and the beneficiary were ranked in a certain order that would generate the Dilemma. Buchanan no more detailed the behavioral assumptions behind such an undesirable situation. He did not explain why and how being charitable could lead a Samaritan to be trapped in such a Dilemma. Thus, to put it in other words, Buchanan explained that Samaritans have become too kind, too charitable, too helpful to be able to get out of the Dilemma, but he did not wonder if being too charitable could be the cause of the Dilemma in the first place. This is what we do in this paper. We explore some plausible micro-foundations to motivate the payoff ordering chosen by Buchanan. The purpose is to inquire deeper into reasonable causes behind the Dilemma and to discuss classical and novel solutions to escape the latter. We proceed in two steps. First, we start by assuming that Samaritans have altruistic concerns towards recipients. We do not introduce the assumption because it was in Buchanan’s original essay—it was not—but because Buchanan’s essay is almost systematically interpreted in terms of altruism. Then, from this perspective, the first question to ask is obviously whether an altruistic Samaritan would face a Dilemma, as originally postulated by Buchanan back in 1975. Put differently, one has to ask if it is appropriate to understand the Dilemma as a problem of altruism. To answer the question, we go back to Buchanan’s original matrixes and formally introduce altruism in the model— as we do in Sect. 2. We then first show that altruism alone is not compatible with a Samaritan’s Dilemma. In other words, once we explicitly assume that helpers assist out of altruism, the Samaritan’s Dilemma does not even exist, contrarily to what is usually put forward in the research that understands the Dilemma as a problem of excessive altruism. The reason is straightforward: by internalizing the recipient’s preference to save the cost of effort, an altruistic Samaritan is perfectly fine with a situation where s/he helps and the recipient free-rides on her assistance. As in Buchanan’s original game, this outcome still corresponds to a Nash-equilibrium, but now, is Pareto-efficient, since both the Samaritan and the recipient find themselves in the situation which provide them the highest possible payoff. Hence, the helper is no longer stuck in a dilemma. It then appears that, once we assume that Samaritans are altruistic, an additional parameter has to be included in the analysis to make sure that the payoff ordering still generates a Samaritan’s Dilemma. In particular, this parameter must capture the context-specific disutility Samaritans experience when they help a recipient who does little to improve her situation, thus balancing the benefits of altruism. As it will appear below, this counterweighting effect can be either understood in terms of ethics of responsibility or strategic courage. Then, in Sect. 3, we expand on this work and develop an evolutionary game that, under given parametrizations, results in a Samaritan’s Dilemma. Using this type of model is consistent with Buchanan’s original paper for at least two reasons. First, it allows us to capture, thought in a stylized way, the cultural dynamics we think Buchanan had in mind when he talked about the diffusion of excessively charitable behaviors in the society at large. Under given parametrizations, in fact, our model characterizes a scenario where Samaritanism and opportunism coevolve as an integrated system of cultural habits. Second, in evolutionary models, individuals are not depicted as strategic utility-maximizers, but rather, as rule-abiders whose behavioral responses are largely situational. Their agency, in other words, is “pragmatical”, which is perfectly consistent with Buchanan’s idea that charitable behaviors responds to cultural conventions rather than some form of strategic thinking. Through this model, we then show that a Dilemma occurs, under certain conditions (values of the different parameters introduced in our model), and that the situation is evolutionary stable. We also show, however, that the dilemma is not the only possible outcome of an interaction between a Samaritan and a recipient. We thus enrich and complement Buchanan’s model. In particular, in terms of solutions and ways to escape the dilemma. This is what we explain in the fourth section of the paper, in which we discuss the different results put forward. This analysis offers three types of payoffs. First, by giving microeconomic and behavioral foundations to the matrixes Buchanan used in his essay, we contribute to improve our understanding of Buchanan’s work and, at the same time, of the conditions in which a Samaritan’s Dilemma may exist. We show that Buchanan’s pessimistic results were not the consequence of an arbitrarily chosen matrix. They apply in settings where more detailed behavioral assumptions are made. At the same time, our analysis also suggests that Buchanan’s conclusions cannot be taken for granted when richer constellations of parameters’ value (and related behavioral motives) are considered. Second, by analyzing the existence conditions of Buchanan’s original Dilemma, we are able to draw conclusions on possible solutions to escape the later. Not only we reiterate the importance of the Samaritan's strategic courage and ethics of responsibility, in line with Buchanan, but we also emphasize an alternative solution that, to the best of our knowledge, receive no previous attention in the literature. What we highlight is that a key but implicit assumption behind Buchanan’s work is that recipients have a taste for exerting no effort and that these preferences cannot be engineered. However, when we relax this assumption and contemplate the possibility that recipients can be induced to abandon their “parasitic preferences”—for instance, by developing some form of ethics that prescribes to put forward their own effort—we show that Samaritans are no longer forced to use their strategic courage and can behave charitably without fearing the implications of their good heart. This message, we believe, complements Buchanan’s on the importance of the Samaritans’ strategic courage and ethical behavior, suggesting that there may exist situations where a first-best scenario with hard-working recipients and helping Samaritans is achievable. When this is not the case, Buchanan’s pessimistic conclusions are the only possible one. Third, our paper also contributes to the literature on the impact of unilateral altruism. By contrast to what Gary Becker argued in his Rotten Kid theorem (1974), or Axelrod (1980, 1984) with the Tit-for-Tat strategy, we show that unilateral altruism does not always lead egoist to cooperate. Quite the contrary, and well in line with Buchanan’s message on the importance of strategic courage, our analysis suggests that the only way in which an altruistic Samaritan can induce an egoist recipient to “cooperate” (that is, to put forward her effort) is by not providing help in the first place, that is, s/he must avoid doing what her altruistic impulse—or “pragmatic compassion”, as Buchanan (1975a: 75) calls it—would dictate her to do. In our model, Buchanan’s result is closer to the criticisms of Becker’s model that one finds in the works of Ted Bergstrom (1989), Hirshleifer (1977) or Gordon Tullock (1977).",1

Global Organized Crime Index 2021 defines organized crime as “illegal activities, conducted by groups or networks acting in concert, by engaging in violence, corruption or related activities to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or material benefit” (page 23).Footnote 1 Agents in question are criminal organizations, such as mafias, drug cartels, gangs, mobs, and syndicates, terrorist groups that engage in a variety of harmful activities, (e.g., selling and trafficking illegal drugs, migrant smuggling, human trafficking, firearms trafficking, illegal gambling, and extortion using violence). Authorities, such as police organizations and governments, attempt to eradicate these detrimental activities by employing law enforcement strategies. Considering that an increasing number of criminal organizations extend their activities globally, each local law enforcement authority has to address transnational organized crimes by cooperating. Therefore, we must be attentive to two elements. The first is an interaction/strategic relation among organized crime groups. Given that, two classes of relations can be distinguished. The first type is the rivalry and competitive relations among organized crime groups. For instance, consider two organized crime groups that independently fight for territory or provide illegal goods and services to increase their own illegal profit and decrease other organized crime groups’ profits. We label this class “substitution.” For example, we can expect rivalry among mafia-type criminal organizations in Italy, such as between Cosa Nostra and ‘Ndrangheta and Camorra (Paoli 2014). Additionally, Mexican drug cartels have conflicts with each other regarding the control of drug production and trafficking routes. The second type is the collaborative and cooperative relations among organized crime groups, where one group’s activity may increase not only its own profits but also other groups’ profits. This can be labeled a “complementary” relation, which tends to hold if each organized crime group is a subgroup of a common mafia family and each clan’s action can enhance the reputation of the mafia family and acquire more illegal profits. For example, the above Italian mafia-type criminal organizations, such as Cosa Nostra and ’Ndrangheta and Camorra, are confederations of subgroups and clans; thus, cooperation among subgroups that belong to the same mafia family is likely to occur. Therefore, each clan has the incentive to help other clans in the same mafia family. Additionally, cooperative relations among criminal organizations can be found in the collaboration between local gangs and established organized crime groups (e.g., Sicilian Mafia members and Nigerian gangs (Gaffy 2017), Mexican drug cartels and American street gangs (Schmidt 2012), Japanese Mafia (“Yakuza”), and other emerging loosely organized crime groups (Schreiber 2012)). Therefore, their “complementary” and “substitution” relations can vary based on activities and situations. Furthermore, one organized crime group can acquire skills, knowledge, and information from another to have effective criminal activities, which is well observed in criminal networks. This interaction between organized crime groups is not the only type of strategic relation. As the second element, we consider an interaction among law enforcement authorities. Organized crime groups in Italy, such as Cosa Nostra and ‘Ndrangheta and Cammora, engage in illegal business in their home region and outside. This interregional nature is commonly observed in many organized crime groups. Moreover, different clans in one mafia can be targeted by different local law enforcement authorities, thus, creating a coordination problem for local governments. This is almost inevitable because the local government does not have considerable discretion beyond its territories. For example ‘Ndrangheta exercises worldwide influence despite its origination in Calabria in Italy. Therefore, to eradicate their activities, approaches are currently being employed by international law enforcement.Footnote 2 By incorporating the aforementioned two elements, we provide a formal framework to consider interactions among the local organized crime groups and local law enforcement authorities. Specifically, we introduce two local organized crime groups (clans or different mafias) and two local law enforcers (governments). Each local organized crime group engages in harmful activities, such as providing illegal goods and services and using violence to make illegal profits; each local group’s activities cause a negative externality in its local region. In response, each local government employs its law enforcement strategies against only the local organized crime group to reduce the negative external effects. Furthermore, we consider that each local organized crime group’s actions affect the other organized crime group’s profit. The groups’ activities are complementary if each organized crime group’s activity provides a positive externality for the other group. However, their activities are substitutes if each group’s activity provides a negative externality for other groups. Thus, both cases are possible depending on the context. This study demonstrates that each local government’s behavior causes inefficient law enforcement policies. Notably, sanctions can be either overly stringent or lax. Under organized crime groups’ complementarity, the equilibrium sanction level without coordination is lower than the first-best sanction level with coordination. In this case, one organized crime group with a complementarity relation has an incentive to reduce illegal activities as another organized crime group decreases its activities. Therefore, one local government’s law enforcement decreases its local organized crime group’s activities and another local organized crime group’s activities, which indicates the positive externality effects of law enforcement. Thus, each local government considering only its region’s welfare has the incentive to free-ride to save law enforcement costs and invest fewer resources. This indicates that under-enforcement is likely to occur compared to first-best results. Considering that our results can be applied to transnational organized crimes, such as transnational counterterrorism, it is worth mentioning the benefits of the existence of Interpol, which coordinates the member countries’ police efforts against common transnational terrorism activities. Notably, Sandler et al. (2011) argue that Interpol resolves the free-rider problems in law enforcement using cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of spending on Interpol counterterrorism measures and demonstrate that transnational terrorist attacks may not induce a larger defense spending response in the presence of coordinated counterterrorism through law enforcement, intelligence, homeland security spending, or the counterterrorism actions of Interpol. Organized crimes are not always complementary. Under substitution conditions, the equilibrium sanction level without coordination is higher than the first-best sanction level with coordination. Thus, one organized crime group with substitution relations has an incentive to increase illegal activities as another group decreases its activities. One local government’s law enforcement decreases its local organized crime group’s activities but increases another local group’s activities, which indicates the negative externality effects of law enforcement. Therefore, each local government considering only its region’s welfare has an incentive to invest more resources because of negative spill-over effects in the sense that one local government’s enforcement strategies provide detrimental effects to another local region’s welfare compared to first-best results. There are several pieces of supporting evidence. Regarding the severe conflict among drug cartels in Mexico, Dell (2015) shows that the violence reflects rival traffickers’ attempts to usurp territories after crackdowns have weakened incumbent criminal organizations. Moreover, (Durante and Gutiérrez 2013) use close Mexican elections to argue that coordination across municipalities can reduce drug violence in Mexico. Rios (2015) also indicates that when the same party governs a municipality at every level of government, drug traffickers in Mexico are less likely to cause violent conflict in the presence of an informal connection between the government and drug cartels. In addition to our main result, which uses the assumption that local governments move simultaneously, we extend this basic setting to consider the sequential choice of enforcement levels between local law enforcers. This extension indicates that the first mover local government has an incentive to establish harsh enforcement to reduce social harm in the region. This result indicates that local governments that battle organized crime groups’ activities have an incentive to set severe law enforcement policies to extract more effective enforcement strategies for other regions. Moreover, we briefly consider two additional extensions. One is the case where there is a high-level decision-maker of criminal organizations. The other is the case where the interregional government partly intervenes decisions of local governments. Our analysis is closely related to two lines of research in law and economics in the literature. First, this study contributes to the economic analysis of criminal organizations.Footnote 3 Notably, because (Becker 1968) established an economic analysis of illegal activities by individuals, most previous studies on the economic analysis of criminal organizations have focused on the monopolistic aspects of criminal organizations; see (Schelling 1967; Buchanan 1973; Garoupa 2000, 2007), and Yahagi (2018). However, this study is not the first to consider interactions among oligopolistic criminal organizations. For instance, Mansour et al. (2006) and Poret and Téjédo (2006) discuss how criminal organizations, as producers of illegal goods, endogenize their market structures, and the government’s optimal strategy and welfare implications remain uncertain. Moreover, Yahagi (2019) considers how cooperation among criminal organizations emerges, whereas Flores (2016) considers competition between criminal organizations as a Cournot duopoly game where they produce an illegal good and sabotage each other to gain a larger share of the market using violence. As a novel contribution, we extend these studies’ approaches to consider how the regional problems for combatting local criminal organizations caused by the difficulties of local law enforcers coordinating their punishment strategies can be detrimental based on local criminal organizations’ relations. Given this study’s nature, our arguments share motivation with discussion on counter-terrorism, which has been offered by Arce and Sandler (2005) and Sandler and Siqueira (2006). Particularly, our analysis can be considered as an extension of Sandler and Siqueira’s (2006) discussions on counter-terrorism measures to explore how special relations among local criminal organizations affect local governments’ crackdown strategies and social welfare. Second, this study contributes to the literature on the problem of interregional law enforcement. Marceau (1997) models the interrelationship of competing jurisdictions and shows that severe law enforcement in one locality shifts some crime to neighboring communities, which results in excessive enforcement in equilibrium because of the diversion externality. Friehe and Miceli (2016) and Friehe et al. (2018) consider law enforcement in a federal system to address the presence of interregional externalities caused by offenders’ location choices and strategic relations among local law enforcement. By extending Marceau (1997), they consider that although detection efforts by local law enforcers cannot be coordinated, the degree of sanctions can be coordinated at the federal level. Considering that these papers do not consider complementarity or substitution among criminal organizations, we provide different implications for law enforcement policies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our basic model. Section 3 provides our results. Section 4 extends our results. Section 5 concludes this paper.",
